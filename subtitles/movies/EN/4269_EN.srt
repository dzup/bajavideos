FARSA PRODUCTIONS presents

2
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,689
Sir, We have a problem.

3
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:34,361
Be specific.

4
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:37,436
Do you remember project 395/027?

5
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,399
Are you talking about Mission Kaihoro?

6
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:40,673
No, sir.

7
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,840
This is worse, much worse.

8
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,135
I'll show you.

9
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:51,079
It's about the alien virus.

10
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:52,675
According to the contract...

11
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:54,845
The aliens were allowed
to test their virus...

12
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:56,581
...in a restricted area.

13
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:59,123
In exchange we would be
receiving protection. I know.

14
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:02,058
But... What's the real problem, agent?

15
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:03,287
They did the test, sir.

16
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,531
They were supposed to
use a radios of 1 km.

17
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:14,467
But the virus has spread.

18
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:16,033
Day 1, 0:.00 am

19
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:17,303
Day 1, 4:.42 am

20
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,574
Day 1, 8:.1 5 am

21
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:19,877
Day 1, 8:.36 am

22
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:21,775
The whole town is infected.

23
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:22,809
Day 1, 1 :1 0 pm

24
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:25,510
God Damn it, agent!
Something must be done!

25
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:29,587
That's not all, sir. We
caught some of the survivors.

26
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:35,751
A young man in a coma
called Max Giggs...

27
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,360
...another young man
called Bill Johnson,

28
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,363
John West...

29
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:54,178
...Tony Peck... -That's enough!

30
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:55,980
Let me explain something
that you should know by now.

31
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,713
Only our President...

32
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:03,218
...has the authority to order
the execution of that many people,

33
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,185
But the President...

34
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,454
...has more important
business to take care of.

35
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,753
So you give me no option.

36
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,726
Release the prisoners inside the town.

37
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,734
-But, sir...
-That's an order, agent.

38
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:19,395
-But, sir...
-That's an order.

39
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:21,369
-Sir, they are dangerous!
-That's an order!

40
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:23,936
Sir, they must be
exterminated right now!

41
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:24,839
That's an order!!!!

42
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:28,846
Zombie Plague: Mutant Zone

43
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:09,812
Close the border, cut all
lines of communication...

44
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,178
...That town never existed.

45
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,135
Now what?

46
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:49,679
Hey, excuse me.

47
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:53,149
I'm gonna kill you!

48
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:22,073
Bill?

49
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:24,014
What's going on with you?

50
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,420
It's me John... your pal!

51
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:36,522
I saw you die.

52
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:57,065
Max!

53
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:00,500
Max!

54
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,504
Max are you okay! Max, talk to me!

55
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,168
My computer!
- God damn it!

56
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,211
My computer! My computer!
- How do you feel?!

57
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:09,379
Max.
- My computer!

58
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:12,041
I wanna go home.

59
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:16,184
Where am l?

60
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,016
Where am l?

61
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:21,958
Where am l?

62
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,861
Take me home.
- Bill.

63
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:30,200
John, Bill, Here I am!

64
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,498
Oh! Damn!

65
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:00,157
Gentlemen...

66
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,528
On the count of three...

67
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,365
Let's get out of here.

68
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:09,165
One...

69
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:12,568
Two...

70
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:15,271
John, help me!

71
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:18,978
Bill, what the hell are you thinking?

72
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,609
He might still be alive. Come on!

73
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:29,225
Max, Come on!

74
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:33,658
Take it easy, if we stand
still, they won't see us.

75
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,336
Zombies, I hate them!

76
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:32,375
Bill!

77
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,538
John! Max! Let's get out of here!

78
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:06,840
That way!

79
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,880
Damn! This is worse than I feared.

80
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:15,746
Yeah.

81
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,394
Well, now what?

82
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:26,989
Let's find some weapons.

83
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:21,783
John, we have two options.

84
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,344
Wait a second, Bill!

85
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:25,147
It's been thirty hours
since I last slept.

86
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,291
Can I at least go to the bathroom?

87
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:19,895
Max, help me! They're getting
in! They're getting in!

88
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:25,002
Max, help me!

89
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:30,834
Be careful! Let him go! Let him go!

90
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,535
The bag, Max! The bag!

91
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,437
Don't worry! Don't
worry! I'll stay here!

92
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:49,654
Jooooooohn!

93
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:16,253
Jesus! Max, what's going on here?

94
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:17,683
Bill told me to keep an eye on the bag.

95
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:20,421
Yes, but didn't you notice
that he was in trouble?

96
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,151
But Bill told me to
keep an eye on the bag.

97
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:25,124
You have an attitude problem, Max.

98
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:28,362
We'd better go and look for Bill.

99
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,627
Yes... if he's still alive.

100
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,954
What's matter with you?
Are you crazy or what?

101
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,824
You are sick, right? You're
sick. That's what's going on,

102
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:10,900
God damn it.

103
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:15,003
John, come and see this!

104
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:31,622
Oh my God! This is terrible!

105
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:35,517
Bill could end up in one of
those mountains of flesh....

106
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,286
...just for looking
after this goddamn bag.

107
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:43,557
The only thing I know is that
we must leave this town...

108
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:45,191
Right now.

109
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:38,339
Scott Lee Ray.

110
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,021
Easy! Easy, buddy!
- Help, me!

111
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:57,292
They left me, those fuckers
left the town without me.

112
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,736
what are you talking about?

113
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:03,340
A zombie bit me and they thought l
would infect them...

114
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,810
But these zombies are very
different from the others....

115
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:08,279
I'm getting out of here.

116
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:11,811
Don't do it, pal! The street is...

117
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,544
Unknown to us, I know.

118
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:15,949
Everything is infected.
Where are you planning to go?

119
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:18,287
Out of this town.

120
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:28,695
John, look at that zombie.

121
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:31,628
It's disgusting!

122
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:32,928
Horrendous!

123
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:34,369
You can handle it, right?

124
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:35,401
Sure.

125
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,336
Zombie... zombie...come here....

126
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:43,575
Max, no, no, Max, no, Max, nooooooo!

127
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:11,399
Come on.

128
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:19,078
Don't you get it, pal? This
is the end of the human race...

129
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:21,712
We're all gonna die...

130
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,161
When they come back, we'll die.

131
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:41,595
They're inside, getting ready for war...

132
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:45,268
And when they attack it'll be the end.

133
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:48,210
What are you talking
about? I'm out of here.

134
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,677
But I have a map...

135
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,185
City limits.

136
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:01,257
... a map showing the only
way out of this damn town!

137
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:24,247
But if you want it...

138
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,076
You'll have to work for me.

139
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:27,708
Get lost.

140
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:29,547
But this is the only way out!

141
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:31,177
Listen to me...

142
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:33,653
What?!

143
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:57,782
Damn! Now what?

144
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:58,714
Calm down, Max.

145
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,944
Calm down? Did you see what I saw?

146
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:06,680
Take it easy. Know what? We'll go
to the other side of town...

147
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:08,850
....and we'll look for a way out.

148
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:12,261
This reminds me of the
Variety Fair of 93'...

149
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:15,594
You were there? I was there
too! I was doing a show.

150
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:18,057
That was you?

151
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,541
I don't understand your language!

152
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:33,034
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

153
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:35,698
Slowly..., slowly...

154
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:38,675
Slowly..., slowly...

155
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:55,351
Lollypop!

156
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:00,481
Max!

157
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:12,896
John!

158
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:34,554
Bill, we went to the city
limits..., It's terrible!

159
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:36,527
We got there and...

160
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:38,427
...suddenly there was
this... deep...Very deep...

161
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:40,520
I didn't know what to do...

162
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:43,927
It was far... impossible to cross and...

163
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:46,500
Terrible! Terrible! This is terrible!

164
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:04,849
Oh, Damn!

165
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:06,284
Look at this mess!

166
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:08,959
Wait here...the computer is upstairs..

167
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:25,769
Bill, come and see this.

168
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:39,378
It's not here. It's not here!!

169
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,367
O.K. ready.

170
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,945
Contents of drive A.

171
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:11,378
Reading...

172
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:20,154
MAP. FBl

173
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:28,871
Calculating decoding time.

174
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:44,116
I think this is going to take a while...

175
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:46,181
Too much.

176
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:48,615
That's not a problem, I can wait.

177
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:52,461
That's true... This
seems like a safe place.

178
00:33:54,665 --> 00:34:00,035
Perfect! We'll have a guard
like when I was a boy scout!

179
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,407
Scotty!

180
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:23,055
Scotty!

181
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:26,290
Scott...

182
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:27,988
Buddy!

183
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,965
Scotty! Scott Lee Ray. Are you there?

184
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:35,070
Lieutenant, it's a lost
cause. He's probably dead...

185
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,539
...or became one of them...

186
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,443
Yes, yes, I'm listening.

187
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:44,740
Mother of God, Scott! W e're sorry,
we arrived at the base and we...

188
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:48,042
...noticed you weren't
with us. Are you O.K.?

189
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:49,619
Yes, I'm fine.

190
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,620
Alright, pal, tell us
your exact position.

191
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:54,017
We are at the house of Max Giggs'.

192
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:55,916
Roger that, Scott, stay there.

193
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:58,257
A helicopter will pick
you up in a few minutes.

194
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:01,757
Excellent, we'll wait.
Roger, over and out.

195
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:03,364
Damn it, John! What are you doing?

196
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:06,436
What am I doing? I've just saved
your life! You should thank me!

197
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,937
Damned fool! The FBl is
using us as guinea pigs...

198
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,599
They blew your head off!

199
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,041
Do you think they're
going to rescue you?

200
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:16,110
That's true.

201
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:22,710
We must leave this
place as son as possible.

202
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:36,699
Do you think this is gonna work?

203
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:42,201
DO NOT TOUCH! EXPLOSlVE!!!

204
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:25,448
Max.

205
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:01,142
They want to negotiate.

206
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:06,779
Max.

207
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:08,054
they want to negotiate.

208
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,223
Max, listen to yourself,
you are talking crazy.

209
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:12,420
They want to negotiate.
Don't you get it? Negotiate!

210
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:13,959
Max...

211
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:17,632
Enough.

212
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:23,838
Let's get out of here!

213
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:22,951
Move it!

214
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:52,446
Bill!

215
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,154
O.K. this is the plan:

216
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:04,095
we'll look for a car,
Max, you drive, and then...

217
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:04,997
Why?

218
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:07,671
Max, you drive.

219
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:09,002
But why?

220
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:11,742
Max, I can't drive.

221
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:16,207
Stop it!

222
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:44,332
Bill, are you O.K.?

223
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,101
I was just wondering......

224
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:49,502
Why?

225
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:55,668
Max, turn down the next street.
We're close to my house...

226
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:57,602
Once we get there, we can
wait without being in danger...

227
00:42:57,975 --> 00:42:58,669
At least...

228
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:00,676
...until the map decoding is ready.

229
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,145
Come on in Max... Make yourself at
home.

230
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:19,326
Oh, no! My trophies!

231
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:54,560
They were here too.

232
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:53,748
John West loses everything.

233
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:54,619
Do you like it?

234
00:44:57,394 --> 00:44:58,656
Unbelievable, right?

235
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:00,825
Go on Take a look.

236
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:08,999
Know what, Max?

237
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,640
I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

238
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,686
My name is John West.

239
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:13,053
My arms are made out of
steel and my legs of titanium.

240
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:15,831
I was born to win... and
that's what I'm gonna do!

241
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:21,001
He comes from the west,
riding on his horse.

242
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:25,532
Friend of the kids, he's John West.

243
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:30,039
He's fair with the good guys,
and severe with the bad guys,

244
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:33,750
...stronger than a rock, he's John West.

245
00:47:34,718 --> 00:47:38,586
My arms are made out of
steel and my legs of titanium.

246
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:42,992
He fights for good, he's John West.

247
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:47,454
Saving stagecoaches, girls in trouble...

248
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:51,325
strong as a rock, he's John West.

249
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:56,266
John West, John West. He is the best.

A hero, a cowboy, he's John West...

253
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:31,236
John West, John West. He is the best.

254
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:35,571
John West, John West. He's the champ!

255
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:39,773

John West, John West. He's the champ!

00:48:53,196 --> 00:48:57,292

A hero, a cowboy, he's John West...

261
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:23,553

00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:32,261

00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:35,905
A hero, a cowboy, he's John West...

265
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:40,334
A hero, a cowboy, he's John West...

266
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:43,909
A hero, a cowboy, he's John West...

267
00:50:09,706 --> 00:50:11,003
John West!

268
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:25,777
John, John!

269
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:32,385
Max! I would like to
introduce you to somebody...

270
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:36,289
Remember the bag? There
was someone inside!

271
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:38,633
Tell him, boy... tell him your name.

272
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:46,834
Max!

273
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:57,081
Look, John, I have...
You gotta remember this...

274
00:50:57,187 --> 00:51:00,179
You gave it to me at the
Variety Fair back in 93'...

275
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:04,087
Where is it? Where did l
put it? You gotta remember...

276
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:07,822
You gave it to me at the
Variety Fair back in 93'...

277
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:14,737
Here it is! This is you...

278
00:51:15,038 --> 00:51:16,767
And I have your autograph as well!

279
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:19,137
Boy... I think you need a
new one! Follow me upstairs,

280
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:21,369
I have something you're gonna like.

281
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:08,146
You're a lucky guy...

282
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:09,885
There aren't many of
those things in the world.

283
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:17,188
There's no food.

284
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:19,899
I'll order some pizzas.

285
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:25,808
Do you want some pepperoni
pizza, hot dogs or some steaks?

286
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,274
Steaks! Steaks!

287
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:33,213
Well... I think we'd
better go get some burgers.

288
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:46,122
Bill...You come with me...

289
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,627
Max...You stay and
take good care of Max.

290
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:54,664
He's a good guy...
They'll get along fine.

291
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:47,752
What does it feel
like to be one of them?

292
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:59,124
I saw you die, and now you
are walking by my side...

293
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:02,665
It seems to me you're
one of the living dead.

294
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,608
Bill...Are you still
going on about that?

295
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:09,705
OK. I'll tell you all
about it. Remember when...

296
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:47,911
Look Max! It's... it's
John! Do you like it?

297
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:52,251
Turn it around.

298
00:54:56,526 --> 00:54:57,857
We're all there.

299
00:54:58,361 --> 00:55:03,526
That's me...that's John...
And that... that's Bill...

300
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:10,267
And this... this... this is you!

301
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:21,984
It's you Max! It's you! It's you
Max! it's you! It's you! It's you!....

302
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:23,210
This is you!

303
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:07,748
Look, Max!

304
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:13,994
My name is... my arms... John
West, John West, He's the best,

305
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:18,431
John West, John West, He's the champ,

306
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:22,665
John West, John West, he's the best...

307
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:26,537
...a hero, a cowboy, he's John West,

308
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:31,373
John West, John West, He's the best...

309
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:35,575
John West, John West, He's the champ,

310
00:57:35,819 --> 00:57:40,017
John West, John West, he's the best...

311
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:44,951
John West, John West, He's the best...

312
00:57:45,228 --> 00:57:49,164
John West, John West, He's the champ,

313
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:51,691
John West, John West,

314
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:57,198
Look Max! I can't stop
dancing! I can't stop!

315
00:57:58,441 --> 00:57:59,601
What's going on, Max?

316
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:01,636
What's going on? What's...

317
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:06,746
Tough on the bad guys... T ough on the
bad guys... Tough on the bad guys...

318
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:09,450
Tough on the bad guys... T ough on the
bad guys... Tough on the bad guys...

319
00:58:09,853 --> 00:58:10,649
Max!

320
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:16,484
Tough on the bad guys... T ough on the
bad guys... Tough on the bad guys...

321
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:17,455
Max!

322
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:19,290
Tough on the bad guys... T ough on the
bad guys... Tough on the bad guys...

323
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:17,683
Max! Help me! Someone
cut the lights, damn it!

324
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:21,114
Take it easy! We only
have to find the switch...

325
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:42,705
Let me go! Let me go! No,
no not to the window!!!

326
00:59:42,879 --> 00:59:44,744
Not to the window!!! No!!!

327
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,170
John! Help me...

328
01:00:18,181 --> 01:00:19,205
John.

329
01:01:42,131 --> 01:01:43,189
Are you okay?

330
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:47,261
Bill... Max didn't make it.

331
01:01:47,603 --> 01:01:48,831
Damn it.

332
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:51,230
What about Max?

333
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:53,342
Neither.

334
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:09,453
Bill...

335
01:02:43,726 --> 01:02:45,159
What's going on, agent?

336
01:02:45,862 --> 01:02:47,796
They're still alive... perfect.

337
01:02:54,003 --> 01:02:54,492
Bill?

338
01:02:56,339 --> 01:02:56,930
Billy?

339
01:02:58,641 --> 01:02:59,699
Billy, what's going on?

340
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:42,710
William Johnson, 23, medical student...

341
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:49,289
And here we have... Mr.
John West, 26, wrestler...

342
01:03:50,393 --> 01:03:51,485
Two scumbags.

343
01:03:52,061 --> 01:03:57,089
Now it's my turn. My name is James
Dominick Dana...35, federal agent.

344
01:03:57,633 --> 01:04:00,261
A lovely wife, two kids,
expecting the next...

345
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:03,161
...a wonderful house in the
suburbs with a swimming pool...

346
01:04:03,806 --> 01:04:06,502
And a salary of 1 20,000 dollars a year.

347
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:09,909
I could say my life was perfect...

348
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:13,042
Until you showed up!

349
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:17,613
I'll be more specific.

350
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,013
An agent called Scott Lee Ray...

351
01:04:21,257 --> 01:04:25,250
...stole a map of the city. We know
you have some information about it...

352
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:29,924
I need that map! Do you understand?

353
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:38,897
And... what does this mean?

354
01:04:40,476 --> 01:04:43,138
Do Not Touch! Explosive!

355
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:45,574
It's a bomb.

356
01:04:47,316 --> 01:04:51,184
Don't you know Max Giggs?
20, mathematician...

357
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,550
Touch it and we'll all die.

358
01:04:58,361 --> 01:04:59,851
What do you think, agent?

359
01:05:01,831 --> 01:05:02,957
I don't know.

360
01:05:11,807 --> 01:05:15,573
Listen, you morons! I don't care
about your lives, your bombs, nothing!

361
01:05:17,647 --> 01:05:20,241
I just want the goddamn map...

362
01:05:22,184 --> 01:05:24,652
It sounds like they're
trapped in here too...

363
01:05:25,855 --> 01:05:26,378
Very clever...

364
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:27,984
Agent!

365
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:31,851
The map, now!

366
01:05:33,162 --> 01:05:34,652
West, you know something, don't you?

367
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:37,064
Yep...

368
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:42,237
I broke the handcuffs.

369
01:05:42,972 --> 01:05:43,836
Damn it!

370
01:05:48,544 --> 01:05:49,568
That's impossible...

371
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:52,005
No...

372
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,688
My name is John West...

373
01:06:00,323 --> 01:06:03,986
My arms are made of steel
and my legs of titanium...

374
01:06:04,727 --> 01:06:06,524
I was born to win...

375
01:06:07,396 --> 01:06:08,522
and that's what I'm gonna do.

376
01:06:14,203 --> 01:06:16,034
Retreat! Retreat!

377
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:03,181
What the hell are you going to do to
me?

378
01:07:03,419 --> 01:07:05,353
Now I'm the one who asks the
questions!

379
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:10,281
No.

380
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:12,251
What the hell is going on here?

381
01:07:12,461 --> 01:07:15,430
Speak, you fool! Why do you want to
turn this town into a zombie town?

382
01:07:15,598 --> 01:07:16,826
You'd never understand!

383
01:07:16,932 --> 01:07:17,796
Why?!

384
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:20,733
And if you could it'd be the end!

385
01:07:20,903 --> 01:07:22,495
What the hell are you talking about?

386
01:07:22,938 --> 01:07:25,839
The answers will come. In its due time.

387
01:07:25,941 --> 01:07:26,600
What??

388
01:07:26,909 --> 01:07:31,972
The destiny of mankind is
not in our hands anymore!

389
01:07:37,953 --> 01:07:40,854
DO NOT TOUCH! EXPLOSlVE!

390
01:07:51,267 --> 01:07:53,098
Decoding ready in...

391
01:07:57,373 --> 01:08:00,137
Decoding complete, please wait...

392
01:08:02,678 --> 01:08:04,168
Decoding complete, please wait...

393
01:08:09,151 --> 01:08:10,482
Insert disk 2.

394
01:08:13,823 --> 01:08:16,155
Insert disk 2.

395
01:08:34,143 --> 01:08:35,906
Damn bastard! Give me the disk!

396
01:08:36,312 --> 01:08:37,836
Give me the damn disk #2!

397
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:43,229
And now what?

398
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:45,793
I think this could be the end.

399
01:11:48,437 --> 01:11:49,904
OK, we have two options...

400
01:11:50,005 --> 01:11:51,438
Bill, there's no option this time.

401
01:11:51,573 --> 01:11:53,268
What are you talking
about? Are you giving up?

402
01:11:53,375 --> 01:11:54,637
No. They're too many!

403
01:11:54,777 --> 01:11:57,610
Damn it John! We've been in
worse situations than this!

404
01:11:57,813 --> 01:11:59,781
We've no weapons and
they far outnumber us...

405
01:12:00,049 --> 01:12:01,676
What are you afraid of?
They're just zombies!

406
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:03,440
You know, Bill.

407
01:12:03,619 --> 01:12:05,519
These zombies are not
as stupid as we thought.

408
01:12:05,788 --> 01:12:07,153
Damn!
- John, listen to me...

409
01:12:07,256 --> 01:12:10,020
Bring my computer! Bring my
computer!

410
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:43,749
Brother Zombies...

411
01:12:45,594 --> 01:12:48,995
Welcome to my party!

412
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:54,192
Everything's as I expected...
- Max, Max!!

413
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:57,831
The last truck full of
humans has arrived...

414
01:12:58,073 --> 01:13:01,474
And that's why I am gathering
all the zombies from town...

415
01:13:01,777 --> 01:13:04,268
to decide the destiny of our community.

416
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:08,808
Today at sunset...

417
01:13:09,251 --> 01:13:11,651
...we'll end the negotiations...

418
01:13:11,854 --> 01:13:14,049
...and I'll get you
out of this damn town!

419
01:13:15,023 --> 01:13:17,423
Of course I'll leave too,
because I deserve to...

420
01:13:18,193 --> 01:13:18,716
Max!

421
01:13:19,962 --> 01:13:20,621
Bill?

422
01:13:20,796 --> 01:13:21,285
Max!

423
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:32,166
But my main goal is to set you free!

424
01:13:38,781 --> 01:13:42,615
Anyway, It's not going to be easy,
but everything's going to be fine.

425
01:13:43,185 --> 01:13:47,986
The only things you have to
do is trust me and follow me!

426
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:56,291
We will leave in groups...

427
01:13:57,332 --> 01:14:01,132
Zombies first... women
and children, later!

428
01:14:06,074 --> 01:14:09,441
We'll get together at 1 800 hours
at the agreed meeting point...

429
01:14:10,045 --> 01:14:11,842
You can bring your
friends, if you want...

430
01:14:13,148 --> 01:14:13,910
Yes.

431
01:14:16,018 --> 01:14:19,215
But be careful! Because
I once had a friend

432
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:20,615
and he betrayed me!

433
01:14:21,356 --> 01:14:22,948
His name was John West...

434
01:14:23,525 --> 01:14:25,720
His name was John West...
He was tall...fat...

435
01:14:25,894 --> 01:14:27,828
and he looked like a stupid cowboy!

436
01:14:31,233 --> 01:14:32,222
Damn bastard...

437
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:37,630
If I find him... I'll destroy him...

438
01:14:39,107 --> 01:14:41,575
after cutting him into little pieces...

439
01:14:42,778 --> 01:14:44,973
and then I'll make him into minced
meat!

440
01:14:50,419 --> 01:14:53,752
I can assure you it will be
very... very unpleasant...

441
01:15:42,504 --> 01:15:44,062
The reunion.

442
01:15:45,774 --> 01:15:46,832
The time... has come...

443
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:48,643
...and...

444
01:15:52,915 --> 01:15:54,041
Kill them!

445
01:16:19,808 --> 01:16:21,366
Now, rebels!

446
01:16:21,677 --> 01:16:24,168
Kowalski... Anderson...
Plissken... Vega...

447
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:26,407
Attack!

448
01:17:40,922 --> 01:17:42,480
I'll kill you all!

449
01:19:30,398 --> 01:19:31,592
You wanted to escape, huh?

450
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:33,662
You wanted to escape!

451
01:19:34,536 --> 01:19:35,867
But nobody escapes from me...

452
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:41,109
Because I'm John West,
got it? I'm John West!

453
01:19:41,743 --> 01:19:44,473
You're not John West
anymore! You are a looser!

454
01:19:44,846 --> 01:19:47,747
You've lost everything! You're a nobody.

455
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:51,586
Don't you see? You've been
living in the past for years!

456
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:52,982
No! I am John West!

457
01:19:53,088 --> 01:19:54,885
No, no you are not John West.

458
01:19:54,990 --> 01:19:57,220
Yes! I'm John West!
- No! You are not!

459
01:19:57,292 --> 01:20:00,261
I'm John West! I'm John West!
- You're not, you're not... you are not...

460
01:20:00,395 --> 01:20:04,957
I Am John West! I'm world champion!
- You're not, you're not, you're not!

461
01:20:05,167 --> 01:20:12,005
I'm... I'm...I'm John W est!
- No, you are not John West.

462
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:16,474
No, no, no....

463
01:20:19,381 --> 01:20:21,042
What the hell is going on here?

464
01:20:50,312 --> 01:20:53,110
Distribute the knives!
Distribute the knives!

465
01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:37,550
John... John, stop it!

466
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,254
No.

467
01:21:40,996 --> 01:21:41,894
John, stop it!

468
01:21:42,764 --> 01:21:44,061
Damn it, stop it!

469
01:21:46,034 --> 01:21:48,002
Stop it!

470
01:21:49,237 --> 01:21:51,228
Stop it, John! Stop it! No, no! Stop it!

471
01:21:58,613 --> 01:21:59,807
You wanna fly, Max?

472
01:22:00,315 --> 01:22:00,838
Max.

473
01:22:01,216 --> 01:22:02,513
Well, I'll make you fly then!

474
01:22:02,784 --> 01:22:06,845
Yes, I'll fly! I'll fly
and I'll leave this town!

475
01:22:07,722 --> 01:22:10,452
And once I've done it,
I'll destroy the map!

476
01:22:10,659 --> 01:22:12,092
Max, do you have disk #2?

477
01:22:12,193 --> 01:22:13,125
And then I'll be president...

478
01:22:13,228 --> 01:22:15,196
Max, listen to me! Do you have disk #2?

479
01:22:15,297 --> 01:22:18,066
And then I'll pass a law to destroy
all the cowboys and wrestlers!

480
01:22:18,066 --> 01:22:19,397
John, please, stop!

481
01:22:19,467 --> 01:22:21,731
And I'll also destroy...

482
01:22:37,852 --> 01:22:39,649
Don't you dare get in the
way of John West again!

483
01:22:39,888 --> 01:22:41,150
Leave Max alone, John.

484
01:22:41,256 --> 01:22:42,951
Bill, don't you see? He's a murderer!

485
01:22:43,191 --> 01:22:43,714
No!

486
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:45,260
I don't know what the
hell has happened...

487
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:46,727
but I do know that he can
get us out of this place!

488
01:22:47,295 --> 01:22:50,787
Bullshit! That's bullshit, Bill!
Don't you listen to him, got it?

489
01:22:58,006 --> 01:22:59,667
John... God Damn it! Let me go...

490
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:02,176
Tighter! Tighter!

491
01:23:02,277 --> 01:23:03,244
Damn it, John...

492
01:23:05,046 --> 01:23:07,810
Get your hands off me, you dirty ape!

493
01:23:08,583 --> 01:23:09,572
Tighter!

494
01:23:09,651 --> 01:23:10,709
Max, shut up!

495
01:23:10,952 --> 01:23:12,579
But, John...
- Shut up!

496
01:23:18,893 --> 01:23:21,726
Bill...you have to understand...

497
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:49,980
Behind you!

498
01:24:26,361 --> 01:24:28,056
Easy, Max, It's over...

499
01:24:34,135 --> 01:24:35,864
It's all over now, buddy.

500
01:24:36,971 --> 01:24:38,336
We'll leave this town...

501
01:24:39,474 --> 01:24:40,805
and everything will go
back to normal again.

502
01:24:42,644 --> 01:24:44,373
Bill, listen to me...
-You shut up you!

503
01:24:44,879 --> 01:24:46,471
Don't you realize what you've done?!

504
01:24:51,986 --> 01:24:55,012
Max, you do have disk #2, don't you?

505
01:24:59,661 --> 01:25:00,923
Easy, pal...

506
01:25:01,696 --> 01:25:03,398
everything's going to be normal again...

507
01:25:03,398 --> 01:25:05,161
You just have to give me the map, Max.

508
01:25:07,302 --> 01:25:09,031
Max, give me the map.

509
01:25:09,404 --> 01:25:13,841
No, No, no, no! That's the only
thing you care about, right?

510
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:15,667
The damn disk #2!

511
01:25:15,743 --> 01:25:16,411
Max, take it easy!

512
01:25:16,411 --> 01:25:19,209
Let me tell you one thing, Bill...
Nothing's going to be like it was before!

513
01:25:19,581 --> 01:25:23,517
Everything's like this because of
you! You wanted to keep the damn bag!

514
01:25:23,852 --> 01:25:26,685
What for? We could
barely save ourselves,

515
01:25:27,055 --> 01:25:28,990
but you wanted to keep the bag!

516
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:31,322
Max, shut up!
- And... who put you in charge?

517
01:25:31,659 --> 01:25:33,889
Because I didn't... Did you, John?

518
01:25:37,365 --> 01:25:40,596
You are always telling everybody
what to do... "This way!" "That way!"

519
01:25:40,668 --> 01:25:42,192
Shut up!
-... "Let's find some weapons!"

520
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:42,959
"Give me the bag! "

521
01:25:44,339 --> 01:25:45,328
"The bag! The bag!"

522
01:25:46,007 --> 01:25:47,201
No, No.

523
01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:51,811
No. John! John,

524
01:25:52,013 --> 01:25:52,775
say something!

525
01:25:53,948 --> 01:25:55,939
Yes... I will say something....

526
01:25:58,586 --> 01:26:00,383
"This way! That way! This way!"

527
01:26:03,458 --> 01:26:04,049
Know what, Bill?

528
01:26:05,059 --> 01:26:06,151
"The bag! The bag!"

529
01:26:06,694 --> 01:26:08,457
All this has gone too far...

530
01:26:22,377 --> 01:26:24,436
I don't know who's
responsible for all this...

531
01:26:26,214 --> 01:26:29,775
but I do know that whatever
is happening down there...

532
01:26:31,319 --> 01:26:32,786
is worse than anything...

533
01:26:36,357 --> 01:26:37,483
It's pure evil...

534
01:26:40,562 --> 01:26:44,259
And if we want to stay alive,
we have to work together...

535
01:26:44,832 --> 01:26:46,094
so we can get the hell out of here.

536
01:26:50,371 --> 01:26:53,829
Because we are stronger,
we can fight them.

537
01:26:54,976 --> 01:27:00,437
We have to show those
damn zombies what we can do.

538
01:27:06,588 --> 01:27:10,752
I want to find the person responsible
for all this, dead or alive...

539
01:27:12,994 --> 01:27:16,327
I want infinite justice, so we
can achieve enduring freedom...

540
01:27:22,937 --> 01:27:25,098
This is not a war
between us, my friends...

541
01:27:28,376 --> 01:27:29,934
This is a war against terror...

542
01:27:32,213 --> 01:27:34,078
This is strike against terror!

543
01:27:42,156 --> 01:27:43,919
This is only the humble opinion...

544
01:27:44,525 --> 01:27:45,753
of a simple cowboy...

545
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:48,094
who once entertained children...

546
01:27:48,429 --> 01:27:52,422
and who is now merely
trying... to save the world.

547
01:28:29,504 --> 01:28:30,562
Alright, John...

548
01:28:31,105 --> 01:28:32,307
I forgive you for not saving me

549
01:28:32,307 --> 01:28:33,501
while the zombies ripped off my arm.

550
01:28:34,676 --> 01:28:36,507
I didn't save you
because you killed Max!

551
01:28:36,878 --> 01:28:39,642
You didn't save him?
- No, he didn't! He didn't!

552
01:28:39,881 --> 01:28:41,109
Shut up!

553
01:29:05,273 --> 01:29:07,434
...the whole town is infected...

554
01:29:07,608 --> 01:29:08,768
Oh, Damn!

555
01:29:08,843 --> 01:29:09,935
...release the survivors...

556
01:29:10,011 --> 01:29:11,103
...slowly...

557
01:29:11,279 --> 01:29:12,541
...Iook at this mess...

558
01:29:13,414 --> 01:29:14,676
...they were here, too...

559
01:29:14,782 --> 01:29:15,942
...now rebels!...

560
01:29:16,017 --> 01:29:17,085
...Iet's find some weapons...

561
01:29:17,085 --> 01:29:17,710
...I don't understand your language...

562
01:29:17,819 --> 01:29:18,553
...they want to negotiate...

563
01:29:18,553 --> 01:29:19,417
...today at sunset...

564
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:20,917
...Iisten to yourself,
you're talking crazy...

565
01:29:21,122 --> 01:29:22,724
...we'll end the negotiations...

566
01:29:22,724 --> 01:29:23,986
...they want to negotiate,
got it? Negotiate...

567
01:29:24,392 --> 01:29:26,019
...and I'll get you out
of this damn town....

568
01:29:26,094 --> 01:29:28,528
...when they come back, we'll die...

569
01:29:28,596 --> 01:29:29,927
...now I'm the one...
Who's asking the questions.

570
01:29:30,832 --> 01:29:31,696
....they are inside...

571
01:29:31,766 --> 01:29:33,393
...what the hell is going on here?

572
01:29:33,468 --> 01:29:34,992
It's about the alien virus...

573
01:29:35,103 --> 01:29:36,798
...and when they attack
it'll be the end...

574
01:29:36,971 --> 01:29:37,733
Why?

575
01:29:38,272 --> 01:29:39,330
What are you saying?

576
01:29:40,575 --> 01:29:42,008
They are inside...

577
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:43,038
...Iollypop...

578
01:29:43,177 --> 01:29:44,405
...distribute the knives...

579
01:29:44,512 --> 01:29:46,280
...Iollypop... distribute the knives...

580
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:49,443
...Iollypop......Iollypop......Iollypop...
...Iollypop......Iollypop......Iollypop...

581
01:30:59,887 --> 01:31:00,683
John...

582
01:31:03,424 --> 01:31:05,483
I think it's time for you to tell me...

583
01:31:05,827 --> 01:31:08,455
...how come you're still
alive... when I saw you die?

584
01:31:08,896 --> 01:31:11,592
Bill, it's a long story.

585
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:16,096
Come on, John, tell me. I'm all ears.

586
01:31:19,373 --> 01:31:21,273
Okay Bill, I'll tell you.

587
01:31:22,109 --> 01:31:23,201
It all started when...

588
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:28,533
And now what?

589
01:33:29,537 --> 01:33:31,596
We could run away,

590
01:33:33,207 --> 01:33:34,834
search for a safe place...

591
01:33:36,644 --> 01:33:38,373
but there's no point.

592
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:40,747
What's going on, Bill?

593
01:33:41,549 --> 01:33:42,311
What's happening?

594
01:33:43,851 --> 01:33:45,978
This is the end of the human race, John.

595
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:47,512
We have to do something!

596
01:33:51,492 --> 01:33:52,925
I think it'd be better...

597
01:33:53,594 --> 01:33:56,358
to sit here... and wait.

598
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:33,732
Alright...

599
01:34:35,703 --> 01:34:36,931
Iet's do it.

600
01:34:38,439 --> 01:34:39,497
On the count of three...

601
01:34:40,608 --> 01:34:41,575
Let's get out of here!

602
01:34:43,811 --> 01:34:44,470
One...

603
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:47,138
Two...

604
01:36:16,370 --> 01:36:20,898
FlVE YEARS LATER

605
01:36:32,853 --> 01:36:34,582
CONTRACT

606
01:36:43,197 --> 01:36:46,928
You know what? This is the
return I was waiting for...

607
01:36:54,441 --> 01:36:56,841
And it's all thanks to you...
