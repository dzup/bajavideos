1
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,489
I'm all ears.

2
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:51,559
What I'm most concerned about,
Mr. N˙Òez, are the people.

3
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:55,027
If we'd close down, five thousand
employees will be left on the street.

4
00:01:55,098 --> 00:01:57,259
Stop talking nonsense, Fraga.

5
00:01:57,567 --> 00:01:59,934
Mr. N˙Òez is not here
to listen to sentimental statements.

6
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:02,572
We are not here to discuss families,
we're here to talk about money.

7
00:02:02,607 --> 00:02:04,130
I want to make it clear.

8
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:07,233
Lot of dough was spent with this.
None of you realized it beforehand.

9
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,337
None of you...

10
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,006
sent an accurate report
to headquarters.

11
00:02:13,116 --> 00:02:15,050
This is not forfree.

12
00:02:15,118 --> 00:02:17,211
I can tell you right now
that we could leave,

13
00:02:17,287 --> 00:02:20,154
liquidate assets,
put up with the tide...

14
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,622
or sell everything.

15
00:02:22,158 --> 00:02:25,355
Of course, we'll evaluate
whaùs the best forthe corporation.

16
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,963
Soon, I'll send you a memo
with the final decisiÛn.

17
00:02:29,165 --> 00:02:31,326
Now, I don't have much more to say.

18
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,096
We'll keep in touch.

19
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:35,137
I'm not ajerk, N˙Òez.
I knowwhy you're here.

20
00:02:35,205 --> 00:02:36,536
You've already made a decisiÛn.

21
00:02:36,606 --> 00:02:38,506
Just a compensation
won't be enough for me.

22
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,169
Tell those that if they don't pay
all they have to pay,

23
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,144
I'll talk.
I knowmany things.

24
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:45,577
Howthey went off with everything.
I knowabout the off-shore funds,

25
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,477
I knowabout the money transfers.

26
00:02:47,984 --> 00:02:51,317
I can talk and you
and all those damned Galicians...

27
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,252
will appear on the newspaper covers.

28
00:02:53,389 --> 00:02:56,153
We already are on the papers.
We already are the devil.

29
00:02:56,492 --> 00:02:58,653
People won't be scared of us.

30
00:02:59,028 --> 00:03:01,019
Iùs your family
who will be scared of you.

31
00:03:01,564 --> 00:03:03,998
We have recorded you in all formats.

32
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,494
Frame by frame, second by second.

33
00:03:08,671 --> 00:03:10,161
If you wish,

34
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,976
I'll send them a DVD
so they have a better defined image.

35
00:03:17,513 --> 00:03:19,538
By the way, here's zone 4, isn't it?

36
00:03:40,103 --> 00:03:42,003
D'you knowwhom you remind me?

37
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:47,500
You look a bit like Anna Karina
in "Vivre sa vie".

38
00:03:49,245 --> 00:03:52,009
No, no, sorry, iùs not Anna Karina.

39
00:03:52,715 --> 00:03:56,378
You look exactly like Delphine Seyrig
in "LannÈe derniËre ‡ Marienbad".

40
00:04:03,026 --> 00:04:04,891
Have you ever acted in a movie?

41
00:04:13,436 --> 00:04:15,233
I think you're most suited for that.

42
00:04:16,105 --> 00:04:19,472
In two months,
I'll be filming my second movie.

43
00:04:19,575 --> 00:04:21,873
If you want, you could give
me your phone number...

44
00:04:21,945 --> 00:04:25,676
and, who knows? Maybe...
you could be my Geena Rowlands.

45
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,599
<i>Ch°ldren, stop!</i>

46
00:04:53,443 --> 00:04:55,434
MartÌn, get out ofthere!
MartÌn, have you listened to me?

47
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,246
Naughty kid, get out ofthere!
Naughty!

48
00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:21,459
I am calm.
In any case,

49
00:05:21,537 --> 00:05:23,198
iùs them who must not be calm.

50
00:05:23,272 --> 00:05:26,435
Just because!
To you... a ten per cent, I think.

51
00:05:29,445 --> 00:05:31,504
You're very polite, Freddy.

52
00:05:32,382 --> 00:05:34,179
I didn't say that.

53
00:05:34,283 --> 00:05:36,183
I said "polite".

54
00:05:37,053 --> 00:05:40,955
We're a bit touchy, aren't we?

55
00:05:43,626 --> 00:05:46,459
Touchy and out of place.

56
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,389
At my house.

57
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:53,626
Yes.

58
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,900
Well, no, I don't think so.

59
00:05:57,707 --> 00:06:00,341
No, no...
No, Freddy, no. No, no.

60
00:06:00,376 --> 00:06:02,976
Who threwit to the toilet? Who?

61
00:06:03,346 --> 00:06:05,075
We'll talk later.

62
00:06:05,214 --> 00:06:06,943
What I do think
is that we should send something,

63
00:06:07,016 --> 00:06:08,916
a registered letter.
I don't know, whatever...

64
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,250
Hold a second, don't hang up...
Where are you going?

65
00:06:12,922 --> 00:06:15,288
To look for ajob.

66
00:06:45,621 --> 00:06:48,215
- Hi!
- Hi.

67
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:25,324
Weren't you getting out tonight?

68
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,325
I don't know.

69
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,562
I don't want to miss the nominations.

70
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,400
Go, I'll record them foryou.

71
00:07:46,516 --> 00:07:48,450
I'm sure all them
are leading successful lives.

72
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:54,084
If I were you, I'd go.

73
00:08:17,446 --> 00:08:19,414
Be my light, be my light.

74
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:24,245
I'll change to anothertopic
that I don't want to overlook,

75
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,915
as we had been trying to solve it
for a long time and we couldn't.

76
00:08:28,224 --> 00:08:30,920
It might be trivial...

77
00:08:31,127 --> 00:08:32,924
but I have it written down.

78
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:35,120
Mr. Lacrose!

79
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,035
Mr. Lacrose, we're right now
dealing with your situation,

80
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,932
and we've decided,
by unanimous vote,

81
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:46,804
that your case
will be filed with the Court.

82
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:49,602
Mr. Rafaeli has offered
his services as lawyer.

83
00:08:51,547 --> 00:08:53,447
Well... I don't know.

84
00:08:53,549 --> 00:08:55,574
Please, allowme until the 15th.
Can you?

85
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:58,085
Eleven thousand pesos
in service charges...

86
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:01,252
Listen Lacrose,
we can't wait foryou any longer.

87
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:07,459
How strange,
a Lacroze who's poor...

88
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,998
But this Lacrose is written with "s".

89
00:09:48,471 --> 00:09:50,996
<i>I'd l°ke to tell you...</i>

90
00:09:51,941 --> 00:09:53,636
<i>a dream.</i>

91
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,303
<i>Iùs a very strange dream...</i>

92
00:09:56,545 --> 00:09:59,013
I've had today early morning.

93
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,610
On this dream, God appeared to me.

94
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,484
<i>I was accompan°ed
by several professors...</i>

95
00:10:06,555 --> 00:10:09,422
<i>from d°fferent parts of the un°verse.</i>

96
00:10:10,226 --> 00:10:14,356
<i>The s°tuat°on was very tense,</i>

97
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:18,925
<i>as God accused us...</i>

98
00:10:19,001 --> 00:10:22,402
<i>of hav°ng wasted a whole generat°on.</i>

99
00:10:22,471 --> 00:10:25,998
<i>Because of that, and to separate
the righteous from the s°nners,</i>

100
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:28,937
<i>God dec°ded...</i>

101
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:31,444
to take us a test.

102
00:10:32,248 --> 00:10:35,081
<i>He would choose one of
my alumn°,</i>

103
00:10:35,151 --> 00:10:37,351
<i>that means one of you,</i>

104
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:42,016
<i>and would testyou
to challenge a l°m°t s°tuat°on.</i>

105
00:10:42,658 --> 00:10:44,250
<i>Prov°ded th°s student...</i>

106
00:10:44,327 --> 00:10:48,127
made the right decisiÛn
and achieved a happy end,

107
00:10:48,497 --> 00:10:50,488
I would pass the exam,

108
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:54,091
and the reward was
that I could wake up from the dream...

109
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,434
and go on living.

110
00:10:57,506 --> 00:10:59,474
Otherwise,

111
00:10:59,542 --> 00:11:02,534
as a punishment
for my poor performance as educator,

112
00:11:03,045 --> 00:11:07,277
<i>I would be condemned
to never wake up aga°n.</i>

113
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,075
It was then...

114
00:11:10,219 --> 00:11:13,188
that the idea of
coming to this meeting...

115
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,150
had new value for me.

116
00:11:18,661 --> 00:11:20,390
I began wondering...

117
00:11:20,496 --> 00:11:23,624
about what kind of people I'd meet.

118
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,527
Will they be loyal ortraitors?

119
00:11:29,572 --> 00:11:33,338
Will they be capable
of sacrificing fortheirfellows...

120
00:11:34,143 --> 00:11:37,510
or will they live only
fortheir personal satisfaction?

121
00:11:38,981 --> 00:11:43,179
Will they be ready
to be coherent with theirfeelings...

122
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,387
or will they prefer...

123
00:11:46,689 --> 00:11:50,090
the comfort of hypocrisy?

124
00:11:52,695 --> 00:11:54,322
Well...

125
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,327
excuse my solemnity,

126
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,199
and please, don't confuse it
with despair.

127
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:02,100
Leùs make it clear,

128
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:06,074
I do not only fervently wish
to wake up tomorrow,

129
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:10,334
which isjust the 5th.
And I get my retirement payment,

130
00:12:11,013 --> 00:12:14,278
but I also wish to be invited,
to attend...

131
00:12:15,351 --> 00:12:19,481
and to deliver a better speech
at the 25th anniversary...

132
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:23,917
of the day you've graduated.

133
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:34,365
Giris, boys!

134
00:12:35,037 --> 00:12:37,471
Atoast to the 20 years!

135
00:12:37,706 --> 00:12:40,402
Congratulations!

136
00:12:54,557 --> 00:12:56,991
Just because you were friends
and I did love you a lot,

137
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:59,252
because I earn my living with this.

138
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,993
Leùs see...

139
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:06,524
You must be patient, not that much,

140
00:13:07,136 --> 00:13:10,970
cause you'll be successful in a very,
but very short term.

141
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,300
What else?

142
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,239
You'll be successful,
what else dyou want, dear?

143
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,334
What about me?

144
00:13:15,511 --> 00:13:18,309
- Her name is Lara.
- Howpretty she is!

145
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,280
She takes exactly afteryou!

146
00:13:20,349 --> 00:13:21,338
What a pity, since herfather is very,
very handsome.

147
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:23,112
<i>Who could have sa°d that?</i>

148
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,414
I went forthe two of you.

149
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,147
Me too.

150
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:31,459
Iùs never late.

151
00:13:32,027 --> 00:13:35,190
Anybody knows something
about soft-headed PequeÒo?

152
00:13:35,331 --> 00:13:37,231
What a pity he didn't come, isn't it?

153
00:13:37,366 --> 00:13:40,130
Don't you miss the dumb flying
from side to side in the classroom?

154
00:13:40,336 --> 00:13:43,533
PequeÒo!

155
00:13:45,975 --> 00:13:48,307
Whaùs up, Lacrose?
Have you become evangelist?

156
00:13:49,178 --> 00:13:51,408
No, I'm not evangelist,

157
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,138
but we behaved badly,

158
00:13:53,215 --> 00:13:56,207
we ruined the best years
that a boy, jerk, can live.

159
00:13:56,285 --> 00:14:00,278
Ajerk boy or a boy, comma, jerk?

160
00:14:02,124 --> 00:14:03,557
We didn't behave well.

161
00:14:03,626 --> 00:14:06,891
We were simply soldiers.
You gave the orders.

162
00:14:06,962 --> 00:14:09,897
Don't you remember when he told us
to piss on him at the locker room?

163
00:14:10,032 --> 00:14:12,466
And it was you who made him
kiss Pochola in the bathroom!

164
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,501
And the one who followed him
to his house, too.

165
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:17,161
Poor wretch, not even
when we left school you left him alone.

166
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:20,140
In the end, boys,
the only son of a bitch...

167
00:14:20,242 --> 00:14:22,437
was Lacrose, you see!

168
00:14:22,511 --> 00:14:24,342
Voglio a entrare!

169
00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:28,346
Voglio a entrare!

170
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:32,045
- Per la finestra?
- Hello!

171
00:14:32,354 --> 00:14:35,551
Howare you?

172
00:14:35,691 --> 00:14:38,319
I'm so happy to see you!

173
00:14:38,427 --> 00:14:40,918
- Howare you?
- Let me see...

174
00:14:53,342 --> 00:14:55,367
- Have I interrupted anything?
- No.

175
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,477
I can't believe it!

176
00:15:00,616 --> 00:15:02,607
This is a lie, isn't it?

177
00:15:04,386 --> 00:15:07,184
Tell me this is not true,

178
00:15:07,456 --> 00:15:09,185
that iùs a dream.

179
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,459
Or better tell me...

180
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,095
that what I'm living
is absolutely, but absolutely real.

181
00:15:15,264 --> 00:15:17,357
Shit! Say what you want,
but please say something!

182
00:15:17,433 --> 00:15:19,128
- Howare you?
- Me?

183
00:15:19,201 --> 00:15:21,101
What does it matter about me?
Howare you?

184
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,263
What do you do?

185
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,971
Are you married?
Do you have children?

186
00:15:26,108 --> 00:15:28,303
Well, I made a movie.

187
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,469
I can't believe
you've made a movie!

188
00:15:30,546 --> 00:15:31,911
And whaùs the title?

189
00:15:31,981 --> 00:15:34,040
"Corollary of a Sleeping Twilight"

190
00:15:35,084 --> 00:15:37,644
It wasn't premiered in Spain, was it?
Otherwise, I'd have rushed to see it.

191
00:15:38,988 --> 00:15:42,321
There's a great boom
with Argentine movies.

192
00:15:42,491 --> 00:15:45,187
Many ofthem have been premiered.
"The Bride's Son",

193
00:15:46,128 --> 00:15:47,493
- "Seven Queens"...
- But you knowwhat?

194
00:15:47,563 --> 00:15:51,021
What I do is more for...
I don't know...

195
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:54,160
Iùs no so much for export, leùs say.

196
00:15:55,604 --> 00:15:57,299
And you, Franquito?

197
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,068
Hitachi, shit! Howgood you look!
You have not a single grey hair!

198
00:16:01,577 --> 00:16:03,511
What dyou do? Apart from keeping
yourselfin formol, of course!

199
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:05,308
D'you want me to lie
or do I spoil you the night?

200
00:16:05,447 --> 00:16:07,005
Have you seen him well?

201
00:16:07,082 --> 00:16:09,175
- Whom?
- Guido!

202
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,184
- Yes, whaùs up?
- He's got tits.

203
00:16:16,492 --> 00:16:19,086
Sorry, but NÈstor
also looks very decayed...

204
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:20,890
Yes, you're right!

205
00:16:20,963 --> 00:16:23,363
They're those typical characters
one meets in the subway...

206
00:16:23,432 --> 00:16:25,297
frustrated because
they don't get a pay raise,

207
00:16:25,668 --> 00:16:28,369
feeling blue
because they are almost forty,

208
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,497
and terrified cause
they no longer get an erection.

209
00:16:31,006 --> 00:16:32,530
Queers, bah!

210
00:16:32,675 --> 00:16:35,200
Andjust think that in the past,
men loaded their swords...

211
00:16:35,444 --> 00:16:38,572
and fought to death.
Where will those warriors be now?

212
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:42,050
In the movies, Romi,
only in the movies.

213
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:45,176
Excuse me...

214
00:16:52,995 --> 00:16:55,896
- Howare you, Lacrose?
- D'you knowanything of PequeÒo?

215
00:16:56,031 --> 00:16:59,900
I call him from time to time...
Once a year...

216
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:03,462
but as he never answers
I just leave a message in his voicemail.

217
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:05,973
Maybe thaùs not longer his number...

218
00:17:06,008 --> 00:17:09,273
So you've got his number.
Could you give it to me?

219
00:17:09,645 --> 00:17:11,112
Please?

220
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,052
You knowwhat?
Don't take it bad,

221
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,195
but I'd rather not be me
the one who gives it to you.

222
00:18:28,123 --> 00:18:30,216
The time machine.

223
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,889
The time tunnel.

224
00:18:57,452 --> 00:18:59,886
- Iùs brilliant!
- Iùs good...

225
00:19:00,088 --> 00:19:03,148
but the grass is better.
Hash makes me feel a bit down.

226
00:19:06,495 --> 00:19:07,985
Have you given up smoking?

227
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,361
Iùs not the right moment.

228
00:19:10,966 --> 00:19:13,264
Iùs very hard.
I understand you.

229
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,098
DiscÈpolo was right!
Look at me!

230
00:19:16,471 --> 00:19:18,462
I've always been disastrous at school.

231
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,531
I've ever had not
a dammed talent for anything.

232
00:19:20,876 --> 00:19:22,935
Even gymnastics I didn't pass.

233
00:19:23,946 --> 00:19:26,608
Something must be very wrong that now
I'm a winner and you are doing so badly.

234
00:19:26,982 --> 00:19:28,472
But don't give up!

235
00:19:29,384 --> 00:19:32,911
This will change, we're living
the last throes of capitalism.

236
00:19:34,189 --> 00:19:36,157
In a short time,
you'll get what you deserve...

237
00:19:36,225 --> 00:19:37,624
and I'll get what I deserve.

238
00:19:38,126 --> 00:19:40,060
You did well.

239
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:43,095
I mean your parents! They guessed
what was coming, and left in time.

240
00:19:43,398 --> 00:19:46,390
Since you left, everything went to hell.
There's no employment already.

241
00:19:47,703 --> 00:19:51,298
Now, I don't knowif you've read
any paper, kidnapping is in vogue.

242
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,576
Everybody complains but iùs the only
possible industry in this country.

243
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,641
As for me, every time
a businessman is kidnapped...

244
00:19:56,912 --> 00:19:58,880
I feel like celebrating with champagne.

245
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,639
More if considering that those turds
have kidnapped ourfuture.

246
00:20:03,485 --> 00:20:05,350
Iùsjust that I don't have the guts...

247
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,445
Don't give up.
Don't indulge them.

248
00:20:09,191 --> 00:20:11,489
This will change.
And it will have to do with the South.

249
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,356
Argentina is the future.

250
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:17,125
- Argentina kills you.
- No way! Argentina will take off.

251
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:19,064
There are good people here,
I knowwhat I'm saying!

252
00:20:20,335 --> 00:20:22,530
Hey, has anybody brought eye drops?

253
00:20:23,505 --> 00:20:25,063
Hey! Leonor, and you?
What do you do?

254
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,265
Because you played thejerk
and didn't tell us anything.

255
00:20:27,342 --> 00:20:30,368
- Sorry, but why Leonor?
- For Benedetto.

256
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:32,271
The woman
was with Sacrist·n six months...

257
00:20:32,347 --> 00:20:35,510
and when she returned, she had a thicker
accent than Fernando Fern·n GÛmez.

258
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,945
I understand.

259
00:20:38,353 --> 00:20:40,014
Don't get angry,

260
00:20:40,088 --> 00:20:43,080
iùsjust that I don't get used
to the accent.

261
00:20:44,126 --> 00:20:46,117
Anyway, you didn't answer us
on what you do.

262
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,395
Finances.

263
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,961
Oh! I see.

264
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:56,230
Here, those of your race
have cleaned us out.

265
00:20:56,371 --> 00:20:57,998
I've heard something about that.

266
00:20:59,574 --> 00:21:01,303
As to me, to take a case in point,

267
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,474
they conned me out
of the only 2,000 dollars...

268
00:21:03,545 --> 00:21:05,877
I could had saved in all my life.

269
00:21:05,948 --> 00:21:08,508
With that money
I intended to make my next movie.

270
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,951
And as to Franco?
Tell him.

271
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,177
He was also swindled
of all his severance pay.

272
00:21:14,656 --> 00:21:17,090
Hey! Leonor, by any chance,

273
00:21:17,225 --> 00:21:19,022
you don't work
for the Asturian Bank, do you?

274
00:21:19,094 --> 00:21:22,188
Sorry! Did I get you?
Can you make a movie with 2,000 dollars?

275
00:21:23,332 --> 00:21:25,197
I film in digital system
and everything is done by me myself.

276
00:21:25,267 --> 00:21:26,598
And the actors?

277
00:21:27,102 --> 00:21:29,400
Real people.
Actors are a fraud.

278
00:21:29,471 --> 00:21:31,666
Listen! Mr. Robert de Niro
is not a fraud at all.

279
00:21:32,107 --> 00:21:35,099
- Please! He always does the same thing.
- No way!

280
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,508
Travis Brickle is not the same
that Jack La Mota.

281
00:21:37,646 --> 00:21:40,479
This is over.
Why don't we go somewhere?

282
00:21:40,649 --> 00:21:43,550
Sure! Today is my only
and last night here.

283
00:21:43,618 --> 00:21:45,677
Tomorrow early,
I'm leaving back to Madrid.

284
00:21:46,755 --> 00:21:49,417
In fact, I feel like going over the city
and if you don't have anything to do,

285
00:21:49,524 --> 00:21:51,321
what would be better
that doing something together?

286
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,996
- And?
- Nothing.

287
00:22:30,165 --> 00:22:32,030
They must have been re-painted.

288
00:22:32,367 --> 00:22:34,335
I think it wasn't that one...

289
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:41,303
We wrote them
when we began to sit together,

290
00:22:41,376 --> 00:22:43,037
dyou remember?

291
00:22:44,746 --> 00:22:46,611
I think iùs that one.

292
00:22:54,156 --> 00:22:56,124
Do you dare?

293
00:22:59,227 --> 00:23:01,252
THE BEST PIANISTOF THE WORLD

294
00:23:15,177 --> 00:23:17,236
THE BEST SINGER

295
00:23:22,084 --> 00:23:23,915
Whaùs up with your life?

296
00:23:26,221 --> 00:23:27,984
Nothing special.

297
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,651
And you?

298
00:23:32,294 --> 00:23:33,989
I'm fine.

299
00:23:34,129 --> 00:23:37,292
Melina, there's no sense in it.
We'll keep on talking about the past.

300
00:23:37,365 --> 00:23:39,526
No way! I want to know
what you're up to now.

301
00:23:39,601 --> 00:23:42,331
- You'll get too bored.
- Leùs go. Come on!

302
00:23:42,537 --> 00:23:44,232
Come on...

303
00:23:45,073 --> 00:23:47,200
Are you leaving, Palombo?

304
00:23:47,442 --> 00:23:50,070
- Lf you let my hand go, I will.
- Iùs okay!

305
00:24:04,493 --> 00:24:06,290
Tell me about your life.

306
00:24:08,263 --> 00:24:10,424
As you know,
some lives are ideal for a film...

307
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:13,528
Well, mine would just serve
for a short-length film.

308
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,932
What a fool you are!

309
00:24:23,678 --> 00:24:26,112
Here your are, colleague,
you drive! I look.

310
00:24:26,181 --> 00:24:28,649
- No! What ifl scratch it?
- No, it belongs to the company!

311
00:24:33,455 --> 00:24:35,150
Hey, and the Italpark?

312
00:24:35,957 --> 00:24:37,290
D'you remember the Matter Horn?

313
00:24:37,325 --> 00:24:39,394
Sure! Howcan I forget it?
It was the best of all the attractions.

314
00:24:39,429 --> 00:24:43,057
In 1992, one ofthe cars
detached with a girl inside.

315
00:24:43,198 --> 00:24:44,961
Iùs said that the car crossed
all through the avenue.

316
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,326
- What the hell is this?
- Aflower.

317
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:50,067
It has a computerthat,
according to the time ofthe day,

318
00:24:50,138 --> 00:24:52,299
is opened or closed.

319
00:24:53,475 --> 00:24:55,909
Here was where I first saw
"Close Encounters ofthe Third Kind".

320
00:24:56,011 --> 00:24:58,104
My granny took me.
The old lady fell asleep,

321
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:00,976
buy deeply asleep,
as soon as the first UFO appeared.

322
00:25:01,116 --> 00:25:02,549
I sawit five times.

323
00:25:03,451 --> 00:25:05,419
Five times! We entered
at 11:00 in the morning...

324
00:25:05,987 --> 00:25:08,046
and went out at 11:00 night.

325
00:25:08,356 --> 00:25:11,052
Good grief! Howl cried seeing
that movie, especially at the end.

326
00:25:13,161 --> 00:25:15,026
I wished an UFO came and took me...

327
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,428
far away, but well far away.

328
00:25:17,666 --> 00:25:19,657
I'm still waiting.

329
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:23,331
Hey, would you...

330
00:25:23,972 --> 00:25:26,338
Would you allowme a moment,
just a fewminutes?

331
00:25:26,408 --> 00:25:28,876
Could you leave me alone, please?

332
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,548
Mister, Mister,
don't you have a coin?

333
00:26:08,617 --> 00:26:11,142
No, nothing, no!

334
00:26:12,454 --> 00:26:14,445
What a son of a bitch!
I'm leaving!

335
00:26:14,522 --> 00:26:18,117
- Stop! Be smart.
- Be smart what?

336
00:26:20,595 --> 00:26:23,155
My mother always told me to take
advantage of contacts made at school.

337
00:26:23,231 --> 00:26:25,495
That I had been sent
to a private school for a reason.

338
00:26:26,601 --> 00:26:29,069
At then, I took it badly.

339
00:26:29,204 --> 00:26:32,298
I thought that the worid was ruled
by merits and not by contacts.

340
00:26:33,575 --> 00:26:35,975
But now, look at me!
And look at yourself, too!

341
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,640
We've been not successful at all,
Alexis.

342
00:26:40,382 --> 00:26:42,009
Instead... Look at him!

343
00:26:42,317 --> 00:26:44,182
D'you have the "Pelo" magazine?

344
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,121
"The imaginary express"?

345
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,977
How excellent
were thejingles in the past!

346
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,170
<i>Yes?</i>

347
00:28:15,577 --> 00:28:18,011
Excuse me, could you tell...

348
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:21,241
which apartment
PequeÒo family lives?

349
00:28:21,416 --> 00:28:24,180
<i>Seventh B.
Has someth°ng serious occurred?</i>

350
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,082
<i>I heard shouts,
thaùs why I'm ask°ng.</i>

351
00:28:26,154 --> 00:28:28,145
<i>You are the doctor, aren'tyou?</i>

352
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:32,589
No... I'mjust a friend.

353
00:28:33,561 --> 00:28:36,621
<i>A friend?
Get out or I'll call the pol°ce!</i>

354
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,940
<i>Act°on Lu°s, act°on...</i>

355
00:28:51,513 --> 00:28:53,003
<i>Yes?</i>

356
00:28:53,348 --> 00:28:56,545
PequeÒo family?

357
00:30:34,315 --> 00:30:36,249
Come in.

358
00:30:44,659 --> 00:30:46,627
I suppose you remember me.

359
00:30:47,629 --> 00:30:49,290
Iùs me, Luis MarÌa.

360
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:52,960
Lacrose.

361
00:30:53,535 --> 00:30:55,435
Sit down.

362
00:30:59,474 --> 00:31:01,101
I don't knowhowto begin...

363
00:31:01,175 --> 00:31:03,166
Iùs been so many years.

364
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:08,206
I don't expect that with what I've come
to tell you, we can be friends.

365
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,009
I'm happy just to know
that you're okay.

366
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,183
I'vejust come
from the graduates meeting...

367
00:31:14,522 --> 00:31:16,922
and I was told that something
was wrong with you.

368
00:31:18,993 --> 00:31:21,461
Lfiùs any consolation to you,
during these years...

369
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,022
I also went through
many bad situations.

370
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:28,299
It seems that God punished me
for all I did,

371
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:31,370
and among all the wrong I did,
I also include what I did to you.

372
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,967
I just want you to know
that I've changed,

373
00:31:36,044 --> 00:31:37,602
I swear you I've changed.

374
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,306
Imagine howl've changed...

375
00:31:39,414 --> 00:31:42,110
that nowl work as a coach
at the school club,

376
00:31:42,383 --> 00:31:44,476
and when I see a boy
is bothering another,

377
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:48,012
I suspend him, immediately!

378
00:31:48,389 --> 00:31:50,448
Because rugby's not that.

379
00:31:51,225 --> 00:31:53,955
Rugby's good, iùs camaraderie,

380
00:31:54,228 --> 00:31:57,061
friendship, stamina.

381
00:31:58,232 --> 00:32:01,224
And dyou knowwhat made me change?

382
00:32:02,236 --> 00:32:05,330
A book...
A book I read made me change.

383
00:32:06,407 --> 00:32:09,467
One year ago, I went
to the supermarket to buy whiskey.

384
00:32:10,311 --> 00:32:13,212
When I was queuing to pay,

385
00:32:14,315 --> 00:32:16,408
I sawa book with a cover which read:

386
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:20,009
"Manual ofthe Warrior ofthe Light".

387
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,186
I got caught by that title.

388
00:32:22,557 --> 00:32:25,424
That same night,
instead of drinking up the bottle,

389
00:32:25,493 --> 00:32:27,927
I began to read it.
What I like best from the book...

390
00:32:28,062 --> 00:32:29,927
is when it says
that a warrior ofthe light...

391
00:32:30,098 --> 00:32:32,089
always has a second chance.

392
00:32:32,634 --> 00:32:35,967
Then, I decided I could be
that warrior ofthe light,

393
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:40,038
and for that, I only need
to have my personal experience,

394
00:32:40,408 --> 00:32:42,171
a missiÛn in my life.

395
00:32:42,744 --> 00:32:44,644
And then I realized that my missiÛn...

396
00:32:45,146 --> 00:32:48,445
is to find all the people
I had done harm to in the past...

397
00:32:48,516 --> 00:32:50,006
and apologize to them.

398
00:32:50,084 --> 00:32:52,177
Just nowl've become aware
of how cruel I've been to you,

399
00:32:53,021 --> 00:32:54,955
and that I've robbed you
ofthe best years.

400
00:32:57,258 --> 00:32:59,920
I want you to know
that I feel indebted to you.

401
00:33:02,363 --> 00:33:04,194
I want to apologize to you.

402
00:33:04,666 --> 00:33:06,531
Except for money... anything!

403
00:33:08,469 --> 00:33:11,131
I'm glad you feel so worried.

404
00:33:11,639 --> 00:33:14,938
I'm very grateful for your attitude,

405
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:19,308
iùs very nice,
very moving all you've said.

406
00:33:20,682 --> 00:33:24,982
If you really want
to ingratiate yourselfwith Germ·n,

407
00:33:26,054 --> 00:33:28,249
who's been 20 years
without getting out,

408
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:31,988
and consequently, with me, since
I took care ofhim during all that time,

409
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:37,155
if your remorse is so sincere,
I'll ask you for a favor...

410
00:33:38,533 --> 00:33:40,160
A small one.

411
00:33:44,505 --> 00:33:46,302
Stay tonight to take care of my brother.

412
00:33:46,374 --> 00:33:48,171
How's Germ·n?
What does he sufferfrom?

413
00:33:48,242 --> 00:33:50,005
Is it related to all I did to him?

414
00:33:50,078 --> 00:33:52,410
It is. Of course it is.

415
00:33:53,247 --> 00:33:56,045
Anyway,
what he couldn't overcome...

416
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,608
wasn't so much the physical affliction,

417
00:33:58,686 --> 00:34:02,952
but the psychological.

418
00:34:04,192 --> 00:34:06,092
You'll see him,

419
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,558
since you're going
to make me the favor, aren't you?

420
00:34:08,896 --> 00:34:12,263
Sure, man, yes! What time dyou think
you'll be back, approximately?

421
00:34:13,401 --> 00:34:16,893
I don't know...
A movie, a coffee,

422
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,500
see what the night is about,

423
00:34:20,174 --> 00:34:23,940
they say so many things ofthe night,
so many temptations.

424
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,909
Four or five hours, I think...

425
00:34:27,181 --> 00:34:29,115
I want to be sincere.

426
00:34:29,183 --> 00:34:30,878
No, iùs okay.

427
00:34:30,952 --> 00:34:32,943
But please, do have fun!

428
00:35:09,557 --> 00:35:11,957
How do I look?

429
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:17,429
D'you think any chick
will give me a second glance?

430
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,501
Whaùs most important
is what we have inside, friend.

431
00:35:22,103 --> 00:35:23,968
The worid is like a mirror...

432
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:27,974
which reflects
our own image to each of us.

433
00:35:31,445 --> 00:35:34,209
I almost forget...

434
00:35:34,515 --> 00:35:36,449
Twelve o'clock is the time
for his medication.

435
00:35:37,084 --> 00:35:38,346
Don't forget, okay?

436
00:35:38,419 --> 00:35:42,253
And when you enter his room,
just do it quietly, don't be afraid.

437
00:35:42,623 --> 00:35:44,921
I don't think he'll recognize you.

438
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,591
Bye, see you!

439
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:51,430
For me,
iùs been the best time in my life.

440
00:35:51,499 --> 00:35:54,935
I just remember
there was nothing we agreed on.

441
00:35:56,337 --> 00:35:59,204
I liked The Avengers
and you liked Charlie's Angels.

442
00:36:00,274 --> 00:36:02,435
You liked Billy Joel and I hated him.

443
00:36:02,543 --> 00:36:04,943
I still listen to him.

444
00:36:05,012 --> 00:36:06,912
- Really?
- Whaùs wrong with it?

445
00:36:06,981 --> 00:36:09,211
Iùs the same ifl tell you
that my favorite movie is Bambi.

446
00:36:09,283 --> 00:36:10,875
I don't know.
One is supposed to grow, to evolve.

447
00:36:10,952 --> 00:36:13,045
Sorry, but I don't agree.

448
00:36:16,457 --> 00:36:17,583
Howare you?

449
00:36:17,658 --> 00:36:20,525
I'm looking for "Easy to love",
by Ella Fitzgerald.

450
00:36:27,034 --> 00:36:30,492
Here it is, "Easy love",
but here appears as ifby Ray Conniff.

451
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:33,270
No, I said "Easy to love",

452
00:36:33,574 --> 00:36:36,134
by Ella Fitzgerald.
Watch carefully, please.

453
00:36:38,346 --> 00:36:40,246
I hate these supermarkets.

454
00:36:44,252 --> 00:36:47,415
You'll see,
he's about to shake his head.

455
00:36:57,265 --> 00:36:58,664
See?

456
00:37:39,707 --> 00:37:43,244
<i>The best is already over...
The best °s already over...</i>

457
00:37:43,279 --> 00:37:46,645
Here, I've got it.
Iùs in "Ballads".

458
00:37:47,114 --> 00:37:48,342
D'you want it?

459
00:37:55,656 --> 00:37:57,419
Thanks.

460
00:38:00,161 --> 00:38:01,321
What do we do?

461
00:38:01,395 --> 00:38:03,886
Pee. First of all, I need to pee.

462
00:38:13,174 --> 00:38:15,938
You should come to Spain.
You won't pay for anything.

463
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,005
Just the ticket.

464
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,547
I'll take you to my beach house
in Marbella.

465
00:38:21,115 --> 00:38:23,015
Iùs a very posh place,

466
00:38:23,084 --> 00:38:27,077
six rooms, sauna, tennis court...

467
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:30,520
What I do ask you
is that you try to come alone.

468
00:38:31,926 --> 00:38:33,655
You can't imagine
howwinners we're in Spain.

469
00:38:34,161 --> 00:38:36,254
Women get crazy about us.

470
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:39,263
Well, no longer with me,
but ifthey listen to you talking...

471
00:38:39,633 --> 00:38:42,193
Spanish ladies
love our accent very much.

472
00:38:42,269 --> 00:38:45,363
Hey! Leonor,
as you're in the worid of finances,

473
00:38:45,673 --> 00:38:49,905
don't you knowanyone
who wishes to invest money in cinema?

474
00:38:51,045 --> 00:38:52,478
As a matter of fact...

475
00:38:53,214 --> 00:38:56,240
ifthere's something that has nothing
to do with my worid is art...

476
00:38:57,118 --> 00:38:58,551
You don't get me,

477
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:02,521
what I'm asking is
if you want to invest money in my movie.

478
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:05,090
And whaùs your movie about?

479
00:39:07,294 --> 00:39:09,319
I still don't know

480
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,963
Anyway, I can tell you
that I work without a script.

481
00:39:11,998 --> 00:39:14,297
I don't need an instruction manual
to express myself.

482
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,903
My movies shinejust by themselves.

483
00:39:17,038 --> 00:39:20,269
Sorry Alexis,
but if your movies had shined,

484
00:39:20,574 --> 00:39:22,064
they wouldn't have done so badly.

485
00:39:22,143 --> 00:39:24,202
Lfthe audience
is not on a par with my movies,

486
00:39:24,678 --> 00:39:26,373
iùs not my responsibility.

487
00:39:26,547 --> 00:39:28,538
Besides, I won't change
to please the audience.

488
00:39:28,983 --> 00:39:31,178
As for me, fuck the audience!

489
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,450
What I do is different.

490
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:36,186
Iùs the State's responsibility
and not mine...

491
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:39,484
that people dare face my work.
Isn't it?

492
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,654
Lito, the situation must be different
for a professional, no?

493
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:44,591
How's the situation there
for a physicist?

494
00:39:44,665 --> 00:39:46,667
I have a good background to try.

495
00:39:46,702 --> 00:39:48,464
Things are not that easy.

496
00:39:48,536 --> 00:39:51,300
Careful! What I do
is not limited just to research.

497
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,633
I've developed an engine...

498
00:39:54,008 --> 00:39:57,307
thaùs a system oftwo opposed rotors
that operate over a common main shaft.

499
00:39:57,545 --> 00:40:00,036
The main advantage is that it
absolutely lacks of centrifugal force...

500
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:01,910
in the torque box.

501
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:05,482
A cam chain joins both opposed rotors,

502
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:09,212
and this allows the main torque
to turn up without hysteresis.

503
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,890
I give you all these details because it
can be used as a hydroelectric turbine,

504
00:40:12,026 --> 00:40:14,153
and reduces energy cost to half.

505
00:40:14,528 --> 00:40:16,587
Is it clear or not what I mean?

506
00:40:17,598 --> 00:40:19,566
Look, guys,

507
00:40:19,733 --> 00:40:21,928
iùs not that I want to disappoint you,

508
00:40:22,069 --> 00:40:25,197
but ifiùs for employment,
forget about going there.

509
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,974
This fascist of Aznar
has taken his back on immigrants,

510
00:40:28,042 --> 00:40:29,339
and even more with Argentineans.

511
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:32,902
You know, with all this of the default,
we're not at all well considered.

512
00:40:34,982 --> 00:40:37,951
I think, if you allowme the advice,

513
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:40,343
that the action
will not take place in Europe.

514
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,511
You may find it hard to believe,
but I'm one ofthose...

515
00:40:42,756 --> 00:40:45,281
who think that Argentina
has an amazing potential.

516
00:40:45,593 --> 00:40:48,221
Here, all we need
is an ethic revolution.

517
00:40:48,462 --> 00:40:51,363
We have to pull our native wit
and cunning idiosyncrasy to pieces.

518
00:40:52,266 --> 00:40:54,063
We should call a group of notables...

519
00:40:54,135 --> 00:40:55,693
- Like Bioy Casares...
- He died.

520
00:40:56,137 --> 00:40:58,105
- Favaloro.
- He also died.

521
00:40:58,172 --> 00:41:01,266
AlfonsÌn then! No statesman in the worid
can be compared with AlfonsÌn.

522
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:04,010
This country has everything
to be the future potency.

523
00:41:04,078 --> 00:41:05,443
We have everything!

524
00:41:05,513 --> 00:41:09,950
We have minerals!
We have oil! We have food!

525
00:41:10,117 --> 00:41:14,247
We have kilometers
and kilometers of rich soil!

526
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,420
Are you Carlos N˙Òez?

527
00:41:17,091 --> 00:41:18,490
The very same.

528
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,607
I worked foryour bank.

529
00:41:20,642 --> 00:41:22,655
You could have told us!

530
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:32,162
This man,
if we can call him a man,

531
00:41:32,373 --> 00:41:35,274
is the regional manager
ofthe Asturian Bank!

532
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:38,105
This bank is one ofthe banks...

533
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:42,079
that seized the savings
of millions of Argentine citizens!

534
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:46,177
It was yourfault that my daughter
lost everything and left the country!

535
00:41:46,287 --> 00:41:48,653
I wish you the worst, N˙Òez!

536
00:41:49,023 --> 00:41:51,321
I wish you a cancer...

537
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:54,222
that gradually breaks you up,
son of a bitch!

538
00:41:54,295 --> 00:41:56,957
You're a thief, N˙Òez!
Don't let yourselfbe fooled by him!

539
00:41:57,064 --> 00:41:59,191
- Son of a bitch!
- Thief!

540
00:42:03,304 --> 00:42:04,931
I'll be back in a moment.

541
00:42:05,539 --> 00:42:08,133
- D'you have a pen?
- I haven't got one.

542
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:10,342
Hey, you...
A pen, please.

543
00:42:10,377 --> 00:42:12,607
Quickly, a pen, a pen!
Quickly, please!

544
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,478
Thanks.

545
00:42:16,417 --> 00:42:17,907
What are you doing?

546
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:23,181
Afriend comes from abroad.
He seems to be a charming guy.

547
00:42:23,924 --> 00:42:26,119
His friends believe the guy
is worth his weight in gold,

548
00:42:26,193 --> 00:42:29,094
and they don't realize that,
as a matter of fact,

549
00:42:29,196 --> 00:42:31,357
he's responsible
for having taken all their savings,

550
00:42:31,665 --> 00:42:34,600
their marriages, the future
oftheir children. Everything.

551
00:42:34,935 --> 00:42:37,233
It should be a bit exaggerated.

552
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:39,534
Instead of working for a bank,

553
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,999
he could be an emissary ofthe IMF.

554
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:44,633
The thing is that...
that very same night,

555
00:42:44,712 --> 00:42:46,441
his friends decide to kidnap him,

556
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:49,947
and thus, recover all they've lost,
and by the way, take revenge on him.

557
00:42:50,017 --> 00:42:52,212
Isn't it brilliant for a movie?

558
00:42:52,286 --> 00:42:54,345
Iùs a noirfilm,

559
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:57,480
a mixture between Chabrol,
Bresson and Lynch.

560
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:00,024
Iùs obscure, bizarre...

561
00:43:00,127 --> 00:43:02,095
Iùs really bizarre.

562
00:43:07,034 --> 00:43:09,400
Guys, leùs pretend
that nothing has happened here.

563
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:12,200
We won't allowthis fucking crazy woman
to spoil our night.

564
00:43:30,491 --> 00:43:32,015
Disgusting.

565
00:43:35,229 --> 00:43:37,356
Worse than disgusting.

566
00:43:39,133 --> 00:43:40,259
- Come in.
- Where's the bathroom? There?

567
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:42,198
Wait, wait, wait!

568
00:43:43,637 --> 00:43:45,264
Wait a second.

569
00:43:46,173 --> 00:43:48,903
- Come on Guido, it doesn't matter!
- It does matter!

570
00:43:50,177 --> 00:43:52,202
You can go in now.

571
00:44:41,628 --> 00:44:44,028
So, finally you're
what you dreamt about.

572
00:44:44,398 --> 00:44:46,525
Iùs my worst nightmare.

573
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:50,267
Here I see you
with a crowded audience.

574
00:44:51,171 --> 00:44:54,607
Melina, I play at restaurants.
I am a functional musician.

575
00:44:54,742 --> 00:44:56,266
D'you understand?

576
00:45:07,321 --> 00:45:09,118
What am I doing here?

577
00:45:30,544 --> 00:45:32,535
THIS IS YOUR LAST NIGHT

578
00:45:37,418 --> 00:45:39,386
WWACH YOUR BACK

579
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:16,382
PequeÒo...

580
00:47:16,617 --> 00:47:18,209
PequeÒo!

581
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,352
PequeÒo!

582
00:47:27,294 --> 00:47:30,127
Iùs me, Luis MarÌa...

583
00:47:30,297 --> 00:47:32,162
Lacrose, dyou remember?

584
00:47:38,572 --> 00:47:40,972
Keep quiet, PequeÒo! Keep quiet!

585
00:47:41,041 --> 00:47:42,668
Your brother will be here soon,

586
00:47:43,243 --> 00:47:46,235
but be quiet, I'm here.

587
00:47:52,586 --> 00:47:54,952
PequeÒo, keep quiet!
Keep quiet, please!

588
00:47:56,323 --> 00:47:59,292
My God! What I've done to you, PequeÒo!
I never wanted you to be like this!

589
00:48:00,027 --> 00:48:02,154
I was a shit
but I swear I've changed.

590
00:48:02,262 --> 00:48:04,958
You'll notice my change, really.

591
00:48:05,432 --> 00:48:07,400
I've changed.

592
00:48:07,534 --> 00:48:09,161
I won't hurt you!

593
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:12,235
Stop it, you jerk!

594
00:48:15,108 --> 00:48:17,975
Sorry, I didn't mean to call you jerk.

595
00:48:18,612 --> 00:48:21,604
I knowyou hate me.
I knowyou wish I were dead,

596
00:48:22,115 --> 00:48:24,208
and I understand.
You're absolutely right.

597
00:48:25,452 --> 00:48:27,249
I deserve all you wish me.

598
00:48:28,422 --> 00:48:29,980
Even more.

599
00:48:31,458 --> 00:48:34,222
If you want to hit me, just do it.

600
00:48:34,628 --> 00:48:37,188
I promise I'll let you.
Come on! Come on, hit me!

601
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,266
No, but don't be afraid, hit me,

602
00:48:50,577 --> 00:48:52,340
break my face.

603
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:04,853
I'm sorry, PequeÒo.

604
00:49:05,492 --> 00:49:08,222
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

605
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:11,092
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

606
00:49:22,476 --> 00:49:24,410
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

607
00:49:24,611 --> 00:49:26,442
Iùsjust that I can't believe it.

608
00:49:27,948 --> 00:49:30,041
And tell me,
what did your girlfriends say...

609
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:32,209
when they found me there?

610
00:49:32,519 --> 00:49:34,009
Nothing.

611
00:49:34,988 --> 00:49:36,387
I don't believe you.

612
00:49:37,157 --> 00:49:38,522
What would you like to drink?

613
00:49:39,026 --> 00:49:41,119
Did any of them get angry?

614
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:45,057
Any one?

615
00:49:51,004 --> 00:49:53,336
Guido, you aren't lying to me, are you?

616
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:58,336
Wouldn't it be that you had
no girlfriend in all this time?

617
00:50:04,284 --> 00:50:06,013
Iùs that, isn't?

618
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:12,322
I've been the only one.
Yes or no?

619
00:50:13,694 --> 00:50:15,457
Don't get nervous.

620
00:50:16,697 --> 00:50:18,961
Whaùs the problem in telling me
that I've been your only girlfriend?

621
00:50:19,032 --> 00:50:21,125
- Because you weren't.
- Yes, I was.

622
00:50:21,301 --> 00:50:22,427
- You weren't.
- Yes!

623
00:50:22,502 --> 00:50:26,461
- No!
- You got angry, that means I was.

624
00:50:29,543 --> 00:50:30,669
Okay, dyou want to knowthe truth?

625
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:32,036
Yes.

626
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:40,279
Ifl didn't have a girlfriend...

627
00:50:40,554 --> 00:50:42,249
it wasn't because I didn't want.

628
00:50:42,322 --> 00:50:44,222
It was because I couldn't.

629
00:50:44,357 --> 00:50:46,621
Now... D'you want to know
why I couldn't?

630
00:50:48,662 --> 00:50:51,688
Look at me. Would you get out
with someone like this?

631
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,236
And dyou want to know
why I became this?

632
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:01,565
Ah! So you don't want to know...

633
00:51:02,175 --> 00:51:04,302
Twenty years ago
I didn't look like this.

634
00:51:04,678 --> 00:51:07,476
I think you do know very well
that I wasn't like this.

635
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:11,344
What dyou mean?

636
00:51:13,687 --> 00:51:16,315
Anyway, I'm on a diet now

637
00:51:17,057 --> 00:51:19,958
In a year, I'll be the same I was.

638
00:51:21,094 --> 00:51:23,085
D'you want me to believe
that you got fat...

639
00:51:23,196 --> 00:51:25,426
because I left you 20 years ago?

640
00:51:26,032 --> 00:51:28,500
- I didn't say that.
- You're reproaching me.

641
00:51:28,969 --> 00:51:30,459
Forget what I've told you.

642
00:51:30,704 --> 00:51:32,968
I don't even remember
howl got here.

643
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,443
It was gradual.

644
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:43,511
Gradually, I was getting fat outside...

645
00:51:44,651 --> 00:51:46,619
and gradually I was thinning inside.

646
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:50,422
I got so thin inside that...

647
00:51:51,491 --> 00:51:53,550
Any time I'm introduced a girl,

648
00:51:54,161 --> 00:51:56,425
I feel hair will growin my nose,

649
00:51:57,097 --> 00:51:59,657
that my teeth
will become full of parsley,

650
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:04,098
that ifl speak,
my voice will be shrill...

651
00:52:04,171 --> 00:52:06,230
or my tongue will twist,

652
00:52:07,507 --> 00:52:10,340
orthat my belly
will start to make noises.

653
00:52:10,477 --> 00:52:12,206
I have such a bad time...

654
00:52:13,947 --> 00:52:17,246
that I asked my friends
not to introduce me to anyone else,

655
00:52:17,918 --> 00:52:20,648
- and thaùs it.
- And how dyou manage with sex?

656
00:52:21,421 --> 00:52:24,083
Whaùs this?
An interpellation, Your Honor?

657
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:26,552
Iùs that it surprises me.

658
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:29,092
Really, how dyou manage?

659
00:52:34,534 --> 00:52:36,126
I pay.

660
00:52:37,037 --> 00:52:38,595
Howawful!

661
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:41,969
Melina. Ifl don't pay,
who'd like to go to bed with me?

662
00:52:43,143 --> 00:52:46,078
I know some friends of Eduardo...

663
00:52:46,146 --> 00:52:47,943
uglier than you,
who are engaged with somebody.

664
00:52:48,014 --> 00:52:49,311
Thanks, Melina.
Do I call foryour radio taxi?

665
00:52:49,382 --> 00:52:52,943
No, I meant fatter than you,
and are engaged.

666
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:56,385
Buy dyou know?
They don't care, they laugh at that.

667
00:52:56,456 --> 00:52:59,584
- They laugh because they have money.
- Don't think they have much.

668
00:53:01,194 --> 00:53:02,957
Look Melina, I prefer to be alone.

669
00:53:03,163 --> 00:53:04,630
I have a good time.

670
00:53:04,898 --> 00:53:07,958
Besides, I know of
any inspiring couple relation.

671
00:53:09,636 --> 00:53:11,467
Mine is not bad.

672
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:15,169
"Iùs no bad",
with that is enough!

673
00:53:16,243 --> 00:53:19,474
I love Edu,
but iùs another kind oflove.

674
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:24,339
Eduardo's an excellent father,
a great supplier.

675
00:53:24,918 --> 00:53:26,909
So did you marry Wal Mart?

676
00:53:29,189 --> 00:53:33,057
He has other ways
to demonstrate love...

677
00:53:34,327 --> 00:53:36,158
He wears himself out working...

678
00:53:36,263 --> 00:53:38,595
so that Lari and I
can have everything.

679
00:53:39,566 --> 00:53:42,160
I appreciate all that sacrifice.

680
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:47,138
I don't expect him to bring me flowers,

681
00:53:48,008 --> 00:53:52,069
as for him to bring his salary
is more or less the same.

682
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:57,314
Melina, thaùs not love.

683
00:53:58,018 --> 00:53:59,508
Thaùs habit.

684
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:02,884
What dyou knowabout love?

685
00:54:03,023 --> 00:54:05,992
Maybe nothing.
But the day I find someone,

686
00:54:06,359 --> 00:54:09,453
I'll feel love and not resignation.

687
00:54:09,696 --> 00:54:12,290
- I feel love.
- I don't think so.

688
00:54:12,699 --> 00:54:15,259
- What dyou knowwhat I feel?
- That you aren't happy.

689
00:54:15,368 --> 00:54:17,359
- I am happy.
- I don't think so.

690
00:54:18,972 --> 00:54:20,098
And you?

691
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,307
Mister "iùsgoddamnedworhtliving",
are you happy?

692
00:54:23,376 --> 00:54:26,209
No. But I'm not telling everybody
that I am...

693
00:54:26,313 --> 00:54:28,304
by showing the picture of a daughter.

694
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:31,447
No Meli, no!

695
00:54:32,085 --> 00:54:33,609
Stop, stop!

696
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:39,958
Hey! That story
you were telling me about...

697
00:54:41,161 --> 00:54:42,253
Which ofthem?

698
00:54:42,329 --> 00:54:44,422
The one about the film that came
to your mind at the grill restaurant...

699
00:54:44,631 --> 00:54:47,429
- Yes. What about it?
- How do they handle the deal?

700
00:54:49,002 --> 00:54:51,334
What dyou mean
by how do they handle the deal?

701
00:54:51,404 --> 00:54:53,304
Sure. Are they barefaced?

702
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,670
They should use hoods.

703
00:54:55,976 --> 00:54:57,375
If not, they're two idiots.

704
00:54:57,444 --> 00:54:59,469
Maybe they could cover his face.

705
00:55:00,013 --> 00:55:01,446
With ajacket, for example.

706
00:55:01,514 --> 00:55:04,449
I think they should wear hoods
or women panty hoses.

707
00:55:05,151 --> 00:55:06,846
Thaùs silly.

708
00:55:07,287 --> 00:55:09,278
The one who should wear a hood
is the Galician.

709
00:55:09,689 --> 00:55:12,123
The victim must never know
the place where he'll be kept.

710
00:55:12,192 --> 00:55:13,591
Okay, okay, okay...

711
00:55:14,995 --> 00:55:16,155
When the Galician least suspects,

712
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:18,459
they cover his face with ajacket,

713
00:55:18,598 --> 00:55:21,294
thread it into a knot with the sleeves
and threaten:

714
00:55:21,601 --> 00:55:24,536
"You take it off, and we'll kill you".

715
00:55:51,464 --> 00:55:53,557
<i>As to my l°ved exper°ences,</i>

716
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,930
<i>I always have the fondest memories,</i>

717
00:55:56,069 --> 00:55:58,094
<i>my emot°on doesn'tforget them,</i>

718
00:55:58,171 --> 00:56:01,106
<i>t°me goes by and I remember even more.</i>

719
00:56:01,408 --> 00:56:05,003
<i>Three fr°ends, we were always,</i>

720
00:56:05,245 --> 00:56:08,078
<i>during that pastyouth...</i>

721
00:56:09,315 --> 00:56:11,579
<i>It was the mostfamous trÌo...</i>

722
00:56:11,651 --> 00:56:13,414
<i>that could have walked...</i>

723
00:56:13,486 --> 00:56:16,080
<i>those south streets.</i>

724
00:56:17,023 --> 00:56:20,254
<i>Where are you, Pancho Als°na?</i>

725
00:56:20,994 --> 00:56:24,486
<i>Where are you, Balmaceda?</i>

726
00:56:25,031 --> 00:56:28,364
<i>I wa°tforyou on the corner...</i>

727
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:31,994
<i>of Su·rez y Necochea.</i>

728
00:56:32,072 --> 00:56:35,872
<i>Today, none of you come to my call.</i>

729
00:56:36,009 --> 00:56:39,604
<i>Already my l°fe goes off at a tangent.</i>

730
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:43,376
<i>Today, the old guard shouts:</i>

731
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:47,442
<i>Who has d°spersed that trÌo?</i>

732
00:56:48,688 --> 00:56:52,351
<i>But I st°ll rememberyou,</i>

733
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:56,260
<i>my two fr°ends of the past...
- Look at Leonor...</i>

734
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:58,593
She's deeply moved.

735
00:57:04,237 --> 00:57:06,535
Hurrah! Hurrah!

736
00:57:09,943 --> 00:57:11,342
Master, please...

737
00:57:24,624 --> 00:57:25,989
Master...

738
00:57:26,292 --> 00:57:28,089
Is that you?

739
00:57:30,563 --> 00:57:32,258
Excuse me, master...

740
00:57:32,565 --> 00:57:35,668
I don't pretend to be a flatterer,
but you're really unique!

741
00:57:35,703 --> 00:57:37,397
You're more than unique,

742
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:39,528
you're a genius!

743
00:57:42,675 --> 00:57:45,200
Don't pull my leg, boy!

744
00:57:46,346 --> 00:57:48,143
I swear I'm not kidding.

745
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:50,444
You've made me feel as nobody else has.
You're a milestone in my life.

746
00:57:50,517 --> 00:57:52,348
I'd like to thank you
for what you've done for me.

747
00:57:52,418 --> 00:57:54,283
Charge it to his table.

748
00:57:54,354 --> 00:57:56,618
Iùs been years since I have experienced
what you made me feel.

749
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:59,218
Juan!

750
00:58:04,531 --> 00:58:06,362
Just ten pesos.

751
00:58:06,432 --> 00:58:09,299
- Sorry, ten what?
- Just ten euros.

752
00:58:23,483 --> 00:58:26,316
Listen, Master,
I don't want to be inopportune.

753
00:58:27,487 --> 00:58:30,979
But I'd really like to knowhow can I
thank you for what you've done for me.

754
00:58:31,057 --> 00:58:33,355
And what fucking thing
have I done foryou, boy?

755
00:58:33,526 --> 00:58:35,551
You've been real close
of making me cry.

756
00:58:45,238 --> 00:58:47,297
Just a second, just a second!

757
00:58:47,507 --> 00:58:51,273
Here it is! Here it is!

758
00:59:46,065 --> 00:59:48,056
<i>A warrior of the l°ght,</i>

759
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:51,500
<i>when he beg°ns someth°ng,
he gets to the end.</i>

760
00:59:51,571 --> 00:59:53,971
<i>Putyour hands to work, Lu°s!</i>

761
00:59:56,609 --> 00:59:58,201
Meli...

762
01:00:00,913 --> 01:00:02,642
Meli, are you okay?

763
01:00:03,616 --> 01:00:06,449
<i>Who am I to tell you
thatyou're not happy?</i>

764
01:00:07,086 --> 01:00:08,246
Anyway,

765
01:00:08,621 --> 01:00:11,181
if you don't want to forgive me,
I understand.

766
01:00:11,457 --> 01:00:15,188
But if you do want to forgive me,

767
01:00:16,329 --> 01:00:19,355
it would be better you do it right now,

768
01:00:20,667 --> 01:00:23,431
because we won't meet
till next school meeting.

769
01:00:23,503 --> 01:00:25,095
D'you understand?

770
01:02:28,227 --> 01:02:30,127
<i>Can you call a tax°for me?</i>

771
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:36,628
Or I'll call to the one I know.

772
01:02:37,203 --> 01:02:40,695
Valdemar, affectionately...

773
01:02:40,973 --> 01:02:43,032
- Whaùs your name, boy?
- Carlos N˙Òez.

774
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:44,700
Lito for my friends.

775
01:02:44,977 --> 01:02:47,138
Lito, man...

776
01:02:47,947 --> 01:02:49,437
There you go.

777
01:02:50,650 --> 01:02:53,915
- How can I thank you forthis?
- Iùs 30.

778
01:02:53,986 --> 01:02:57,615
- Thirty tangos!
- Euros, boy... euros!

779
01:03:06,432 --> 01:03:08,266
- Hey...
- What?

780
01:03:08,301 --> 01:03:10,098
And where do they keep the Galician?

781
01:03:13,473 --> 01:03:15,424
Whaùs up?
D'you want to become a scripter now?

782
01:03:15,459 --> 01:03:17,375
You didn't answer me.
Where do they hinder him?

783
01:03:17,443 --> 01:03:20,412
In an apartment in Mar del Plata.

784
01:03:21,314 --> 01:03:23,339
In winter, iùs a ghost city.

785
01:03:23,483 --> 01:03:25,280
- Iùs brilliant!
- You're crazy.

786
01:03:25,351 --> 01:03:27,285
I can't involve my wife in this!

787
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:29,115
What dyou mean by "this"?

788
01:03:29,322 --> 01:03:31,517
You knowthat apartment
is my wife's.

789
01:03:32,291 --> 01:03:34,885
Wait, madman!

790
01:03:34,961 --> 01:03:37,953
Iùs a script for a movie.

791
01:03:38,631 --> 01:03:42,089
She can't get angry because I include
something ofher in my script.

792
01:03:43,269 --> 01:03:44,964
Don't pretend to be stupid.

793
01:03:46,305 --> 01:03:47,704
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

794
01:03:47,974 --> 01:03:49,441
Be smart, Alexis.

795
01:03:49,509 --> 01:03:52,410
I'm fed up with your "be smart".
What dyou mean by "be smart"?

796
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:15,400
<i>Okay, she's go°ng.</i>

797
01:04:23,342 --> 01:04:25,139
Is the door open downstairs?

798
01:04:25,444 --> 01:04:27,002
Yes.

799
01:04:31,217 --> 01:04:32,878
Bye!

800
01:06:12,084 --> 01:06:13,517
<i>Keep calm, Lu°s.</i>

801
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:18,113
<i>A warrior of the l°ght
does not l°sten to provocat°ons.</i>

802
01:06:52,124 --> 01:06:54,524
- He's a friend, Franco...
- Friend?

803
01:06:55,061 --> 01:06:57,586
He's the one who ripped us off
ofthe little dough we had in the bank.

804
01:06:58,664 --> 01:07:00,529
Don't feel pity for him, Alexis.

805
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:02,362
He doesn't deserve it.

806
01:07:03,135 --> 01:07:05,069
Iùs time to cash it.

807
01:07:05,471 --> 01:07:07,632
Destiny handed him to us on a platter.

808
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:10,910
Beatricce told us
when she read his palms.

809
01:07:10,945 --> 01:07:12,400
Sorry,

810
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:15,605
but I'm an artist, not a criminal.

811
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:18,147
Not even you believe that.

812
01:07:19,952 --> 01:07:21,647
I knowwell what I am.

813
01:07:24,390 --> 01:07:26,358
I open the papers
and find no news on you.

814
01:07:26,659 --> 01:07:28,286
I look at the covers
of show supplements...

815
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:30,191
and your picture's neverthere.

816
01:07:30,696 --> 01:07:33,187
Some time ago, on TV, they were talking
about the new Argentine cinema...

817
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:36,264
and I thought: Now, they will surely
mention my friend, but nothing...

818
01:07:37,703 --> 01:07:41,537
They talked about Caetano,
Burman, Trapero, Martel...

819
01:07:42,208 --> 01:07:44,005
They never mentioned your name.

820
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:47,044
D'you want me to tell you
howl predict yourfuture?

821
01:07:47,179 --> 01:07:48,942
In a year, you'll give up the cinema.

822
01:07:49,248 --> 01:07:51,910
Rather, you've already given it up.
The point is that you didn't realize it.

823
01:07:51,984 --> 01:07:53,246
Who's going to invest money in you?

824
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:55,184
Howmuch money your last movie made?

825
01:07:55,254 --> 01:07:57,085
Howlarge was the audience?

826
01:07:57,456 --> 01:07:59,890
What the hell dyou know
of cinema business?

827
01:08:00,259 --> 01:08:01,886
Nobody will risk dough on you, dear.

828
01:08:01,961 --> 01:08:04,987
Here the only one who can invest
money on your movie is yourself,

829
01:08:05,231 --> 01:08:08,223
and as far as I know,
you'll never be able to afford it,

830
01:08:09,034 --> 01:08:11,264
except that tonight
we do something...

831
01:08:17,910 --> 01:08:19,844
Howmuch will you ask?

832
01:08:25,251 --> 01:08:26,878
Have you decided?

833
01:08:27,419 --> 01:08:30,479
We've been driving around for 5 minutes
and you don't say where we're going.

834
01:08:32,324 --> 01:08:33,882
Did you hear me?

835
01:09:06,859 --> 01:09:09,953
I'm thinking over and over
about coming back.

836
01:09:11,363 --> 01:09:13,991
Leave everything and get back here.

837
01:09:16,468 --> 01:09:18,368
Maybe here...

838
01:09:18,437 --> 01:09:20,234
I could be myself again.

839
01:09:21,006 --> 01:09:24,407
Maybe I could have feelings again.

840
01:09:25,945 --> 01:09:27,537
In fact, just tonight
I've felt more sensations...

841
01:09:27,613 --> 01:09:30,138
than in all past seventeen years.

842
01:09:30,449 --> 01:09:33,247
D'you see those two guys?
Last time I cried, they were with me.

843
01:09:33,352 --> 01:09:36,583
In 1985, when they came
to see me off at the airport.

844
01:09:38,023 --> 01:09:39,888
Here, people still kiss each other.

845
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:43,422
They feel, they hug.

846
01:09:45,664 --> 01:09:48,599
Here, one walks on the streets
and feels vertigo.

847
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:51,668
Here, you get splashed
from the loose tiles of sidewalks.

848
01:09:51,937 --> 01:09:54,167
I love that.
I love when loose tiles splash.

849
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:58,940
In Europe,
everything is too well done.

850
01:10:01,013 --> 01:10:03,345
Your Argentina of caramel...

851
01:10:03,649 --> 01:10:06,413
doesn't longer exist, boy...

852
01:10:17,963 --> 01:10:19,954
Ladies and gentleman...

853
01:10:22,735 --> 01:10:26,967
I have just had a close encounter
ofthe third kind...

854
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:30,631
Don't laugh. Iùs real.

855
01:10:31,210 --> 01:10:33,371
I met a Martian who told me...

856
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:36,414
that this is the best country
of the worid.

857
01:10:38,017 --> 01:10:41,043
The Martian says
he likes Argentina very much...

858
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:44,351
because here the people
kiss one each other.

859
01:10:45,090 --> 01:10:48,685
Hug one each other.
Feel one each other.

860
01:10:51,697 --> 01:10:55,326
Other ofthe things this Martian loves
are the loose tiles ofthe sidewalks.

861
01:10:55,734 --> 01:10:58,066
He likes their splashing.

862
01:10:59,271 --> 01:11:03,139
Itjust remained he told me he likes
AlfonsÌn and that capped it all...

863
01:11:27,132 --> 01:11:29,123
Isn't it time
you leave forthe airport?

864
01:11:35,574 --> 01:11:36,973
Leùs go.

865
01:11:38,177 --> 01:11:41,271
Oh! The camera!

866
01:11:42,181 --> 01:11:43,614
I've left the compact...

867
01:11:44,016 --> 01:11:45,608
D'you want me to bring it to you?

868
01:11:55,961 --> 01:11:57,929
Do I call for an ambulance?

869
01:11:58,030 --> 01:11:59,520
No. Go on, go on.

870
01:12:13,278 --> 01:12:17,544
<i>In the e°ght month you laugh
w°th f°ve lemon blossoms,</i>

871
01:12:18,183 --> 01:12:22,119
<i>w°th f°ve l°ttle feroc°t°es...</i>

872
01:12:22,988 --> 01:12:24,922
<i>Sleep l°ttle boy,</i>

873
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:27,356
<i>that I'll br°ng you the moon...</i>

874
01:12:27,426 --> 01:12:30,327
<i>when °ùs needed...
- Dummy!</i>

875
01:12:32,364 --> 01:12:35,424
Where have you put your dummy, baby?

876
01:12:36,101 --> 01:12:37,625
Little box,

877
01:12:38,303 --> 01:12:40,271
Dummy... little box.

878
01:12:53,118 --> 01:12:55,109
Here's the dummy.

879
01:14:28,647 --> 01:14:30,274
Don't let me down.

880
01:14:39,057 --> 01:14:40,581
Take good care of yourself, friend.

881
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,264
Everything's going to be okay,
dyou understand?

882
01:14:50,335 --> 01:14:52,303
- Okay...
- Okay.

883
01:14:58,977 --> 01:15:00,444
Listen, Franquito.

884
01:15:00,512 --> 01:15:02,309
Thanks for everything.

885
01:15:02,981 --> 01:15:05,040
- Don't look
- You either.

886
01:15:09,955 --> 01:15:12,355
If you don't let me see your belly,
I'll showyou nothing.

887
01:15:12,424 --> 01:15:14,654
- First, you showme.
- No, you first.

888
01:15:16,061 --> 01:15:17,892
Well, I have an idea.

889
01:15:18,063 --> 01:15:20,258
We count up to three and we show
each other everything at the same time.

890
01:15:20,365 --> 01:15:22,458
- Okay?
- Yeah.

891
01:15:22,901 --> 01:15:24,368
One...

892
01:15:24,670 --> 01:15:26,262
Two...

893
01:15:27,339 --> 01:15:28,636
Three!

894
01:15:30,108 --> 01:15:32,542
No...

895
01:16:09,014 --> 01:16:10,914
- Are you crazy?
- No...

896
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:13,884
Get a rubber right now.

897
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:19,055
I suppose you have...

898
01:16:19,625 --> 01:16:21,320
<i>Alex°s...</i>

899
01:16:21,393 --> 01:16:23,224
I didn't want to say anything
in the presence of Franco,

900
01:16:23,328 --> 01:16:26,024
because you know
howproud and stubborn he is.

901
01:16:27,032 --> 01:16:30,524
I thought maybe you could understand me
and at the same time, help me.

902
01:16:32,537 --> 01:16:35,472
I've seen he's very bad, very blue...

903
01:16:36,642 --> 01:16:38,303
Okay, leùs don't go deeper.

904
01:16:39,244 --> 01:16:41,212
The thing is that, as a friend,
I feel indebted.

905
01:16:41,947 --> 01:16:44,415
I knowthere's nothing better
than the physical presence,

906
01:16:44,616 --> 01:16:47,210
the hug, the comforting word.

907
01:16:47,386 --> 01:16:49,217
But being ten thousand kilometers away,

908
01:16:49,288 --> 01:16:51,256
what can I do for my friends?

909
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:54,215
I thought that maybe
you and Franco...

910
01:16:54,359 --> 01:16:57,260
could accept,
from a distant friend,

911
01:16:57,629 --> 01:17:00,462
a kind of help, minimum, symbolic,

912
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,027
but which surely alleviates.

913
01:17:04,169 --> 01:17:06,296
I mean, I was thinking...

914
01:17:06,405 --> 01:17:09,272
of an amount oftwo thousand dollars.

915
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:15,036
But these are from the Asturian Bank.
Who will cash them?

916
01:17:15,113 --> 01:17:17,047
- Are you kidding?
- Jeez! You're right!

917
01:17:17,115 --> 01:17:19,515
But I can solve this immediately!

918
01:17:26,091 --> 01:17:28,525
I give you my word that no later
than tomorrow... right today!

919
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:31,986
Before leaving, I'll send
a message to the accountant...

920
01:17:32,130 --> 01:17:35,065
telling him to give you
the money in cash. I swear.

921
01:17:46,244 --> 01:17:48,144
Tell me something, Leonor...

922
01:17:48,613 --> 01:17:51,480
Did you do anything
to make your dream come true?

923
01:17:52,484 --> 01:17:55,942
Sons of bitches like me
don't have dreams,

924
01:17:56,254 --> 01:17:59,223
we have objectives.
Well specific and profitable.

925
01:18:01,093 --> 01:18:03,459
- Then, I must be a son of a bitch.
- What are you talking about?

926
01:18:10,302 --> 01:18:12,361
Someday, you'll realize.

927
01:18:34,259 --> 01:18:37,490
Ouch, my hand!

928
01:18:37,996 --> 01:18:39,930
Ouch, shit!

929
01:18:39,998 --> 01:18:41,556
What a fucking tile!

930
01:18:45,504 --> 01:18:48,439
Iùs not what you think!

931
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:52,203
I knewyou were up to something.
I've been suspecting.

932
01:18:54,112 --> 01:18:56,205
I knewyou wouldn't let me
go by myselfto the airport!

933
01:18:56,314 --> 01:18:59,181
Howmuch I love you, damn it!

934
01:19:38,423 --> 01:19:41,051
TODAY IS YOUR LAST NIGHT

935
01:19:41,126 --> 01:19:43,924
IT'S BEEN A MISTAKE
NOTTO LETME CHEATATTHE EXAM

936
01:19:43,995 --> 01:19:46,395
WATCH YOUR BACK!

937
01:19:56,107 --> 01:19:57,540
<i>- Hello!
- No t°me left, °ùs urgent,</i>

938
01:19:57,609 --> 01:20:00,043

01:20:02,981 --> 01:20:05,643
<i>9 to the r°ght three t°mes,
3 to the right tw°ce.</i>

941
01:20:06,184 --> 01:20:08,175
<i>Go to my bedroom
and look beh°nd Grac°ela Alfano.</i>

942
01:20:08,253 --> 01:20:09,880
<i>You'll f°nd everyth°ng beh°nd her.</i>

943
01:20:10,055 --> 01:20:12,922
<i>There you'll f°nd enough money
for Germ·n's ma°ntenance,</i>

944
01:20:13,158 --> 01:20:15,388
<i>to afford your costs
and even to treatyourself somet°mes.</i>

945
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:17,357
As you see, I'm not coming back.

946
01:20:17,429 --> 01:20:19,056
Don't misjudge me.

947
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:22,496
Stop, stop dude,
what is it that you're not coming back?

948
01:20:22,567 --> 01:20:25,468
Except for money... anything!
Or have you already forgotten?

949
01:20:25,537 --> 01:20:28,472
Be good, Luis.
Be good this time.

950
01:20:28,540 --> 01:20:31,600
Stop dude, listen to me,
just one thing!

951
01:20:31,743 --> 01:20:34,405
I'm not obliged
to assume this responsibility, man!

952
01:20:53,465 --> 01:20:55,626
<i>What a glor°ous n°ght...</i>

953
01:20:55,734 --> 01:20:57,531
<i>W°ll she be feel°ng the same?</i>

954
01:20:57,769 --> 01:21:01,136
<i>Maybe not, maybe she's happy,
maybe everyth°ng's okay °n her marr°age.</i>

955
01:21:01,206 --> 01:21:03,902
<i>Iùs been long s°nce I've felt so well.</i>

956
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:06,369
<i>Maybe Gu°do's right.</i>

957
01:21:07,045 --> 01:21:09,013
<i>Maybe I'm not happy.</i>

958
01:21:09,147 --> 01:21:11,672
<i>But °f she's happy,
why °s she w°th me ton°ght?</i>

959
01:21:12,284 --> 01:21:14,115
<i>Maybe she st°ll loves me.</i>

960
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:16,615
<i>Bah! Iùs °mposs°ble
she could love me.</i>

961
01:21:17,188 --> 01:21:20,385
<i>Maybe Gu°do °s much more
than a teenager boyfriend.</i>

962
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:22,889
<i>Maybe... I st°ll love h°m.</i>

963
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:25,255
<i>Maybe, he also st°ll loves me.</i>

964
01:21:25,597 --> 01:21:28,031
<i>If she st°ll loved me,
she would have told me.</i>

965
01:21:29,067 --> 01:21:31,433
<i>But °f he st°ll loves me,
why d°dn't he tell me?</i>

966
01:21:31,536 --> 01:21:34,334
<i>But she's the love of my l°fe,
and I d°dn't tell her, e°ther.</i>

967
01:21:35,974 --> 01:21:39,466
<i>Maybe, he d°dn't tell me because
he's afra°d that I don't feel the same.</i>

968
01:21:40,345 --> 01:21:42,540
<i>As soon as I get there,
I'm go°ng to tell her the truth.</i>

969
01:21:44,482 --> 01:21:46,279
<i>That I'm not happy.</i>

970
01:21:46,952 --> 01:21:49,648
<i>Thatfrom now on,
I feel l°ke wak°ng up °n the morn°ng.</i>

971
01:21:50,488 --> 01:21:52,456
<i>That we're t°me proof.</i>

972
01:21:53,625 --> 01:21:56,185
<i>Thatfor her,
I will lose twenty thousand k°los.</i>

973
01:21:57,262 --> 01:22:00,891
<i>That w°th h°m by my s°de,
I'll be happy.</i>

974
01:23:20,245 --> 01:23:23,009
<i>A warrior of the l°ght °s rel°able.</i>

975
01:23:23,214 --> 01:23:26,240
<i>A warrior of the l°ght
may make a m°stake somet°mes.</i>

976
01:23:26,317 --> 01:23:29,184
<i>A warrior of the l°ght
does not comm°t treason.</i>

977
01:23:29,954 --> 01:23:32,650
<i>A warrior of the l°ght
adapts to the c°rcumstances.</i>

978
01:23:33,058 --> 01:23:36,960
<i>A warrior of the l°ght
always holds the hand of h°s ·ngel.</i>

979
01:23:37,028 --> 01:23:39,360
<i>A warrior of the l°ght
deserves a reward.</i>

980
01:23:39,464 --> 01:23:42,228
<i>A warrior of the l°ght does not rob.</i>

981
01:23:42,534 --> 01:23:45,469
<i>A warrior of the l°ght
pays h°s apartment charges.</i>

982
01:24:01,252 --> 01:24:04,278
Men, what a night we've had.

983
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:07,383
- D'you have e-mail?
- D'you have anything to write it down?

984
01:24:13,231 --> 01:24:16,530
Soyfranco@hotmail.com

985
01:24:17,102 --> 01:24:20,333
yobrillo@hotmail.com

986
01:24:22,173 --> 01:24:24,232
Great, I'll write...

987
01:24:24,542 --> 01:24:26,476
and you'll get my e-mail address.

988
01:24:27,412 --> 01:24:29,607
Well, iùs time...

989
01:24:33,585 --> 01:24:36,383
Have that wrist examined, to check
if you've really broken it, okay?

990
01:24:39,657 --> 01:24:43,149
Today, they'll take you the dough.
See howyou tell this to Franquito.

991
01:25:00,278 --> 01:25:02,041
What a disaster...

992
01:25:02,947 --> 01:25:04,437
Look at the positive side ofthe night...

993
01:25:04,516 --> 01:25:06,882
We made a brilliant image
with the guy.

994
01:25:34,679 --> 01:25:36,579
Did you have a good time?

995
01:27:03,468 --> 01:27:05,902
<i>Anton°o Banderas as Leonor,</i>

996
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:09,201
<i>Pabl°to Echarri as me
and the lame Suarfor Franqu°to.</i>

997
01:27:09,941 --> 01:27:12,068
<i>Maybe he even produces °t.</i>

998
01:27:12,510 --> 01:27:15,911
<i>What °f °nstead of k°dnapp°ng a male
fr°end they k°dnap a female friend?</i>

999
01:27:16,447 --> 01:27:18,506
<i>Sure, as the fat woman
from the Internat°onal Monetary Fund,</i>

1000
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:20,208
<i>but pretty.</i>

1001
01:27:20,518 --> 01:27:23,248
<i>Aracel°would be su°table
for that role.</i>

1002
01:27:23,588 --> 01:27:26,386
<i>Bes°des, everybody wants to see her
engaged w°th Adri·n aga°n.</i>

1003
01:27:27,959 --> 01:27:31,258
<i>I'll get an aud°ence of 100,000 people
at the f°rst weekend show.</i>

1004
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:33,327
<i>Th°s t°me, °ùll be a h°t.</i>

1005
01:27:33,498 --> 01:27:35,329
<i>Iùll be a h°t!</i>

1006
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:37,295
Everything must have to be done
very quickly.

1007
01:27:37,368 --> 01:27:39,336
When he takes me home,

1008
01:27:40,605 --> 01:27:42,596
I'll ask him to accompany me
to the door,

1009
01:27:42,707 --> 01:27:45,107
and he'll certainly do so
because he loves kissing...

1010
01:27:45,310 --> 01:27:48,006
in such a disgusting and filthy way.

1011
01:27:49,213 --> 01:27:51,204
Well, I enter into my apartment,

1012
01:27:52,116 --> 01:27:54,550
I close the door
and he gets back to the car.

1013
01:27:54,619 --> 01:27:56,280
There you showup,

1014
01:27:56,354 --> 01:27:59,380
and cover his head with thejacket,
thread it into a knot with the sleeves,

1015
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:02,023
and I get out to help.

1016
01:28:02,994 --> 01:28:06,225
<i>Then, to the trunk, to your house,
keys, Mar del Plata, and next.</i>

1017
01:28:07,565 --> 01:28:09,362
<i>Isn't °t br°ll°ant?</i>

1018
01:28:09,634 --> 01:28:12,000
<i>One further po°nt...
When you talk to h°s w°fe,</i>

1019
01:28:12,103 --> 01:28:14,094
<i>you'll tell her not to even th°nk
of a bank draft.</i>

1020
01:28:15,006 --> 01:28:16,564
<i>You'll tell her to send the money...</i>

1021
01:28:16,641 --> 01:28:20,133
<i>by Federal, °n l°ttle rolls...</i>

1022
01:28:20,945 --> 01:28:22,606
<i>and °ns°de three v°deotapes.</i>

1023
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,279
<i>How dyou know he's marr°ed?</i>

1024
01:28:24,482 --> 01:28:27,280
<i>When he opened h°s wallet I saw
the p°cture of h°s w°fe and k°d.</i>

1025
01:28:29,153 --> 01:28:30,882
<i>Leùs hope they love h°m.</i>

1026
01:28:31,022 --> 01:28:32,853
<i>Leùs hope they love h°m,</i>

1027
01:28:34,459 --> 01:28:36,222
<i>and very much.</i>

1028
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:30,000
