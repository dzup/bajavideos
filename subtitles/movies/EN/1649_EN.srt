{2487}{2552}COMMON WEALTH
{5081}{5155}I heard you.|You have a job in a disco.
{5159}{5216}Doing what, the accounting?
{5225}{5255}The door?
{5267}{5350}As a bouncer? Are you nuts?|You could get killed!
{5363}{5420}Tell me about it later.
{5429}{5509}Don't get angry.|You just never stop calling me.
{5513}{5563}I'm sorry. Yes.
{5567}{5619}Yes, I love you a lot.
{5626}{5719}I'm nervous about the flat.|I haven't sold a single one.
{5723}{5798}Yes, it started well,|but after that...
{5822}{5925}Also, some clients have been|waiting for me
{5929}{6008}for a half hour|in this freezing weather.
{6012}{6117}It's pouring and I'm dressed up.|You're lucky.
{6126}{6185}You can wear|a jogging suit to work.
{6217}{6255}What? A tuxedo?
{6271}{6354}You had to rent one?|Are you crazy or what?
{6363}{6416}They have to pay for that.
{6425}{6497}You think firemen|buy their helmets?
{6507}{6603}We'll talk about it later.|Okay, honey.
{6620}{6662}I love you a lot!
{6667}{6714}Yes, bye.
{6719}{6765}He's such a pain!
{7025}{7072}Luis?|Julia, from the agency.
{7076}{7138}Excuse me, I was|talking to a client
{7142}{7231}who's interested in this flat.|Did I say it was amazing?
{7255}{7304}- Yes, you did.|- On the phone.
{7469}{7568}Well, well, well.|Here are the super-advantages.
{7572}{7641}One, near the subway.|Two, downtown.
{7645}{7712}Three, there are schools|for the kids,
{7716}{7782}and four, parks|where they can play.
{7786}{7855}- We don't have kids.|- You don't? Good.
{7859}{7965}Me neither. It leaves you free to go|to the movies or to a bingo parlor.
{7969}{8046}I don't play bingo,|it was just an example.
{8050}{8115}You can walk|anywhere from here.
{8119}{8186}- So there's no garage?|- No.
{8190}{8236}There's no... garage.
{8276}{8310}Let's see.
{8318}{8374}This is it. By the way,
{8378}{8417}I wanted to warn you
{8421}{8530}that these old flats usually|have old furniture
{8539}{8570}and that funny
{8574}{8616}seventies wallpaper...
{8626}{8674}I can imagine it. Let's go.
{8678}{8772}That's what I mean, you have|to use your imagination.
{8776}{8814}They usually belong
{8818}{8909}to elderly people.|Sometimes they smell bad...
{8998}{9062}But not in this case.|Look at that.
{9086}{9122}This is your typical
{9126}{9203}amazing flat, period.|It's what we call
{9207}{9271}"ready to live in".|And it's completely furnished.
{9275}{9365}It has pictures, lamps,|a TV, a radio,
{9369}{9431}a sofa...|I think it's a sofa bed.
{9435}{9511}No, it's a sofa sofa,|and a good one.
{9519}{9555}This looks like leather.
{9581}{9674}High-quality! Not like mine,|which is like a beach chair.
{9706}{9770}Every time I show|someone this flat,
{9775}{9815}I want it for myself.
{9821}{9919}Though to each his own|and I won't pressure you.
{9923}{9965}- The owner lives here?|- The owner?
{9969}{10057}What owner? I don't think so.|No, it says it's free.
{10061}{10141}You can sign for it and|come live here tomorrow.
{10145}{10180}What do you think?
{10184}{10235}Can we see the other rooms?
{10239}{10318}Of course, no problem.|Let's see the bedroom.
{10372}{10454}But first, the closet.|Lots of room.
{10460}{10513}The bedroom, I think...
{10569}{10658}What a beautiful bed!|It must be king size.
{10673}{10727}A waterbed, like in Las Vegas!
{10731}{10757}What's the price?
{10765}{10841}Not that I've ever|been in Las Vegas.
{10845}{10880}But this is nice.
{10916}{11003}And if you get seasick,|you can turn it off.
{11007}{11084}I imagine. There must be|a button somewhere.
{11091}{11129}And the price?
{11147}{11191}Didn't they tell you?
{11239}{11344}Think about it, anyway.|I'll give you my card...
{11666}{11698}Not too much...
{11723}{11807}Her, it was her....
{11897}{11955}You're like|a ventriloquist's dummy!
{11959}{12038}Go ahead, laugh.|What a day I've had!
{12042}{12121}I get a cab at the disco,|and guess who I meet?
{12125}{12182}- Who?|- Antonio Pesadas.
{12186}{12274}Pesadas who worked with me|at the insurance company.
{12278}{12315}Right. He was unbearable.
{12319}{12398}Well, he still is.|But now he's a taxi driver.
{12402}{12459}- He got laid off, too.|- Just like you.
{12463}{12564}I didn't get fired for doing|something wrong. It was downsizing.
{12568}{12647}Right. He was|superfluous, too.
{12651}{12698}I don't knowwhat he was.
{12702}{12767}But if you mean|I'm "superfluous"...
{12771}{12858}Please. It was four years ago.|Forget it.
{12862}{12916}But you keep reminding me.
{12920}{13015}You're saying I lost my job|because I was superfluous.
{13044}{13114}Listen: maybe Pesadas|was superfluous,
{13118}{13191}but I wasn't, I was essential.
{13274}{13322}What's all this?
{13369}{13409}It's a romantic dinner.
{13413}{13462}But... whose flat is this?
{13466}{13576}Nobody's. But since I'm|the only one with a key...
{13580}{13615}Let's see if I get it.
{13623}{13717}This is one of the agency flats,|and you're cooking in it?
{13737}{13814}Don't start acting|like you were my father.
{13818}{13924}I'm not. But you do whatever you|want without checking with me!
{13928}{13964}Acting like your father...
{13968}{14069}Ricardo, we'll clean up afterwards|and they won't find out.
{14073}{14127}- They will and they'll fire you.|- So what?
{14131}{14217}Let them. It's only|a 15-day temp job.
{14221}{14298}And it's worth it.|It has a Jacuzzi.
{14302}{14318}A what?
{14328}{14363}A hot tub, Ricardo.
{14379}{14405}And a sauna,
{14411}{14453}a Finnish sauna.
{14457}{14502}You sure it's Finnish?
{14515}{14550}And the best part is...
{14600}{14626}Come on.
{14699}{14752}- lt moves!|- It's a waterbed.
{14756}{14821}You can change the temperature.
{14825}{14886}What if you want it to stop?
{14890}{14946}There must be|a button somewhere.
{14950}{14977}Wait, wait...
{15004}{15030}Stop!
{15265}{15356}Julia, you know I need|to be relaxed for this.
{15362}{15431}We've waited|six months for you to relax!
{15435}{15510}That long?|Try to understand.
{15514}{15569}Someone could|come in any time.
{15573}{15674}We're alone.|You'll relax, leave it to me.
{15688}{15756}- What's that noise?|- The pipes.
{15760}{15800}It's the neighbor's TV.
{15804}{15882}You can hear it perfectly.|The walls are thin.
{15886}{15948}Forget about it|and concentrate.
{15961}{16049}If we can hear them,|they can hear us.
{16053}{16122}Stop being paranoid.|Let them hear us.
{16126}{16179}They'll get off on it.
{16552}{16580}Get it off of me!
{16619}{16659}What now?
{16663}{16690}That's disgusting!
{16694}{16730}Where did they come from?
{16734}{16785}I told you we shouldn't be here.
{16796}{16904}Don't start with your Jesuit school|guilt complex, Ricardo!
{16908}{16947}But we are guilty.
{16951}{17007}Okay, we're guilty.
{17011}{17093}We're fornicating|like degenerate beasts,
{17097}{17173}but the cockroaches|don't knowthat!
{17177}{17233}You're driving me crazy!
{17243}{17272}You're right, sorry.
{17281}{17341}But they really give me|the creeps.
{17346}{17385}Me too, believe me.
{17389}{17435}We'll close the door,
{17439}{17492}go into the living room...
{17496}{17558}...Clean up and go home.|Please, Julia.
{17562}{17583}No.
{17587}{17615}We'll stay here.
{17619}{17646}Why?
{17650}{17732}Because I say so.|Our house is freezing,
{17736}{17788}and this is a special night.
{17800}{17873}Yeah, Walpurgis night.
{17916}{17992}- Julia...|- You don't feel like it.
{17996}{18076}- You don't mind, do you?|- No, not at all.
{18082}{18147}We're like Krishnas.|Tomorrowwe'll beg in the park.
{18151}{18211}That would be better.|In the disco,
{18215}{18286}this 12-year-old|with baggy pants
{18290}{18369}said he'd kill me|because I asked for his lD.
{18373}{18457}Who would ever hire you|as a bouncer?
{18461}{18539}I told the temp agency|I would do anything.
{18543}{18580}Should I turn on the TV?
{18584}{18640}The neighbor's isn't enough?
{18644}{18706}What a great romantic dinner.
{18775}{18850}The vulture,|nature's gravedigger,
{18854}{18890}devours the dead.
{18909}{18969}When one vulture|finds a carcass,
{18987}{19051}twenty more appear|to share it.
{19055}{19104}A voracious jackal joins them.
{19110}{19204}The somber party continues|until nothing's left.
{19348}{19374}Hello?
{19407}{19488}God! Richard!|Richard, wake up!
{19614}{19663}God, the 9:00 people!
{19674}{19711}Richard, wake up!
{19715}{19747}Just a little more...
{19751}{19810}Nowyou feel affectionate?|Men!
{19814}{19887}We have time for a quickie.
{19891}{19923}To dress quickly.
{19927}{19960}- What's that?|- The doorbell.
{19964}{20012}- Who is it?|- A client, damnit!
{20016}{20051}I have to explain everything.
{20073}{20140}- Great. Always in a hurry.|- Carlos Manzanares?
{20144}{20209}Julia García.|I was expecting you.
{20213}{20287}First, the location.|Here are the super-advantages.
{20291}{20330}One, near the subway.|Two,
{20334}{20417}downtown. Three, schools|for the kids, and four,
{20421}{20458}parks where they can play.
{20462}{20494}Fantastic.
{20793}{20867}High-quality leather.|A sofa to last a lifetime.
{20871}{20909}- What's this?|- Look.
{20913}{20967}- Stains just wipe off.|- Right.
{20971}{21031}Let me showyou|the bedroom.
{21039}{21107}No, let me showyou|the kitchen.
{21111}{21177}Fully equipped,|it even has a toaster.
{21225}{21268}I said you should see
{21272}{21296}the kitchen.
{21300}{21359}- What is this?|- A dampness problem.
{21384}{21429}- Who are you calling?|- The fire department.
{21433}{21502}There's no need to.|We can fix this.
{21506}{21544}A stitch in time...
{21548}{21635}The man upstairs must|have left a faucet on.
{21639}{21691}If the agency finds out...
{21818}{21850}Stop, it's here!
{21889}{21924}Come on, quickly!
{22012}{22092}- What's going on?|- Today is the day, Encarna.
{22096}{22175}- The old man? No!|- Yes. Something bad has happened.
{22179}{22237}I've prayed for this moment!
{22241}{22294}I hope it's not a false alarm.
{22298}{22329}God forbid.
{22429}{22505}They must have|left a faucet on.
{22509}{22560}- Let's see...|- This is my flat!
{22564}{22626}No, excuse me.|That's the door.
{22630}{22714}Let's see. Please.|Get back, we need room.
{22722}{22748}Ma'am, please!
{22779}{22821}Have you nothing to do?
{22981}{23011}What's up?
{23034}{23110}Don't come out|dressed like a drag queen!
{23191}{23222}Ring first.
{23235}{23268}Mind your own business.
{23275}{23312}Yes, you should ring.
{23327}{23424}What the fuck did you call us for?|To ring the bell?
{23445}{23507}- I didn't call you.|- lgnore her.
{23511}{23578}- What if he's asleep?|- Asleep? Bullshit!
{23585}{23670}Besides, he never opens|the door, even if you ring.
{23680}{23728}He's a dangerous lunatic.
{23734}{23809}He'll leave the gas on someday|and blowus up.
{23814}{23876}- Hit it!|- Ma'am!
{23880}{23927}Don't touch my ax,
{23931}{23959}damnit!
{24007}{24043}It must be bolted.
{24076}{24132}- With a iron bar.|- And chains.
{24136}{24185}They haven't gone in yet?
{24189}{24246}They're trying.|Tell María and Salas.
{24250}{24342}This isn't a circus.|Who the hell is the manager?
{24346}{24432}He's not here. He took|his kids to Disneyland.
{24436}{24511}In Paris,|not the "Wals Dineys" one.
{24526}{24582}It had to happen today.|Bad luck.
{24586}{24629}- Aren't you the manager?|- No, no.
{24662}{24712}Who's she?|Who are you?
{24724}{24763}We don't know her.
{24767}{24817}She bought the engineer's flat.
{24828}{24859}Well, "bought"...
{24863}{24921}Julián Chueca,|from the videoclub.
{24925}{25006}Nice to meet you.|We met your husband
{25010}{25050}downstairs at the door.
{25075}{25107}He's very elegant.
{25128}{25206}- He's a croupier in a casino.|- Really?
{25210}{25286}He said he was going|to a disco.
{25300}{25349}Well, it's a disco-casino.
{25401}{25438}What do you think?
{25474}{25500}The Rotaflex.
{25740}{25787}Okay, everyone downstairs.
{25803}{25840}I'm surfing the net...
{25844}{25883}Everyone downstairs.
{25887}{25967}My son's right. Why can't we|stay if we live here?
{25971}{26020}Because I say so, okay?
{26024}{26084}- No need to get cocky.|- Downstairs!
{26088}{26125}- It's our home!|- She's staying!
{26154}{26253}What a stench!|What is all this fucking shit?
{26819}{26846}Disgusting!
{26850}{26934}- Where did you come from?|- My flat. The door was open.
{26938}{27014}Stay out of our way.|This is no joke.
{27143}{27217}There's the leak.|It must be a broken pipe.
{27229}{27289}How could someone|live like this?
{27293}{27344}I didn't know him.
{27350}{27378}You hear that?
{27870}{27930}Here's our friend,|watching TV.
{28150}{28174}God!
{28267}{28339}- What are you doing here?|- He's dead!
{28352}{28393}Of course he's dead.
{28406}{28470}We see this every month.
{28530}{28570}He died weeks ago.
{28576}{28657}He was alone, with no family|to look after him.
{28689}{28743}- What's that smell?|- That smell...
{28754}{28804}is the smell of rotting flesh.
{28823}{28912}The cat has probably been|feeding on the body,
{28925}{28968}and I can assure you,
{28972}{29021}it's not a pretty sight.
{29025}{29049}Paco!
{29053}{29088}Cut the bullshit.
{29687}{29718}Hey?
{29939}{29983}Are you there?
{30147}{30173}What are you doing?
{30221}{30245}What are you looking for?
{30313}{30421}Fifteen men|on a dead man's chest.
{30436}{30509}Ho, ho, ho, and a bottle
{30520}{30546}of rum.
{30637}{30678}Up. What are you doing?
{30697}{30750}Fuck, we'll have to bend him.
{30754}{30814}Bend him?|Just raise him a bit.
{30822}{30861}There we go.
{30895}{30935}He was snobbish and thin.
{30957}{31020}- Hold on, ma'am, he's falling!|- Over here.
{31024}{31054}Have a toke, Juanillo.
{31058}{31123}Always so proud,|and look at him now.
{31127}{31171}God fucking damn it!
{31175}{31211}Calm down.
{31215}{31244}Come on!
{31346}{31372}Slow down, Toni!
{31389}{31423}This guy stinks!
{31490}{31539}- Finally! That bastard.|- You sure he's dead?
{31543}{31613}That's enough already!|Ladies!
{31652}{31716}There's no need to push us.
{31754}{31780}Is that her?
{31800}{31840}The one in the suit.
{31844}{31884}How did she get in?
{31888}{31940}She called the fire department.
{31944}{31984}The bitch!
{32371}{32411}A crossword puzzle?
{32785}{32811}Hello?
{32825}{32859}Hi, dear.
{32877}{32944}No, I'm in a café.
{32977}{33077}Yes, the firemen came.|It was a pipe or something.
{33119}{33215}Did you tell people it was our|flat? They think we live here,
{33219}{33251}I mean, there.
{33258}{33329}No, if they see we're not there,
{33333}{33388}the agency might find out.
{33392}{33464}So I should spend|the night.
{33470}{33558}Are you going home?|Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.
{33582}{33670}Careful with the kid|in baggy pants. Bye.
{34238}{34287}The secret is Mr. Clean.
{34371}{34408}It's a cinch!
{34458}{34479}Great!
{34483}{34566}You scrubbed|everything but my back.
{34571}{34657}Mr. Clean does|the hard work for you.
{34661}{34736}The secret is Mr. Clean.
{35687}{35750}If Ricardo knew, he'd kill me.
{35848}{35903}Fifteen men
{35907}{35987}on a dead man's chest.
{36000}{36052}Ho, ho, ho,
{36059}{36119}and a bottle of rum.
{36160}{36186}It's loose!
{38609}{38634}What's going on?
{38691}{38752}I must talk to that woman.
{38756}{38851}With a knife? You're crazy, Castro.|Give it to me.
{38856}{38899}You'll ruin everything!
{39469}{39528}What is it? Is it her?
{39532}{39580}Shut up! I can't hear.
{39625}{39651}Let me see!
{39680}{39732}Get back, Castro.
{39754}{39803}Just settle down.
{39879}{39935}- Well?|- Excuse me?
{39950}{39980}Taking out the trash?
{40000}{40075}Yes. There's a lot|when you're moving in.
{40079}{40112}Wait a second.
{40137}{40167}Stay right there.
{40267}{40292}Don't worry.
{40296}{40351}- I'll take it down.|- No, no.
{40355}{40423}- I'll go with you.|- I don't mind.
{40438}{40468}But I do.
{40601}{40661}- How's your husband?|- He's exhausted.
{40665}{40737}- You knowwhat moving's like.|- No, I don't.
{40743}{40807}I was born and will die|in this building.
{40821}{40861}I didn't see you bring
{40865}{40901}too many things.
{40905}{40965}The flat was ready|to live in.
{40969}{41026}- Did you knowthe engineer?|- Who?
{41037}{41067}The previous owner.
{41071}{41126}No, I got it|through an agency.
{41130}{41185}I'd never use an agency!
{41189}{41254}- Why not?|- They're all thieves.
{41269}{41317}They take your money|without doing anything.
{41892}{41923}- Shall we go up?|- No.
{41927}{42000}I have to buy some cigarettes.
{42013}{42048}Cigarettes...
{42488}{42556}- No, no! Wait!|- What?
{42562}{42614}It's just paper.
{42628}{42665}Hold on!
{42669}{42728}My husband's into recycling.
{42742}{42793}Recycling, recycling...
{43331}{43417}That's two hundred bills worth|5,000 pesetas
{43421}{43529}in each bunch|and there are 300 bunches,
{43537}{43564}that makes...
{43659}{43701}300 million pesetas.
{43998}{44032}Calm.
{44071}{44109}I'm a mature woman.
{44133}{44190}This is just something|that happened.
{44200}{44255}I have to accept it as normal.
{44318}{44362}I won't lose control.
{44379}{44404}No.
{44448}{44537}I'm a multimillionaire,|that's all.
{44609}{44683}I'm totally rich.
{44734}{44775}Without spending a penny,
{44784}{44841}I could live off the interest
{44854}{44899}and never work again.
{44945}{45044}I could go around the world|as many times as I can take.
{45091}{45155}Is this going to affect me?
{45219}{45246}No.
{45265}{45306}I'm the same as always.
{45311}{45378}A millionaire, but the same.
{45733}{45764}Why are you here?
{45776}{45829}- You don't want to see me?|- No!
{45833}{45889}I mean, yes, but weren't you|going home?
{45893}{45922}Fine, I'll go.
{45926}{46013}- Don't be silly. What happened?|- The disco is history.
{46017}{46071}- They fired you?|- No, I quit!
{46077}{46125}Why do you always say that?
{46129}{46201}Did the 12-year-old|do that to you?
{46205}{46246}Don't. No, worse.
{46251}{46332}The disco owner,|obeying the kid's father.
{46349}{46387}I lasted two days.
{46391}{46455}I'm the king of disco bouncers.
{46467}{46506}I'm King Kong!
{46531}{46591}The giant shithead bouncer.
{46603}{46639}You want a beer?
{46643}{46707}We have beer here now?|What?
{46711}{46765}Have we moved in completely?
{46788}{46869}I have something|important to tell you.
{46873}{46955}Not tonight. Tell me|the bad news tomorrow.
{46959}{47020}It's not bad news,|on the contrary.
{47029}{47109}Imagine something|changing everything.
{47119}{47185}Everything,|I mean, everything.
{47196}{47232}A stroke of luck.
{47251}{47349}Julia, look who|you're talking to here.
{47371}{47406}I have nothing.
{47424}{47489}I've been beaten|and humiliated,
{47498}{47552}I feel ridiculous.
{47559}{47611}I prefer not|to imagine anything.
{47631}{47647}Fine.
{47659}{47710}If you don't want to know...
{47778}{47822}THE STRONGEST DRUG|lSN'T SPEED
{47898}{47929}IT'S MONEY
{47933}{47959}Which is better?
{47975}{48061}A Rover or a Mercedes?|I'd prefer a Mercedes.
{48065}{48124}They're classy, elegant.
{48129}{48172}Yeah, fucking great.
{48176}{48250}I want to be reincarnated|as a fucker who owns one.
{48267}{48370}In this life, we'll never|put our asses in one of those.
{48376}{48441}Unless we catch Pesadas' taxi.
{48445}{48517}The cocksucker has a Mercedes.
{48534}{48604}Your character is turning bitter.
{48608}{48667}You always say|I have no character.
{48684}{48745}What you didn't have was bitterness.
{48756}{48848}Now I'm embittered.|That's what you're calling me!
{48852}{48955}What about you? Always|looking over my shoulder.
{48974}{49032}- What?|- Don't pretend to be offended.
{49040}{49107}Always saying people|can't put up with me.
{49117}{49165}"What, fired again?"
{49177}{49207}What are you saying?
{49220}{49251}You heard me.
{49279}{49366}Look. Just because|things aren't going well
{49370}{49457}doesn't give you|the right to be rude.
{49481}{49530}For years, "Mr. Rude"
{49534}{49606}has kept our thing afloat.|You knowthat?
{49617}{49686}- What thing?|- Our thing.
{49690}{49780}Our relationship, the bills,|the rent, everything!
{49828}{49855}Look,
{49866}{49932}Iet's talk about this tomorrow.
{49974}{50047}We used to live off|my salary, but now
{50051}{50095}you have to work, too,
{50099}{50168}and never stop|rubbing my face in it
{50172}{50267}so that I knowyou're in charge|now. Think I don't get it?
{50276}{50324}A nice romantic dinner...
{50328}{50399}Well, my life is going to hell
{50403}{50464}and I can't buy|an Audi or a Mercedes.
{50468}{50502}I can't! Okay?
{50527}{50570}I had good news,
{50583}{50658}but nowl don't even|feel like telling you!
{50665}{50736}And I don't feel|like staying here!
{50741}{50803}- Where are you going?|- Home.
{50807}{50920}I don't want to stay in this flat|because it's what we'll never have!
{50925}{50968}You don't realize that.
{51024}{51097}I'll never have|this flat or that car
{51101}{51149}or a girl like|the one in the ad!
{51153}{51235}So you have to settle for|someone like me.
{51239}{51271}I didn't say that.
{51275}{51334}Yes, you did, and you meant it.
{51338}{51446}Well, I have to settle for you|and you for me. So what?
{51459}{51556}At least I recognize my limitations|and don't expect strokes of luck.
{51596}{51626}Ricardo!
{51639}{51665}What?
{51691}{51751}You're making a huge mistake.
{52618}{52682}Quique, the lady|needs something.
{52706}{52733}Everything okay?
{52737}{52806}The best breakfast|in Madrid, Quique.
{52810}{52854}Is there a newspaper here?
{52864}{52903}If there isn't, there will be.
{52997}{53022}Excuse me...
{53057}{53125}Napoleon was exiled to Elba,
{53129}{53167}the Canary lslands,|or Treasure lsland?
{53178}{53202}What?
{53217}{53280}The Trivia machine.
{53295}{53334}Well, it must be Elba.
{53353}{53379}Okay.
{53480}{53504}Thank you.
{53561}{53641}Picking up girls, Charli?|The horny little guy.
{53674}{53745}I was just asking her|about Napoleon.
{53749}{53803}His mother gets angry|with me because
{53807}{53834}he spends
{53838}{53881}the shopping money on that.
{53885}{53956}How dare you talk|like that about me!
{53960}{54005}Charli. Charli, Charli...
{54009}{54071}My mother has nothing|to do with this.
{54075}{54106}5th floor, right?

{54482}{54509}I have number 35.

{54923}{54956}That's 1,525 pesetas.
{54960}{55012}Cheap for Madrid.
{55216}{55269}- I don't think so.|- It's no good?
{55276}{55361}It is. With the E.U.,|everything's good.
{55365}{55405}The bank will change it.
{55409}{55440}But it's paid for.
{55444}{55480}Really? By whom?
{55511}{55575}Oswaldo,|the Cuban dance teacher.
{55579}{55612}He's really good.
{55619}{55722}He dances merengue, salsa,|the lambada, that kind of thing...

{57340}{57434}Twenty guys with metal bats.|Right, soccer hooligans.
{57441}{57491}I don't know. That's why
{57495}{57546}I didn't go to the office.
{57553}{57612}Show a flat? Now?
{57630}{57676}I don't think I can.
{57701}{57731}Which one?
{57746}{57798}Other buyers, right.

{59139}{59174}Not at all, come in.
{59238}{59291}Here are the super-advantages.
{59295}{59404}One, near the subway. But you|look more like taxi type people.
{59416}{59449}Two, downtown.
{59453}{59551}Near a bingo parlor. A shot of|anisette and a game or two. Great!
{59555}{59635}And three. Schools, blah,|blah, blah. Kids, etc.
{59669}{59705}But you have no kids.

{61510}{61565}- I should go...|- No, don't.
{61569}{61599}It's not your fault.

{62163}{62211}Besides, I can't do much
{62215}{62283}at the hospital...|All those tubes.

{62387}{62428}- Exactly!|- Right.
{62436}{62485}So you will come tonight.
{62491}{62518}Around nine?
{62537}{62563}Great!
{62649}{62697}And thanks for the coffee!

{65704}{65761}since you work in a bank...
{65821}{65867}You're going to laugh.
{65871}{65979}My friend inherited a lot of money|in cash from her parents...
{66005}{66068}They must have had it at home,
{66074}{66133}under the mattress.|Anyway,
{66137}{66205}she wants to take it|to the bank...
{66209}{66300}What? No, of course I'm not|mixed up in anything funny.
{66324}{66408}The amount? I don't know,|say... 300 million.
{66477}{66545}Under a mattress.|That's not so strange.
{66574}{66654}Whatever. Imagine|someone, Miss X, appears
{66658}{66743}in the bank with that money.|What would you do?
{66774}{66800}Right.
{66810}{66858}Without thinking twice.
{66873}{66950}Well, I'll let my friend knowthat.

{67022}{67096}We'll have to get|together sometime. Bye.

{68265}{68314}Well, news gets around.
{68321}{68415}I've been here two days and I feel|like I already know everybody.
{68425}{68476}Great, it was like a dream.
{68490}{68528}A children's paradise.
{68532}{68563}Is your family here?
{68567}{68660}No, they stayed. It's not|their fault I'm the manager.
{68667}{68714}So I'm on my own.
{68730}{68804}Everyone here is|from the building, right?
{68808}{68871}It's a very close community.
{68875}{68936}We're all interested|in the common good.
{68940}{69006}We have an interest in...|the building.
{69010}{69053}We've always lived here.
{69057}{69096}Ramona was born here.
{69100}{69206}Right. I've known her|since I was a boy. Cheers.
{69368}{69422}You're sure|she hasn't gone out?
{69443}{69504}Not since the Cuban went up.
{69544}{69594}I can't stand this.
{69617}{69673}Emilio gets some ideas...
{69677}{69748}That's what I say,|but no one listens.
{69752}{69794}He's brainwashed them.
{69798}{69846}What would you do?
{69870}{69911}We've got her here.
{69916}{70022}What are we waiting for?|I could fix this in a second.
{70026}{70072}Without Emilio finding out?
{70076}{70130}No one's moving from here.
{70140}{70202}Cookie! This is our song!

{70389}{70435}You can dance with the retard.
{70538}{70624}Don't take it so hard.|He's very passionate.
{70632}{70701}Passionate?|What do you mean by that?
{70710}{70786}Well, about what he does.|He doesn't leave
{70801}{70834}things undone.
{70843}{70906}He leaves a lot undone.
{70917}{70972}Every night|we just watch videos.
{71021}{71102}I don't want to know|about anyone's private life.
{71106}{71192}Since you seem to be|such good friends lately...
{71206}{71253}Well listen to you!
{71259}{71322}Go dance, you have no idea.|Go on!
{71326}{71365}You're so bossy!
{71411}{71465}Take off your jacket,|it's hot.
{71469}{71497}I'm fine.
{71501}{71609}You just don't want the girls|to see howfat you are.
{71632}{71701}I knowyou ate|all the canapés!
{71870}{71936}It's a shame what happened.
{71948}{72018}Yes, that poor old man.|It was terrible.
{72025}{72087}We meant your husband.
{72140}{72201}Right, the accident.|It was awful.
{72212}{72264}Accident? Wasn't he beat up
{72268}{72296}by skinheads?
{72300}{72350}He was. But it was an accident
{72354}{72433}because they took him|for someone else.
{72445}{72471}Right.
{72503}{72549}Did you knowthe old man?
{72553}{72579}The dead one?
{72583}{72652}- We all know each other here.|- He was strange.
{72672}{72699}Always alone.
{72703}{72789}- He never went out.|- The lottery win went to his head.
{72805}{72834}He won the lottery?
{72846}{72878}The sports lottery.
{72892}{72947}But that was a long time ago.
{72958}{73009}He was too afraid to go out.
{73013}{73093}Isn't that silly?|Afraid of us!
{73133}{73165}Afraid!
{73296}{73331}- Can I go now?|- No.
{73335}{73389}Emilio said|we all have to stay.
{73393}{73438}You made me sign it.
{73442}{73531}Do you want to end up|like the engineer?
{73545}{73578}And stop drinking.
{73708}{73751}How is it going?
{73762}{73818}I don't know.|The bitch is smart.
{73822}{73859}But she has the money.
{73864}{73913}We don't knowthat yet.
{73942}{73991}Ramona saw her with bags.
{73995}{74030}She sees what she wants to.
{74044}{74118}Why don't we go up|and search her place now?
{74128}{74190}You want to go up?|Stay calm.
{74199}{74242}We have to do this right.
{74291}{74371}We should have done it|right from the start.
{74553}{74589}Eurodisney!
{74600}{74684}Eurodisney|fucked us over completely!
{74691}{74758}I finally have|a vacation and... Shit!
{75000}{75110}You were brave, going into|that flat with the firemen.
{75114}{75151}What was it like? A cave?
{75163}{75204}More or less, yes.
{75239}{75308}What was the first thing|you saw?
{75329}{75408}Cockroaches, bags full|of garbage, and filth.
{75438}{75472}Nothing else?
{75523}{75597}I knowwe sound morbid,|insisting like this.
{75612}{75691}We've just wondered|about it so long.
{75705}{75755}You can ask him, too.
{75759}{75806}He went in with me.
{75863}{75930}Domínguez! That's news.
{75947}{76022}The fucker went in|and didn't tell anyone.
{76238}{76307}I hope they weren't|boring you.
{76319}{76398}No, they're charming.|Everyone is, really.
{76666}{76695}They're like
{76699}{76767}a family to me.|I'm lucky to live here.
{76777}{76854}There aren't many|young people... Iike us.
{76898}{76951}It's my senior citizens party.
{76971}{77011}But they love to dance.
{77015}{77092}You just have to|start them off. Shall we?
{77102}{77151}No, I only dance at weddings.
{77155}{77223}- Come on, I'll teach you.|- Only at weddings!
{78047}{78083}Come on!
{78087}{78163}You don't have|to accompany me.
{78167}{78231}- You Cubans!|- We like taking care of women.
{78235}{78312}- I bet you say that to all of them.|- And it works!
{78560}{78647}How embarrassing!|We left together.
{78651}{78720}But possibly|each to their own flat.
{78724}{78801}No, you were already|in your own flat.
{78805}{78853}You didn't have to go.
{78878}{78921}You're right! I'm blasted!
{78933}{78974}They're thinking the worst.
{78978}{79032}Well, we can't|disappoint them.
{79036}{79133}Right, if they're going to gossip,|it might as well be true.
{79148}{79202}Wait... What about|your husband?
{79232}{79307}My husband.|What a pain, my husband.
{79311}{79413}I didn't want to say so, but|the hospital called. He's dead.
{79417}{79466}- Really?|- You heard me.
{79470}{79542}The anesthesia gave him|a heart attack.
{79557}{79649}But I don't want to think|about that now, I need to...
{79653}{79707}- To get away from it all.|- Right!
{79711}{79747}To get away from it all.
{80168}{80249}Isn't it amazing?|It can make waves.
{80253}{80291}The engineer had class.
{80295}{80367}- Did you know him?|- No.
{80371}{80424}But I've heard|a lot about him.
{80442}{80475}And the ceiling?
{80479}{80559}The finger of God|punished me the other day.
{80600}{80636}You knowwhat?
{80663}{80712}He'll have reasons to.
{80720}{80814}We'll savagely profane|this holy waterbed.
{80818}{80881}Wait, wait a second.
{80926}{80955}I have ice cream.
{80959}{81016}I love ice cream.|But hurry back.
{81306}{81346}You forgot the ice cream.
{81385}{81430}- Were they listening?|- No.
{81435}{81490}They're beating up Domínguez.
{81494}{81558}It must be Castro.|Always the same.
{81562}{81601}Some people shouldn't drink.
{82442}{82475}What was that?
{82485}{82519}What, darling?
{82538}{82617}There's someone|in the living room.
{82730}{82757}Julia.
{82815}{82857}Julia, come back!
{82907}{82932}What is this?
{83024}{83050}What are you doing?
{83136}{83165}How did you get in?
{83181}{83220}Get out of my flat!
{83224}{83261}Your flat?
{83292}{83344}- Let's go.|- I'll call the police.
{83356}{83400}- Are you sure?|- Put that down.
{83420}{83450}What do you mean?
{83454}{83487}I don't think you would.
{83491}{83537}Forget it, Ramona.
{83541}{83597}- She doesn't fool me.|- Slut.
{83660}{83687}I'm sorry.
{83737}{83814}Let go, it's not yours!|I'll buy you one.
{83825}{83924}Well, let's leave.|Come on, let's go. Let's go.
{84039}{84074}Unbelievable!
{84078}{84130}They just walked in!|Did you...?
{84544}{84576}Out of my home!
{84618}{84658}Get out right now!
{84690}{84774}You were all working together,|all of you!
{84819}{84882}You came up|to unlock the door.
{84886}{84981}God, how could I be so stupid?|To think you and l...
{84985}{85031}Get out! Get out!
{85057}{85085}Get out!
{85265}{85341}You'd better be|as innocent as you seem.
{85345}{85387}Get out!
{86324}{86378}Where do you think|you're going?
{86395}{86477}- What happened?|- Thanks to you, I was almost killed.
{86481}{86547}- I had nothing to do with it.|- Lying bitch!
{86551}{86612}You told them I had the money.
{86616}{86644}What do you want?
{86648}{86747}They're downstairs.|They'll take the money and kill us.
{86752}{86792}- You're crazy.|- Crazy?
{86811}{86882}They're crazy.|Think about the engineer.
{86886}{86940}He wouldn't sign|and he disappeared.
{86944}{87002}- I don't understand.|- Listen, your life's at stake.
{87054}{87146}We used to watch|the old man day and night.
{87160}{87205}Every day for years!
{87209}{87286}How did you know he had|the money at home?
{87290}{87374}One day the bank people|came with two big bags.
{87380}{87423}The 500 million stayed there.
{87427}{87458}It's 300 million.
{87482}{87553}- I heard 500.|- 300. I counted it.
{87626}{87656}It doesn't matter.
{87715}{87808}It used to be a dream|that helped us get by.
{87814}{87886}To share his money|when he died.
{87890}{87981}But now he's dead, the money's|here and they know it.
{88024}{88058}- Get out.|- First my suitcase.
{88062}{88160}The suitcase!|Fucking greed will send us to hell.
{88165}{88190}Help me!
{88282}{88352}- Help!|- The elevator's stuck again?
{88394}{88420}Ignore her! Help!
{88428}{88496}Go tell Emilio|the elevator's stuck.
{88504}{88551}Don't! Don't move!
{88571}{88619}We just want to help.
{88623}{88663}Go back inside.
{88748}{88795}God! Get me out of here!
{88829}{88861}Don't or I'll kill you!
{88896}{88946}You hear me, you bitch?
{88950}{88987}It's all your fault!
{88996}{89039}Sticking your nose|in our business!
{89062}{89123}- What's wrong, Mommy?|- Go to your fucking room!
{89139}{89216}It's crushing me!|God, it's crushing me!
{89220}{89245}I can't hold on!
{89259}{89330}I'll tell Emilio|it's taken care of.
{89446}{89474}Tell him
{89478}{89554}the suitcase is his|if he gets me out!
{89578}{89599}God!
{89995}{90030}My God, no!
{90055}{90121}- lt was an accident!|- Come on, come on!
{90128}{90154}Come on!
{90167}{90247}Scream and I'll cut you open!|Come on!
{90262}{90323}Inside!
{90383}{90438}We don't have
{90442}{90489}anything to do with this.
{90493}{90540}- lt must be Emilio.|- The manager?
{90544}{90574}Yes, it was his idea.
{90599}{90666}The old man|didn't enjoy his money.
{90681}{90770}We just didn't want it to go|to the tax administration.
{90774}{90803}How noble!
{90849}{90907}She must be in the patio.
{91002}{91029}Shut up!
{91045}{91112}Emilio's an accountant,|he understands it.
{91145}{91221}He said that if we worked|together patiently,
{91229}{91285}we'd get it|without hurting anyone.
{91289}{91324}And you believed him?
{91328}{91382}Not everyone.|Some walked out
{91386}{91490}and the rest of us signed|an agreement. Equal shares.
{91496}{91595}It was serious, but we never|thought anyone would get hurt.
{91601}{91652}May lightning strike him|if I'm lying!
{91656}{91718}- No!|- Shut up!
{91820}{91923}We're going outside. Keep your|mouth shut. You come, too.
{91972}{92020}Come on, outside!
{92024}{92097}- Are you going to kill Mommy?|- I don't know.
{92116}{92146}She's here!
{92155}{92217}Tell my husband.|He's in the videoclub.
{92251}{92288}Pull yourself together.
{92293}{92339}Let Hortensia go!
{92343}{92405}Relax, we can talk it over.
{92409}{92454}There's enough money
{92458}{92504}for everyone in there.
{92528}{92573}Don't do anything rash.
{92577}{92615}Stay back or I'll kill her!
{92619}{92678}Julia, you're not a killer.
{92682}{92731}But you people are. Back!
{92735}{92800}I'm leaving here|and I don't care how.
{92804}{92914}You're scared. We're not responsible|for what happened to Domínguez.
{92918}{92982}The elevator's|had problems before.
{92986}{93015}It's true, Julia.
{93019}{93094}We called the repairman.|We haven't hurt anyone.
{93098}{93137}How can you think that?
{93141}{93189}We're normal, like you.
{93196}{93286}Normal? You killed Domínguez|and you want to kill me!
{93295}{93335}She's right. What is this?
{93339}{93405}We should just slit|her fucking throat.
{93409}{93476}Castro, shut up!|Give me the suitcase.
{93480}{93504}Fuck you!
{93508}{93569}Give me the suitcase|and leave.
{93573}{93668}You screwed with the old man|until he died of fright.
{93681}{93770}I won't let you bastards|keep the money!
{93781}{93845}Someone call|my husband, please!
{93849}{93956}She'll kill her and keep the money!|We've waited so long for this?
{93960}{93996}Let me think, damnit!
{94000}{94055}About what? Either I leave,
{94059}{94168}or there will be a massacre|you'll never fucking forget.
{94199}{94277}We have to give her|the money! We have to!
{94339}{94365}I'll kill her!
{94407}{94444}Put that away!
{94456}{94485}Castro!
{94501}{94534}Get out of the way!
{94798}{94859}Who the fuck called|the police?
{94863}{94913}Thank God|you got here in time.
{94917}{94942}Stay calm.
{94951}{95005}I'm Gutiérrez, the manager.
{95018}{95056}Here is the body.
{95060}{95135}It was a horrific sight.|No, no.
{95139}{95205}Don't look.|Damn accident!
{95226}{95286}She's leaving,|the bitch is leaving.
{95380}{95411}How long have you|been the manager?
{95430}{95478}You're not leaving here!
{95482}{95529}You want me to scream?
{95533}{95610}Do it. And explain|the suitcase to the police.
{95691}{95721}Excuse me, Julia.
{95725}{95817}I told them you were the last|person to see Domínguez alive.
{95821}{95892}Yes, but it all happened|so quickly...
{95896}{95931}Let's go to the station.
{95935}{96016}- The station? Why?|- For your statement.
{96022}{96109}Sorry, I don't have time.|I have a plane to catch.
{96118}{96178}Of course, that explains|the suitcase.
{96182}{96238}It's a business trip.|I'll call you
{96242}{96287}in a couple of days.
{96295}{96338}Sorry, that's impossible.
{96345}{96417}You can go after|giving your statement.
{96437}{96483}Why don't we do it here?
{96487}{96597}Excuse me, but I know|about these things.
{96612}{96685}The first thing we do|is interviewwitnesses.
{96699}{96804}Come on, we have to|let these men do their work.
{96808}{96842}- Use my flat.|- No!
{96890}{96968}There's no need,|we can use mine. Let's go.
{96981}{97068}Thanks for your help, Emilio,|but we don't need you.
{97083}{97111}Right, upstairs.
{97130}{97159}Go on up.
{97289}{97333}That's all, then. Right?
{97337}{97389}You might be called later
{97393}{97446}if there's an investigation.
{97457}{97494}There's something else.
{97534}{97591}In this building...
{97604}{97656}Something strange|is happening.
{97664}{97696}- What happened?|- Yes.
{97700}{97814}The inevitable. You left your wife|alone and she was almost killed.
{97820}{97877}I was in the videoclub.
{97881}{97989}No, I went to look for him|and only the blonde was there.
{97993}{98070}I must have been having a coffee.|I don't know.
{98074}{98125}If you don't know...
{98129}{98190}We've all been here on guard.
{98194}{98272}- What do we do now?|- I don't know, give me time.
{98284}{98345}- What if she tells them?|- About what?
{98355}{98392}The elevator, the party...
{98396}{98477}No, she'd have to tell them|about the money.
{98481}{98533}She held on tight|to that suitcase.
{98547}{98612}No, it's not that. It's...|complicated.
{98623}{98672}Let's just say that they
{98676}{98752}have been looking|for something for years
{98760}{98817}and I found it|in a couple days.
{98830}{98856}"They"?
{98860}{98906}The neighbors.
{98919}{99003}They know I have it|and they want to kill me.
{99050}{99099}But what did you find?
{99179}{99207}Ma'am, what
{99211}{99238}did you find?
{99293}{99329}This flat.
{99404}{99464}I know it sounds silly,|but it's nice.
{99486}{99538}It's furnished, with a view.
{99542}{99586}I found it by chance.
{99598}{99665}They've worked for years|for what they have.
{99680}{99748}People can be very envious.
{99808}{99859}But the elevator...?
{99868}{99952}She has a nicer flat|so they want to kill her.
{99957}{99999}Absurd, isn't it?
{100025}{100070}Forgive me, I'm nervous.
{100151}{100196}Everything's ready?
{100214}{100244}Yes, perfect.
{100522}{100553}She's leaving.
{100559}{100595}Do something.
{100599}{100671}Maybe you'd like an aperitif.
{100675}{100718}How about... a beer?
{100722}{100787}- No, thanks. We have to go.|- Come on.
{100791}{100847}Encarna, can you|get some beers?
{100851}{100889}- Right away.|- And olives.
{100893}{100948}Let's have a nice cold beer.
{100952}{101028}We do appreciate it,|but we're on duty.
{101032}{101101}A couple of beers|never hurt anyone.
{101105}{101146}No, they're good for you.
{101150}{101223}They don't want anything!|Let's go.
{101236}{101288}- Damn her.|- Emilio, she's going.
{101423}{101450}Julia...
{101476}{101505}He's talking to you.
{101575}{101622}You left the door open.
{101664}{101693}What?
{101705}{101791}The door. You forgot|to close the door.
{101795}{101824}Come back up.
{101923}{101986}Close it for me.|See you later.
{102000}{102076}Julia, lock it if you're|going on a trip
{102080}{102160}to keep out the burglars.|Right, officers?
{102190}{102250}He's right,|you should lock it.
{102289}{102315}Well...
{102345}{102418}All right, but wait for me here.
{102422}{102474}- I'll be right back.|- Don't worry.
{102955}{103020}Hurry, you'll miss your plane.
{103053}{103107}The policeman downstairs wants
{103111}{103140}you to come down.
{103217}{103247}Should we wait?
{103354}{103386}No, she'll be okay.
{103390}{103445}- Are you sure?|- Yeah. She's nuts.
{103598}{103663}This hurts me|more than it hurts you.
{103918}{103976}We wanted you|to be one of us,
{103986}{104061}to share the luck|of living in this building.
{104093}{104151}We even threwyou a party.
{104220}{104256}And how do you thank us?
{104283}{104311}Laughing at us,
{104315}{104407}and what's worse, trying|to run off, playing dirty.
{104417}{104444}Domínguez died
{104448}{104535}because you double-crossed him!|What was the deal?
{104540}{104627}"50-50 and fuck the rest|of those cocksuckers"?
{104692}{104758}Domínguez didn't|deserve to end up like that!
{104776}{104826}God! Do you know how many
{104830}{104911}years I've been|behind this project,
{104915}{104973}getting these people together?
{105019}{105076}I've turned down jobs,
{105080}{105141}well-paying jobs,|just to stay here.
{105145}{105204}I knewthings would
{105208}{105250}fall apart without me.
{105391}{105444}You see what happens?
{105475}{105527}A treat for the kids.
{105531}{105606}My first vacation in 20 years,|and you appear
{105614}{105661}and fuck everything up!
{105748}{105822}Who do you think you are?|I'll tell you.
{105848}{105892}You're a lying whore who
{105896}{105973}hasn't a penny!|This isn't even your flat!
{105991}{106026}But that doesn't matter.
{106042}{106091}I feel sorry for your kind.
{106095}{106131}What are you saying?
{106150}{106218}Don't play dumb.|You understand me.
{106240}{106310}You people think|only of yourselves.
{106314}{106386}You probably|don't have a family, either.
{106390}{106454}You people don't|want responsibilities.
{106468}{106552}You just want|to live in the present.
{106556}{106650}Fuck everyone else.|Well, we're different here.
{106718}{106773}This is a community.
{106804}{106852}García's hip is bad
{106869}{106954}and he eats lunch|at his daughter's house.
{106958}{107034}He needs a little car|to get around town.
{107038}{107107}Paquita, on the 5th floor,
{107116}{107190}is 40 years old and still single.|Knowwhy?
{107218}{107244}Her mouth is
{107248}{107314}disgusting and|she's never been kissed.
{107329}{107389}She needs to get|her teeth fixed.
{107409}{107502}It's all here on this list,|corrected year after year.
{107536}{107579}Knowwhat I'm talking about?
{107604}{107687}About solidarity, respect.
{107704}{107753}We believe|in respecting others.
{107800}{107844}You don't know|what that means.
{107908}{107945}Just finish it!
{107949}{107998}Don't tell me what to do.
{108013}{108085}You killed the engineer,|didn't you?
{108119}{108232}He didn't want to guard|the old man. Just two hours a day.
{108236}{108286}No, he was above all that.
{108290}{108338}He didn't have|a family to support.
{108346}{108410}Out living it up to all hours.
{108414}{108475}Drunks coming in and leaving.
{108484}{108526}He kept us all awake.
{108553}{108617}He was destroying|the community.
{108652}{108764}So kill me, too and stop boring me|with your sermons.
{108768}{108814}You're a fraud and a thief,
{108818}{108856}Iike me, like everybody.
{108865}{108922}No, I'm not a thief.|I'm not a thief.
{108926}{108981}I have a right to it, I do.
{109010}{109074}We did the sports lottery|together.
{109081}{109140}I helped him|guess the scores.
{109147}{109206}He asked me for advice.
{109261}{109295}He said...
{109357}{109441}"Sporting against Real Sociedad"....
{109489}{109515}And l...
{109549}{109577}I...
{109592}{109618}I said...
{109715}{109749}"Tie".
{109774}{109866}I don't know, it just|came out of my mouth.
{109883}{109990}No one else in Spain|marked "Tie". Just me.
{110021}{110078}I said, "Tie".
{110154}{110233}When I heard he'd|won the jackpot,
{110272}{110301}I was glad.
{110322}{110365}I swear I was glad.
{110369}{110424}And he didn't want to share.
{110451}{110524}As if we didn't exist.|We were neighbors.
{110528}{110593}A lifetime together, meeting
{110598}{110652}in the elevator, in the bar...
{110657}{110705}It meant nothing to him.
{110728}{110803}He could have given us part,|or just gifts.
{110822}{110900}But no, he wanted it|all for himself,
{110911}{110975}the Goddamn greedy fucker.
{111051}{111129}I've dreamt about|this moment ever since.
{111172}{111251}If I hadn't spoken,|if I'd shut my mouth,
{111260}{111311}if I hadn't said "Tie"...
{111320}{111406}the bastard wouldn't|have ruined our lives.
{111445}{111490}Are you going|to keep it all?
{111550}{111577}What?
{111618}{111678}You wouldn't kill|for 30 million,
{111696}{111744}but you would|for 300 million.
{111768}{111832}People kill for 15,000 pesetas.
{111857}{111895}You needed the neighbors.
{111899}{112013}You couldn't guard the old man|by yourself. You planned this.
{112017}{112071}- That's a lie.|- Nowyou don't need them.
{112075}{112109}But howwill you get out?
{112155}{112205}Will you kill them all?
{112226}{112256}You'll need an excuse
{112260}{112338}to take out the suitcase.|You must have one.
{112975}{113047}You've had 20 years|to think about it.
{113105}{113212}And about getting rid|of your beloved wife and kids.
{113226}{113300}I love my wife as much|as the first day we met.
{113343}{113419}She must be a good woman|to have gone
{113423}{113453}without vacations.
{113480}{113565}But with money, you can|get something better.
{113569}{113598}Shut up.
{113613}{113666}Someone who doesn't know,
{113691}{113769}who matches|your new house and pool,
{113776}{113828}your new convertible.
{113859}{113899}Have you thought about it?
{114059}{114148}Get in the bathtub, I don't|want bloodstains on the floor.
{114164}{114211}Get in the bathtub, I said!
{114726}{114798}100,200,300,400,500...
{114802}{114884}What are you doing?|Why did you buy that?
{114888}{114968}Don't distract me,|I'll have to start over.
{115000}{115060}I'm worried about you.|Are you okay?
{115064}{115111}Yes, Mom. Leave me alone.
{115127}{115205}Well, whatever happens,|don't leave the flat.
{115216}{115287}Everything will|turn out all right.
{116000}{116063}Hello? Yes, speaking.|Who's this?
{116079}{116117}What agency?
{116133}{116183}The real estate agency.
{116202}{116249}Yes, what is it?
{116265}{116334}Look, I can't talk|to you right now.
{116403}{116433}What?
{116455}{116496}Who told you?
{116506}{116535}A neighbor.
{116539}{116634}Yes, I am living here|and I suppose I'm fired.
{116690}{116768}Don't worry, in an hour|I'll have it clean.
{116777}{116823}No, give me 90 minutes.
{116844}{116933}What? Someone else|is coming to see it?
{116953}{117015}Is this the only flat|in Madrid?
{117967}{117998}Hello?
{118033}{118087}There's no one here,|come in.
{118163}{118221}Well, this is a great flat.
{118230}{118298}Here are the super-advantages.|One, near the subway.
{118302}{118394}Two, downtown.|Three, schools for the kids,
{118398}{118452}and four, parks|where they can play.
{118470}{118536}We can see the kitchen,|if you want.
{118540}{118618}- Does it have a garage?|- No, it doesn't.
{118622}{118685}If it did, it'd have|been sold by now.
{118740}{118817}Hi, I'm Julia García,|from the agency.
{118821}{118868}What's going on?
{118878}{118941}They must be friends of hers.
{118949}{119007}It's plastic,|I can't hear anything.
{119011}{119074}Excuse me.|I'd like a minute
{119078}{119118}- alone with you.|- Of course.
{119122}{119164}- What's your name?|- Javier Pacheco.
{119178}{119226}We have to tell Castro.
{119241}{119307}He said to tell people|he's in the bar.
{119327}{119400}Great. I'll go get him.
{119415}{119505}But he's not there. He just|doesn't want his wife to know.
{119519}{119549}About what?
{119553}{119585}His affair with blonde.
{119606}{119638}From the videoclub?
{119642}{119724}You didn't know? Haven't|you noticed he's always
{119741}{119778}carrying videos?
{119782}{119874}Lately he's seen more movies|than Woody Allen.
{119922}{119963}Impossible.
{119967}{120057}She's hot. I got a card and|I don't even have a VCR.
{120061}{120146}What do I care about|that loser's private life?
{120183}{120226}Well, since you asked...
{120247}{120322}- You slapped me!|- You deserved that and more.
{120362}{120419}You see a couple of tits
{120444}{120478}and that's that.
{120515}{120565}You all have shit for brains.
{120594}{120680}Listen, Jaime or Javi.|I need a favor.
{120692}{120775}I rang three times.|They said they'd call...
{120785}{120822}You did very well,
{120826}{120861}Jaime or Javi.
{120876}{120932}Just don't showthem|the bedroom.
{120936}{120971}What do I tell them?
{120975}{121024}The truth.|There's a bad leak.
{121036}{121099}- ls that the reason?|- No, silly.
{121109}{121170}Let's say I wasn't|alone yesterday
{121175}{121214}and I'm not today, either.
{121259}{121287}Did he do that?
{121312}{121368}Love can be very strange.
{121378}{121417}But you're still so young.
{121453}{121496}See, there is a leak.
{121507}{121569}Yes, it's not worth|showing them.
{121647}{121742}You're new and don't know,|but this is normal in our work.
{121746}{121825}The bosses know.|It's a kind of fringe benefit.
{121829}{121908}Still, I think I'll wait|a few months before...
{121914}{121954}I bring girls to the flats.
{121958}{122020}You have|to find the girl first.

{136862}{136938}I'll create a distraction,|like in the Death Star.
{136942}{136964}What star?
{136983}{137011}Han Solo distracted
{137015}{137056}the Stormtroopers while
