1
00:01:03,888 --> 00:01:06,270
The wind’s too strong!

2
00:01:12,826 --> 00:01:16,959
- Awful weather.
- The letters must shine.

3
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:18,839
Some wind you have in this village!

4
00:01:19,632 --> 00:01:21,510
The women here
live longer than the men.

5
00:01:22,596 --> 00:01:23,431
Except our poor mother...

6
00:01:23,473 --> 00:01:24,515
She got lucky.

7
00:01:24,515 --> 00:01:25,979
Don’t say that, Raimunda.

8
00:01:26,312 --> 00:01:29,236
Mother died in father’s arms.
It’s how she would have wanted it.

9
00:01:29,236 --> 00:01:30,446
She wanted to die in a fire?

10
00:01:32,408 --> 00:01:37,753
I think it was a good death.
They were asleep, didn’t notice at all.

11
00:01:37,795 --> 00:01:40,967
What difference does that make?
That’s not a way to speak.

12
00:01:42,097 --> 00:01:43,307
Hello, Augistina.

13
00:01:45,938 --> 00:01:47,357
Bye, Augustina.

14
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:48,986
Good day, Manola.

15
00:01:49,278 --> 00:01:50,906
Mom, what else should I bring?

16
00:01:50,947 --> 00:01:51,782
That’s all.

17
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:52,911
Now, she’s an eyeful.

18
00:01:53,077 --> 00:01:55,164
Augustina!

19
00:01:55,751 --> 00:01:58,633
This is Paula, right? Wonderful girl!
Let me kiss her.

20
00:01:59,717 --> 00:02:02,014
Ah, something’s wrong here.
She stole her father’s eyes.

21
00:02:03,516 --> 00:02:06,231
How are you?
- Not like before.

22
00:02:08,779 --> 00:02:11,869
My lot is impossible
to keep clean.

23
00:02:12,161 --> 00:02:14,163
It’s a nightmare.
- Well. it looks great.

24
00:02:14,456 --> 00:02:16,879
I feel such peace
when I’m taking care of my mound.

25
00:02:17,213 --> 00:02:20,052
I often come here alone,
I sit down and forget all worry.

26
00:02:20,135 --> 00:02:22,474
We have to go and see aunt Paula before we leave.

27
00:02:22,891 --> 00:02:24,185
Come by and visit me, too!

28
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:25,815
Of course.

29
00:02:25,982 --> 00:02:30,323
Wait, how’s Paco doing?
Fine, he stayed in Madrid—too much work.

30
00:02:33,414 --> 00:02:36,838
Mother, is it true that aunt Augustina
comes to look after her own grave?

31
00:02:36,921 --> 00:02:42,184
Yes, that’s how it’s done around here.
You buy yourself a lot and maintain it.

32
00:02:42,476 --> 00:02:43,812
What a nutcase.

33
00:02:43,937 --> 00:02:45,440
That’s how it’s done.

34
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:48,657
I’ll drive?
- Yes, yes.

35
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:12,958
Aunt Paula?

36
00:03:14,084 --> 00:03:14,921
Who is it?

37
00:03:15,088 --> 00:03:15,422
Raimunda.

38
00:03:15,422 --> 00:03:20,347
Let’s be quick.
I don’t want to stay the night.

39
00:03:20,597 --> 00:03:22,895
Put a smile on for your aunt.

40
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,979
Okay.

41
00:03:24,313 --> 00:03:25,986
The house smells as awful as ever.

42
00:03:26,194 --> 00:03:28,532
Aunt Paula, how are you?

43
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:32,248
My, you look thin! Are you on a diet?

44
00:03:32,499 --> 00:03:33,794
Ever since I turned 14.

45
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:35,339
Who are these people?

46
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,596
What do you mean who?
Solia and my Paula.

47
00:03:38,971 --> 00:03:41,352
Paula looks just like me.

48
00:03:42,271 --> 00:03:44,065
Let’s go to the dining room.

49
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:47,992
Sure, come on in.

50
00:03:49,953 --> 00:03:53,209
Solia looks so much older…

51
00:04:04,986 --> 00:04:07,784
Can I turn it off?
- Turn it off, I’m not watching.

52
00:04:09,245 --> 00:04:11,542
Fires are a terrible thing.

53
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,799
So, what brings you here?

54
00:04:15,258 --> 00:04:17,680
I don’t know. Maybe we can talk.

55
00:04:18,013 --> 00:04:20,685
No.
- Let’s have breakfast then.

56
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,481
Look in the cupboard.

57
00:04:24,025 --> 00:04:26,322
My rheumatism is killing me.

58
00:04:27,283 --> 00:04:31,210
I found doughnuts,
just like mother’s.

59
00:04:32,878 --> 00:04:34,549
How was the cemetery?

60
00:04:34,966 --> 00:04:37,053
Mom would have been pleased.

61
00:04:37,556 --> 00:04:39,225
Did you clean it well?

62
00:04:39,225 --> 00:04:40,186
Of course.

63
00:04:41,272 --> 00:04:42,816
She likes it very clean.

64
00:04:42,941 --> 00:04:47,452
If she could do it herself, she would
but of course she can’t.

65
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:50,626
Yes, too bad she can’t.

66
00:04:51,836 --> 00:04:54,133
Auntie, don’t you ever get lonely
here in this big house?

67
00:04:55,385 --> 00:04:58,517
You’d be better off in a home.
They’ll take care of you.

68
00:04:58,559 --> 00:05:00,521
I like it here.

69
00:05:01,107 --> 00:05:02,191
Can I use the bathroom?

70
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:04,071
Go.

71
00:05:05,323 --> 00:05:08,664
Still, living alone is no good.
I’m worried about you.

72
00:05:08,873 --> 00:05:10,416
How do you manage with food?

73
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,839
Augustina brings me bread.

74
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,304
If I need anything else from the store
I just call them.

75
00:05:16,429 --> 00:05:18,101
Don’t worry.

76
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,035
So pretty.

77
00:06:07,665 --> 00:06:11,048
Look what your aunt has made.
She even inscribed your name.

78
00:06:13,09 --> 00:06:14,555
Are we leaving soon?

79
00:06:15,265 --> 00:06:15,849
We are.

80
00:06:17,395 --> 00:06:18,772
Aunt Paula, we should go.

81
00:06:19,065 --> 00:06:20,819
I have a bout of rheumatism again.

82
00:06:21,153 --> 00:06:22,195
Don’t get up.

83
00:06:22,404 --> 00:06:24,076
This can’t go on.

84
00:06:26,287 --> 00:06:30,923
I’m still worried, next time
I’m taking you with me.

85
00:06:31,383 --> 00:06:34,347
Yes, yes, next time.
If there is one.

86
00:06:34,347 --> 00:06:36,143
Of course there will be.

87
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,774
Take care of yourself.

88
00:07:04,036 --> 00:07:05,747
You, too.

89
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:09,05
Of course.
Auntie, I love you so much.

90
00:07:09,674 --> 00:07:12,177
Are we stopping at Augustina’s?
- Yes.

91
00:07:21,031 --> 00:07:22,742
Come on in!

92
00:07:24,746 --> 00:07:27,503
So, how did your aunt seem to you?

93
00:07:27,795 --> 00:07:28,462
Bad.

94
00:07:28,796 --> 00:07:29,759
Terrible.

95
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:33,015
She’s so stubborn. I can’t imagine
how she manages by herself.

96
00:07:33,015 --> 00:07:36,273
She manages. No other choice.

97
00:07:36,898 --> 00:07:39,864
Every day, I bring her bread.
She won’t starve, at least.

98
00:07:40,197 --> 00:07:42,285
Let’s go out in the yard.
- I’m sad.

99
00:07:42,576 --> 00:07:47,03
She talks about our mother.
As if she’s alive.

100
00:07:47,295 --> 00:07:49,215
Yes, that’s what she does.

101
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,639
Come, sit down, let’s talk.

102
00:07:53,559 --> 00:07:56,733
I’ll give you some money
to take good care of her.

103
00:07:56,816 --> 00:08:00,616
No need to give me anything.
It’s my pleasure.

104
00:08:01,366 --> 00:08:03,956
I’d take her with me
but she won’t let me.

105
00:08:03,956 --> 00:08:06,253
I don’t know what to do with her.
We’ll think of something.

106
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:09,510
Every day when I go to the store
I knock on her window

107
00:08:09,844 --> 00:08:12,893
and I stay until I see her.
Don’t worry, she’s in good hands.

108
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:17,735
You can’t imagine how grateful I am.

109
00:08:18,988 --> 00:08:24,166
I just hope... someone takes care
of my own mother this way...

110
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,546
wherever she is.

111
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,269
See that?

112
00:08:35,985 --> 00:08:38,112
The only hippie in the village.

113
00:08:39,032 --> 00:08:40,868
Come see the plastic necklaces.

114
00:08:42,998 --> 00:08:44,043
They’re beautiful.

115
00:08:44,418 --> 00:08:46,881
They may be plastic
but they’re top quality!

116
00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:54,731
They remind me of my mother.
- You’re such a good daughter.

117
00:08:55,692 --> 00:08:58,155
Any news of her?
- None.

118
00:08:58,531 --> 00:09:00,661
It’s like she vanished.

119
00:09:00,828 --> 00:09:02,290
What about your sister?

120
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:05,881
Regina? She’s in Madrid,
reaping awards and accolades.

121
00:09:08,805 --> 00:09:10,557
Mom, I ran out of minutes.

122
00:09:10,974 --> 00:09:13,523
So much the better, we need
a break from your telephone.

123
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,693
Use mine.
- Please.

124
00:09:15,944 --> 00:09:17,197
In that case, you can’t.

125
00:09:17,197 --> 00:09:18,909
What was I saying?

126
00:09:19,118 --> 00:09:21,372
Regina, she’s on every television show.

127
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:24,252
You can rent an apartment in Madrid
for the price of a ticket.

128
00:09:24,711 --> 00:09:26,383
She was meant to be a singer.

129
00:09:26,508 --> 00:09:29,682
Do you remember... when you were 14...

130
00:09:29,891 --> 00:09:33,147
They took you to an audition
for young talents.

131
00:09:34,316 --> 00:09:36,946
Really?
You never told me that.

132
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,662
Past is past. Anyway,
it was because of Augustina's sister.

133
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:43,711
Didn’t you ever wish you were with her
in show business?

134
00:09:45,04 --> 00:09:45,591
Not really.

135
00:09:45,675 --> 00:09:47,845
She would have liked that.

136
00:09:49,015 --> 00:09:50,310
She would flip out.

137
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,398
Want some?

138
00:09:52,856 --> 00:09:53,900
No, thank you.

139
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:56,740
Homegrown and home-made.

140
00:09:56,907 --> 00:09:57,907
No, no.

141
00:09:59,412 --> 00:10:01,164
We have to go, really.
- Yes.

142
00:10:01,918 --> 00:10:04,965
Did you tell the police
about your mother’s disappearance?

143
00:10:05,134 --> 00:10:07,721
No. Regina thinks
it won’t do any good.

144
00:10:07,846 --> 00:10:10,310
Many times she appealed on TV
to people who may have information.

145
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,983
TV is one thing,
the police is another.

146
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:15,697
What do I know.

147
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,789
It’s not the first time
your mother disappears.

148
00:10:19,872 --> 00:10:21,919
Yes, but never for that long.

149
00:10:22,378 --> 00:10:24,047
It’s been three and a half years.

150
00:10:24,506 --> 00:10:28,391
Don’t lose hope, and take care of yourself,
you look tired.

151
00:10:28,558 --> 00:10:30,352
Look at the pretty blossoms.

152
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:34,027
It’ll bear a lot of fruit.
Too bad I don’t have any appetite.

153
00:10:34,863 --> 00:10:36,491
Must be the cigarettes.

154
00:10:37,535 --> 00:10:39,749
It’s thanks to cigarettes
that I eat at all.

155
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,300
Her eyes are just like her father’s.

156
00:10:47,222 --> 00:10:50,854
Cigarettes stimulate appetite
and improve your mood.

157
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,992
Drive safe.

158
00:11:09,938 --> 00:11:12,276
You won’t believe what I saw
at my aunt’s house.

159
00:11:13,154 --> 00:11:14,447
What?

160
00:11:15,284 --> 00:11:16,911
An exercise bike.

161
00:11:17,204 --> 00:11:18,666
That’s absurd.

162
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:21,589
She got an exercise bike
for her treatment.

163
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:24,426
The old hag has completely lost it.

164
00:11:24,468 --> 00:11:26,640
I don’t like it when you talk
that way about her.

165
00:11:27,058 --> 00:11:28,937
Mom, she didn't even recognize us.

166
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:34,491
It’s the wind. The damned wind
makes people crazy.

167
00:11:36,203 --> 00:11:37,706
Mm, very tasty.

168
00:11:39,126 --> 00:11:41,632
I can’t believe
she can still make these.

169
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,773
Hello, Regina.
Are you off to work?

170
00:12:09,274 --> 00:12:10,693
What can you do.

171
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,697
Can you give her a ride?

172
00:12:12,697 --> 00:12:13,949
Where to?

173
00:12:14,074 --> 00:12:17,165
The city. The closer to downtown,
the better.

174
00:12:17,248 --> 00:12:18,795
Hop on.
- Thanks.

175
00:12:19,03 --> 00:12:20,296
Later.

176
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,877
Hi, dad.
- Hey there.

177
00:12:38,044 --> 00:12:39,589
What’s new?

178
00:12:45,935 --> 00:12:48,691
How was it?
Did you have fun?

179
00:12:49,276 --> 00:12:50,779
At the cemetery?

180
00:12:50,988 --> 00:12:52,408
You must be kidding!

181
00:12:55,581 --> 00:12:58,087
Are you having fun now?

182
00:12:58,588 --> 00:12:59,923
What?

183
00:13:00,802 --> 00:13:02,638
Put your feet down.

184
00:13:05,268 --> 00:13:07,107
Bring me another beer.

185
00:13:07,523 --> 00:13:09,278
Are you drunk?

186
00:13:10,195 --> 00:13:12,701
Get me another beer!
Please.

187
00:13:13,244 --> 00:13:16,835
Paco, don’t you think you’ve had
enough? You’re working tomorrow.

188
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:23,348
I rest tomorrow, and the day after.
- What?

189
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:25,979
They fired me.

190
00:13:26,146 --> 00:13:27,066
Wait a minute.

191
00:13:28,484 --> 00:13:29,946
Goddamn it!

192
00:13:31,367 --> 00:13:34,124
Then look for another job
or are you just resting from now on?

193
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:39,299
I’ll look, let me
finish watching the game.

194
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,270
Say goodbye to the TV.
If we’re poor,

195
00:13:44,437 --> 00:13:46,859
might as well live like the poor.

196
00:13:47,401 --> 00:13:49,487
Paula, get off the phone.

197
00:13:50,242 --> 00:13:52,328
Dinner’s here, if you want to eat.

198
00:14:23,688 --> 00:14:26,149
Are you mad at me?
- No.

199
00:14:27,028 --> 00:14:29,281
I’m worried about my aunt.

200
00:14:29,993 --> 00:14:31,913
She’s worse than ever.

201
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,752
She couldn’t recognize Solia, her own niece.

202
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,183
How can anyone live like that?
- She can.

203
00:14:43,187 --> 00:14:44,857
Stop it, Paco.

204
00:14:47,404 --> 00:14:48,907
What’s with you?

205
00:14:49,074 --> 00:14:52,165
I’m just tired,
and I have to be up early tomorrow.

206
00:14:52,707 --> 00:14:54,461
I can do it myself.

207
00:14:56,884 --> 00:14:58,386
Don’t be a nuisance.

208
00:15:06,446 --> 00:15:10,454
Don’t call me that.
- I was kidding.

209
00:16:31,753 --> 00:16:33,298
What are you doing here?

210
00:16:33,632 --> 00:16:34,883
Waiting for you.

211
00:16:35,218 --> 00:16:36,388
Why?

212
00:16:38,183 --> 00:16:43,444
I tried to call you a million times to buy bread.

213
00:16:45,031 --> 00:16:49,208
You’re soaking wet.
How long did you wait?

214
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:51,461
I don’t know. Not long.

215
00:16:53,216 --> 00:16:55,010
Where were you?
Out with your girlfriends?

216
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:57,015
No.

217
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,938
I didn’t go anywhere.

218
00:17:01,357 --> 00:17:03,445
Then why didn’t you pick up?

219
00:17:05,365 --> 00:17:06,995
What’s the matter with you?

220
00:17:10,878 --> 00:17:12,926
Something’s wrong.

221
00:17:14,594 --> 00:17:17,059
What is it, tell me!

222
00:17:23,239 --> 00:17:24,490
Is it your father?

223
00:17:27,706 --> 00:17:29,795
He...

224
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,297
Where is he?

225
00:17:33,092 --> 00:17:34,512
In the kitchen.

226
00:17:45,033 --> 00:17:46,663
What happened?

227
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:54,888
I was in the kitchen... with my back to him...
he came in and grabbed me...

228
00:17:56,143 --> 00:17:57,143
He was drunk.

229
00:17:57,769 --> 00:18:02,281
I fought back... I asked him what he was doing.
He kept telling me he wasn’t my father.

230
00:18:03,241 --> 00:18:06,373
I fought back...

231
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,130
but he kept coming...

232
00:18:12,428 --> 00:18:14,430
he tried to hug me.

233
00:18:20,068 --> 00:18:24,285
Then he took his pants off, he said
there’s nothing wrong with that...

234
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:27,042
because he’s not my father.

235
00:18:31,887 --> 00:18:33,931
I opened a drawer
and took a knife...

236
00:18:34,222 --> 00:18:37,981
just to scare him off...

237
00:18:42,158 --> 00:18:44,037
to make him leave me alone.

238
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:48,130
He wasn’t scared...

239
00:18:49,882 --> 00:18:52,930
Said I wouldn’t do it
and jumped me.

240
00:18:58,735 --> 00:19:00,363
What are we going to do, mom?

241
00:19:04,371 --> 00:19:05,583
I don’t know.

242
00:19:08,298 --> 00:19:10,718
You should change, you’ll catch a cold.

243
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:16,982
Paula, remember!

244
00:19:17,274 --> 00:19:19,862
I killed him.

245
00:19:19,904 --> 00:19:22,577
You saw nothing
because you were out.

246
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,377
It’s important that you remember.

247
00:21:08,137 --> 00:21:09,389
Hush.

248
00:21:09,765 --> 00:21:13,564
Who can that be?
- I don’t know, go away.

249
00:21:16,028 --> 00:21:17,950
Raimunda, it’s me, Emilio.

250
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,1000
I’ll be right there.

251
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,516
What is it?

252
00:21:29,725 --> 00:21:31,980
Sorry I’m bothering you
this late.

253
00:21:32,062 --> 00:21:34,402
Thing is, tomorrow
I’m going to Barcelona, and I want

254
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:37,409
to leave you the restaurant key
if someone wants to see it.

255
00:21:38,202 --> 00:21:40,916
No problem, but you know
I’m not home all day.

256
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:43,03
Paco is home, right?

257
00:21:43,337 --> 00:21:44,757
Paco?

258
00:21:45,801 --> 00:21:49,433
He found a new job.
It’s his first day tomorrow.

259
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:52,815
What’s this? Are you hurt?
- It’s just a scratch.

260
00:21:54,404 --> 00:21:58,954
I remembered I’ll be home most of the day
now that Paco has a job.

261
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:02,086
Give me the key.

262
00:22:03,254 --> 00:22:06,303
Here, it’s my brother’s phone number
and this is my cell.

263
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:11,273
You’re leaving tomorrow?
- Early morning.

264
00:22:12,107 --> 00:22:16,032
Just out of curiosity, how much
do you want for the restaurant? I really like it.

265
00:22:16,743 --> 00:22:18,830
It’s a pity
you don’t like the owner that much.

266
00:22:18,997 --> 00:22:20,209
For Christ’s sake, Emilio.

267
00:22:20,334 --> 00:22:23,758
5 mil. asking price
but we can negotiate.

268
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:28,100
I understand. Good bye,
we’ll miss you.

269
00:22:28,267 --> 00:22:29,897
I’ll miss you more.

270
00:22:33,195 --> 00:22:35,031
Good luck.
- Thanks.

271
00:22:38,164 --> 00:22:40,253
Emilio is leaving?
- Yes.

272
00:22:41,879 --> 00:22:46,013
Go to your room, Paula.
- I want to be with you.

273
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,777
I’ll need your help later.

274
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:57,455
Don’t pick up.

275
00:22:59,835 --> 00:23:01,797
It’s one of your girlfriends.

276
00:23:05,429 --> 00:23:10,024
Pick up and tell her
you can’t talk right now. It’s late.

277
00:23:12,487 --> 00:23:16,497
I can’t talk right now.
- What? It’s aunt Solia.

278
00:23:16,956 --> 00:23:19,586
Get your mother on the phone.
- Mom, it’s aunt Solia.

279
00:23:19,961 --> 00:23:21,465
Tell her I’m busy.

280
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,267
She’s busy right now.
- Give her the phone, it’s urgent.

281
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:28,897
Mom, you have to take this.

282
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:36,664
Solia, I have so much laundry...

283
00:23:36,664 --> 00:23:38,208
Augustina called.

284
00:23:39,421 --> 00:23:41,173
Aunt Paula died.

285
00:23:41,508 --> 00:23:44,264
When?
- Just now.

286
00:23:47,353 --> 00:23:49,651
Aunt Paula died.

287
00:23:52,238 --> 00:23:55,286
I swear, the whole time
I was thinking of how to take her.

288
00:23:57,333 --> 00:24:00,924
And now, she died all alone.
- Don’t cry, honey.

289
00:24:02,343 --> 00:24:04,515
Augustina said not to worry.

290
00:24:04,598 --> 00:24:07,396
She’ll take care of everything
until we get there.

291
00:24:07,897 --> 00:24:11,030
Before she died, aunt Paula
picked a color for her grave

292
00:24:11,113 --> 00:24:13,409
and paid for everything.
It’s unreal,

293
00:24:13,492 --> 00:24:16,959
the way she arranged everything,
so rational to the very last.

294
00:24:17,209 --> 00:24:19,465
I can’t make it
to her funeral.

295
00:24:19,673 --> 00:24:21,593
As much as I hate to say it.

296
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:25,267
I’m very busy.
- What? How can you say that?

297
00:24:25,894 --> 00:24:27,981
It’s true, I can’t make it.

298
00:24:29,986 --> 00:24:32,367
You have to go alone.
- Alone?

299
00:24:33,453 --> 00:24:36,334
You know that I get panic attacks
when I see dead people.

300
00:24:36,793 --> 00:24:40,717
You don’t have to see her. I’ll ask
Augustina to take care of everything.

301
00:24:40,884 --> 00:24:42,597
And if they ask me about you?

302
00:24:42,931 --> 00:24:46,022
Tell them I just had surgery.
Think of something.

303
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:49,863
Listen, I’ll visit soon,
just not right now.

304
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:53,453
I don’t understand you, Raimunda.
Aunt Paula loved you so much.

305
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:55,247
I loved her, too.

306
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:59,508
Solia, one day I’ll explain.

307
00:24:59,633 --> 00:25:01,470
You’ll be shocked.
- I’m shocked already.

308
00:25:01,512 --> 00:25:04,811
Calm down, Solia. Take a Valium.
I’ll take one, too.

309
00:25:05,186 --> 00:25:06,816
And just go tomorrow.

310
00:25:08,193 --> 00:25:10,365
Okay?
- Okay.

311
00:25:30,491 --> 00:25:31,576
The door.

312
00:26:56,259 --> 00:26:59,056
Wait here, don’t come with me.

313
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,647
I hope nothing has changed
since I worked here.

314
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:47,874
Stop! Don’t come near!

315
00:28:48,582 --> 00:28:49,668
Sorry.

316
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:52,799
What do you want?

317
00:28:53,342 --> 00:28:55,305
I wanted to see
if the restaurant was open.

318
00:28:55,305 --> 00:28:56,099
We’re closed.

319
00:28:56,976 --> 00:29:00,190
Why? Can you help me?

320
00:29:01,903 --> 00:29:08,041
We’re shooting a film nearby
and the crew needs a place to eat.

321
00:29:08,793 --> 00:29:11,381
Do you know of any other place around?

322
00:29:13,426 --> 00:29:15,140
How many of you?

323
00:29:15,348 --> 00:29:17,603
25... 30 people.

324
00:29:19,398 --> 00:29:21,279
Lend me a hand.

325
00:29:22,822 --> 00:29:26,705
I can manage that, no problem.
Really?

326
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:30,256
Lunch for 30.

327
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:35,433
When should I expect you?
- We’re done at 15:30, and we need...

328
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:38,023
16:00 sound good?
- Okay.

329
00:29:38,189 --> 00:29:39,483
Terrific.

330
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,489
How much are you paying?

331
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:44,953
300 euro.

332
00:29:45,161 --> 00:29:46,039
Okay.

333
00:29:48,085 --> 00:29:51,926
Sorry I yelled at you.
You just scared me.

334
00:29:53,932 --> 00:29:56,102
No problem. See you at 16:00.
Thank you.

335
00:29:56,143 --> 00:29:58,441
You’re welcome. Bye.
- See you.

336
00:30:00,487 --> 00:30:02,741
No problem. It’s already 10:00.

337
00:30:07,627 --> 00:30:10,342
Please, can I have
2 more kilos.

338
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,762
All right.
- How much are the potatoes?

339
00:30:13,306 --> 00:30:15,643
4 kilos for 1,60 euro.

340
00:30:16,311 --> 00:30:19,068
I’ll take 8.
- Okay.

341
00:30:23,245 --> 00:30:25,331
Hi, Katrina.
- Hello, Raimunda.

342
00:30:25,665 --> 00:30:28,421
Where to?
- I’m cooking lunch for 30 people.

343
00:30:28,672 --> 00:30:30,718
Can you lend me 100?

344
00:30:30,969 --> 00:30:32,638
Sorry, I’m broke, too.

345
00:30:32,763 --> 00:30:35,061
Just got out of acupuncture.
They turned me into a hedgehog.

346
00:30:35,729 --> 00:30:39,278
Please, I’ll pay it back tomorrow.
- Cost me 10,80...

347
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:41,032
Thank you so much.

348
00:30:41,282 --> 00:30:44,123
I’ll bring it over later today.
- Thanks.

349
00:30:44,248 --> 00:30:46,627
I’ll have to go on a diet.
- Won’t hurt you any.

350
00:30:50,886 --> 00:30:52,933
Hi, Ines.
So you’re back from your village.

351
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,478
Yes, since last night.
How are you?

352
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:59,111
Did you happen to bring
any sausages or blood pudding?

353
00:30:59,488 --> 00:31:01,492
Sure, how did you know?

354
00:31:01,575 --> 00:31:04,040
My blood pudding is finger-licking fresh.

355
00:31:04,124 --> 00:31:07,171
I need 1,5 kilos.
- That much?

356
00:31:07,213 --> 00:31:09,844
I’m cooking for 30.
- Who’s visiting?

357
00:31:09,928 --> 00:31:13,769
Long story, tell you later.
Give me credit, I’ll pay tomorrow?

358
00:31:13,852 --> 00:31:16,066
Okay, no problem.
- Thanks.

359
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:18,737
Wait, do you have anything sweet?

360
00:31:19,154 --> 00:31:21,994
Of course. Doughnuts.
They’re to die for.

361
00:31:22,453 --> 00:31:26,213
With cholesterol that high,
you shouldn’t be eating those.

362
00:31:26,547 --> 00:31:29,387
It’s my only weakness.
I brought three boxes.

363
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:32,474
Don’t eat all of them.
- What should I do, give them away?

364
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,563
Sell them to me, you’ll make a profit.

365
00:31:35,022 --> 00:31:36,818
Can I at least try them?

366
00:31:36,943 --> 00:31:40,159
Have a few, but not too much.
Deliver them to my place?

367
00:31:40,492 --> 00:31:43,082
Okay, see you soon.
- See you.

368
00:31:43,124 --> 00:31:45,01
Bye.
- Bye, sweetie.

369
00:31:58,364 --> 00:32:01,244
Anybody else want pork-chops?

370
00:32:04,335 --> 00:32:05,02
What about you?

371
00:32:15,525 --> 00:32:17,113
Just a bit more?

372
00:32:52,565 --> 00:32:53,942
Augustina?

373
00:32:58,451 --> 00:33:00,373
Is that you, Augustina?

374
00:33:07,637 --> 00:33:10,769
Soledat, daughter.

375
00:33:13,192 --> 00:33:16,198
Solie, I have to talk to you.

376
00:33:35,907 --> 00:33:37,410
Solie.

377
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,096
All right.

378
00:33:47,139 --> 00:33:48,976
It’s okay, calm down.

379
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:55,157
Where is she?
- Upstairs, in my mother’s room.

380
00:33:55,533 --> 00:34:00,209
Better this way, I brought her here
to be close to the body.

381
00:34:01,01 --> 00:34:02,799
Thank you, Augustina.

382
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:06,974
Let’s go to the next room.

383
00:34:13,862 --> 00:34:15,034
Good evening.

384
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:19,917
I spoke with your sister, poor thing,
just out of surgery.

385
00:34:20,251 --> 00:34:21,546
Yes, just now.

386
00:34:21,672 --> 00:34:26,264
Calm down, you don’t have to
see the body.

387
00:34:30,606 --> 00:34:33,488
My condolences.
Such a pity.

388
00:34:46,224 --> 00:34:49,356
Santa’s daughter.

389
00:34:50,232 --> 00:34:54,032
Please, let her catch her breath,
she’s tired from the journey.

390
00:34:54,408 --> 00:34:56,871
Come here, Solie. Calm down

391
00:35:03,802 --> 00:35:05,724
It happened during the night.

392
00:35:06,517 --> 00:35:09,190
I had finished dinner and was
watching TV

393
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:13,448
then I heard a knock on the door.

394
00:35:14,744 --> 00:35:19,920
I thought I’d imagined it,
but then I heard it again.

395
00:35:21,09 --> 00:35:23,429
"Who is it?" I asked.

396
00:35:24,179 --> 00:35:28,774
And then I heard a voice say:
"Augustina".

397
00:35:30,401 --> 00:35:33,826
I went out on the street,
nobody in sight.

398
00:35:34,244 --> 00:35:36,414
But I wasn’t afraid.

399
00:35:36,497 --> 00:35:40,131
I looked at your aunt’s house.

400
00:35:40,673 --> 00:35:42,428
The front door was open.

401
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,352
That’s odd, I thought.
So I went over...

402
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:49,275
called your aunt but no answer.

403
00:35:50,527 --> 00:35:53,409
Of course, she couldn’t have
answered, bless her soul.

404
00:35:54,413 --> 00:35:58,672
I went into the bedroom and found her.

405
00:35:59,255 --> 00:36:01,887
She was just lying there,
small as a bird.

406
00:36:02,179 --> 00:36:03,975
Her spirit called you.

407
00:36:04,685 --> 00:36:07,146
Hers or that of another woman.
- Who else?

408
00:36:08,776 --> 00:36:10,865
I don’t know, I didn’t see her.

409
00:36:12,158 --> 00:36:18,506
Someone or something called
to bring me news of her death...

410
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,804
and opened the front door for me.

411
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,477
Let’s go to the kitchen.

412
00:36:32,994 --> 00:36:35,668
You must be starving.
- Yes.

413
00:36:36,919 --> 00:36:39,467
I haven’t had a bite
since yesterday morning.

414
00:36:39,843 --> 00:36:41,263
I knew it.

415
00:36:42,806 --> 00:36:46,898
Look, you scored a celery.
- That should be enough.

416
00:36:53,707 --> 00:36:55,835
What were the women talking about?

417
00:36:57,297 --> 00:37:00,094
Just shooting the breeze,
you know how it is here.

418
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,974
They were talking about my mother.

419
00:37:03,183 --> 00:37:05,022
Yes, they say they saw her.

420
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:10,367
They say she came back
to take care of your aunt.

421
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:14,042
Has she visited you?

422
00:37:15,02 --> 00:37:17,424
No, what about you?
- Me, neither.

423
00:37:17,465 --> 00:37:20,346
But things like that do happen.
- I don’t know.

424
00:37:20,765 --> 00:37:23,812
My grandmother was visited
by my grandfather’s ghost.

425
00:37:24,856 --> 00:37:26,609
May he rest in peace.

426
00:37:27,529 --> 00:37:28,865
Go on, eat.

427
00:37:29,782 --> 00:37:32,246
She was terrified at first.

428
00:37:32,496 --> 00:37:34,752
But then she asked him
why he had come back.

429
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:37,593
The deal was, she hadn’t kept
a promise she had made.

430
00:37:37,926 --> 00:37:43,144
So she kept it— she took the whole
village to the cemetery.

431
00:37:43,271 --> 00:37:45,943
He was appeased and she didn’t
see him any more.

432
00:37:49,995 --> 00:37:51,204
Here.

433
00:37:52,248 --> 00:37:55,087
I haven’t told you this before.

434
00:38:27,616 --> 00:38:30,246
Do you want to go to your aunt’s
place to look around,

435
00:38:30,246 --> 00:38:32,083
maybe take something to remember her by?
- No, thanks.

436
00:38:32,124 --> 00:38:36,07
Maybe later, with Raimunda.
- Tell her everything went well.

437
00:38:36,385 --> 00:38:38,554
The whole village came to her funeral.

438
00:38:38,763 --> 00:38:40,894
I’ll tell her by all means.

439
00:38:41,478 --> 00:38:43,818
She’d hate to have missed it.

440
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:50,206
Go on, get going.

441
00:39:50,501 --> 00:39:52,548
Solia, open up.

442
00:39:56,890 --> 00:40:00,314
Open up.
It’s your mother.

443
00:40:08,414 --> 00:40:11,254
My mother is dead.

444
00:40:13,509 --> 00:40:15,765
You must be her ghost.

445
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,022
Call me whatever you like,
just get me out of here.

446
00:40:19,022 --> 00:40:21,025
I’m in the trunk.

447
00:40:21,234 --> 00:40:25,075
Of course, mom, anything for you.

448
00:40:34,803 --> 00:40:39,733
Soledat, daughter.
Don’t be afraid.

449
00:40:41,109 --> 00:40:42,947
I am your mother.

450
00:40:43,992 --> 00:40:46,287
Don’t you want to hug me?

451
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:00,818
Help me out.

452
00:41:05,371 --> 00:41:07,791
Aunt’s suitcase?
- Yes.

453
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:16,227
What’s in them?
- Clothes, and some of her valuables.

454
00:41:16,268 --> 00:41:19,859
Good thing I managed to hide them
before the neighbors got here.

455
00:41:19,901 --> 00:41:23,700
Everyone except Augustina was scoping,
but I had managed to clean up.

456
00:41:24,118 --> 00:41:26,290
Augustina deserves a present.

457
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:30,549
She did more for Paula
than your sister did.

458
00:41:30,549 --> 00:41:33,765
A true hero,
she even managed the funeral.

459
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,147
Thanks for coming.

460
00:41:38,317 --> 00:41:40,611
I’m deathly tired.

461
00:41:43,327 --> 00:41:46,625
Are you staying the night here?
- Of course, where else?

462
00:41:48,213 --> 00:41:51,679
My god. No wonder you were scared!

463
00:41:51,762 --> 00:41:55,019
Do you still have the beauty parlor?
- Yes, I do.

464
00:41:56,104 --> 00:42:01,238
We can adapt this room. Tomorrow,
give me a haircut and dye my hair.

465
00:42:02,035 --> 00:42:04,204
Okay.
- I’ll need clothes.

466
00:42:04,454 --> 00:42:08,882
I don’t intend to just stay in here.

467
00:42:09,131 --> 00:42:11,304
Nobody knows me here.

468
00:42:11,388 --> 00:42:13,515
Back where I was I couldn’t even
stick my nose out.

469
00:42:14,183 --> 00:42:16,397
Can you imagine?

470
00:42:18,987 --> 00:42:20,614
Are you staying long?

471
00:42:21,409 --> 00:42:24,666
Can’t wait to get rid of me?
- Not at all! Just asking.

472
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:28,966
I’ll stay as long as God wills it.

473
00:42:31,723 --> 00:42:37,442
If you’re tired of me, just tell me.

474
00:42:37,945 --> 00:42:40,949
You’re divorced, it’s better for you
to live with your mother.

475
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:42,328
Unless there’s another man...

476
00:42:42,411 --> 00:42:44,667
No, mom, I’m alone.

477
00:42:44,792 --> 00:42:46,419
As usual.

478
00:42:46,753 --> 00:42:48,259
Not anymore.

479
00:42:50,303 --> 00:42:51,641
Answer the phone.

480
00:42:54,103 --> 00:42:55,983
Are you back yet?
- Yes, I am.

481
00:42:56,233 --> 00:43:00,867
I couldn’t find you.
I just spoke with Augustina.

482
00:43:00,908 --> 00:43:02,330
Yes, everything went great.

483
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:06,04
The whole village came.
The whole day I thought of you.

484
00:43:06,421 --> 00:43:08,510
I wanted badly to be there.

485
00:43:09,261 --> 00:43:11,432
300, right?

486
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:14,565
And for the drinks?
- Drinks are on the house.

487
00:43:15,107 --> 00:43:19,074
Same time tomorrow?
Everyone loved it.

488
00:43:19,115 --> 00:43:20,535
Glad to hear it.

489
00:43:20,535 --> 00:43:25,296
Just one thing, if the portions were larger
it would have been perfect.

490
00:43:25,587 --> 00:43:28,678
No problem. Tomorrow I’ll feed you so much
you won’t be able to walk.

491
00:43:28,845 --> 00:43:31,267
Great. See you tomorrow, then.
- See you.

492
00:43:34,273 --> 00:43:37,364
Solie, I’m sorry.
- Did you start in a restaurant?

493
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,701
Yes, Emilio left me his.

494
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:42,206
Now, that’s news!
- It’s not just that.

495
00:43:42,624 --> 00:43:44,503
Paco left us.

496
00:43:45,129 --> 00:43:48,053
That’s why I couldn’t
make it to the funeral.

497
00:43:48,053 --> 00:43:50,265
You called in the middle of an argument.

498
00:43:50,556 --> 00:43:52,853
I knew that something bad was happening.

499
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:56,528
Did he beat you?
- No, Paco never laid a hand on me.

500
00:43:57,364 --> 00:43:59,451
He just left.

501
00:43:59,702 --> 00:44:00,872
Forever.

502
00:44:01,289 --> 00:44:03,209
He’ll be back, you’ll see.

503
00:44:03,501 --> 00:44:05,714
I don’t think so.
- Why?

504
00:44:06,175 --> 00:44:07,929
Call it intuition.

505
00:44:08,931 --> 00:44:11,603
All right, then. Kisses.

506
00:44:12,313 --> 00:44:14,235
To you, too.
- See you soon.

507
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:19,036
You know, neither of us
has had any luck with men.

508
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:21,916
Raimunda and I failed,
but not you.

509
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,544
What about me?

510
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,966
Father adored you.

511
00:44:26,049 --> 00:44:28,222
Raimunda said you’re lucky

512
00:44:28,305 --> 00:44:30,895
you died in the arms of your lover.

513
00:44:31,354 --> 00:44:33,942
Raimunda is a good egg,
but her tongue can be evil.

514
00:44:35,446 --> 00:44:38,159
I turned a blind eye to your father
and he took advantage.

515
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:40,079
He cheated on me till the very end.

516
00:44:40,624 --> 00:44:44,590
What are you saying?
- It’s true.

517
00:44:44,841 --> 00:44:47,556
I kept quiet, didn’t want you to know.

518
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:50,520
Enough about this, let the bygones
be bygones.

519
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:54,028
Will his ghost return?
- I hope not.

520
00:44:54,528 --> 00:44:57,702
What about your husband?
- My husband?

521
00:44:58,078 --> 00:45:01,042
Can he come back?
- I don’t think so.

522
00:45:01,668 --> 00:45:04,925
No word in two years.
- You’re better off.

523
00:45:05,593 --> 00:45:07,556
It’s just the two of us.

524
00:45:57,622 --> 00:46:00,920
How much did you pay for this? 10?
- 10,80.

525
00:46:01,129 --> 00:46:03,802
I’ll give you 3 euro more.

526
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:07,059
And I’ll pay you for 4 boxes
instead of three.

527
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:10,609
Thank you.
- So they won’t say I’ve used you.

528
00:46:12,528 --> 00:46:15,952
Can you help me with the fridge.

529
00:46:15,994 --> 00:46:18,917
I just finished eating.
- I need to bring it downstairs.

530
00:46:19,043 --> 00:46:22,257
Go ahead, tilt it towards you.

531
00:46:23,553 --> 00:46:27,061
Yep, that’s right. You got it.

532
00:46:29,691 --> 00:46:33,866
Now, watch the stairs, no rush.
Careful! That’s good.

533
00:46:37,332 --> 00:46:40,046
Left. Terrific!

534
00:46:42,592 --> 00:46:47,271
Can it fit through the elevator door?
- This side first.

535
00:46:48,189 --> 00:46:52,572
Watch out! Okay.
- My god, it’s like an elephant.

536
00:46:53,242 --> 00:46:56,416
Now we can call the elevator.

537
00:47:08,607 --> 00:47:10,445
Kitchen’s this way.

538
00:47:13,159 --> 00:47:14,912
The room keeps cool throughout the day.

539
00:47:14,996 --> 00:47:17,210
What about this freezer?
- Not working.

540
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:21,885
So, this is your restaurant?
- At least while you’re shooting.

541
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:27,731
You can count on me.
I can help you make the dessert.

542
00:47:27,856 --> 00:47:30,154
And I can wait on the tables.

543
00:47:30,446 --> 00:47:35,414
I don’t know if we’ll be open tonight,
but I appreciate the thought.

544
00:47:39,257 --> 00:47:40,717
Mom?

545
00:47:43,891 --> 00:47:48,274
Do you need me to do anything?
- I need a haircut.

546
00:47:49,655 --> 00:47:55,584
I mean something you wanted
while you were alive,

547
00:47:55,667 --> 00:47:57,880
that doesn’t let you rest in peace.

548
00:47:59,133 --> 00:48:02,096
When you die, a lot of what you did
is left unfinished.

549
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:04,310
And a lot of what you finished
was done wrong.

550
00:48:04,644 --> 00:48:06,774
I just don’t know if anything can be fixed.

551
00:48:07,316 --> 00:48:11,575
And if it can,
is it my business to fix it?

552
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,496
Who knows.

553
00:48:15,877 --> 00:48:18,255
My clients will come any minute now.

554
00:48:18,465 --> 00:48:22,642
What are we going to do?
- We’ll serve them. I’ll help.

555
00:48:22,642 --> 00:48:24,603
I can’t introduce you as my mother.

556
00:48:24,603 --> 00:48:26,023
Everyone knows I’m an orphan.

557
00:48:26,232 --> 00:48:29,030
Then tell them I’m a foreigner.

558
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:30,825
Foreigner? From where?

559
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:34,875
The Dominican Republic.
- No, that won’t work.

560
00:48:34,959 --> 00:48:37,548
Too many Dominicans around,
they know the accent.

561
00:48:38,634 --> 00:48:41,764
Chinese then.
Madrid is full of Chinese.

562
00:48:42,017 --> 00:48:43,895
Mom, you make a poor Chinese woman.

563
00:48:43,895 --> 00:48:47,193
We need something exotic.
That we don’t have any of.

564
00:48:47,486 --> 00:48:49,491
Russian.

565
00:48:52,206 --> 00:48:55,420
You think I look more Russian
than Chinese?

566
00:48:55,504 --> 00:48:57,632
Yes, Russians look just like us.

567
00:48:57,716 --> 00:49:01,139
Just keep quiet, whatever you hear.

568
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,397
And pretend you don’t understand any of it.

569
00:49:04,981 --> 00:49:07,194
Let me show you how we do things.

570
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:10,201
Here we do haircuts and dyeing,
and here’s where we wash.

571
00:49:12,081 --> 00:49:14,501
If the client is tall,
don’t use a pillow.

572
00:49:14,585 --> 00:49:16,172
If she’s short, you use it.

573
00:49:17,257 --> 00:49:19,221
This carpet’s here so you won’t slip.

574
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:23,062
Here’s where you hang the showerhead.

575
00:49:23,062 --> 00:49:27,237
I used to hang it down below
but I got backaches.

576
00:49:27,988 --> 00:49:30,286
Yes, I get those, too.

577
00:49:30,661 --> 00:49:34,127
Shampoos have a built-in doser.
Have a seat, mom.

578
00:49:39,306 --> 00:49:40,682
That’s good.

579
00:49:40,849 --> 00:49:43,522
Don’t use more than one towel per client.

580
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:45,236
They just get in the way.
- That’s right.

581
00:49:45,403 --> 00:49:50,537
Then press on the hair with one hand, and done.

582
00:49:51,247 --> 00:49:54,03
You’re so organized.
Proud of you, daughter.

583
00:50:00,267 --> 00:50:02,105
Hello.
- Good day.

584
00:50:04,778 --> 00:50:06,823
Hi.
- Hello.

585
00:50:07,198 --> 00:50:09,119
She’s Russian, doesn’t speak Spanish.

586
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,497
Poor thing.

587
00:50:10,664 --> 00:50:15,508
She was out begging, I took pity.
She reminds me of my mother.

588
00:50:15,508 --> 00:50:19,349
Solia, don’t take in Russians
They’re all Mafioso’s.

589
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:21,313
You have a kind heart.
People use you.

590
00:50:21,396 --> 00:50:24,067
You want it lighter?

591
00:50:25,113 --> 00:50:27,283
Wash hair. Yes?

592
00:50:27,325 --> 00:50:29,329
She was a hairdresser back home.

593
00:50:29,371 --> 00:50:31,877
How do you communicate?
- With gestures.

594
00:50:31,877 --> 00:50:34,716
She’s a fast learner,
soon she’ll speak enough Spanish.

595
00:50:35,09 --> 00:50:38,098
So many Russians around,
I’m not suprised.

596
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:46,115
So you’re Russian.
- Ruski.

597
00:50:53,297 --> 00:50:56,721
Russia, water not cold, not hot.

598
00:51:15,594 --> 00:51:18,894
Hello there.
- What’s up?

599
00:51:19,061 --> 00:51:20,858
Got a day off tomorrow.

600
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:23,986
Then so do we.

601
00:51:24,949 --> 00:51:29,125
We’ll be done next week
and we want to celebrate.

602
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:33,425
What would you like,
dinner or a party?

603
00:51:34,929 --> 00:51:36,681
Party sounds better.

604
00:51:37,057 --> 00:51:40,230
Could you reserve the balcony for us?

605
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,068
No problem.

606
00:51:45,451 --> 00:51:47,748
Don’t look at me like that,
I’m blushing.

607
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:50,044
I’ll stop if you do.

608
00:51:50,418 --> 00:51:52,966
Go get a drink,
I have more work to do.

609
00:51:56,974 --> 00:52:00,984
Since she came back
she’s sounded strange over the phone.

610
00:52:00,984 --> 00:52:03,908
If she asks you about Paco,
you know nothing.

611
00:52:03,908 --> 00:52:07,165
The less she knows, the better.

612
00:52:21,236 --> 00:52:23,323
Hello.
- Hi there.

613
00:52:24,368 --> 00:52:26,037
Anybody there?
- I don’t think so.

614
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:29,294
I have to use the restroom.
- Why?

615
00:52:29,503 --> 00:52:30,841
I need to pee.

616
00:52:31,342 --> 00:52:33,930
The pipes are clogged.
I’m waiting for the plumber.

617
00:52:33,971 --> 00:52:36,685
I’ll pour in water myself.
I really need to go, for heaven’s sake.

618
00:52:40,025 --> 00:52:41,571
Hello.

619
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:47,041
What’s with you.
- Not in the mood.

620
00:52:48,044 --> 00:52:50,632
Let me give you a haircut.
- I don’t want any.

621
00:52:50,674 --> 00:52:53,890
You have split ends.
- Okay, but just a trim.

622
00:53:00,571 --> 00:53:02,365
Listen...

623
00:53:02,698 --> 00:53:04,538
Is your father back yet?
- No.

624
00:53:05,831 --> 00:53:07,543
He’s gone forever.

625
00:53:08,296 --> 00:53:10,050
What a story.

626
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:12,095
I just don’t understand him.

627
00:53:14,809 --> 00:53:16,856
Did anyone die in here?

628
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,706
Or your mother.
- What?

629
00:53:24,748 --> 00:53:27,962
She’s so pushy.
When we were growing up.

630
00:53:27,962 --> 00:53:32,178
There weren’t any restrooms.

631
00:53:32,178 --> 00:53:35,269
We went in the chicken pen.

632
00:53:35,269 --> 00:53:38,484
Even then, I had to wait for her
She could spend hours among the hens.

633
00:53:39,864 --> 00:53:41,659
Raimunda.

634
00:54:15,146 --> 00:54:17,818
What’s this dress doing here?
- It’s mother’s.

635
00:54:18,696 --> 00:54:19,991
I know.

636
00:54:21,952 --> 00:54:23,498
And that smell.

637
00:54:24,917 --> 00:54:28,717
What smell?
- Same as in the toilet.

638
00:54:28,925 --> 00:54:32,391
Mom’s smell. Don’t you remember
how she farted all day long.

639
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,117
Yes, I remember.

640
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:44,960
You couldn’t breathe.
Remember?

641
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:51,308
When we had guests...

642
00:54:53,771 --> 00:54:55,106
a barrel of laughs!

643
00:55:01,871 --> 00:55:06,340
Why did you bring these here?
Don’t complain to me about nightmares.

644
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,011
Dead people’s clothes are to be given away.

645
00:55:13,647 --> 00:55:15,650
Aunt Paula’s suitcase.

646
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,521
The old doll.

647
00:55:39,121 --> 00:55:41,684
What’s this?
Jewelry?

648
00:55:43,323 --> 00:55:45,364
What were you going to do with it?

649
00:55:47,047 --> 00:55:48,486
Nothing.
- Nothing?

650
00:55:48,688 --> 00:55:52,809
As in keep it to yourself?
- Raimunda, don’t say that.

651
00:55:53,452 --> 00:55:55,292
I didn’t bring the suitcase.

652
00:55:56,293 --> 00:55:57,695
Then who did?

653
00:55:59,615 --> 00:56:02,697
When I came back from the funeral
it was waiting for me here.

654
00:56:03,817 --> 00:56:05,338
What?

655
00:56:07,299 --> 00:56:09,182
What kind of nonsense is that?

656
00:56:10,301 --> 00:56:15,064
You think I’ll buy that?
You’ve no conscience.

657
00:56:19,349 --> 00:56:21,830
Raimunda, don’t leave this way.

658
00:56:52,494 --> 00:56:54,294
We need a new fridge.

659
00:56:55,374 --> 00:56:57,936
Why don’t you repair the old one?

660
00:56:58,857 --> 00:57:00,697
It’s too far gone.

661
00:57:01,898 --> 00:57:03,900
Its motor’s still running.

662
00:57:04,579 --> 00:57:07,224
I told you not to go in there.

663
00:57:07,501 --> 00:57:09,664
I saw the door was open
and came in to get a hammer.

664
00:57:11,065 --> 00:57:14,667
Did someone else go in there, you think?
- I don’t think so.

665
00:57:20,072 --> 00:57:22,072
Mom, you said
you got rid of the body.

666
00:57:22,753 --> 00:57:24,756
I haven’t had the time.

667
00:57:24,957 --> 00:57:27,637
Do you think I enjoy
keeping a dead body around?

668
00:57:31,639 --> 00:57:36,162
Paula, get ready.
They’ll be here in half an hour.

669
00:57:39,764 --> 00:57:41,06
Paula?

670
00:57:44,329 --> 00:57:46,571
What is it?
You haven’t even changed yet.

671
00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:48,051
I’m not in a party mood.

672
00:57:48,612 --> 00:57:51,013
Me neither, but this is our job.

673
00:57:51,732 --> 00:57:53,736
So get up, lazybones.

674
00:57:53,817 --> 00:57:55,815
You need help?

675
00:57:58,060 --> 00:57:59,139
What is it?

676
00:57:59,258 --> 00:58:02,983
I can’t get it out of my head.
He’s too close, in that storage room.

677
00:58:04,584 --> 00:58:07,666
You’ll drive me crazy, too,
with such thoughts.

678
00:58:08,064 --> 00:58:11,946
Mom, I can’t help thinking it.
I killed my father.

679
00:58:12,228 --> 00:58:14,270
Paco was not your father.

680
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:17,192
Stop lying to me.

681
00:58:17,352 --> 00:58:20,395
I know you just want to make me
feel better.

682
00:58:20,752 --> 00:58:24,557
It’s true.
Paco was not your real father.

683
00:58:24,997 --> 00:58:26,959
He took us in.

684
00:58:32,201 --> 00:58:35,044
So he was telling the truth.
- Yes.

685
00:58:36,083 --> 00:58:37,925
But that doesn’t excuse him.

686
00:58:41,727 --> 00:58:44,929
I promise, Paula, I’ll tell you
everything, but not now.

687
00:58:45,852 --> 00:58:48,814
Go on, get dressed.
We don’t have much time.

688
00:58:49,374 --> 00:58:51,015
Who is my father, then?

689
00:58:52,816 --> 00:58:55,417
A man from the village.
- Do I know him?

690
00:58:57,138 --> 00:58:59,821
I promise to tell you everything.

691
00:59:00,221 --> 00:59:02,503
Later.

692
00:59:02,822 --> 00:59:04,304
Okay?

693
00:59:04,344 --> 00:59:05,986
Okay, remember you promised.

694
00:59:17,675 --> 00:59:20,435
Two Mohitos.
- Two Mohitos. And for you?

695
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:23,877
Two more.
Yes, lemon makes them tastier.

696
00:59:43,171 --> 00:59:45,333
Here you go.
- Thanks.

697
00:59:48,735 --> 00:59:52,057
Mm, delicious.
You sure know how to make them.

698
00:59:52,258 --> 00:59:55,461
Our cleavages are more delicious.

699
00:59:56,099 --> 01:00:00,505
Enough work, let’s have some fun
We’re off now.

700
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:04,668
What counts for me is for the clients
to have fun and be happy.

701
01:00:04,785 --> 01:00:05,748
More Mohitos?

702
01:00:06,346 --> 01:00:08,028
Bend down, they’ll see you.

703
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:10,750
I’d love to see Raimunda
and my grand-daughter.

704
01:00:12,112 --> 01:00:15,513
The other day I just glimpsed her leg.
- And you saw what happened?

705
01:00:17,276 --> 01:00:20,034
That’s her restaurant.

706
01:00:20,997 --> 01:00:23,238
Looks like business is good.

707
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,402
She deserves that.

708
01:00:25,841 --> 01:00:27,682
Poor thing, works so hard.

709
01:00:36,928 --> 01:00:41,251
Keep your head down or they’ll see you.
- Who’ll see me?

710
01:01:11,514 --> 01:01:14,154
What are you doing here?
I’m glad to see you.

711
01:01:14,636 --> 01:01:18,316
I brought aunt Paula’s things.
Didn’t know you had a party.

712
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:23,081
That’s the film crew’s party.
I cooked for them a whole week.

713
01:01:26,122 --> 01:01:27,163
Come on in.

714
01:01:27,243 --> 01:01:30,446
I never thought of stealing
aunt Paula’s things.

715
01:01:31,05 --> 01:01:33,568
I know. I just got carried away.

716
01:01:33,969 --> 01:01:36,091
You know me. I speak without thinking.

717
01:01:36,331 --> 01:01:37,333
Hi, auntie.
- Hello.

718
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:40,852
Anything to drink?
- No, thank you.

719
01:02:08,594 --> 01:02:10,994
You remember?
- Of course I do.

720
01:02:11,717 --> 01:02:14,238
It’s been years since I last heard you sing.

721
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:16,598
I’ve never heard her.

722
01:02:19,081 --> 01:02:21,762
Really?
- Never.

723
01:02:23,883 --> 01:02:26,885
Would you like to?
- Of course.

724
01:02:29,488 --> 01:02:30,489
Okay.

725
01:02:37,654 --> 01:02:39,095
I can’t believe it.

726
01:02:57,867 --> 01:02:59,948
Quiet, they’re about to sing.

727
01:03:04,992 --> 01:03:06,795
Good evening.

728
01:03:07,314 --> 01:03:11,796
I would like to thank the film crew
for letting us feed them.

729
01:03:12,557 --> 01:03:16,400
From the bottom of my heart.
My gift to you is a song.

730
01:03:17,441 --> 01:03:19,922
I’m a bit rusty
so don’t be too critical.

731
01:03:45,019 --> 01:03:48,902
She learned that song from your grandmother,
for the audition.

732
01:05:32,335 --> 01:05:33,456
”Auto Friends,” can I help you?

733
01:05:33,456 --> 01:05:39,537
I’m calling about the ad,
I’d like to rent a bus.

734
01:05:39,579 --> 01:05:41,502
Sure, how big and for how long?

735
01:05:41,941 --> 01:05:44,863
The normal size,
for a day.

736
01:05:49,947 --> 01:05:53,869
Yes?
- Can I speak to Raimunda?

737
01:05:53,989 --> 01:05:55,071
Speaking.

738
01:05:55,193 --> 01:05:58,633
I was given this number to schedule
a tour of the restaurant.

739
01:05:58,633 --> 01:06:01,718
They gave me your name.
My name’s Carlos.

740
01:06:04,959 --> 01:06:07,439
Pity you didn’t call earlier.

741
01:06:07,439 --> 01:06:10,323
Someone else took over the restaurant.

742
01:06:10,481 --> 01:06:12,724
Mr. Emilio didn’t tell me anything about that.

743
01:06:13,525 --> 01:06:15,966
He must have had his reasons.

744
01:06:16,244 --> 01:06:18,928
How can I get in touch with
whoever’s in charge?

745
01:06:19,169 --> 01:06:24,772
She’s not around today.
Best to call Emilio and ask him.

746
01:06:25,613 --> 01:06:29,096
Thank you. Good bye.
- Bye.

747
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:43,664
Hello?
- Emilio, hi. It’s Raimunda.

748
01:06:43,984 --> 01:06:46,707
Raiminda, nice to hear your voice.
Did a man call about the restaurant?

749
01:06:46,788 --> 01:06:51,910
Yes, but he sounded fishy,
said he wants to use it

750
01:06:52,070 --> 01:06:52,911
as a laundry.

751
01:06:53,071 --> 01:06:54,873
A laundry?
- You know, for dirty money…

752
01:06:55,112 --> 01:06:56,792
from drugs or prostitution.

753
01:06:56,792 --> 01:06:59,476
I told him it’s okay, go ahead.

754
01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:00,997
How could you say that?

755
01:07:02,998 --> 01:07:05,559
Okay, Emilio, I’ve been
meaning to call you.

756
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:10,524
I know it’s wrong but,
I kept the restaurant for myself.

757
01:07:12,566 --> 01:07:14,247
I’m sorry.

758
01:07:15,125 --> 01:07:17,06
You? You kept it for yourself?

759
01:07:18,090 --> 01:07:20,209
I should have told you earlier.

760
01:07:20,810 --> 01:07:23,012
I’m extremely disappointed.

761
01:07:23,291 --> 01:07:26,895
Sorry.
- I don’t understand, how did this happen?

762
01:07:26,935 --> 01:07:32,138
Thing is, this filming crew showed up
and I was desperate.

763
01:07:32,138 --> 01:07:34,061
I had no money, Paco left me.

764
01:07:34,102 --> 01:07:36,823
Paco left you?
- Yes.

765
01:07:36,982 --> 01:07:41,145
We got into a big fight.
I don’t think I’ll see him again.

766
01:07:43,066 --> 01:07:43,066
He left the same day
you left for Barcelona.

767
01:07:44,788 --> 01:07:46,149
How are you doing?

768
01:07:46,268 --> 01:07:50,871
It’s bad.
Trying to get my life back on track.

769
01:07:51,072 --> 01:07:54,994
I see.
What should I do now?

770
01:07:55,315 --> 01:07:58,716
Tell me how much rent I owe you
for the month and I’ll send it.

771
01:07:58,716 --> 01:08:00,438
Just give me a couple of days.

772
01:08:19,972 --> 01:08:22,812
Yes?
- Raimunda?

773
01:08:22,812 --> 01:08:24,296
Yes, who is it?
- It’s Augustina.

774
01:08:25,015 --> 01:08:27,656
I’m in Madrid, I’d like to see you.

775
01:08:28,697 --> 01:08:32,062
What luck, I can’t today.
I’m running errands.

776
01:08:32,062 --> 01:08:33,182
Tomorrow?

777
01:08:33,182 --> 01:08:35,103
Tomorrow’s busy, too.
The whole week’s busy.

778
01:08:35,263 --> 01:08:38,627
Too bad, I’m in the hospital.

779
01:08:38,858 --> 01:08:40,147
What happened?

780
01:08:40,147 --> 01:08:43,858
Cancer. Doctors say
it’s not looking good.

781
01:08:43,858 --> 01:08:45,231
I need to see you.

782
01:08:46,271 --> 01:08:48,152
Which hospital are you in?
I’ll come today.

783
01:08:48,712 --> 01:08:50,834
The central one.

784
01:08:51,596 --> 01:08:54,196
God bless you for this, Raimunda.

785
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:02,281
You go alone, I’m running late.

786
01:09:09,407 --> 01:09:11,649
Hi, auntie.
- What are you doing here?

787
01:09:11,649 --> 01:09:12,610
Solie.

788
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:16,852
Solie.
- Is this your mother I hear?

789
01:09:17,091 --> 01:09:19,415
Solie, come out.

790
01:09:21,415 --> 01:09:23,738
What?
- I’m leaving you Paula.

791
01:09:24,778 --> 01:09:25,376
Wait! I’ve work to do.

792
01:09:25,696 --> 01:09:29,09
Going to the hospital.
To see Augustina. She has cancer.

793
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:31,062
That’s terrible news.

794
01:09:31,381 --> 01:09:34,305
Paulina will bring you auntie’s handbag.
Keep it.

795
01:09:34,663 --> 01:09:37,826
I’ll try to be back soon.

796
01:09:38,187 --> 01:09:41,389
Say hi to Augustina.
Tell her to keep her chin up.

797
01:09:42,230 --> 01:09:43,470
Will do.

798
01:09:46,151 --> 01:09:48,075
Can I come in now?

799
01:09:49,313 --> 01:09:50,674
Yes, sweetie, come on in.

800
01:10:10,610 --> 01:10:11,959
How are you, dear?

801
01:10:15,374 --> 01:10:19,296
I knew that there was something
wrong with me.

802
01:10:20,176 --> 01:10:22,096
Don’t lose hope.

803
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:25,930
These flowers are beautiful.

804
01:10:26,178 --> 01:10:28,972
You didn’t need to do this.
Raimunda.

805
01:10:33,015 --> 01:10:37,108
Do me a favor.

806
01:10:37,588 --> 01:10:39,308
Just name it.

807
01:10:40,350 --> 01:10:41,911
Close the door.

808
01:10:46,065 --> 01:10:47,915
Grab a chair.

809
01:10:57,882 --> 01:10:59,952
I don’t have much time left.

810
01:11:00,993 --> 01:11:04,407
But before I go I need to know
what happened to my mother.

811
01:11:05,685 --> 01:11:07,448
What can I do?

812
01:11:08,288 --> 01:11:11,733
You can tell me
if she’s alive or dead.

813
01:11:12,852 --> 01:11:14,733
How would I know?

814
01:11:14,853 --> 01:11:17,176
Ask your mother.

815
01:11:17,856 --> 01:11:20,297
My mother?
She’s dead.

816
01:11:20,778 --> 01:11:26,224
She is. But she visited aunt Paula
to take care of her.

817
01:11:26,303 --> 01:11:27,784
The whole village knows.

818
01:11:28,303 --> 01:11:33,977
If she visits, ask her about my mother.
That’s all I want from you.

819
01:11:34,308 --> 01:11:36,910
But that’s crazy.

820
01:11:37,269 --> 01:11:39,711
Have you seen her?

821
01:11:40,233 --> 01:11:40,982
Not me.

822
01:11:41,273 --> 01:11:42,711
She never came to you?

823
01:11:43,553 --> 01:11:45,838
I think she avoided me.

824
01:11:46,235 --> 01:11:49,599
But I heard her talk to your aunt
many times.

825
01:11:50,989 --> 01:11:55,642
Okay, I’ll ask her if I see her
but I doubt it will happen.

826
01:11:56,164 --> 01:11:57,965
I really have to go now.

827
01:12:01,326 --> 01:12:03,968
I won’t ask you for anything else.

828
01:12:04,329 --> 01:12:05,930
You owe me, remember.

829
01:12:05,930 --> 01:12:08,172
I have to go, a lot of work to do.

830
01:12:08,892 --> 01:12:11,692
Stay a bit longer, your sister
wanted to talk to you.

831
01:12:12,294 --> 01:12:14,455
Some other time,
I really have to go.

832
01:12:14,818 --> 01:12:16,615
It’s about TV.

833
01:12:17,698 --> 01:12:20,421
She wanted to give you some tapes.

834
01:12:20,899 --> 01:12:26,906
From that audition you went to together as kids.

835
01:12:27,666 --> 01:12:35,630
Call her, please.
She’s expecting you to call.

836
01:12:35,990 --> 01:12:38,631
Tell my sister I don’t even like TV.

837
01:12:38,713 --> 01:12:43,677
Me, neither. I’ll tell her.
Don’t forget what I asked.

838
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:48,959
Your Russian friend seems to like TV.

839
01:12:50,03 --> 01:12:53,152
For someone who doesn’t understand
a word, she’s really into it.

840
01:12:53,445 --> 01:12:56,844
I’m pretty sure
they put something inside those TV sets.

841
01:12:56,844 --> 01:12:58,766
I can’t take my eyes off.

842
01:12:58,766 --> 01:13:03,570
It gets worse every day.
I just can’t stop. It’s like a drug.

843
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:08,412
I stayed up all night, too,
to watch a horror flick.

844
01:13:08,733 --> 01:13:11,334
Of course, after all those screams...

845
01:13:12,738 --> 01:13:14,616
Do you like the doll?

846
01:13:14,616 --> 01:13:17,299
Just like the ones in the horror flicks.

847
01:13:17,621 --> 01:13:23,305
It’s very old. Your mother played with it
when she was carrying you.

848
01:13:23,463 --> 01:13:25,627
Why didn’t the two of you live together?

849
01:13:26,025 --> 01:13:28,179
We had no money.

850
01:13:28,588 --> 01:13:33,389
Your father went to work in Venezuela
and left your mother with your aunt Paula.

851
01:13:33,470 --> 01:13:36,994
I stayed with your aunt Solia.

852
01:13:37,065 --> 01:13:39,144
What did your mother tell you?
- Nothing.

853
01:13:39,235 --> 01:13:41,557
She doesn’t like talking about it.

854
01:13:42,357 --> 01:13:44,960
How is she now?
- Better.

855
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,562
But still unbearable at times.

856
01:13:47,641 --> 01:13:49,280
Yes, she’s got a very strong personality.

857
01:13:49,559 --> 01:13:51,153
How did you two get along?

858
01:13:51,642 --> 01:13:54,884
She was my favorite as a child,

859
01:13:55,488 --> 01:13:57,930
but when she grew up...

860
01:13:58,449 --> 01:14:01,329
she began to drift away from me...

861
01:14:01,691 --> 01:14:05,124
for no particular reason,

862
01:14:05,124 --> 01:14:07,054
until we were little more than strangers.

863
01:14:08,537 --> 01:14:10,659
Your mother didn’t like me.

864
01:14:12,337 --> 01:14:16,090
It’s terrible when a daughter
doesn’t love her own mother.

865
01:14:18,173 --> 01:14:23,134
Now that you two are alone together
you must love her all the more.

866
01:14:23,547 --> 01:14:25,468
Make sure she can feel it.

867
01:14:26,749 --> 01:14:29,139
Why did you come back, Grandma?

868
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:33,793
I was lonely.

869
01:14:37,275 --> 01:14:39,558
Good day.
- Hello.

870
01:14:40,108 --> 01:14:44,560
I’d like 25 feet of scotch tape
and some packing paper.

871
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:47,520
How much tape?
- 4 or 5 rolls.

872
01:14:47,803 --> 01:14:48,643
Ah, okay.

873
01:14:49,843 --> 01:14:51,324
5 rolls of tape...

874
01:14:57,449 --> 01:15:00,572
add one more pickaxe and one more shovel.

875
01:15:00,653 --> 01:15:02,012
Sure.

876
01:15:35,634 --> 01:15:38,639
Okay, thanks a lot.
- Thank you for shopping.

877
01:15:40,121 --> 01:15:42,269
How are you, Raimunda?

878
01:15:42,269 --> 01:15:43,604
She’s lost it completely.

879
01:15:43,644 --> 01:15:44,924
Who, Augustina?

880
01:15:45,273 --> 01:15:47,275
Completely nuts.
- Hi, mom.

881
01:15:48,523 --> 01:15:50,966
What happened to you?
- Nothing.

882
01:15:51,726 --> 01:15:54,050
Bring me a glass of water, will you.

883
01:15:54,892 --> 01:15:57,813
Could she stay with you tonight?

884
01:15:57,813 --> 01:15:59,413
Sure, but where should I put her?

885
01:15:59,534 --> 01:16:01,613
Anywhere.

886
01:16:02,576 --> 01:16:06,287
Paco’s coming over today.
We need to talk in private.

887
01:16:08,289 --> 01:16:09,901
Sure.

888
01:16:10,702 --> 01:16:12,942
You’re staying here tonight.

889
01:16:17,784 --> 01:16:19,386
Okay, I’m off.

890
01:16:19,588 --> 01:16:21,509
Long night ahead of me.

891
01:16:50,968 --> 01:16:52,649
Hello.
- How are you?

892
01:16:53,168 --> 01:16:54,811
I need your help tonight.

893
01:16:54,890 --> 01:16:57,494
Can it wait till tomorrow?

894
01:16:57,494 --> 01:17:00,056
No. But I’ll pay you
like a regular customer.

895
01:17:00,284 --> 01:17:02,577
No way, I’ll give you a discount.

896
01:17:03,178 --> 01:17:06,939
I didn’t know you were seeing someone.
- Whatever gave you that idea?

897
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:10,863
Okay. How can I help?

898
01:17:11,663 --> 01:17:16,027
First we need to load up some furniture.
I'll explain on the way.

899
01:17:16,217 --> 01:17:17,028
Furniture?
- I’ll explain later.

900
01:17:17,028 --> 01:17:21,430
We can’t do it alone.
- Let me get the neighbor to help us.

901
01:17:21,631 --> 01:17:24,033
Put on something comfortable.
I’ll wait outside.

902
01:17:24,551 --> 01:17:27,394
What should I put on?
- Something more comfy.

903
01:17:29,264 --> 01:17:36,600
Careful. Just like that.
- Don’t drop it. Be careful.

904
01:17:39,082 --> 01:17:42,964
Come on. Push.

905
01:17:44,565 --> 01:17:46,848
One, two, three, lift!

906
01:17:48,888 --> 01:17:53,094
One more time.
One, two, three.

907
01:17:56,175 --> 01:17:59,698
Almost broke my back.
- That’s all. We’re done.

908
01:18:00,658 --> 01:18:04,980
Thank God!
- That’s how you do it.

909
01:18:07,662 --> 01:18:11,545
Where are we going?
- Hooker River.

910
01:18:11,665 --> 01:18:15,296
Where’s that?
- About 100 miles away.

911
01:18:15,428 --> 01:18:19,260
100 miles?
That’ll take the whole night.

912
01:18:19,631 --> 01:18:21,553
I told you I’ll pay you.

913
01:18:21,711 --> 01:18:25,235
For my company?
- And for helping me dig a hole

914
01:18:25,235 --> 01:18:27,266
and bury the fridge in it...

915
01:18:27,266 --> 01:18:28,436
no questions asked.

916
01:18:28,478 --> 01:18:31,760
Wait, I’m happy that you trust me

917
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:34,922
but you could at least tell me,
for heaven’s sake.

918
01:18:34,922 --> 01:18:37,313
I got enough problems as it is.
No ID papers,

919
01:18:37,313 --> 01:18:39,316
no job, no home,
and now thins.

920
01:18:39,966 --> 01:18:43,768
I’m asking you, how much do you want?
- Okay.

921
01:18:46,530 --> 01:18:51,573
Okay, I want the night shift.
- What night shift?

922
01:18:52,215 --> 01:18:56,778
In your restaurant, I’ll serve
the drinks and get all the tips.

923
01:18:57,216 --> 01:19:00,221
But you supply the drinks.
- Partners.

924
01:19:00,822 --> 01:19:05,623
No word about this to anyone.
- Of course. I’m your accomplice now.

925
01:19:06,704 --> 01:19:08,544
I haven’t killed anyone,
in case you're wondering.

926
01:19:08,663 --> 01:19:10,546
I don’t want to know.

927
01:19:10,784 --> 01:19:12,908
I wasn’t going to tell you.

928
01:19:48,403 --> 01:19:51,494
Move aside. Let me do it.

929
01:20:05,105 --> 01:20:06,504
Push.

930
01:20:08,065 --> 01:20:09,338
Goodness me!

931
01:20:11,459 --> 01:20:13,632
I can’t do it any more.

932
01:20:14,070 --> 01:20:16,461
I need a break.

933
01:21:17,463 --> 01:21:19,677
What are you doing here, Augustina?

934
01:21:21,717 --> 01:21:24,470
Can we talk?
- I’m busy right now.

935
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:27,320
Okay, come here.

936
01:21:33,398 --> 01:21:35,927
How are you?
- Same old.

937
01:21:36,047 --> 01:21:38,691
Did you learn anything?
- About what?

938
01:21:38,731 --> 01:21:40,290
About what I asked you.

939
01:21:41,332 --> 01:21:43,331
I thought you were pulling my leg.

940
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:46,403
I’d better sit down.

941
01:21:49,096 --> 01:21:53,018
Raimunda, have some sympathy for me.

942
01:21:53,451 --> 01:21:57,413
I’ll do anything for you
within the bounds of reason.

943
01:21:57,413 --> 01:21:59,905
I just want to know if my mother is alive.

944
01:22:04,669 --> 01:22:09,542
Augustina, your illness has addled
your brains. I know it’s hard,

945
01:22:09,592 --> 01:22:12,915
but you can’t bother people
with your problems.

946
01:22:13,873 --> 01:22:15,316
My life’s complicated enough.

947
01:22:15,996 --> 01:22:20,720
My mother disappeared the same day
your parents died in the fire.

948
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:27,554
Isn’t that a strange coincidence?

949
01:22:28,044 --> 01:22:31,166
Not really. You said it yourself,

950
01:22:31,206 --> 01:22:34,207
your mother left that morning
and it wasn’t her first time.

951
01:22:34,690 --> 01:22:38,851
Your grandmother raised you
because your mother was away all the time.

952
01:22:38,851 --> 01:22:42,484
Why am I telling you this?

953
01:22:42,814 --> 01:22:47,896
My mother left that morning
to meet your father.

954
01:22:48,817 --> 01:22:51,261
That can’t be true.
Nobody saw her.

955
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:55,262
She wanted to be discreet.

956
01:22:56,023 --> 01:23:01,107
They had an affair, Raimunda.

957
01:23:02,541 --> 01:23:04,669
That’s a lie.

958
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:08,913
My mother loved my father,
she would never allow it.

959
01:23:08,913 --> 01:23:11,914
That’s why she left him
to live with aunt Paula.

960
01:23:12,276 --> 01:23:14,717
She stayed with my aunt
because she was sick.

961
01:23:14,996 --> 01:23:17,360
not because she ran away.
She would never let it happen.

962
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:20,079
So she lived in two houses.
How would you know?

963
01:23:20,079 --> 01:23:22,591
You never lived together,
didn’t keep in touch for years.

964
01:23:22,802 --> 01:23:26,684
I heard them say you passed each other
on the street, like strangers.

965
01:23:28,725 --> 01:23:30,727
I heard them say lots of things.

966
01:23:32,088 --> 01:23:35,330
I once overheard your mother
and mine arguing.

967
01:23:36,209 --> 01:23:39,054
Your mother said that she can’t
keep letting your father in,

968
01:23:39,054 --> 01:23:40,486
she couldn’t do it anymore,

969
01:23:40,605 --> 01:23:42,775
and that she didn’t care
about winning him over,

970
01:23:42,775 --> 01:23:46,060
because your father only hurt
those who loved him.

971
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:50,702
What are you trying to do, Augustina?

972
01:23:51,742 --> 01:23:56,385
To make you realize
your parents and my mother

973
01:23:56,385 --> 01:23:57,947
are connected somehow.

974
01:23:59,467 --> 01:24:01,748
Why didn’t you turn to the police?

975
01:24:02,579 --> 01:24:04,711
They ask too many questions.

976
01:24:04,831 --> 01:24:07,432
Best not to parade your own skeletons.

977
01:24:08,915 --> 01:24:11,317
That’s why I’m staying away from TV,

978
01:24:11,317 --> 01:24:13,036
even though my sister insists.

979
01:24:13,277 --> 01:24:16,161
Because this is up to you
and me to sort out together.

980
01:24:18,482 --> 01:24:20,803
I have to go back to work.

981
01:24:24,165 --> 01:24:26,487
Think about what I said.

982
01:24:27,085 --> 01:24:28,888
How’s Paco doing?

983
01:24:29,559 --> 01:24:31,290
Who?
He’s fine.

984
01:24:37,605 --> 01:24:40,337
We should have warned auntie
about our visit.

985
01:24:40,337 --> 01:24:41,697
Why, she’s home.

986
01:24:41,778 --> 01:24:44,649
Mom, you don’t understand.
- What?

987
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:48,062
It’s not polite to visit
without calling first,

988
01:24:48,062 --> 01:24:49,502
even if she is your sister.

989
01:24:49,945 --> 01:24:52,267
Who told you that?
Your aunt Solia?

990
01:24:52,704 --> 01:24:54,347
That’s just basic manners.

991
01:24:54,868 --> 01:24:57,988
You and your aunt are going to
kill me with your basic manners.

992
01:24:58,389 --> 01:24:59,829
How vulgar!

993
01:25:04,912 --> 01:25:07,475
What brings you here, Raimunda?

994
01:25:12,918 --> 01:25:16,761
What’s up your tail?
- Don’t scream, I’ll go deaf.

995
01:25:16,801 --> 01:25:18,633
I’m already deaf.

996
01:25:18,804 --> 01:25:22,328
As a bat. We came to see you.
And I need a haircut.

997
01:25:23,087 --> 01:25:26,729
Why didn’t you call? I have a client.
- I’m in no rush.

998
01:25:27,131 --> 01:25:30,852
Also, we need to talk.

999
01:25:31,602 --> 01:25:33,972
About what?
- Our aunt’s house.

1000
01:25:34,254 --> 01:25:37,134
Can I watch some TV?
- Yes, go ahead.

1001
01:25:37,855 --> 01:25:41,379
We need to decide what to do
and start on the paperwork.

1002
01:25:42,820 --> 01:25:45,573
Grandma?
- Here.

1003
01:25:45,612 --> 01:25:48,984
Hide. My mom’s here
- I heard.

1004
01:25:54,578 --> 01:25:56,792
Solie, where’s the Russian woman?

1005
01:25:56,991 --> 01:25:59,833
What Russian woman?
- My assistant.

1006
01:25:59,873 --> 01:26:05,395
I was talking religion to her,
she was washing my head, then she was gone.

1007
01:26:06,397 --> 01:26:09,709
She must be sensitive.
I shouldn’t’ve mentioned religion.

1008
01:26:10,038 --> 01:26:14,363
She probably stepped out.
- My hair’s halfway done.

1009
01:26:14,881 --> 01:26:19,925
I’ll finish it. Poor thing
is claustrophobic. She needs open air.

1010
01:26:20,366 --> 01:26:22,969
Some assistant you have.
How much are you paying her?

1011
01:26:23,489 --> 01:26:27,573
Nothing, she’s staying with me.

1012
01:26:27,812 --> 01:26:29,174
I gave her some of mom’s clothes.

1013
01:26:29,214 --> 01:26:31,575
I don’t approve of this,
taking in complete strangers.

1014
01:26:32,974 --> 01:26:37,939
We’ve been saying that.
She’s too nice, people use her.

1015
01:26:38,298 --> 01:26:40,940
How did it go with Paco?

1016
01:26:41,340 --> 01:26:44,022
He came for his clothes.

1017
01:26:44,504 --> 01:26:47,697
I think he lives with someone else.
I don’t care.

1018
01:26:48,466 --> 01:26:51,229
Why didn’t you tell me about this Russian woman?

1019
01:26:52,269 --> 01:26:53,989
I don’t know, must’ve slipped my mind.

1020
01:27:02,956 --> 01:27:05,358
Look here, it’s Augustina.

1021
01:27:07,359 --> 01:27:10,480
Good evening, Augustina.
- Evening.

1022
01:27:10,562 --> 01:27:15,166
Your sister told us your mother
never married, is that true?

1023
01:27:15,284 --> 01:27:16,206
Yes.

1024
01:27:16,365 --> 01:27:19,206
She was a hippie.

1025
01:27:20,929 --> 01:27:22,640
This is Augustina.

1026
01:27:24,371 --> 01:27:28,293
My mother believed in free love
so she never married.

1027
01:27:29,055 --> 01:27:32,899
The day she disappeared
a friend of hers died, right?

1028
01:27:33,017 --> 01:27:36,101
That’s right.
- What did she die of?

1029
01:27:36,138 --> 01:27:41,423
There was a fire. They’re common
in our village because of the hot wind.

1030
01:27:42,142 --> 01:27:46,348
She refers to Alcanfor de las Infantas.

1031
01:27:46,786 --> 01:27:51,391
Statistics say there are
many insanity cases there.

1032
01:27:51,469 --> 01:27:53,909
Do you think your mother suffered, Augustina?

1033
01:27:53,909 --> 01:27:55,832
I mean, from some mental disorder…

1034
01:27:56,075 --> 01:28:01,717
I don’t think so. Whenever she got ill,
she just left.

1035
01:28:01,798 --> 01:28:03,278
That’s a hippie for you.

1036
01:28:03,358 --> 01:28:07,119
Then one day she left
and never came back?

1037
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:10,603
Yes, over four years ago.

1038
01:28:10,724 --> 01:28:15,086
That friend who died in a fire,
tell us more about her.

1039
01:28:18,690 --> 01:28:19,649
What about her?

1040
01:28:19,687 --> 01:28:23,971
Tell us about the woman
who died in the fire.

1041
01:28:23,971 --> 01:28:25,774
There’s a rumor going around...

1042
01:28:25,895 --> 01:28:27,495
I don’t believe rumors.

1043
01:28:27,696 --> 01:28:31,777
Tell us what you told us earlier.

1044
01:28:31,777 --> 01:28:33,498
About her and her husband,

1045
01:28:33,498 --> 01:28:37,343
about their connection
to your mother’s disappearance.

1046
01:28:37,343 --> 01:28:38,784
You said that?

1047
01:28:39,902 --> 01:28:44,986
I’d rather not talk about it.

1048
01:28:47,670 --> 01:28:51,311
Isn’t that what you came for?

1049
01:28:51,752 --> 01:28:53,233
Isn’t it?
- It is.

1050
01:28:53,434 --> 01:28:55,473
But I changed my mind.

1051
01:28:56,677 --> 01:29:00,918
What’s the matter with you?
Lost your nerve?

1052
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:05,443
Augustina wanted to tell you
something else as well.

1053
01:29:05,443 --> 01:29:09,123
She wants you to know
she’s got a terminal illness.

1054
01:29:09,725 --> 01:29:11,445
Cancer.

1055
01:29:15,447 --> 01:29:20,053
No need to be shy,
you’re among friends.

1056
01:29:20,129 --> 01:29:22,853
Let’s support her
with our applause.

1057
01:29:29,578 --> 01:29:34,422
Augustina has a dream.
She wants to be treated in Houston.

1058
01:29:34,823 --> 01:29:41,266
But in order to live that dream
you have to tell us everything in detail.

1059
01:30:07,646 --> 01:30:09,645
Augustina came to the restaurant.

1060
01:30:09,887 --> 01:30:11,288
She did?

1061
01:30:11,369 --> 01:30:16,09
She thinks we see our mother’s ghost,
wants us to ask her about her own mother.

1062
01:30:16,571 --> 01:30:20,133
She says her mother had an affair
with our father.

1063
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:29,699
Did you know about this?

1064
01:30:30,461 --> 01:30:31,702
No.

1065
01:30:33,424 --> 01:30:37,544
Okay... Mother told me,
after...

1066
01:30:38,788 --> 01:30:43,148
After what?
- After she learned.

1067
01:30:46,392 --> 01:30:48,152
Solie, look at me.

1068
01:30:50,393 --> 01:30:53,997
Is there something I should know?

1069
01:30:54,117 --> 01:30:55,959
If I tell you...

1070
01:30:56,599 --> 01:30:59,921
you won’t believe me
and you’ll probably scream.

1071
01:31:01,201 --> 01:31:04,444
I promise not to scream.

1072
01:31:05,566 --> 01:31:07,767
Mother’s ghost is visiting.

1073
01:31:10,209 --> 01:31:12,892
Who?
- Have a seat.

1074
01:31:18,614 --> 01:31:21,457
She was with aunt Paula until her death.

1075
01:31:21,658 --> 01:31:25,820
She told Augustina about it
and opened the front door.

1076
01:31:26,099 --> 01:31:30,100
She left money for Augustina,
to buy bread.

1077
01:31:30,664 --> 01:31:33,066
You did that?
- Yes.

1078
01:31:35,308 --> 01:31:37,789
Who told you that, Augustina?

1079
01:31:38,988 --> 01:31:40,831
See, you don’t believe me.

1080
01:31:42,511 --> 01:31:45,273
Solie, Augustina is whacked in the head.

1081
01:31:45,393 --> 01:31:48,756
Remember, you yourself were amazed

1082
01:31:48,756 --> 01:31:53,559
that aunt Paula could manage alone
in her condition?

1083
01:31:54,118 --> 01:31:55,480
Remember!

1084
01:31:55,798 --> 01:31:58,482
I remember.
What are you driving at?

1085
01:31:58,802 --> 01:32:00,803
Auntie was not alone.

1086
01:32:01,525 --> 01:32:06,888
Who do you think made those doughnuts
and brought auntie’s belongings?

1087
01:32:07,370 --> 01:32:10,530
The dolls, too,
before the neighbors got to them?

1088
01:32:10,530 --> 01:32:12,453
Do you understand now?

1089
01:32:12,972 --> 01:32:15,013
Do you?

1090
01:32:18,738 --> 01:32:20,778
Have you seen her?- Yes.

1091
01:32:26,421 --> 01:32:29,303
Is she the Russian woman?

1092
01:32:30,663 --> 01:32:31,585
Yes.

1093
01:32:33,746 --> 01:32:35,266
Where is she?

1094
01:32:38,030 --> 01:32:39,511
In there.

1095
01:33:07,090 --> 01:33:08,490
Mother.

1096
01:33:09,291 --> 01:33:11,254
What are you doing here?

1097
01:33:32,350 --> 01:33:34,590
I thought you were dead.

1098
01:33:35,470 --> 01:33:38,232
I came back to ask for your forgiveness.

1099
01:33:39,553 --> 01:33:41,836
I knew nothing about it, daughter.

1100
01:33:42,515 --> 01:33:44,756
I swear I had no idea.

1101
01:34:05,291 --> 01:34:09,491
Daughter.
Sweet daughter of mine.

1102
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:15,018
The worst is over.
She didn’t reject me.

1103
01:34:15,176 --> 01:34:17,018
Or did she?
- No, she didn’t.

1104
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:21,982
Is it true you came back
to ask her forgiveness?

1105
01:34:22,422 --> 01:34:24,824
Yes, and to see you.

1106
01:34:26,146 --> 01:34:29,349
Will you explain one day?
- I will.

1107
01:34:30,628 --> 01:34:32,672
I hope you’ll understand

1108
01:34:34,232 --> 01:34:36,472
and forgive me as well.

1109
01:35:02,211 --> 01:35:04,412
I have to talk to her.

1110
01:35:04,774 --> 01:35:06,494
Let’s go back.

1111
01:35:09,453 --> 01:35:11,695
Now?
- Yes.

1112
01:35:38,194 --> 01:35:41,556
I used to dream about this.
- Me, too.

1113
01:35:43,879 --> 01:35:46,199
I don’t know where to begin.

1114
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:48,722
You’re not a ghost, right?

1115
01:35:48,803 --> 01:35:50,444
You just never died.

1116
01:35:50,484 --> 01:35:52,326
No, I never died.

1117
01:35:53,086 --> 01:36:00,930
But even if I had, I would return
to ask for forgiveness.

1118
01:36:02,533 --> 01:36:06,855
How could I not see it?

1119
01:36:08,015 --> 01:36:11,140
They say love is blind.
- Yes.

1120
01:36:12,299 --> 01:36:14,862
I learned on the day of the fire.

1121
01:36:15,340 --> 01:36:18,462
Is it true you left father?
- Yes.

1122
01:36:18,784 --> 01:36:20,944
I couldn’t stand his affairs.

1123
01:36:21,064 --> 01:36:25,511
You called the night before the fire
to talk to your aunt.

1124
01:36:25,511 --> 01:36:27,429
You didn’t ask about me,
as usual.

1125
01:36:28,109 --> 01:36:30,071
I got angry...

1126
01:36:31,352 --> 01:36:34,235
I told your aunt bad things about you.

1127
01:36:36,154 --> 01:36:38,359
She defended you...

1128
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:45,603
she told me everything...

1129
01:36:47,123 --> 01:36:50,05
about your father raping you...

1130
01:36:50,05 --> 01:36:53,568
and that your daughter Paula,
your daughter...

1131
01:36:53,770 --> 01:36:55,930
is also your sister.

1132
01:36:57,291 --> 01:36:59,332
I couldn’t believe it.

1133
01:36:59,893 --> 01:37:04,696
How could such a nightmare unfold
before my eyes without knowing it?

1134
01:37:07,179 --> 01:37:12,742
I understood then,
your silence,

1135
01:37:13,582 --> 01:37:15,062
your coldness.

1136
01:37:16,386 --> 01:37:20,188
I understood why
your father had to flee to Venezuela.

1137
01:37:20,188 --> 01:37:23,549
He was never one to
take responsibility.

1138
01:37:24,869 --> 01:37:31,072
I understood why you and Paco
left for Madrid

1139
01:37:31,474 --> 01:37:34,077
and wanted nothing to do with me.

1140
01:37:34,276 --> 01:37:37,558
I thought you had to know
what had happened.

1141
01:37:37,598 --> 01:37:39,602
I understand.

1142
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:44,485
You have no idea how mad I was
when I found out.

1143
01:37:46,125 --> 01:37:49,288
I went looking for him,
to gauge his eyes out.

1144
01:37:49,288 --> 01:37:52,451
I found him asleep, in the arms
of Augustina’s mother.

1145
01:37:52,451 --> 01:37:54,090
They didn’t hear me coming...

1146
01:37:54,211 --> 01:37:56,051
so I set the house on fire.

1147
01:37:56,573 --> 01:38:03,737
It was a windy day, within seconds
the fire swallowed them.

1148
01:38:05,138 --> 01:38:07,579
They never even woke up.

1149
01:38:08,941 --> 01:38:13,384
So the remains in your grave
are Augustina’s mother?

1150
01:38:14,584 --> 01:38:15,666
Yes.

1151
01:38:19,708 --> 01:38:25,512
I roamed the countryside for a few days,
as in a long dream.

1152
01:38:25,912 --> 01:38:29,913
I wanted to go to the police,
turn myself in.

1153
01:38:30,115 --> 01:38:33,197
But before that I had to see your aunt.

1154
01:38:34,198 --> 01:38:36,201
She was not well.
Not well at all.

1155
01:38:37,839 --> 01:38:42,123
When she saw me,

1156
01:38:42,844 --> 01:38:44,405
she didn’t even blink.

1157
01:38:45,567 --> 01:38:53,133
She lived in the past, she thought
we had never separated.

1158
01:38:54,972 --> 01:38:57,936
Your tragedy took away
her last bits of sanity.

1159
01:38:59,055 --> 01:39:01,415
I couldn’t leave her...

1160
01:39:01,938 --> 01:39:05,338
so I stayed...

1161
01:39:06,021 --> 01:39:08,062
until her dying day.

1162
01:39:11,585 --> 01:39:14,426
The people in the village
think you’re a ghost.

1163
01:39:14,547 --> 01:39:16,868
It suited me well.

1164
01:39:17,509 --> 01:39:22,074
Better to be a ghost
than have to face the truth.

1165
01:39:23,113 --> 01:39:27,033
I thought there had to be
an investigation.

1166
01:39:27,033 --> 01:39:30,316
I thought they’ll arrest me
and...

1167
01:39:30,718 --> 01:39:33,477
punish me somehow.

1168
01:39:33,518 --> 01:39:38,164
Although I swear I’ve led a life without sin.

1169
01:39:41,886 --> 01:39:43,847
It’s true.

1170
01:40:03,141 --> 01:40:06,704
We’re almost there,
no need to arrive in daylight.

1171
01:40:06,823 --> 01:40:09,506
Let’s stop here then,
there’s a meadow.

1172
01:40:09,506 --> 01:40:11,228
I haven’t been there for years.

1173
01:40:11,786 --> 01:40:15,627
It’s dry now.
- How do you know?

1174
01:40:16,590 --> 01:40:20,914
From the news.
There’s draught all over Spain.

1175
01:40:39,806 --> 01:40:43,530
We often picnicked here.
Remember, Raimunda?

1176
01:40:43,968 --> 01:40:44,970
I do.

1177
01:40:45,530 --> 01:40:47,890
Used to be so green then.

1178
01:40:48,012 --> 01:40:49,934
I told you it’ll be dry.

1179
01:40:49,934 --> 01:40:52,734
Let’s have a snack.
- I’m not hungry.

1180
01:40:53,616 --> 01:40:56,379
I could have a doughnut.
- Me, too.

1181
01:41:06,464 --> 01:41:08,987
This was your father’s favorite spot.

1182
01:41:09,706 --> 01:41:11,188
You mean Paco?

1183
01:41:11,588 --> 01:41:12,989
Yes, him.

1184
01:41:14,509 --> 01:41:16,711
He really missed this place.

1185
01:41:37,886 --> 01:41:39,768
So you buried him here.

1186
01:41:52,018 --> 01:41:53,938
Come out quick while there’s no-one around.

1187
01:42:09,067 --> 01:42:12,431
If only Paula could see us.
All together.

1188
01:42:13,472 --> 01:42:15,394
She would have been so happy.

1189
01:42:15,633 --> 01:42:16,915
Yes, she would.

1190
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:27,161
Did you always have such big jugs?

1191
01:42:27,721 --> 01:42:29,764
As far back as I can remember.

1192
01:42:29,961 --> 01:42:32,645
I remember them smaller.

1193
01:42:33,766 --> 01:42:37,850
Did you do anything to them?
- What could I have done?

1194
01:42:37,970 --> 01:42:38,731
Okay, then.

1195
01:42:39,051 --> 01:42:41,490
Grandma, was it you
that used the exercise bike?

1196
01:42:41,490 --> 01:42:41,851
Yes, it was.

1197
01:42:41,972 --> 01:42:45,093
Every single day. It works wonders
for blood pressure.

1198
01:42:45,453 --> 01:42:47,934
How did aunt Paula take that?

1199
01:42:48,295 --> 01:42:50,256
She couldn't stop laughing.

1200
01:42:53,539 --> 01:42:55,100
I'll go hide.

1201
01:42:57,782 --> 01:43:01,145
That must be aunt Paula.
- Stop it, Solie.

1202
01:43:01,384 --> 01:43:03,305
I’ll go see who it is.

1203
01:43:03,667 --> 01:43:05,869
Hide mom’s utencils.

1204
01:43:11,673 --> 01:43:14,513
Who is it?
- It’s me, Augustina.

1205
01:43:17,675 --> 01:43:19,838
We’re having dinner, just arrived.

1206
01:43:20,037 --> 01:43:22,160
Sorry to interrupt.

1207
01:43:22,678 --> 01:43:25,081
Come in, don’t just stand there.
- Thank you.

1208
01:43:30,764 --> 01:43:33,208
Good evening.
- Good evening.

1209
01:43:33,568 --> 01:43:36,128
Have a seat.
- Thank you.

1210
01:43:42,493 --> 01:43:45,776
I came to say I’m sorry
about that TV show appearance.

1211
01:43:46,177 --> 01:43:49,017
Ah, the interview.
It didn’t come out right.

1212
01:43:49,098 --> 01:43:52,340
I know. I’m not looking for an excuse,

1213
01:43:52,340 --> 01:43:55,702
but they offered to take me
to a hospital in Houston

1214
01:43:55,702 --> 01:43:57,624
where they can treat that kind of cancer.

1215
01:43:58,506 --> 01:44:01,425
But I’d rather die with a clean conscience,

1216
01:44:01,425 --> 01:44:03,628
not ashamed to look you in the eye.

1217
01:44:06,149 --> 01:44:09,433
Mom, I’ll be upstairs.
- Yes, okay.

1218
01:44:11,355 --> 01:44:13,556
Have something to eat.
- No, thank you.

1219
01:44:14,036 --> 01:44:17,236
You’re selling the house, I heard.
- We are.

1220
01:44:17,277 --> 01:44:21,121
At least, we thought we were,
but there are so many memories...

1221
01:44:21,121 --> 01:44:23,242
I don’t really know what to do.

1222
01:44:24,03 --> 01:44:28,365
Well, I’ll get going.
- Why so soon?

1223
01:44:28,365 --> 01:44:30,729
Stay with us.
- No, I have to go.

1224
01:44:30,846 --> 01:44:33,09
A nurse will stop by
to do my injection.

1225
01:44:33,09 --> 01:44:35,492
The doctors in Madrid showed me
how to do it myself,

1226
01:44:35,492 --> 01:44:37,733
but I could never learn.

1227
01:44:38,494 --> 01:44:41,817
Your sister has no excuses
for not being here with you.

1228
01:44:41,897 --> 01:44:44,056
Don’t remind me of her.

1229
01:44:44,337 --> 01:44:48,221
After what happened on TV
she won’t talk to me. She’s pissed.

1230
01:44:49,220 --> 01:44:51,782
Not as much as I am with her.

1231
01:44:52,742 --> 01:44:56,664
You have plenty of reasons.
- I look at you...

1232
01:44:57,386 --> 01:44:59,105
and I’m truly envious.

1233
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:20,041
Irene.

1234
01:45:21,524 --> 01:45:24,923
I’m so glad to see you.
- Me, too.

1235
01:45:25,606 --> 01:45:30,210
I heard about you and here I am.
It must get lonely.

1236
01:45:30,729 --> 01:45:32,091
It does.

1237
01:45:35,733 --> 01:45:37,613
If only aunt Paula was here.

1238
01:45:37,654 --> 01:45:40,215
I’m here now,
to take care of you.

1239
01:45:40,976 --> 01:45:43,537
Did you leave the door open?
- Yes, let me close it.

1240
01:45:43,537 --> 01:45:45,180
I already did.

1241
01:45:45,701 --> 01:45:48,822
Did the nurse come already?
- No, she will tomorrow.

1242
01:45:49,624 --> 01:45:53,745
You’ll be in pain
if you miss today’s.

1243
01:45:54,143 --> 01:45:57,749
Do you have the medicine, syringes?
- Yes, they gave them to me.

1244
01:45:57,948 --> 01:45:59,949
All right, I’ll do it then.

1245
01:46:05,034 --> 01:46:07,755
I was born in this bed.

1246
01:46:08,356 --> 01:46:11,237
My mother slept here.

1247
01:46:11,518 --> 01:46:14,680
Your sister Paula and I
slept on that one.

1248
01:46:15,040 --> 01:46:19,565
I know Augustina
and I’m grateful to you.

1249
01:46:23,124 --> 01:46:25,928
We have to talk, Irene.

1250
01:46:26,089 --> 01:46:27,929
Anything you wish.

1251
01:46:28,728 --> 01:46:31,810
Just don’t tell anyone
that I’ve returned.

1252
01:46:32,212 --> 01:46:34,094
Don’t worry, I won’t.

1253
01:46:35,094 --> 01:46:38,017
Thank you for not mentioning me
on television.

1254
01:46:39,016 --> 01:46:41,778
It’s none of their business,
it’s just between the two of us.

1255
01:46:42,140 --> 01:46:43,581
Of course.

1256
01:46:43,660 --> 01:46:45,500
Nobody’s business but ours.

1257
01:46:49,705 --> 01:46:55,147
<i>Hey, beautiful. Give your father
a kiss, Magdalene.</i>

1258
01:47:02,512 --> 01:47:05,516
<i>Did I ever tell you the story of Pinocchio?</i>

1259
01:47:05,996 --> 01:47:09,157
<i>The boy that told lies</i>

1260
01:47:09,599 --> 01:47:11,438
<i>and his nose would grow bigger.</i>

1261
01:47:11,478 --> 01:47:14,561
<i>He lied to his father,
the puppet-maker.</i>

1262
01:47:51,027 --> 01:47:53,790
It’s me, mom.
Open up.

1263
01:47:55,109 --> 01:47:58,594
Raimunda, what are you doing here?
- I wanted to see you.

1264
01:47:59,113 --> 01:48:01,637
Are you going to stay here?

1265
01:48:01,996 --> 01:48:02,756
Yes.

1266
01:48:02,994 --> 01:48:04,595
Till the very end.

1267
01:48:04,635 --> 01:48:06,718
Augustina is not doing well.

1268
01:48:06,877 --> 01:48:10,919
After what I did to her mother,
I could at least be there for her now.

1269
01:48:12,122 --> 01:48:16,643
Mom, I’ve so much to tell you.
About Paco.

1270
01:48:16,965 --> 01:48:19,766
Something awful happened.
- You’ll tell me later.

1271
01:48:20,288 --> 01:48:23,451
We’ll see each other every day.

1272
01:48:23,809 --> 01:48:25,409
Yes.

1273
01:48:27,495 --> 01:48:29,573
I need you so much.

1274
01:48:31,975 --> 01:48:34,656
I’ve always needed you.

1275
01:48:35,256 --> 01:48:38,659
Don’t say such things, Raimunda.
My eyes are watering.

1276
01:48:39,701 --> 01:48:41,983
Ghosts are not supposed to cry.
