1
00:00:14,543 --> 00:00:18,872
Well, he walked up to me
and he asked me if I wanted to dance

2
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,844
He looked kind of nice
and so I said I might take a chance

3
00:00:29,057 --> 00:00:31,928
When he danced he held me tight

4
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,346
And when he walked me home
that night

5
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,267
All the stars were shining bright

6
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,522
And then he kissed me

7
00:00:42,654 --> 00:00:46,438
Each time I saw him
I couldn't wait to see him again

8
00:00:49,535 --> 00:00:53,782
I wanted to let him know
that he was more than a friend

9
00:00:56,667 --> 00:00:59,621
I didn't know just what to do

10
00:01:00,588 --> 00:01:03,209
So I whispered I love you

11
00:01:03,924 --> 00:01:06,594
And he said that he loved me too

12
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:09,755
And then he kissed me

13
00:01:10,514 --> 00:01:15,176
He kissed me in a way
that I've never been kissed before

14
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:22,896
He kissed me in a way
that I want to be kissed for evermore

15
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:29,232
I knew that he was mine
so I gave him all the love that I had

16
00:01:31,827 --> 00:01:36,286
And one day he took me home
to meet his mom and his dad

17
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:42,994
Then he asked me to be his bride

18
00:01:43,128 --> 00:01:46,248
And always be right by his side

19
00:01:46,382 --> 00:01:49,086
I felt so happy I almost cried

20
00:01:49,218 --> 00:01:51,673
And then he kissed me

21
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,055
And then he kissed me

22
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,890
And then he kissed me

23
00:02:04,941 --> 00:02:08,856
- [car horn]
- Oh, God. He's here.

24
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,319
[door bell]

25
00:02:14,451 --> 00:02:16,324
OK Chris, just relax.

26
00:02:16,453 --> 00:02:19,904
Tonight is going to be the greatest
night of your life.

27
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,417
Hi.

28
00:02:29,841 --> 00:02:31,880
Hi, Chris.

29
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:35,295
- I'm a little bit overdressed.
- No, it's just...

30
00:02:37,348 --> 00:02:39,387
I got to cancel.

31
00:02:41,477 --> 00:02:45,890
My little sister got sick and my
parents are going out tonight.

32
00:02:46,023 --> 00:02:48,395
Well, I could come over and help out.

33
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:51,891
We could make some chicken soup
or something.

34
00:02:52,029 --> 00:02:53,986
No, you don't want to be there.

35
00:02:54,114 --> 00:02:57,815
She's contagious.
I don't want you to get sick.

36
00:03:00,037 --> 00:03:03,869
We'll do the French restaurant thing
next week, OK?

37
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:05,623
OK.

38
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:07,876
When?

39
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,243
I don't know. Friday, Saturday.

40
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:14,298
I got to get going.
My sister's waiting for me.

41
00:03:16,594 --> 00:03:19,085
You're upset about tonight,
aren't you?

42
00:03:19,222 --> 00:03:20,633
No.

43
00:03:22,976 --> 00:03:25,680
Well, yeah, a little.
But I understand.

44
00:03:27,522 --> 00:03:29,561
You know, Chris...

45
00:03:30,358 --> 00:03:32,979
Girls like you come along
once in a lifetime.

46
00:03:38,074 --> 00:03:40,066
Whoa!

47
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,617
Contagious.

48
00:03:46,457 --> 00:03:49,162
- Contagious?
- Yeah, that's what he said.

49
00:03:49,293 --> 00:03:51,618
He's lying.

50
00:03:51,754 --> 00:03:52,703
Brenda!

51
00:03:52,838 --> 00:03:55,625
I don't know why you're making
such a big deal about him.

52
00:03:55,758 --> 00:03:58,462
He's the best thing that's ever
happened to me.

53
00:03:58,594 --> 00:04:01,215
He's the only thing that's ever
happened to you.

54
00:04:01,346 --> 00:04:03,138
That's why we've got to get out.

55
00:04:03,265 --> 00:04:07,132
It's like a Dairy Queen.
You only get one flavour.

56
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:10,353
You know, I asked you over here
to cheer me up.

57
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,395
- I feel worse.
- Oh, Chris, I'm sorry.

58
00:04:14,526 --> 00:04:16,068
[phone rings]

59
00:04:16,194 --> 00:04:20,487
I'm just in a really bad mood.
My parents are driving me crazy.

60
00:04:20,614 --> 00:04:22,274
My stepmom is such a pain.

61
00:04:22,408 --> 00:04:26,108
If I don't get out of the house I'm
going to spike her Tab with Drano.

62
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:28,284
Don't do that.

63
00:04:28,413 --> 00:04:30,987
[knock on door] Chris?

64
00:04:31,124 --> 00:04:33,164
- Hi, Brenda.
- Hi.

65
00:04:33,293 --> 00:04:34,835
Hi, Mom.

66
00:04:34,962 --> 00:04:36,456
That was Mrs Anderson.

67
00:04:36,588 --> 00:04:39,672
She wants to know if you can babysit
for her tonight.

68
00:04:41,218 --> 00:04:43,887
- No. Tell her I can't.
- Why not?

69
00:04:44,012 --> 00:04:47,132
- Wait, aren't we doing something?
- I have to go home.

70
00:04:49,184 --> 00:04:51,509
Because I want to stay home
and be depressed.

71
00:04:51,644 --> 00:04:54,218
Sit for the Andersons.
That'll depress anyone.

72
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,229
I'm too old to babysit.

73
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:02,773
Sometimes you know
what you're looking for

74
00:05:06,451 --> 00:05:10,780
Sometimes you don't make it
out the door

75
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:17,376
This time I know what I'm doing

76
00:05:18,087 --> 00:05:21,456
I'm not fooling
cos I just can't stop

77
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:25,173
Trying to get a hold on you

78
00:05:31,433 --> 00:05:33,841
Guess what, Brad?

79
00:05:33,977 --> 00:05:36,729
Mom is going to kill you for wearing
skates indoors.

80
00:05:36,855 --> 00:05:39,346
Mom's got to catch me first.
Guess what?

81
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,107
I don't care, winghead.

82
00:05:42,235 --> 00:05:44,561
Mom got Chris to babysit for me.

83
00:05:45,489 --> 00:05:47,446
Chris?

84
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,239
Oh, my...

85
00:05:52,287 --> 00:05:54,410
- Sara!
- Bye!

86
00:05:55,832 --> 00:06:00,209
The night was long
and the road was rough

87
00:06:04,048 --> 00:06:05,840
[mutters] Chris is coming!

88
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:08,802
Would you get out of the way?
Chris is coming.

89
00:06:11,431 --> 00:06:14,800
Now that I've found you
I'll hold on tight

90
00:06:14,934 --> 00:06:20,011
Never gonna let you
out of my sight

91
00:06:23,234 --> 00:06:24,265
Oh, no.

92
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:28,062
Hi, Chris. Come on in.

93
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:34,616
Thanks a million for this.
I'm sorry about the short notice.

94
00:06:34,745 --> 00:06:37,070
No problem.
I'm glad I could help.

95
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,827
Sara.

96
00:06:50,552 --> 00:06:54,170
- Did you take my Clearasil again?
- I ran out of brown.

97
00:06:54,306 --> 00:06:57,010
Great. How am I supposed
to cover up my zits?

98
00:06:57,142 --> 00:07:00,011
- You want some orange?
- I can't use paint.

99
00:07:01,353 --> 00:07:03,975
What do you think?
I figure it's my best yet.

100
00:07:04,106 --> 00:07:07,226
I got the sun rays and the cape
and the special helmet...

101
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:11,357
Great! You wasted all my Clearasil
on another picture of Thor?

102
00:07:12,281 --> 00:07:14,072
Thor's my hero.

103
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:16,607
- Thor's a homo.
- Is not.

104
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:21,702
- Yeah, he is.
- Is not.

105
00:07:22,374 --> 00:07:25,493
- Thor's a complete homo.
- Take it back, Brad.

106
00:07:25,627 --> 00:07:27,619
Take back what you said about Thor.

107
00:07:27,754 --> 00:07:31,372
Take it back, Brad.
Take back what you said about Thor.

108
00:07:31,508 --> 00:07:34,046
You are going to kill somebody
with these things.

109
00:07:34,177 --> 00:07:37,297
Take back what you said about Thor!

110
00:07:37,972 --> 00:07:39,051
No.

111
00:07:41,517 --> 00:07:43,391
If you don't take it back,

112
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,102
I'll tell Chris about all those love
poems you write about her.

113
00:07:47,231 --> 00:07:49,722
All right, Sara. I'm sorry.

114
00:07:49,859 --> 00:07:52,611
- Thor's not a homo.
- Thank you.

115
00:07:52,737 --> 00:07:54,528
- Hi, Chris.
- Hi.

116
00:07:54,655 --> 00:07:56,695
[laughs]

117
00:07:58,951 --> 00:08:00,362
Hi.

118
00:08:01,287 --> 00:08:02,864
Hi.

119
00:08:02,997 --> 00:08:05,998
- You didn't just hear what my...
- No.

120
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,749
Cool.

121
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:10,910
Boy, you look great. I mean, really.

122
00:08:12,256 --> 00:08:15,506
Your hair. Your eyes.

123
00:08:15,634 --> 00:08:17,674
What about them?

124
00:08:20,597 --> 00:08:22,637
They're so well placed.

125
00:08:24,101 --> 00:08:26,638
- Brad, relax.
- Relax.

126
00:08:28,647 --> 00:08:30,686
Take your coat?

127
00:08:31,233 --> 00:08:32,727
Sorry. I'm sorry.

128
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:35,564
- I didn't...
- Thank you.

129
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:41,489
Boy, this is a really cool coat.
No way is this from Sears.

130
00:08:41,618 --> 00:08:44,109
This is way too cool.

131
00:08:44,245 --> 00:08:47,199
- It was my grandpa's.
- He's got great taste.

132
00:08:47,332 --> 00:08:49,324
He's dead.

133
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:55,288
Brad, stop fawning all over Chris.

134
00:08:55,423 --> 00:08:57,462
Come on in the kitchen, honey.

135
00:09:00,511 --> 00:09:03,714
- Yeah, she did.
- We played bridge the other night.

136
00:09:04,515 --> 00:09:06,554
- Hi.
- Hiya, Chris.

137
00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:11,342
- Brad did it.
- Clean it up.

138
00:09:11,981 --> 00:09:13,523
Sure, mom.

139
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:16,519
All right, Chris.
I left some notes for you.

140
00:09:16,652 --> 00:09:19,985
We're going to be at a reception
at the Associates Centre. Here.

141
00:09:20,114 --> 00:09:23,565
Sara is not to wear her skates
in the house.

142
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,322
Now, Sara, Chris is in charge, OK?

143
00:09:26,453 --> 00:09:28,031
Sure.

144
00:09:28,163 --> 00:09:29,954
Can we go to Häagen-Dazs?

145
00:09:30,082 --> 00:09:33,533
Well, yes.
But don't go too late, all right?

146
00:09:34,211 --> 00:09:38,504
Brad will stay at his friend Daryl's
tonight, so don't worry about him.

147
00:09:38,632 --> 00:09:41,335
This one is just getting over
a very bad cough...

148
00:09:41,467 --> 00:09:43,293
It's been almost two weeks.

149
00:09:43,427 --> 00:09:45,799
...so I want her to take some of this.

150
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:50,342
Give her a spoonful in about an hour
and another before she goes to bed.

151
00:09:50,475 --> 00:09:53,145
Will you stop eating chocolate?

152
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,808
You're going to have zits
all over your face.

153
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,732
Mom!

154
00:09:59,484 --> 00:10:00,682
Jesus!

155
00:10:06,908 --> 00:10:10,359
- You guys have a good time.
- We should be home by one.

156
00:10:10,995 --> 00:10:13,747
- OK.
- Take good care of my baby.

157
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,117
I'll guard her with my life.

158
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,543
Bye.

159
00:10:20,004 --> 00:10:22,044
Goodbye.

160
00:10:26,094 --> 00:10:29,011
Brad, into the kitchen
and clean up that mess.

161
00:10:29,138 --> 00:10:31,178
[rhythmic knocking]

162
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:34,306
That's the back door. I'll get it.

163
00:10:34,435 --> 00:10:36,891
Come on, Chris.
Let's go watch some TV.

164
00:10:39,523 --> 00:10:41,563
[knocking]

165
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:52,449
- Are you coming over or what?
- No, not any more.

166
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,578
- Chris is here, isn't she?
- No.

167
00:10:54,705 --> 00:10:57,278
Yes she is.
That's why I'm sleeping here tonight.

168
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:58,993
- I don't think so.
- Come on.

169
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:02,162
- Did you get her clothes off yet?
- Don't be crude. Get back.

170
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:04,703
You fall in love
and suddenly you're a classy guy.

171
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,295
- I have not fallen in love.
- What's she wearing?

172
00:11:07,425 --> 00:11:10,047
- Clothes. Now get out.
- You got to see the new Playboy.

173
00:11:10,178 --> 00:11:13,464
There's this girl in it
and she looks exactly like Chris.

174
00:11:13,556 --> 00:11:15,632
She's got these humongous...

175
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:16,971
Oh, God!

176
00:11:26,527 --> 00:11:28,567
- Who was at the door?
- Stray dog.

177
00:11:28,696 --> 00:11:30,321
What?

178
00:11:33,284 --> 00:11:35,740
- Are you going to go to college?
- Huh?

179
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,372
Oh, great!

180
00:11:43,252 --> 00:11:44,830
Thanks, mom.

181
00:11:44,962 --> 00:11:46,789
- You're going to college?
- No.

182
00:11:46,922 --> 00:11:48,962
- Thank God.
- Calm down.

183
00:11:49,091 --> 00:11:51,167
[phone rings]

184
00:11:51,302 --> 00:11:53,010
Maybe it's Mike.

185
00:11:53,137 --> 00:11:54,086
Hello?

186
00:11:54,221 --> 00:11:56,427
Will you accept a collect call
from Brenda?

187
00:11:56,557 --> 00:11:59,593
- Oh. Yeah, sure.
- Chris?

188
00:12:00,102 --> 00:12:03,305
- Chris, it's Brenda.
- Brenda?

189
00:12:03,438 --> 00:12:04,601
Chris!

190
00:12:04,731 --> 00:12:07,518
- Brenda, what's wrong?
- Oh Chris, I'm in trouble.

191
00:12:07,651 --> 00:12:10,687
- You're always in trouble.
- No, I'm really in trouble.

192
00:12:10,821 --> 00:12:13,738
- I did it.
- You spiked her Tab with Drano?

193
00:12:13,865 --> 00:12:16,902
No, I ran away from home.

194
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:18,743
You what?

195
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:22,120
- Where are you?
- I'm at the bus station downtown.

196
00:12:22,248 --> 00:12:23,706
Brenda!

197
00:12:23,832 --> 00:12:27,118
- Look, just don't go anywhere.
- I don't have any money.

198
00:12:27,252 --> 00:12:30,170
I spent it all on the cab here.

199
00:12:30,297 --> 00:12:32,669
- Chris, I need help.
- I know.

200
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,044
You're in my house!

201
00:12:34,176 --> 00:12:37,260
If I take a cab to the Andersons',
could you pay for it?

202
00:12:37,387 --> 00:12:41,255
Oh no, that's going to be like $40.
I don't have $40.

203
00:12:42,225 --> 00:12:44,467
Well, can you pick me up?

204
00:12:44,603 --> 00:12:46,642
No, I'm babysitting.

205
00:12:47,439 --> 00:12:50,226
I can't call anybody else.
My dad doesn't know.

206
00:12:50,358 --> 00:12:52,434
He'd kill me if he found out.

207
00:12:54,154 --> 00:12:56,395
I'm begging you.
It's really scary here.

208
00:12:56,531 --> 00:13:00,114
I've seen three people shoot up,
a bald Chinese lady with no pants on,

209
00:13:00,243 --> 00:13:03,409
and there's this old guy outside
who wants his slippers.

210
00:13:04,705 --> 00:13:06,994
Get out of my house!

211
00:13:08,835 --> 00:13:10,957
You've just moved!

212
00:13:11,087 --> 00:13:13,245
Please hurry up and get here.

213
00:13:13,381 --> 00:13:16,714
I've got my mom's car.
I can't drive it into the city.

214
00:13:19,345 --> 00:13:21,551
Oh, my God. There's a man with a gun.

215
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,969
Get me the hell out of here.

216
00:13:24,099 --> 00:13:26,970
Look, just hang up and sit down.

217
00:13:27,102 --> 00:13:29,676
Don't move.
I'll be there in half an hour.

218
00:13:30,522 --> 00:13:34,140
Please hurry. I think he's going
to kill somebody. Maybe me.

219
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,735
Brenda?

220
00:13:38,697 --> 00:13:41,152
I don't believe this. I do not.

221
00:13:41,283 --> 00:13:43,904
- Who's Mike? He your boyfriend?
- Yes.

222
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:47,663
I've got to go downtown.
Brad, will you watch Sara?

223
00:13:47,789 --> 00:13:49,912
No way.
What if the house explodes?

224
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,200
The house is not going to explode.

225
00:13:52,335 --> 00:13:54,043
You leave him here and it will.

226
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:57,835
I will be gone an hour there
and back. That's it. OK?

227
00:13:57,966 --> 00:13:59,709
- You guys go steady or what?
- What?

228
00:13:59,843 --> 00:14:02,713
- Do you?
- Yes. Are you two listening to me?

229
00:14:02,846 --> 00:14:05,052
My mom is paying you good money
to watch me.

230
00:14:05,181 --> 00:14:06,841
Brad can watch you.

231
00:14:06,975 --> 00:14:10,557
Why would my mom pay you good money
for Brad to watch me?

232
00:14:10,686 --> 00:14:12,181
Sara...

233
00:14:12,313 --> 00:14:14,804
- Why can't we just all go?
- Because.

234
00:14:14,941 --> 00:14:18,191
- Do you like him a lot?
- No. Yes.

235
00:14:19,236 --> 00:14:20,944
Well, which is it?

236
00:14:21,072 --> 00:14:22,696
Yes. I like him a lot.

237
00:14:22,823 --> 00:14:26,406
No, Sara, your parents would die if
they found out I took you into town.

238
00:14:26,535 --> 00:14:30,533
They'd die if they found out you left
me here alone with him.

239
00:14:30,664 --> 00:14:32,704
Well, who's going to tell them?

240
00:14:38,088 --> 00:14:40,840
- Anybody have to go to the bathroom?
- [both] Nope.

241
00:14:46,054 --> 00:14:48,094
Come on, let's go.

242
00:14:49,433 --> 00:14:52,184
Now, if anybody asks,
we went for ice cream.

243
00:14:54,604 --> 00:14:56,431
- Road trip?
- Jesus!

244
00:14:57,816 --> 00:14:59,855
Where are you going?

245
00:15:00,443 --> 00:15:02,899
- Downtown.
- The city?

246
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:05,235
- Hey, can I go?
- No, Daryl. Go home.

247
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:07,403
- Who is this kid?
- Stray dog.

248
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:09,950
Daryl Coopersmith.

249
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,289
- And you're Chris Parker, right?
- Go home.

250
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:19,826
- You must be a great babysitter.
- What is he talking about?

251
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:22,369
Mr and Mrs Anderson
must really trust you

252
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:24,996
to take little kids into the city.

253
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:28,720
- Alone.
- Yeah, isn't it great?

254
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:30,799
It is so great

255
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,513
that I'll get my mom to talk
to the Andersons about you.

256
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,180
- Then maybe you can babysit for me.
- Stop it.

257
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:40,597
And then maybe we can
drive off to New York just for kicks.

258
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,938
- Chris...
- Daryl...

259
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,475
- You think?
- What am I supposed to do?

260
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,734
Get in the car and run him over.

261
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,821
- Let him come.
- Daryl!

262
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,274
Sorry, can't talk. Got to run.

263
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,492
Will you just get in the car?

264
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,912
All right!

265
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:04,331
Now boys, I swear if you give me
any grief over the next 60 minutes

266
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:08,212
I swear to God I'll kill you.
Dead. Murdered. Stabbed.

267
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:12,921
- Raped?
- I am too old for this crap.

268
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:20,141
25 miles from home, girl

269
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,306
My feet are hurting mighty bad

270
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,224
[Daryl] Mike what?

271
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:29,360
- [Chris] Mike what what?
- What are we talking about?

272
00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:32,239
- What's his last name?
- Todwell.

273
00:16:32,365 --> 00:16:34,441
- Are you writing a book?
- Mike Todwell?

274
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:37,197
- Do you know him?
- They go out.

275
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,369
He's got a red Camaro, right?

276
00:16:40,498 --> 00:16:43,701
Oh gee, Daryl.
Are you a gearhead and a sex fiend?

277
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,211
A lot of people have Camaros.

278
00:16:47,338 --> 00:16:51,122
But do a lot of people have the
license plate SO COOL?

279
00:16:52,844 --> 00:16:54,302
That's Mike.

280
00:16:54,428 --> 00:16:57,963
He's the guy who beat me up for
touching his car, which I didn't do.

281
00:16:58,099 --> 00:17:00,424
- That was him?
- Mike wouldn't do that.

282
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:02,386
- Yes, he would.
- He would not.

283
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,521
He did. He kicked my ass.
Want to see the footprint?

284
00:17:05,648 --> 00:17:06,810
[all] No.

285
00:17:08,817 --> 00:17:10,062
Look.

286
00:17:10,194 --> 00:17:12,233
That's where Thor lives!

287
00:17:13,864 --> 00:17:14,777
Thor?

288
00:17:14,907 --> 00:17:17,445
All the superheroes live in the city.

289
00:17:17,576 --> 00:17:21,241
Spider-Man, Daredevil
and Captain America.

290
00:17:21,371 --> 00:17:24,823
But Thor's the best.
He fights the forces of darkness.

291
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:27,748
Forces of darkness, beware.

292
00:17:38,054 --> 00:17:42,633
So the babysitter goes upstairs and
the sound keeps getting louder.

293
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:45,970
Scrape, scrape, scrape.

294
00:17:46,104 --> 00:17:48,142
The babysitter stops
at the kid's room.

295
00:17:48,272 --> 00:17:50,430
She reaches for the doorknob.

296
00:17:50,566 --> 00:17:54,065
Her hand is trembling,
her heart is beating fast.

297
00:17:54,194 --> 00:17:56,815
Sweat pours down her face.

298
00:17:56,947 --> 00:17:58,524
She opens the door... [gasps]

299
00:17:58,657 --> 00:18:01,230
and the kids are safely
in their beds.

300
00:18:01,701 --> 00:18:03,908
I'd like to be safely in her bed.

301
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:08,874
- What are you guys doing back there?
- Uh, um...

302
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,040
Nothing. Nothing at all.

303
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:13,208
Nothing. Really.

304
00:18:14,881 --> 00:18:17,039
That was my dad's, stupid.

305
00:18:17,175 --> 00:18:19,547
You shouldn't have
brought it along, stupid.

306
00:18:19,677 --> 00:18:21,966
- So what happens?
- OK.

307
00:18:22,096 --> 00:18:26,425
But when the babysitter looks more
closely at the kids, she sees that

308
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,717
- they don't have any faces!
- Oh, my God!

309
00:18:28,853 --> 00:18:31,522
- It's just a pool of mushy goo.
- Like Spaghetti-O's?

310
00:18:31,647 --> 00:18:34,684
- Spaghetti-O's with meat.
- Yuk!

311
00:18:34,817 --> 00:18:37,438
The babysitter screams
and turns to run,

312
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:41,733
but there's this big giant hairy guy
standing right in front of her.

313
00:18:41,866 --> 00:18:43,324
He raises his arm,

314
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:47,151
but there's a big metal hook
instead of a hand.

315
00:18:47,287 --> 00:18:50,205
And the hook goes to her face.
Scrape, scrape, scrape!

316
00:18:50,332 --> 00:18:52,159
[screams]

317
00:18:52,793 --> 00:18:54,453
- Oh, no.
- All right!

318
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,788
- You got a flat. Pull over.
- This is great.

319
00:18:58,924 --> 00:19:00,963
To the right, go to the right.

320
00:19:03,678 --> 00:19:06,169
- Slowly. Take it easy.
- This is not funny.

321
00:19:12,395 --> 00:19:14,435
Hold it steady.

322
00:19:15,899 --> 00:19:19,184
- Go slow. Pull over.
- I'm pulling over.

323
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:21,358
This is great.

324
00:19:35,501 --> 00:19:37,541
[Daryl and Sara laugh]

325
00:19:48,931 --> 00:19:50,970
[Daryl cackles]

326
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:05,356
Uh... where's the spare?

327
00:20:05,489 --> 00:20:07,315
I don't know.

328
00:20:07,449 --> 00:20:09,488
Maybe it's on the car.

329
00:20:11,286 --> 00:20:13,160
You think?

330
00:20:15,957 --> 00:20:20,619
OK. We are going to flag somebody
down and we'll go buy a tyre.

331
00:20:20,754 --> 00:20:22,793
I've got my chequebook.

332
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,380
My purse.

333
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:34,759
Oh, shit!

334
00:20:34,891 --> 00:20:36,931
I forgot my purse.

335
00:20:39,354 --> 00:20:41,394
I don't have any money.

336
00:20:42,482 --> 00:20:45,436
- I don't have my license!
- Did you forget your purse?

337
00:20:47,737 --> 00:20:49,813
Yes, you little asshole.

338
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:52,403
- She's great.
- Wait, I got some money.

339
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:54,528
Here.

340
00:20:55,078 --> 00:20:59,241
What, 50 cents? You don't have any
money. You're a kid, for Chrissake.

341
00:20:59,374 --> 00:21:03,039
Yeah, she's right. You're a kid, for
Chrissake. You don't have any money.

342
00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:05,577
Why don't you take a walk
over there, OK? Right there.

343
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,130
[creepy music]

344
00:21:20,186 --> 00:21:22,641
Everybody stay behind me.

345
00:21:24,982 --> 00:21:27,021
[whistles tune]

346
00:21:40,038 --> 00:21:42,078
You kids having some trouble?

347
00:21:44,334 --> 00:21:46,077
You got a spare?

348
00:21:46,211 --> 00:21:48,250
- No.
- Sara!

349
00:21:50,882 --> 00:21:54,583
You went on the expressway
without a spare? [guffaws]

350
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:03,055
- We're history.
- Ancient history.

351
00:22:05,021 --> 00:22:06,848
[all] Aagghh!

352
00:22:07,815 --> 00:22:10,935
Just relax. Stay calm. Don't panic.

353
00:22:11,778 --> 00:22:14,185
- What do you want?
- Just want to help you.

354
00:22:14,572 --> 00:22:17,692
Don't listen to him. He just wants
to scrape our faces off.

355
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,442
What, are you scared of this?

356
00:22:23,164 --> 00:22:25,287
You kids must be from the suburbs.

357
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:27,455
[cackles]

358
00:22:31,755 --> 00:22:33,795
[starts engine]

359
00:22:46,978 --> 00:22:49,386
I suddenly feel like a total idiot.

360
00:22:53,693 --> 00:22:56,149
Just stay here, OK?
I'll be right back.

361
00:22:59,783 --> 00:23:03,697
Listen, I'm really sorry
for freaking out back there.

362
00:23:03,828 --> 00:23:07,493
- I guess we just overreacted.
- That's OK. I'm used to it.

363
00:23:09,334 --> 00:23:11,539
Listen, I appreciate this, but...

364
00:23:12,586 --> 00:23:14,625
we don't have any money.

365
00:23:14,755 --> 00:23:18,373
I'm stuck babysitting
for these kids, and...

366
00:23:18,508 --> 00:23:21,924
I'm not supposed to be taking them
into the city like this.

367
00:23:22,345 --> 00:23:26,213
I'll tell you what. I'll tow you
to town, to Dawson's garage,

368
00:23:26,349 --> 00:23:29,136
and I'll buy you a tyre.
My treat, OK?

369
00:23:30,145 --> 00:23:32,102
OK?

370
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:35,231
- Oh no, that wouldn't be right.
- What would be right?

371
00:23:35,358 --> 00:23:38,027
Leaving you kids alone
on the expressway?

372
00:23:46,202 --> 00:23:48,241
No, I guess not.

373
00:23:50,623 --> 00:23:52,662
My name's Chris. Chris Parker.

374
00:23:52,792 --> 00:23:55,662
Pruitt. Handsome John Pruitt.

375
00:24:18,942 --> 00:24:21,398
- Hey, mister?
- Yeah, red. What?

376
00:24:22,612 --> 00:24:24,570
How did... how did you...

377
00:24:24,698 --> 00:24:26,737
you know... lose it?

378
00:24:26,867 --> 00:24:29,155
- Lose what?
- Your hand.

379
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:31,494
Was it in 'Nam?

380
00:24:31,621 --> 00:24:33,163
Nah, 'fraid not.

381
00:24:33,289 --> 00:24:36,789
I was changing a tyre on a big rig
and the jack gave out.

382
00:24:36,918 --> 00:24:39,954
Back of the truck fell on the hand
and popped it right off.

383
00:24:40,088 --> 00:24:41,748
Vietnam! [laughs]

384
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,378
What did they do with the hand?
Did they bury it?

385
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,549
No, I wouldn't let them.

386
00:24:48,096 --> 00:24:50,302
- I kept it.
- You kept it?

387
00:24:50,431 --> 00:24:52,590
I got it in the glove
compartment.

388
00:24:56,437 --> 00:24:58,560
- Pruitt.
- Yo.

389
00:24:58,689 --> 00:25:01,892
Dawson here.
I just went by your place.

390
00:25:02,026 --> 00:25:04,149
- And what did you see?
- You won't like it.

391
00:25:04,278 --> 00:25:07,611
- What did you see?!
- That car was parked in front.

392
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,527
- She's with that bastard again.
- [horn]

393
00:25:12,828 --> 00:25:14,867
Oh, my God!

394
00:25:15,998 --> 00:25:18,037
[whimpering]

395
00:25:29,136 --> 00:25:32,220
- Stop, Mr Pruitt, please! Slow down.
- [Sara] This is great!

396
00:25:37,852 --> 00:25:39,892
That's my mother's car!

397
00:25:44,484 --> 00:25:47,153
- OK, look out, kids.
- [Daryl] Oh, God!

398
00:25:51,407 --> 00:25:53,066
- Is it a hand?
- No.

399
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,192
- Oh, good.
- It's a gun.

400
00:26:12,135 --> 00:26:13,677
[laughs]

401
00:26:13,803 --> 00:26:15,843
Can we do that again?

402

- [angry voices]
- What's going on?

405
00:26:28,276 --> 00:26:30,315
- [gunshot]
- Jesus!

406
00:26:33,447 --> 00:26:35,487
I can't believe this.

407
00:26:37,618 --> 00:26:39,657
I mean it. I'm going to kill him!

408
00:26:40,663 --> 00:26:42,702
Please don't hurt him.

409
00:26:45,084 --> 00:26:47,123
Everybody out.

410
00:26:50,339 --> 00:26:51,881
Be careful.

411
00:26:55,344 --> 00:26:57,170
- No, please!
- [gun goes off]

412
00:26:59,973 --> 00:27:01,681
My mom's car!

413
00:27:03,268 --> 00:27:06,803
- Chris, get in the car.
- Hey, kids! Get out of my car!

414
00:27:09,899 --> 00:27:13,066
- Come on, Sara.
- Lock the doors.

415
00:27:20,118 --> 00:27:21,316
[screams]

416
00:27:24,205 --> 00:27:26,032
That's my car!

417
00:27:26,666 --> 00:27:28,824
Get out of there.

418
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,999
Get out of my car!

419
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:48,596
Oh, thanks, mister.
You saved our lives.

420
00:27:50,272 --> 00:27:52,312
- Chris?
- Yeah?

421
00:27:53,942 --> 00:27:57,726
Um... He's a car thief.
This is a stolen car.

422
00:28:00,532 --> 00:28:02,441
- No.
- Yeah.

423
00:28:02,576 --> 00:28:05,493
- The chick is losing it.
- I am not.

424
00:28:06,163 --> 00:28:07,989
You guys want some candy?

425
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:13,204
Brad, no chocolate. Your acne.

426
00:28:13,587 --> 00:28:16,790
Sara, it is time
for your cough syrup.

427
00:28:17,674 --> 00:28:19,797
Daryl, fasten the seatbelt.

428
00:28:20,719 --> 00:28:23,292
She's definitely losing it.

429
00:28:23,429 --> 00:28:27,048
I am not losing anything.
I am still in control here.

430
00:28:27,183 --> 00:28:29,223
Got it?

431
00:28:31,187 --> 00:28:35,978
Sir, would you please take us
to the next corner and drop us off?

432
00:28:37,651 --> 00:28:39,608
In this neighbourhood?

433
00:28:39,736 --> 00:28:44,362
Hey, I wouldn't even get out the car
in this neighbourhood.

434
00:28:44,991 --> 00:28:48,407
- Could you drop us off at a mall?
- A mall?

435
00:28:48,536 --> 00:28:51,371
Where y'all think we at,
Boise, Idaho?

436
00:28:51,956 --> 00:28:53,830
Man, look. I'll tell you what.

437
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:56,745
Come with me. I got a little business
to take care of

438
00:28:56,878 --> 00:28:59,582
and then I can drop you
at a train station or something,

439
00:28:59,714 --> 00:29:03,379
but hey, I ain't driving
to no mall. No way.

440
00:29:04,802 --> 00:29:07,471
Do you promise me
you won't hurt these kids?

441
00:29:10,891 --> 00:29:12,931
Yeah, I promise you.

442
00:29:24,822 --> 00:29:26,980
Long way from home

443
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:29,942
Can't sleep at night

444
00:29:30,661 --> 00:29:32,653
Grab your telephone cos

445
00:29:32,788 --> 00:29:35,279
Something just ain't right

446
00:29:35,415 --> 00:29:37,242
That's evil

447
00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:42,920
Evil is going on

448
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:49,470
Well, I'm warning you girls

449
00:29:51,014 --> 00:29:54,597
You better watch your happy home

450
00:29:58,771 --> 00:30:00,645
Where are we going?

451
00:30:00,773 --> 00:30:03,525
To hell.
Kind of exciting, don't you think?

452
00:30:10,032 --> 00:30:12,072
Cos that's evil

453
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:17,242
Evil is going on

454
00:30:21,627 --> 00:30:24,747
Well, I'm warning you girls

455
00:30:26,131 --> 00:30:28,919
You better watch your happy home

456
00:30:36,475 --> 00:30:38,514
[haggling]

457
00:30:41,772 --> 00:30:45,900
- Did you steal all of these cars?
- Yeah. It gets me some good money.

458
00:30:46,026 --> 00:30:50,070
- Isn't it kind of dangerous?
- Hey, I like danger, all right?

459
00:30:50,197 --> 00:30:51,988
You should try babysitting.

460
00:30:57,954 --> 00:31:00,279
- Sir...
- Wait, wait, wait.

461
00:31:00,415 --> 00:31:02,407
My name is Joe Gipp, OK?

462
00:31:02,542 --> 00:31:04,867
- Mr Gipp...
- No, just Joe.

463
00:31:05,003 --> 00:31:07,244
Just Joe, all right?

464
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,456
We have to get our car
to Dawson's garage.

465
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:13,458
- Do you think you could...
- Relax. Everything'll be OK.

466
00:31:18,515 --> 00:31:20,554
[bell rings]

467
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,633
All right,
it's quitting time at Tara!

468
00:31:28,316 --> 00:31:32,978
- Good job. Got any defects?
- Yeah. A few.

469
00:31:44,499 --> 00:31:46,290
Hi.

470
00:31:46,417 --> 00:31:48,623
How you doing? I'm Brad Anderson.

471
00:31:48,753 --> 00:31:51,125
Nice to meet you.
This is my sister Sara.

472
00:31:51,255 --> 00:31:55,253
This is Chris Parker and that's my
best friend, Daryl Coopersmith.

473
00:31:55,384 --> 00:31:58,089
Pleased to meet you. Really.
It's great. Uh...

474
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,509
- Great shirt.
- What are you doing?

475
00:32:00,639 --> 00:32:02,632
Hi! Nice to meet you.

476
00:32:02,766 --> 00:32:05,222
It's a nice place you got here.
Really. I love it.

477
00:32:05,352 --> 00:32:08,803
- Thanks.
- Yeah, it's... great.

478
00:32:09,731 --> 00:32:11,605
Look.

479
00:32:11,733 --> 00:32:14,734
We sort of took a wrong turn
somewhere,

480
00:32:14,861 --> 00:32:17,779
and if you don't mind,
we'd like to get out.

481
00:32:17,906 --> 00:32:19,946
Mm-hm.

482
00:32:25,497 --> 00:32:27,121
Damn.

483
00:32:27,624 --> 00:32:31,207
Hey, don't hold it in, Graydon.
Go and get pissed, man.

484
00:32:32,379 --> 00:32:34,455
You boosted a Caddie full of kids?

485
00:32:34,589 --> 00:32:37,341
They got in the car
while I was still in there, man.

486
00:32:37,467 --> 00:32:41,167
Was I supposed to put them out on the
street? They would have been killed.

487
00:32:41,304 --> 00:32:45,882
They know where our operation is.
They could go to the cops.

488
00:32:46,768 --> 00:32:48,392
Sir.

489
00:32:49,395 --> 00:32:51,435
No, we wouldn't go to the cops.

490
00:32:52,565 --> 00:32:54,522
How am I supposed to know that?

491
00:32:59,196 --> 00:33:00,607
Uh...

492
00:33:01,407 --> 00:33:04,657
Uh... Hey, we can put it in writing.
We'd all sign it.

493
00:33:04,785 --> 00:33:06,943
- We can take it to a notary...
- Shut up.

494
00:33:08,998 --> 00:33:12,034
Take the Brady Bunch upstairs.

495
00:33:15,921 --> 00:33:18,494
We'll take care of them
after the meeting.

496
00:33:19,424 --> 00:33:22,509
All right, you guys go on home.
Clear out of here!

497
00:33:33,855 --> 00:33:37,354
Don't worry. We'll get home.
This has all just been a big mistake.

498
00:33:37,484 --> 00:33:41,398
- But what about Brenda?
- That was her parents' mistake.

499
00:33:44,032 --> 00:33:46,071
[snoring]

500
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,398
I can't see!

501
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:27,269
Oh, Chris, please hurry
and pick me up!

502
00:34:32,828 --> 00:34:34,737
- It's dead.
- Kind of like us.

503
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:37,659
- What?
- We're really in trouble.

504
00:34:38,167 --> 00:34:41,951
- We're going to die here.
- No, we're not.

505
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:50,761
Oh, no. No, we are not climbing up
there. It is much too dangerous.

506
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:53,592
Look at that.
You could poke your eyes out.

507
00:34:55,767 --> 00:34:58,305
Yeah, well,
they might poke our brains out.

508
00:34:58,437 --> 00:35:00,145
Dallas gets the Ferraris,

509
00:35:00,272 --> 00:35:03,806
there's one Lamborghini to Phoenix
and Cleveland needs four Porsches.

510
00:35:03,942 --> 00:35:06,563
- Forget that.
- But they got an order.

511
00:35:06,695 --> 00:35:11,403
I said forget it. I didn't like the
way they've been running things.

512
00:35:12,367 --> 00:35:14,490
Cleveland is dead.

513
00:36:08,421 --> 00:36:10,461
We can go to that window.

514
00:36:11,841 --> 00:36:14,130
- You got to be shitting me.
- Watch your mouth.

515
00:36:14,261 --> 00:36:17,214
Watch my mouth?
You got to be shitting me.

516
00:36:19,516 --> 00:36:22,635
- What if I fall?
- I won't let you fall.

517
00:36:26,689 --> 00:36:28,729
Thanks, Sara.

518
00:36:29,192 --> 00:36:31,231
Just be careful.

519
00:37:32,336 --> 00:37:36,380
I don't think your parents will ever
ask me to babysit again.

520
00:37:36,506 --> 00:37:39,673
If they do,
I'd ask them for a buck more an hour.

521
00:37:44,681 --> 00:37:48,761
Well, multiple murder
or did Sara just cut off her finger?

522
00:37:48,893 --> 00:37:52,013
- I got the answering machine.
- They went for ice cream.

523
00:37:52,147 --> 00:37:54,223
They're OK. Chris can handle it.

524
00:37:54,357 --> 00:37:58,106
Sure! Sara's probably hanging
from the rafters by now.

525
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:12,039
[whispers] Don't look down.

526
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:28,925
[gasps]

527
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:34,392
You idiot!

528
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:39,561
Boston, two Mercedes.

529
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:41,982
What about the Philadelphia order?

530
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:07,792
Where's the magazine?

531
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:09,968
The Playboy?

532
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,056
Uh... I...

533
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,969
I took the Playboy upstairs.

534
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,393
- There was this article...
- Get it.

535
00:39:40,543 --> 00:39:42,582
Let's go. Come on. Hurry up.

536
00:39:43,129 --> 00:39:44,956
Sara, hold on.

537
00:39:57,017 --> 00:40:00,267
One BMW. Indianapolis...

538
00:40:00,396 --> 00:40:04,061
- Where is it?
- It's... not up there.

539
00:40:04,191 --> 00:40:07,726
- I think the kid's got it.
- So get it back from them.

540
00:40:09,279 --> 00:40:13,526
They're not up there either.
They... got away.

541
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:18,611
- Where did you get this?
- From the office.

542
00:40:18,747 --> 00:40:20,574
Come on!

543
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:24,084
You're going to get us into
so much trouble.

544
00:40:25,211 --> 00:40:27,418
- Hey, you kids get back here!
- Run!

545
00:40:30,675 --> 00:40:32,466
Get the car.

546
00:40:32,594 --> 00:40:34,633
Oh, come on. They're kids.

547
00:40:34,762 --> 00:40:38,262
What are you going to do,
run them down and kill them?

548
00:40:38,391 --> 00:40:40,430
Get the car.

549
00:40:42,812 --> 00:40:46,560
Got to get that magazine back. It has
my notes for the Philadelphia order.

550
00:40:46,691 --> 00:40:49,810
[henchman] That could
put us away for 20 years.

551
00:41:01,664 --> 00:41:03,703
Faster.

552
00:41:09,088 --> 00:41:10,796
Oh, no!

553
00:41:10,923 --> 00:41:13,295
Hey! You kids get back here.

554
00:41:13,425 --> 00:41:15,334
Come on!

555
00:41:15,469 --> 00:41:17,508
In here.

556
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:20,548
[blues / rock]

557
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,023
[song winds down]

558
00:41:40,952 --> 00:41:42,991
[final chord]

559
00:41:48,376 --> 00:41:50,415
[applause]

560
00:42:09,979 --> 00:42:13,847
Sir, we didn't mean to interrupt
your little concert here.

561
00:42:14,359 --> 00:42:16,102
We'll just get off the stage...

562
00:42:16,235 --> 00:42:19,320
Nobody gets out of this place
without singing the blues.

563
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,027
What?

564
00:42:21,157 --> 00:42:24,027
Nobody leaves this place
without singing the blues.

565
00:42:25,536 --> 00:42:27,576
You want me to sing?

566
00:42:35,629 --> 00:42:38,547
- They want me to sing.
- Well, do whatever they want.

567
00:42:38,674 --> 00:42:41,591
- Just get us out of here.
- I can't sing.

568
00:43:19,213 --> 00:43:20,624
Hi.

569
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:23,923
My name's Chris Parker.

[riff]

571
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:29,758
I live in Oak Park.
That's a suburb.

572
00:43:30,725 --> 00:43:32,682
They probably figured that out.

573
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:34,719
[riff]

574
00:43:34,854 --> 00:43:39,065
This is Brad, Sara and Daryl -
and we're in trouble.

575
00:43:39,942 --> 00:43:41,981
Ain't no doubt.

[riff]

577
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:47,237
See, me and my boyfriend Mike -
tonight's our anniversary.

578
00:43:49,451 --> 00:43:53,780
But then he went and cancelled, and
now I'm stuck watching these three.

579
00:43:53,914 --> 00:43:55,373
[bass rhythm kicks in]

580
00:43:55,499 --> 00:43:57,788
And it's so hard.

581
00:43:58,627 --> 00:44:01,296
And it's so hard

582
00:44:01,421 --> 00:44:03,877
Babysitting these guys.

583
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:09,550
? She got the...

584
00:44:14,976 --> 00:44:18,060
I got this call from Brenda.
I went to pick her up.

585
00:44:19,689 --> 00:44:23,140
The tyre had a blowout.
And my mom's car got... shot up.

586
00:44:24,068 --> 00:44:27,568
- This guy started to chase us.
- And we all got hijacked.

587
00:44:28,698 --> 00:44:31,782
- We're cruising down the highway.
- In this big old Cadillac.

588
00:44:31,909 --> 00:44:33,569
And it's so hard

589
00:44:35,037 --> 00:44:36,580
It's so hard

590
00:44:36,706 --> 00:44:38,745
Babysitting these guys

591
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:42,916

00:44:58,184 --> 00:45:00,223
There are nights

And you wish your feet

Were walking in
someone else's shoes

602

- Some guys are out to get us
- And Brenda's probably dead

603
00:45:19,204 --> 00:45:22,289
- We ain't got a nickel
- And they should be in bed

604
00:45:22,416 --> 00:45:24,455
And you out of luck

- I did.

635
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:44,799
You guys were pretty cool yourselves.

636
00:47:44,929 --> 00:47:46,257
Come on.

637
00:47:46,389 --> 00:47:49,840
- Where are we going?
- I don't know. Anywhere but here.

638
00:47:57,107 --> 00:47:59,017
- Chris?
- Yeah?

639
00:47:59,151 --> 00:48:01,274
- Can I tell you something?
- Sure.

640
00:48:03,405 --> 00:48:05,232
I, uh...

641
00:48:05,365 --> 00:48:07,939
I didn't really know you
until tonight.

642
00:48:08,076 --> 00:48:10,116
I mean...

643
00:48:11,204 --> 00:48:14,075
I knew you were pretty.
I mean, you are pretty.

644
00:48:14,207 --> 00:48:16,579
Thanks. Is that your dad's building?

645
00:48:17,961 --> 00:48:19,586
Yeah.

646
00:48:20,922 --> 00:48:25,216
You're more than just that, though.
You're kind of smart too.

647
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:27,632
I think we should turn ourselves in.

648
00:48:28,388 --> 00:48:32,255
Wait, listen to me.
The point is, I...

649
00:48:34,394 --> 00:48:36,351
The point is, I...

650
00:48:36,479 --> 00:48:39,930
I don't know what the hell you're
doing with Mike Todwell, OK?

651
00:48:40,066 --> 00:48:41,311
What?!

652
00:48:41,442 --> 00:48:43,980
I mean it. The guy is a total loser.

653
00:48:44,112 --> 00:48:46,021
Daryl knows it. I know it.

654
00:48:46,155 --> 00:48:48,195
It's none of your business.

655
00:48:50,368 --> 00:48:52,859
There's nothing personal, Chris. I...

656
00:48:55,081 --> 00:48:58,165
I just think you should give
other guys a chance.

657
00:49:00,586 --> 00:49:02,625
Like who?

658
00:49:02,755 --> 00:49:06,289
- Well, like...
- Don't say it. Don't say it!

659
00:49:11,013 --> 00:49:13,848
- [sighs] Like me?
- Oh no, he said it.

660
00:49:13,974 --> 00:49:16,761
- [laughs]
- What's so funny?

661
00:49:18,395 --> 00:49:21,064
Well, it's just that you're a child.

662
00:49:21,189 --> 00:49:23,859
You're just a girl in love
with an asshole.

663
00:49:24,776 --> 00:49:26,899
Brad, look, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...

664
00:49:27,028 --> 00:49:29,068
Forget it!

665
00:49:29,197 --> 00:49:30,905
Chris, look where Daryl is.

666
00:49:31,032 --> 00:49:34,235
I would really like to get to know
you. If you have any time.

667
00:49:34,994 --> 00:49:36,702
I have tons of time.

668
00:49:42,585 --> 00:49:47,046
What are you doing? I'm trying to get
a date. You're cramping my style.

669
00:49:47,173 --> 00:49:49,960
- She's too old for you.
- And you're not?

670
00:49:51,219 --> 00:49:53,045
I'm his babysitter.

671
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:56,968
- How old are you?
- I'm 17.

672
00:49:57,099 --> 00:49:58,926
So am I.

673
00:49:59,602 --> 00:50:00,800
You're 17?

674
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:07,266
- What are you doing on the streets?
- I ran away from home.

675
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:10,275
Brenda. Come on.

676
00:50:10,403 --> 00:50:11,518
Bye.

677
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:15,236
Oh Chris, why aren't you here?

[tannoy announces departures]

679
00:50:23,165 --> 00:50:25,158
Oh!

680
00:50:25,293 --> 00:50:28,578
Oh, It's a kitten!

681
00:50:28,713 --> 00:50:31,749
Here, kitty kitty!

682
00:50:31,882 --> 00:50:34,373
[coos] Hello. Hello.

683
00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:35,838
Aaaw!

684
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:38,425
What's the matter? You got lost?

685
00:50:38,555 --> 00:50:40,429
- You ran away from home.
- Drop it.

686
00:50:41,767 --> 00:50:43,806
- What?
- Put the animal down.

687
00:50:43,936 --> 00:50:45,893
- Why?
- We're going to kill it.

688
00:50:46,021 --> 00:50:50,434
What? You monsters! Why would you
kill a poor defenceless kitten?

689
00:50:51,818 --> 00:50:53,610
Kitten?

690
00:50:54,988 --> 00:50:57,823
- This ain't no kitten.
- That's a jumbo-sized rat.

691
00:51:00,619 --> 00:51:02,528
Aagghhh!

692
00:51:05,957 --> 00:51:08,530
You wouldn't believe
what she'd do for 20 bucks.

693
00:51:08,626 --> 00:51:10,418
I don't care.

694
00:51:10,545 --> 00:51:12,668
- It's them!
- Run!

695
00:51:14,382 --> 00:51:16,422
Come on, guys, run!

[ticket seller] Come back! Hey!

699
00:51:47,081 --> 00:51:48,990
Who's paying for those kids?

700
00:51:49,124 --> 00:51:53,585
Somebody better pay for those kids
or I'm calling the cops.

701
00:51:53,712 --> 00:51:55,752
Deal with it.

702
00:52:00,927 --> 00:52:04,296
I want you to tell me
all about those kids.

703
00:52:05,891 --> 00:52:09,805
Where you found them,
where they came from.

704
00:52:11,855 --> 00:52:13,931
Well, how am I supposed to...

705
00:52:14,858 --> 00:52:18,440
- I don't know anything, you know?
- You know something.

706
00:52:19,529 --> 00:52:22,281
Yeah, you do, don't you?

707
00:52:27,078 --> 00:52:28,702
They...

708
00:52:29,455 --> 00:52:31,495
They got to get their car.

709
00:52:32,792 --> 00:52:34,831
We'll get to it first.

710
00:52:36,379 --> 00:52:39,130
What do those guys want?

711
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:42,257
Maybe they want to give us
a ride home.

712
00:52:42,384 --> 00:52:44,424
Do you think?

713
00:52:47,223 --> 00:52:50,223
Sara, honey, I think you should
lay down and get some sleep.

714
00:52:50,351 --> 00:52:53,553
- I'm not tired.
- Well, pretend you're tired.

715
00:52:53,686 --> 00:52:57,020
- Then can I pretend to sleep?
- Yeah, whatever.

716

Jesus!

Cool threads.

We'll get off at the next stop.

719

Now don't you even think about
getting off this train, mocoso.

Only people getting off

- [gang members] That's right!
- How you sound? This is our train.

Well, your train
is rolling in our turf.

So what?

725
00:53:43,318 --> 00:53:47,647
As soon as we cross Devereaux Street
you and your girls is dead meat.

[whooping and taunts]

727
00:53:50,992 --> 00:53:54,443
- They're going to kill each other.
- And kill us doing it.

728
00:53:54,579 --> 00:53:56,618
There goes Jefferson.

729
00:53:57,749 --> 00:53:59,291
There goes Jackson.

730
00:54:02,211 --> 00:54:04,251
Here comes Devereaux.

731
00:54:04,881 --> 00:54:07,454
Excuse me. I couldn't help but notice

732
00:54:07,592 --> 00:54:10,758
that you're about to start
killing each other.

733
00:54:10,886 --> 00:54:14,587
I was wondering if you could please
wait until we get off the train?

734
00:54:14,724 --> 00:54:17,096
- Sit down, bitch.
- Yeah, bitch. Sit down.

735
00:54:18,894 --> 00:54:21,183
Are you going to let them
get away with that?

736
00:54:21,313 --> 00:54:23,685
- Wait a minute.
- I was kidding.

737
00:54:23,816 --> 00:54:27,765
That was really rude.
Take it back, apologise.

738
00:54:28,487 --> 00:54:30,776
- Stay out of this.
- He called you a bitch.

739

- Brad, just up.
- Hey, listen to the bitch, Brad.

740
00:54:36,453 --> 00:54:38,410
Watch your mouth, you...

- You big-city scum-sucker.
- [gang members] Whoo!

00:54:46,046 --> 00:54:49,545
You just can't keep your foot
out of your mouth, can you, boy?

743
00:54:49,674 --> 00:54:51,714
Let me help.

00:54:54,054 --> 00:54:57,837
- Don't fuck with the Lords of Hell.
- [gang members] That's right!

745
00:55:00,185 --> 00:55:02,058
Don't fuck with the babysitter.

746
00:55:07,859 --> 00:55:09,982
All right, baby, chill out. Shit.

747
00:55:12,613 --> 00:55:14,653

[Brad groans]

749
00:55:21,497 --> 00:55:23,490
- Are you OK?
- I can't feel anything.

750
00:55:23,624 --> 00:55:26,993
Don't touch it! It could get
infected. You could get anything.

751
00:55:27,127 --> 00:55:30,828
Tetanus, lockjaw,
rabies, scabies, emphysema.

752
00:55:30,965 --> 00:55:33,964
Well, then don't let him walk on it.
Pick him up.

753
00:55:34,717 --> 00:55:38,418
- What are we going to do with him?
- Guys, can't you read?

754
00:55:39,388 --> 00:55:41,428
Take him to the hospital.

755
00:55:50,858 --> 00:55:53,265
- I can't feel a thing.
- Look out for the car.

756
00:55:53,402 --> 00:55:55,442
[Brad] Ow! Ow!

757
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,280
Get the doors open, quickly.

758
00:56:03,036 --> 00:56:05,076
Get out of the way!

759

Doctor!

760
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,623
Can we have a doctor? Please?

761
00:56:10,752 --> 00:56:12,412
Can I help you?

762
00:56:12,546 --> 00:56:15,630
We need a doctor. My friend was
wounded in a gang fight.

763
00:56:15,757 --> 00:56:17,666
Calm down. I'll tell you what to do.

764
00:56:19,219 --> 00:56:22,006
Wait. That's them.
Those are the kids who stole my car!

765
00:56:22,138 --> 00:56:25,258
What are you bothering me for?
It's them you want.

766
00:56:36,611 --> 00:56:39,528
Brenda, if you're dead
I wish I was with you.

767
00:56:43,701 --> 00:56:46,536
- Those are hot dogs, right?
- Yeah. Want one?

768
00:56:46,662 --> 00:56:48,702
Yeah, I'd love one.

769
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,118
That'll be two bucks.

770
00:56:55,254 --> 00:56:57,163
- A cheque?
- But it's a good cheque.

771
00:56:57,298 --> 00:57:00,631
Chris's mom wrote it to Chris
cos Chris bought her something,

772
00:57:00,759 --> 00:57:04,342
then I bought Chris some press-on
nails and she wrote it over to me.

773
00:57:04,471 --> 00:57:07,472
So I'll write the check over to you
and take the hot dog.

774
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:09,426
You got a pen?

775
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:12,098
- Get out of here.
- Wait. I'm starving.

776
00:57:12,229 --> 00:57:14,186
You'd rather throw it away?

777
00:57:14,314 --> 00:57:18,098
- I work on a cash-only basis.
- But it's a perfectly good cheque.

778
00:57:18,235 --> 00:57:20,523
No! I'll make it very clear.

779
00:57:20,654 --> 00:57:23,109
You slip me the cash
and I'll slip you the wiener.

780
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:26,691
- But I don't have any cash.
- Then I don't have a wiener!

781
00:57:28,078 --> 00:57:30,995
There you are.
One stitch. All better.

782
00:57:32,123 --> 00:57:34,661
- One stitch?
- Yes, one stitch.

783
00:57:35,835 --> 00:57:40,164
My only shot at every being in a gang
fight and all I get is one stitch?

784
00:57:40,298 --> 00:57:43,050
Chris is going to think
I'm a total failure.

785
00:57:45,011 --> 00:57:48,510
Dr Nuhkbane, the guy with
the stab wounds just died.

786
00:57:49,974 --> 00:57:51,172
Oh, dear.

787
00:57:55,771 --> 00:57:58,227
Oh, Doctor.
We're looking for a friend.

788
00:57:58,357 --> 00:58:00,729
Your friend? Which one is he?

789
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:02,817
He's the one with the stab wound.

790
00:58:04,738 --> 00:58:06,446
- Oh, dear.
- What?

791
00:58:07,116 --> 00:58:09,358
I am sorry. Your friend is dead.

792
00:58:09,493 --> 00:58:10,987
Dead?

793
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,697
Dead?

794
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:14,868
Dead?

795
00:58:15,873 --> 00:58:17,913
[Sara] Oh, Chris!

796
00:58:24,632 --> 00:58:26,589
Sara, what happened?

797
00:58:28,177 --> 00:58:30,051
[whispers] Brad.

798
00:58:30,179 --> 00:58:32,218
Brad!

799
00:58:38,312 --> 00:58:40,351
Daryl, why are you hugging me?

800
00:58:42,691 --> 00:58:45,443
Brad, don't you ever die on me. Ever.

801
00:58:48,155 --> 00:58:50,443
OK. I won't.

802
00:58:50,574 --> 00:58:52,732
What's going on?

803
00:58:52,868 --> 00:58:54,659
What happened?

804
00:58:54,786 --> 00:58:58,120
Oh, dear, you're her friend.
She's fainted.

805
00:59:05,255 --> 00:59:07,294
I had the worst nightmare.

806
00:59:07,924 --> 00:59:09,964
We were stuck in this...

807
00:59:10,802 --> 00:59:13,553
- It's really happening.
- Some night, huh?

808
00:59:14,555 --> 00:59:18,007
It's all right.
I made a mistake, see? He's fine.

809
00:59:20,395 --> 00:59:22,553
Now, you children,
you stay right here.

810
00:59:22,688 --> 00:59:25,642
I'll send the nurse back
with the paperwork.

811
00:59:25,775 --> 00:59:27,814
Come on with me.

812
00:59:28,611 --> 00:59:32,146
Paperwork. She's going to want
to know my name and stuff.

813
00:59:32,281 --> 00:59:34,487
- I'm going to call my mom.
- No, no mothers.

814
00:59:34,617 --> 00:59:36,325
They'll kill us. No way.

815
00:59:36,452 --> 00:59:40,152
Hey, you kids!
Where's my car, goddammit?

816
00:59:42,124 --> 00:59:44,496
- Mr Pruitt!
- Heh-heh!

817
00:59:44,626 --> 00:59:48,541
Babysitter! You want your car,
come on. It's fixed. Let's go.

818
00:59:49,089 --> 00:59:51,129
Hey, wait a minute there.

819
01:00:02,144 --> 01:00:05,347
- What are you doing here?
- I got a little banged up.

820
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,805
- Where's our car?
- At Dawson's garage.

821
01:00:07,941 --> 01:00:10,348
- Is her car OK?
- Yeah. I paid for the window.

822
01:00:10,485 --> 01:00:14,020
That's my fault. But Dawson's going
to make you pay for the tyre.

823
01:00:14,155 --> 01:00:16,029
- How much?
- 50 bucks.

824
01:00:18,785 --> 01:00:21,358
- 50 bucks?
- Yeah, 50 bucks.

825
01:00:23,748 --> 01:00:25,491
- Here we go.
- Where are you going?

826
01:00:25,625 --> 01:00:28,329
- I'm a fugitive now, OK?
- Kind of like us.

827
01:00:29,712 --> 01:00:32,084
- Good luck, babysitter.
- You too, Mr Pruitt!

828
01:00:32,215 --> 01:00:34,337
Hey, Pruitt, stop!

829
01:00:34,467 --> 01:00:36,506
Hold it right there!

830
01:00:38,262 --> 01:00:40,171
Where are we going to get 50 bucks?

831
01:00:40,306 --> 01:00:42,879
Maybe we could sell Daryl. You think?

832
01:00:45,394 --> 01:00:47,683
We will think of something. Come on.

833
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:54,854
- Chris, I got to make.
- You got to what?

834
01:00:54,987 --> 01:00:58,152
I got to go to the bathroom.
I've really got to go.

835
01:00:58,281 --> 01:01:01,068
- Just try and hold it, honey, OK?
- Sounds like a party.

836
01:01:01,617 --> 01:01:03,657
Looks like a party...

837
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:05,994
It is a party!

838
01:01:06,122 --> 01:01:09,573
- Daryl, get back here.
- Sorry, can't talk. Got to run.

839
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:14,335
Why do I have this feeling
we're never going to see him again?

840
01:01:14,463 --> 01:01:17,583
Come on, Sara, you can go
to the bathroom in there.

841
01:01:17,716 --> 01:01:19,756
[music from inside]

842
01:01:22,346 --> 01:01:24,385
I've been trying to get to you

843
01:01:24,515 --> 01:01:26,341
For a long time

844
01:01:26,475 --> 01:01:28,348
Seems constantly that

845
01:01:28,477 --> 01:01:30,350
You were on my mind

846
01:01:30,479 --> 01:01:34,263
I was thinking about
a short-cut I might take

847
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:37,519
Well, it seems like
I made a mistake

848
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:46,618
I really have to go to the bathroom.

849
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:50,034
- I have to go really bad.
- In a minute.

850
01:01:58,756 --> 01:02:00,796
- What?
- I don't believe it.

851
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:06,219
- I don't believe it.
- Who is it? Some high-IQ kids?

852
01:02:06,347 --> 01:02:08,386
No, stupid, it's Miss March.

853
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:15,139
There's Daryl.

854
01:02:15,272 --> 01:02:17,312
No way!

855
01:02:20,736 --> 01:02:22,610
- It is Miss March.
- What?

856
01:02:22,738 --> 01:02:25,063
This is amazing. Could you sign this?

857
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:27,238
Right here.

858
01:02:31,371 --> 01:02:34,041
- I can't believe it.
- Can't believe what?

859
01:02:34,791 --> 01:02:36,867
- This is not me.
- It sure is you.

860
01:02:37,002 --> 01:02:39,041
It is not.

861
01:02:43,758 --> 01:02:46,380
- What's your name?
- It's not Shaylene.

862
01:02:49,389 --> 01:02:51,678
- She's not Shaylene.
- Wait a minute.

863
01:02:51,808 --> 01:02:54,429
Guys, come on. Think about this.

864
01:02:55,562 --> 01:02:57,803
Do you honestly believe
a Playboy centrefold

865
01:02:57,939 --> 01:02:59,563
would have nothing better to do

866
01:02:59,691 --> 01:03:02,894
than to show up at a Kappa party
with a bunch of kids?

867
01:03:05,988 --> 01:03:07,946
- Yeah.
- Maybe.

868
01:03:09,075 --> 01:03:11,114
Where's your brain?

869
01:03:16,916 --> 01:03:18,955
Told you it wasn't her, stupid.

870
01:03:19,543 --> 01:03:21,583
Sorry.

871
01:03:23,339 --> 01:03:24,999
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

872
01:03:25,549 --> 01:03:27,341
I've really got to go, Chris.

873
01:03:28,594 --> 01:03:32,045
- Where's your bathroom?
- It's right that way.

874
01:03:32,181 --> 01:03:33,591
I'll...

875
01:03:34,057 --> 01:03:36,097
I'll take Sara to the bathroom.

876
01:03:37,811 --> 01:03:39,850
One, two, three!

877
01:03:44,066 --> 01:03:46,106
Aagghh!

878
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:49,859
[bell rings]

879
01:03:53,492 --> 01:03:56,410
- Hey, guys.
- I must be hallucinating.

880
01:03:56,537 --> 01:03:59,407
Does anybody else see
a talking penis?

881
01:04:04,795 --> 01:04:06,871
Hey, speaking of penises,

882
01:04:07,005 --> 01:04:09,496
do you know
how the Playboy Unabashed Dictionary

883
01:04:09,633 --> 01:04:11,672
defines oral gratification?

884
01:04:13,178 --> 01:04:15,005
I do.

885
01:04:21,645 --> 01:04:25,096
I haven't seen you around campus
much. You a freshman?

886
01:04:26,191 --> 01:04:28,230
Sophomore.

887
01:04:28,401 --> 01:04:30,192
You can't be a junior.

888
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,478
I'm a senior.

889
01:04:32,614 --> 01:04:35,235
- In high school.
- In high school?

890
01:04:36,159 --> 01:04:37,487
Yeah.

891
01:04:38,995 --> 01:04:41,402
- I can't believe it.
- What?

892
01:04:42,999 --> 01:04:47,246
The prettiest girl at the University
of Chicago is in high school.

893
01:04:48,671 --> 01:04:50,794
- Oh, that was good(!)
- No, I mean it.

894
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:52,455
Yeah?

895
01:04:53,717 --> 01:04:55,461
[song comes to an end]

896
01:05:01,475 --> 01:05:03,515
Want to dance?

897
01:05:04,228 --> 01:05:07,312
- I don't have time.
- She'll be in line for a while.

898
01:05:08,023 --> 01:05:10,431
- OK.
- I'm Dan. Dan Lynch.

899
01:05:10,567 --> 01:05:13,983
I'm going to slow it down now and do
a song I wrote for the woman I love.

900
01:05:14,112 --> 01:05:15,393
Do it, Bobby.

901
01:05:19,201 --> 01:05:21,739
I go through each day

902
01:05:23,163 --> 01:05:25,914
Hoping for something

903
01:05:26,041 --> 01:05:28,080
Some little sign

904
01:05:30,170 --> 01:05:32,458
So, you're babysitting these kids?

905
01:05:33,173 --> 01:05:36,791
Huh! I don't think you can call it
babysitting.

906
01:05:36,926 --> 01:05:40,794
I see my future in your eyes

907
01:05:44,434 --> 01:05:49,095
If they end up as drug addicts and
mass-murderers it's my fault.

908
01:05:49,230 --> 01:05:52,978
Look, don't worry about it.
Everything's going to be OK.

909
01:05:53,109 --> 01:05:56,026
- I think you're doing a great job.
- You do?

910
01:05:56,153 --> 01:05:59,487
Sure I do. I mean,
you've gotten the kids this far.

911
01:06:00,324 --> 01:06:02,566
They're still alive. [laughs]

912
01:06:02,701 --> 01:06:04,741
It could be a lot worse.

913
01:06:05,829 --> 01:06:07,869
It could be.

914
01:06:07,998 --> 01:06:10,121
I know how quickly time flies

915
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:14,330
I see my future in your eyes

916
01:06:16,089 --> 01:06:20,501
I see my future in your eyes

917
01:06:21,594 --> 01:06:24,381
Yes, I've felt the sorrow

918
01:06:24,513 --> 01:06:27,550
And I've heard the crying

919
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:32,012
Believe me, I've tasted the tears

920
01:06:38,694 --> 01:06:40,983
It's always the same.

921
01:06:41,113 --> 01:06:46,024
All he cares about are the Bears,
the Bengals, the Dolphins.

922
01:06:48,036 --> 01:06:50,076
What about the love?

923
01:06:50,622 --> 01:06:52,662
The romance?

924
01:06:53,542 --> 01:06:55,119
And the sex?

925
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:58,959
I care about those things.

926
01:07:00,298 --> 01:07:02,090
Deeply.

927
01:07:02,217 --> 01:07:04,256
I'm so lonely.

928
01:07:07,097 --> 01:07:10,430
How could a righteous babe like you
be lonely?

929
01:07:11,893 --> 01:07:14,847
That's the sweetest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

930
01:07:14,979 --> 01:07:16,888
Really?

931
01:07:17,023 --> 01:07:19,062
Want to go to bed?

932
01:07:26,616 --> 01:07:29,189
- I really have to go.
- No, no, no.

933
01:07:29,327 --> 01:07:31,449
Tell me how I can help.
What do you need?

934
01:07:31,579 --> 01:07:33,536
Well...

935
01:07:33,664 --> 01:07:36,036
Actually, I...

936
01:07:36,167 --> 01:07:38,871
- I need $50.
- No problem.

937
01:07:40,587 --> 01:07:42,247
Really?

938
01:07:42,923 --> 01:07:44,916
All I got is a 20.

939
01:07:45,050 --> 01:07:47,422
- Oh, no, that's fine.
- No, wait right here.

940
01:07:47,553 --> 01:07:49,592
I'll be right back.

941
01:07:50,889 --> 01:07:54,472
- He is getting us $50.
- Tha... That's terrific.

942
01:08:00,982 --> 01:08:03,769
- Hi. We're going to get the money.
- Really?

943
01:08:03,902 --> 01:08:05,941
Isn't that great, Brad?

944
01:08:07,697 --> 01:08:10,532
- I could only get 45.
- Oh no, that's great.

945
01:08:10,658 --> 01:08:12,366
- Thank you so much.
- Luann.

946
01:08:13,745 --> 01:08:15,405
What the hell are you doing?

947
01:08:15,538 --> 01:08:18,290
You've been replaced,
you big dumb bohunk.

948
01:08:19,208 --> 01:08:22,743
- Oh, you're dead, kid.
- I didn't touch her. I'm a child.

949
01:08:26,174 --> 01:08:29,543
Lay off, he's just a kid,
you big dumb bohunk.

950
01:08:29,677 --> 01:08:31,171
I'm driving.

951
01:08:44,858 --> 01:08:46,898
This is really weird.

952
01:08:48,028 --> 01:08:50,566
You're weird.

953
01:08:50,698 --> 01:08:52,737
[Daryl cackles]

954
01:09:23,645 --> 01:09:27,014
- The car is fixed.
- That's great. That's wonderful.

955
01:09:29,943 --> 01:09:32,814
Thank you. Really.

956
01:09:32,946 --> 01:09:34,440
No problem.

957
01:09:34,573 --> 01:09:37,324
Why don't you go pay for the car
and I'll wait out here

958
01:09:37,450 --> 01:09:39,906
and see that you get out OK?

959
01:09:40,996 --> 01:09:42,739
No, that's OK. We'll be fine.

960
01:09:43,790 --> 01:09:45,829
Are you sure?

961
01:09:46,543 --> 01:09:48,582
Yeah, I'm sure.

962
01:09:50,338 --> 01:09:51,962
OK.

963
01:09:53,049 --> 01:09:55,255
Take care of yourself.

964
01:09:55,385 --> 01:09:58,255
- See you, guys.
- Bye.

965
01:09:58,387 --> 01:09:59,383
Wait.

966
01:10:02,099 --> 01:10:05,017
How am I going to find you
to pay you back?

967
01:10:05,770 --> 01:10:07,809
Don't worry about it.

968
01:10:09,231 --> 01:10:11,023
Maybe I'll see you again.

969
01:10:17,323 --> 01:10:20,158
Come on, Brad.
Seems pretty cool, right?

970
01:10:21,285 --> 01:10:23,324
Right?

971
01:10:29,710 --> 01:10:31,749
[Chris] Mr Dawson?

972
01:10:36,883 --> 01:10:38,627
[Brad] Hello?

973
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:40,800
[Sara] Mr Dawson?

974
01:10:43,139 --> 01:10:45,512
[Chris] Is anybody here?

975
01:10:45,642 --> 01:10:47,681
[Sara] Hello?

976
01:10:51,189 --> 01:10:53,228
[Brad] Hello?

977
01:10:55,193 --> 01:10:56,735
Mr Dawson?

978
01:11:04,786 --> 01:11:06,196
Mr Dawson?

979
01:11:06,329 --> 01:11:08,368
[machinery roars]

980
01:11:38,068 --> 01:11:39,895
Thor!

981
01:11:41,113 --> 01:11:42,571
[Chris] Sara...

982
01:11:42,698 --> 01:11:44,736
O Thor, mighty God of thunder.

983
01:11:46,158 --> 01:11:49,325
- Who is this kid?
- You must be Mr Dawson, right?

984
01:11:51,330 --> 01:11:54,165
- [whispers] Secret identity.
- What do you want?

985
01:11:55,417 --> 01:11:58,502
Um... Mr Pruitt sent us.
This is our car.

986
01:11:59,463 --> 01:12:01,502
You owe me 50 bucks.

987
01:12:04,843 --> 01:12:07,334
Have you been fighting
the forces of darkness?

988
01:12:08,889 --> 01:12:10,846
What is she talking about?

989
01:12:10,974 --> 01:12:14,639
- She thinks you're somebody else.
- It's him, Brad. It's really him.

990
01:12:14,769 --> 01:12:17,095
- Look, it's Thor!
- Come on, let's go.

991
01:12:17,230 --> 01:12:20,231
Don't listen to him anyway.
He said you were a homo.

992
01:12:25,989 --> 01:12:28,361
You spreading rumours about me, kid?

993
01:12:29,158 --> 01:12:31,484
Oh, no. No, sir.

994
01:12:32,578 --> 01:12:34,618
Thank you. Come on, Sara.

995
01:12:36,999 --> 01:12:39,325
What's this? There's $45 here.
You owe me 50.

996
01:12:40,128 --> 01:12:43,294
- I know. That's all that we have.
- Then you don't have a car.

997
01:12:43,422 --> 01:12:46,507
You don't understand.
We have had an unbelievable night...

998
01:12:46,634 --> 01:12:48,093
Save it!

999
01:12:48,219 --> 01:12:50,258
You owe me money.

1000
01:12:50,846 --> 01:12:52,886
Now, you give me five bucks,

1001
01:12:53,474 --> 01:12:55,513
or you get out.

1002
01:12:59,063 --> 01:13:02,063
I thought you always helped
people in trouble.

1003
01:13:05,277 --> 01:13:08,444
Hey, kid, this is the city.

1004
01:13:08,572 --> 01:13:10,944
- I help nobody but myself.
- But I thought...

1005
01:13:11,074 --> 01:13:13,114
Get lost!

1006
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:22,123
Wait! I know why you're not
acting like yourself.

1007
01:13:22,252 --> 01:13:24,707
You don't have your special helmet.

1008
01:13:27,257 --> 01:13:32,298
See, you're wearing the baseball hat.
You're supposed to be wearing this.

1009
01:13:32,428 --> 01:13:34,468
Take mine.

1010
01:13:35,473 --> 01:13:37,513
Go on, take it.

1011
01:13:38,226 --> 01:13:40,265
Take it.

1012
01:13:43,773 --> 01:13:45,812
You're giving this to me?

1013
01:13:46,484 --> 01:13:48,275
Well, yeah. You're my hero.

1014
01:14:00,414 --> 01:14:02,039
Here.

1015
01:14:02,583 --> 01:14:04,622
Here, take the car.

1016
01:14:06,003 --> 01:14:08,161
Thanks, Thor.

1017
01:14:08,297 --> 01:14:10,336
You're welcome. Hey, kid.

1018
01:14:11,967 --> 01:14:14,007
I got one of these at home.

1019
01:14:16,179 --> 01:14:18,753
Could I get your address
so I could send you a cheque?

1020
01:14:18,890 --> 01:14:21,891
- Go!
- Come on, Chris. Get in the car.

1021
01:14:22,019 --> 01:14:24,225
- Thank you.
- Thanks!

1022
01:14:33,529 --> 01:14:35,817
- Daryl, what time is it?
- 11.41.

1023
01:14:35,948 --> 01:14:39,114
OK, we can get Brenda
and we can be home by one.

1024
01:14:39,243 --> 01:14:41,282
[Sara] Man, am I up late!

1025
01:14:43,163 --> 01:14:45,203
Good work, Joe Gipp.

1026
01:14:45,999 --> 01:14:48,039
Follow them.

1027
01:14:54,799 --> 01:14:56,839
[snoring]

1028
01:15:07,937 --> 01:15:09,396
Stop!

1029
01:15:09,522 --> 01:15:11,147
Thief!

1030
01:15:13,192 --> 01:15:15,232
She's woken up! [laughs]

1031
01:15:24,412 --> 01:15:26,120
Get out of my house!

1032
01:15:26,998 --> 01:15:29,323
Wow, look at that toy store!

1033
01:15:29,834 --> 01:15:31,992
Chris, look at the toy store!

1034
01:15:32,128 --> 01:15:34,701
- Look at all those toys!
- I can see it.

1035
01:15:44,765 --> 01:15:46,259
Oh, great.

1036
01:15:47,601 --> 01:15:49,973
What are we looking at?

1037
01:15:50,103 --> 01:15:52,855
Mike was supposed to
take me there tonight.

1038
01:15:55,734 --> 01:15:57,561
Oh-ho-ho!

1039
01:15:57,694 --> 01:16:00,150
- What?
- Looks like he went without you.

1040
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:02,319
Check it out.

1041
01:16:10,832 --> 01:16:12,871
What's wrong?

1042
01:16:14,043 --> 01:16:15,787
Everything.

1043
01:16:21,926 --> 01:16:25,758
- Ahem! May I help you?
- We're just looking for somebody.

1044
01:16:31,727 --> 01:16:35,227
- Let's just go in and get 'em.
- Patience.

1045
01:16:46,450 --> 01:16:48,489
He's with Sesame Blexar.

1046
01:16:49,495 --> 01:16:51,783
She's such a sleaze.

1047
01:16:51,914 --> 01:16:54,998
He dumps you for an easy chick
and you get a night of hell.

1048
01:16:55,125 --> 01:16:57,165
Doesn't seem fair to me.

1049
01:16:58,754 --> 01:17:01,671
Stay here and watch Sara.
I will be right back.

1050
01:17:04,301 --> 01:17:06,340
I got to see this.

1051
01:17:17,438 --> 01:17:19,430
You know, Ses,

1052
01:17:19,565 --> 01:17:22,400
girls like you come along
once in a lifetime.

1053
01:17:24,319 --> 01:17:26,276
Or twice in the same night.

1054
01:17:27,406 --> 01:17:28,734
Oh, wow.

1055
01:17:31,743 --> 01:17:34,530
- How's your sister? All better(?)
- Well...

1056
01:17:35,664 --> 01:17:37,656
You lied.

1057
01:17:37,791 --> 01:17:39,451
- No, I didn't.
- Don't lie!

1058
01:17:45,715 --> 01:17:47,423
Get a grip. Jesus!

1059
01:17:47,550 --> 01:17:51,963
A grip. Do you have any idea
what I've been through tonight?

1060
01:18:01,314 --> 01:18:02,974
I thought that...

1061
01:18:03,107 --> 01:18:05,016
I thought that...

1062
01:18:05,151 --> 01:18:06,811
that you loved me.

1063
01:18:12,616 --> 01:18:14,408
Or is it all just bullshit, huh?

1064
01:18:15,077 --> 01:18:18,660
Look, little girl,
I don't know what you thought we had,

1065
01:18:18,789 --> 01:18:22,324
but it wasn't half as serious
as you like to think it was.

1066
01:18:24,378 --> 01:18:26,417
All right. You let go of her.

1067
01:18:27,256 --> 01:18:29,213
Picking them kind of young,
aren't you?

1068
01:18:29,341 --> 01:18:32,626
This kid's got more class at 15
than you'll ever have.

1069
01:18:38,475 --> 01:18:41,345
- You're such a loser.
- Here we go again.

1070
01:18:44,773 --> 01:18:49,020
I could only dream of having somebody
like Chris for a girlfriend.

1071
01:18:50,236 --> 01:18:52,312
But you've got her!

1072
01:18:52,447 --> 01:18:56,065
- And you treat her like this?
- Don't waste your time, half-pint.

1073
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:59,036
Her legs are locked together
at the knee.

1074
01:19:02,457 --> 01:19:03,951
I'd love to hit you.

1075
01:19:04,083 --> 01:19:06,870
- I'd love to pound on your face.
- Yeah? Go ahead?

1076
01:19:14,969 --> 01:19:16,961
But I won't.

1077
01:19:19,098 --> 01:19:21,589
You're so slimy,
I won't sink to your level.

1078
01:19:22,768 --> 01:19:24,262
I will.

1079
01:19:27,648 --> 01:19:30,851
- Oh! That's just great.
- See you around, Mike.

1080
01:19:37,115 --> 01:19:39,155
Did you see that? That was great.

1081
01:19:39,868 --> 01:19:41,777
We were amazing!

1082
01:19:41,912 --> 01:19:44,663
We were, weren't we?
It was so cool.

1083
01:19:45,665 --> 01:19:47,872
- I was so cool.
- Can you believe it?

1084
01:19:49,085 --> 01:19:50,744
Where is Sara?

1085
01:20:02,889 --> 01:20:04,514
Hey, kid.

1086
01:20:05,809 --> 01:20:07,387
Come here for a second.

1087
01:20:10,272 --> 01:20:12,098
Get her.

1088
01:20:20,365 --> 01:20:23,235
- Mom. Dad.
- [screech of brakes]

1089
01:20:28,748 --> 01:20:30,408
Sara!

1090
01:20:30,541 --> 01:20:33,708
- Sara!
- I thought she'd be here.

1091
01:20:50,561 --> 01:20:51,972
Let go!

1092
01:20:56,442 --> 01:20:58,268
Hey, kid. Hey, hold it, man.

1093
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:10,611
- Dammit.
- Sara!

1094
01:21:10,747 --> 01:21:13,119
Sara!

1095
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:14,910
- Guys, look.
- What?

1096
01:21:15,043 --> 01:21:17,534
It's my dad's building.
My mom and dad are there.

1097
01:21:17,671 --> 01:21:19,710
She's probably there. Come on!

1098
01:21:29,390 --> 01:21:31,015
Mom?

1099
01:21:31,768 --> 01:21:33,392
Dad?

1100
01:21:48,242 --> 01:21:51,243
I'll take this floor
and you take the one above.

1101
01:22:05,676 --> 01:22:07,715
[voices from party]

1102
01:22:31,825 --> 01:22:34,114
Hey, kid. Come on out.

1103
01:22:40,209 --> 01:22:42,581
I just need to get something
from you.

1104
01:22:44,463 --> 01:22:46,502
I'm not going to hurt you.

1105
01:22:48,842 --> 01:22:50,420
Hey, come on, kid.

1106
01:22:50,552 --> 01:22:52,710
Sara!

1107
01:22:52,846 --> 01:22:54,885
Sara!

1108
01:22:55,807 --> 01:22:57,847
- Sara?
- Sara!

1109
01:23:02,856 --> 01:23:04,516
Sara's in trouble.

1110
01:23:06,609 --> 01:23:09,563
Hey! Stop! Don't go out there.

1111
01:23:12,281 --> 01:23:14,321
Get back here.

1112
01:23:17,954 --> 01:23:19,946
Hey, kid, wait.

1113
01:23:23,626 --> 01:23:25,369
Jesus Christ.

1114
01:23:25,503 --> 01:23:27,246
Hey!

1115
01:23:29,799 --> 01:23:32,503
Come on back up here. Come on!

1116
01:23:37,056 --> 01:23:39,629
- Which floor?
- We'll try this one first.

1117
01:24:08,545 --> 01:24:09,659
[cries out]

1118
01:24:34,612 --> 01:24:37,233
Oh God. We're at my parents' party.

1119
01:24:38,282 --> 01:24:40,321
[voices and light piano music]

1120
01:24:52,838 --> 01:24:55,210
Now kid, stay right where you are.

1121
01:24:56,341 --> 01:24:58,381
Don't move.

1122
01:24:59,428 --> 01:25:01,467
My parents. What are we going to do?

1123
01:25:01,596 --> 01:25:05,012
- I'm going out there to find Sara.
- You can't. They'll see you.

1124
01:25:05,141 --> 01:25:06,933
No they won't.

1125
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:09,468
Stay right here. I'll be right back.

1126
01:25:26,995 --> 01:25:29,284
Be right back with the coats, honey.

1127
01:25:41,134 --> 01:25:43,173
[hums]

1128
01:25:54,730 --> 01:25:56,640
I don't believe it.

1129
01:25:56,774 --> 01:25:59,858
Len Lescher. Loyola Law?

1130
01:25:59,986 --> 01:26:01,610
Class of '68?

1131
01:26:02,738 --> 01:26:05,858
- Sorry, wrong guy.
- Honey, we should be going.

1132
01:26:05,991 --> 01:26:09,407
- Nice meeting you.
- It's getting kind of late.

1133
01:26:09,537 --> 01:26:11,197
Looking for something?

1134
01:26:11,330 --> 01:26:13,903
- Come on, let's go.
- Oh come on, honey.

1135
01:26:14,041 --> 01:26:17,706
Just one more.
My diet doesn't start till next week.

1136
01:26:17,836 --> 01:26:20,458
- Well, we told Chris one o'clock.
- These are so good.

1137
01:26:20,589 --> 01:26:22,629
Excuse me.

1138
01:26:24,134 --> 01:26:26,174
- You tried one of these?
- What?

1139
01:26:27,304 --> 01:26:30,969
They are so delicious.
I've got to get this recipe.

1140
01:26:33,769 --> 01:26:36,686
Do you happen to know
the name of the caterer?

1141
01:26:36,813 --> 01:26:38,640
Caterer?

1142
01:26:45,864 --> 01:26:48,983
We didn't mean to
spring it on you like this.

1143
01:26:53,496 --> 01:26:55,536
Hello?

1144
01:27:01,754 --> 01:27:04,079
You'll excuse me.

1145
01:27:04,215 --> 01:27:06,622
Oh, my God. Is he OK?

1146
01:27:06,759 --> 01:27:08,752
Did you hurt yourself?

1147
01:27:10,012 --> 01:27:12,052
[whispers] Brad. Daryl.

1148
01:27:13,015 --> 01:27:15,471
- Where's Sara?
- She's out the window.

1149
01:27:16,352 --> 01:27:18,428
Take it easy. No rush.

1150
01:27:18,562 --> 01:27:19,476
What?

1151
01:27:19,605 --> 01:27:23,104
She must have gone upstairs and out
the window. She's out there now.

1152
01:27:23,233 --> 01:27:25,309
Mom? Dad?

1153
01:27:27,780 --> 01:27:29,938
Goddamn!

1154
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:49,212
Sara, just hold on, OK?
Don't be scared.

1155
01:27:50,927 --> 01:27:52,967
Daryl, Brad, loosen the rope.

1156
01:27:53,513 --> 01:27:55,137
Come on, hurry.

1157
01:27:56,723 --> 01:27:58,218
Let me give you a hand.

1158
01:27:58,350 --> 01:27:59,928
Sara, grab the rope.

1159
01:28:00,060 --> 01:28:02,100
Easy, easy.

1160
01:28:03,522 --> 01:28:07,187
That's the most exciting thing
that's happened all night.

1161
01:28:09,027 --> 01:28:13,321
Just take it really slow.
Don't be scared of him, Sara.

1162
01:28:13,448 --> 01:28:16,235
OK, that's good. Don't look down.

1163
01:28:16,368 --> 01:28:18,526
OK, that's good.

1164
01:28:18,661 --> 01:28:20,369
Keep walking, that's right.

1165
01:28:20,497 --> 01:28:22,785
Just walk right by him.

1166
01:28:22,916 --> 01:28:24,873
Hold on.

1167
01:28:25,001 --> 01:28:27,409
You're almost here. Hold on, Sara.

1168
01:28:28,087 --> 01:28:31,587
Just walk right up it.
You're almost there. Hang on.

1169
01:28:32,216 --> 01:28:35,003
OK, real close. Don't worry. Grab on.

1170
01:28:38,472 --> 01:28:40,512
Oh, Brad!

1171
01:28:42,476 --> 01:28:44,350
Sara?

1172
01:28:45,521 --> 01:28:48,522
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. Can we go home now?

1173
01:28:49,275 --> 01:28:50,769
Not yet.

1174
01:28:58,701 --> 01:29:03,279
Look, I'm not going to hurt you,
all right? I just need the Playboy.

1175
01:29:14,216 --> 01:29:17,834
See, this is what they were after.
Some notes and stuff.

1176
01:29:18,553 --> 01:29:22,136
You know, that they need. I guess
they're pretty important to them.

1177
01:29:26,644 --> 01:29:28,684
- Don't say it.
- [Daryl laughs]

1178
01:29:29,647 --> 01:29:32,185
- Wow!
- It's pretty uncanny, huh?

1179
01:29:36,321 --> 01:29:38,147
She don't even compare to you.

1180
01:29:43,161 --> 01:29:45,734
- Well, what about him?
- Who?

1181
01:29:45,872 --> 01:29:47,911
Come here.

1182
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:55,791
- Help!
- Uh... yeah.

1183
01:29:58,133 --> 01:30:02,511
Leave him hanging out there for a
while. Let him sweat it out. Come on.

1184
01:30:05,182 --> 01:30:07,221
[laughter]

1185
01:30:12,564 --> 01:30:16,396
Give me the magazine
and get out of here.

1186
01:30:18,111 --> 01:30:20,151
I'll take care of the children.

1187
01:30:32,667 --> 01:30:35,454
You're right.
Babysitting is dangerous.

1188
01:30:35,587 --> 01:30:37,625
Come on.

1189
01:30:42,968 --> 01:30:45,885
? 25 miles from home, girl

1190
01:30:46,805 --> 01:30:50,090
? My feet are hurting mighty bad

1191
01:30:50,225 --> 01:30:54,009
? Now I've been walking for
three days and two lonely nights

1192
01:30:54,145 --> 01:30:57,265
? You know that I'm mighty mad

1193
01:31:03,780 --> 01:31:05,819
Chris!

1194
01:31:07,533 --> 01:31:09,573
Oh, I'm so happy.

1195
01:31:12,663 --> 01:31:14,371
What took you guys so long?

1196
01:31:14,499 --> 01:31:17,950
You'll never believe
what I've been through tonight.

1197
01:31:23,549 --> 01:31:25,755
? I'm so tired

1198
01:31:25,885 --> 01:31:29,170
? But I just can't lose my stride

1199
01:31:30,806 --> 01:31:33,262
I lost my skate. It's not here.

1200
01:31:33,851 --> 01:31:37,302
- Maybe you left it some place.
- We gotta go back and find it.

1201
01:31:37,438 --> 01:31:39,477
No, Sara honey, we can't.

1202
01:31:49,616 --> 01:31:51,276
- Brad?
- What?

1203
01:31:51,410 --> 01:31:54,079
Sara, that's not your parents' car,
is it?

1204
01:31:54,204 --> 01:31:55,947
- [all] Yes, it is.
- No!

1205
01:31:56,081 --> 01:31:58,536
- What are we going to do?
- Everybody duck.

1206
01:32:03,046 --> 01:32:05,667
Oh, my God, look at that lunatic.

1207
01:32:06,591 --> 01:32:10,589
Brad and Sara will be driving soon.
On the road with people like that!

1208
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:14,385
- How fast do your parents drive?
- I don't know. About 45?

1209
01:32:14,515 --> 01:32:16,555
We'll go 80.

1210
01:32:22,356 --> 01:32:25,274
Brad, Sara, Daryl, upstairs now.
Into your pyjamas.

1211
01:32:25,401 --> 01:32:29,481
- I don't have any pyjamas here.
- I don't care. Just go upstairs.

1212
01:32:30,531 --> 01:32:32,607
- Go home.
- But I don't want to go home.

1213
01:32:32,742 --> 01:32:35,742
You have to. I'm sorry.
I'll call you tomorrow.

1214
01:32:39,123 --> 01:32:42,077
Come on feet, don't fail me now

1215
01:32:42,209 --> 01:32:45,376
I got ten more miles to go

1216
01:32:46,130 --> 01:32:48,169
I got nine

1217
01:32:48,298 --> 01:32:50,042
Eight

1218
01:32:50,175 --> 01:32:52,251
Seven

1219
01:32:52,386 --> 01:32:53,666
Six, six, six

1220
01:32:53,804 --> 01:32:57,422
I got five more miles to go now

1221
01:32:57,557 --> 01:33:01,341
Over up the hills
just around the bend

1222
01:33:01,478 --> 01:33:05,345
Although my feet are tired
I can't lose my stride

1223
01:33:05,482 --> 01:33:08,020
I got to get to my baby again

1224
01:33:08,151 --> 01:33:11,187
I got to keep on walking

1225
01:33:13,198 --> 01:33:15,771
I got to walk on

1226
01:33:19,536 --> 01:33:21,778
I'm so tired

1227
01:33:21,913 --> 01:33:25,247
But I just can't lose my stride

1228
01:33:38,888 --> 01:33:40,928
[front door opens]

1229
01:33:42,851 --> 01:33:45,520
- Hiya, Chris. Sorry we're late.
- Oh, that's OK.

1230
01:33:45,645 --> 01:33:47,602
Any problems?

1231
01:33:47,730 --> 01:33:51,598
No, not really. Well, Brad stayed
home and Daryl's sleeping over.

1232
01:33:51,734 --> 01:33:54,059
Daryl? Whoah!

1233
01:33:54,195 --> 01:33:56,520
What a nightmare for you.

1234
01:34:00,660 --> 01:34:03,826
- His head's been torn off.
- Gross!

1235
01:34:08,834 --> 01:34:11,539
- What happened?
- Everything is cool.

1236
01:34:13,672 --> 01:34:16,163
Chris, can we do this again
next Friday?

1237
01:34:16,300 --> 01:34:18,458
Aaw, Sara...

1238
01:34:18,594 --> 01:34:20,670
I think I'm retired.

1239
01:34:20,804 --> 01:34:22,844
You've got to sit for me again.

1240
01:34:24,224 --> 01:34:27,178
- We'll see, OK?
- OK.

1241
01:34:27,311 --> 01:34:30,762
I know that seniors don't normally
hang out with freshmen,

1242
01:34:30,897 --> 01:34:33,139
so if I see you around school,

1243
01:34:33,275 --> 01:34:36,110
and I say hi and you ignore me
as usual, it's OK.

1244
01:34:37,028 --> 01:34:39,354
I don't ignore friends, Brad.

1245
01:34:45,453 --> 01:34:46,734
[Daryl] Chris?

1246
01:34:47,831 --> 01:34:49,622
I'd just like to say thanks

1247
01:34:49,749 --> 01:34:53,248
for giving me what was probably
the greatest night of my life.

1248
01:34:57,048 --> 01:34:59,087
So far.

1249
01:35:00,885 --> 01:35:03,637
- Me too.
- Me too.

1250
01:35:07,558 --> 01:35:08,756
Me too.

1251
01:35:12,646 --> 01:35:14,473
- Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.

1252
01:35:14,607 --> 01:35:17,276
- Bye-bye. Drive safely.
- I will, thanks.

1253
01:35:33,959 --> 01:35:36,532
- Hi.
- Hi!

1254
01:35:39,673 --> 01:35:41,416
How did you know I...

1255
01:35:41,550 --> 01:35:44,301
I thought the little girl
might be missing this.

1256
01:35:44,427 --> 01:35:46,385
She left it in the back seat.

1257
01:35:47,263 --> 01:35:49,801
You came all the way out here
just to return this?

1258
01:35:51,309 --> 01:35:54,643
Well, actually,
I was... going to ask you...

1259
01:35:54,771 --> 01:35:57,226
Oh, you came for the money.

1260
01:35:58,233 --> 01:36:00,272
No, no, no, no.

1261
01:36:01,610 --> 01:36:03,649
I'm looking for a babysitter.

1262
01:36:05,030 --> 01:36:07,069
Really?

1263
01:36:07,699 --> 01:36:09,359
Well...

1264
01:36:09,492 --> 01:36:11,402
I think tonight was my last job.

1265
01:36:13,246 --> 01:36:14,954
Oh.

1266
01:36:15,081 --> 01:36:17,121
That's too bad.

1267
01:36:19,461 --> 01:36:21,252
Who was the babysitter for?

1268
01:36:23,172 --> 01:36:24,797
Me.

1269
01:36:30,930 --> 01:36:32,804
Maybe retirement can wait.

1270
01:36:35,685 --> 01:36:37,724
Kiss him!

1271
01:36:43,442 --> 01:36:47,487
Well, he walked up to me
and he asked me if I wanted to dance

1272
01:36:50,449 --> 01:36:54,743
He looked kind of nice
and so I said I might take a chance

1273
01:36:57,956 --> 01:37:00,827
When he danced he held me tight

1274
01:37:00,959 --> 01:37:04,245
And when he walked me home
that night

1275
01:37:04,379 --> 01:37:07,166
All the stars were shining bright

1276
01:37:07,299 --> 01:37:09,422
And then he kissed me

1277
01:37:14,514 --> 01:37:16,554
And then he kissed me

1278
01:37:18,393 --> 01:37:20,432
And then he kissed me

1279
01:37:21,813 --> 01:37:24,897
And then he kissed me?
