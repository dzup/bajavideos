1
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,953
Goodbye, Roberto.

2
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:27,156
See you, Luisito.

3
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:36,731
Hit him!

4
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:41,612
He'll knock him.

5
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,417
- Good hook.
- A southpaw.

6
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:49,386
Do you box?

7
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,046
Yes, sort of.

8
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,750
I was a
middleweight Walter Junior.

9
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:59,188
Another beer
and a glass for the boy.

10
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,557
Thanks.

11
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,634
I also was left-handed.

12
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,464
Let me see.

13
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:07,031
Come on.

14
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:13,437
Come on, shoot.

15
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:15,812
Thanks, pal.

16
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:17,846
Good, good...

17
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,418
I didn't cover you.

18
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:29,051
- I don't know you.
- I'm from Paraná.

19
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:34,566
What brought you this way?

20
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,796
They told me...

21
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:41,040
...there is work here.

22
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,575
This place is dead.

23
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:47,646
I was fired from the factory
a few years ago.

24
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:55,977
I'm going back to work.

25
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,016
See you.

26
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,623
Still here?

27
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:35,717
I don't know anybody here.

28
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,430
You said you are from Paraná.

29
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,397
I live near Paraná
in the countryside.

30
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,969
I can offer you something
for a few weeks.

31
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:51,072
You'll only get room and board.

32
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:57,211
- Do you have a family?
- Yes, but they live...

33
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,644
...across the river.

34
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,413
Okay?

35
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,026
Alright?

36
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:27,096
He'll sleep in the barn
and he'll help with the harvest.

37
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,939
- What was your name?
- Félix.

38
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,376
Hey, kiddo!

39
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,915
She's my wife.

40
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:26,565
You don't have to train today.
Have a drink.

41
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,493
Thanks.

42
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,376
The stew was good today.

43
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:51,613
Coming, Popeye.

44
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:58,823
Popeye!

45
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,066
You don't have to.

46
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,835
Mercedes!

47
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,529
Cut it out!

48
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,984
Listen, the highway is closed.

49
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:54,609
Many trucks stopped.

50
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:56,984
Next they'll stop the train.

51
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,140
You have to carry a gun nowadays.

52
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:19,000
It's the only way.

53
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:29,980
One of these nights
I'll take you to town.

54
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,673
Here's the vegetable garden.

55
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,178
You'll have to pick them.

56
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:37,415
Little by little.

57
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,747
And there's the orchard.

58
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:44,947
The ingredients are important
for sauces and jams.

59
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,648
It's not a hard job.

60
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:49,818
My family always did it,
and lived well.

61
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,725
But things have changed.

62
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:54,458
I never liked this.

63
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:59,130
Bring all the fruit here.

64
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:02,104
She'll tell you what to do.

65
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,905
She's in charge of this.

66
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,600
She likes it...

67
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:09,737
...but with the baby
she can't do it alone.

68
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,418
Bye!

69
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,896
These are juicy.

70
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:38,109
And these are dry.

71
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,186
We just picked these...

72
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:49,944
...peaches.

73
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:57,059
When they are nice and yellow,
they are ready to pick.

74
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:45,200
This is Roberto's father.

75
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:48,504
Here we boil.

76
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:51,108
This is for the sauce.

77
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,209
Here we do the grinding.

78
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:54,918
The seasonings.

79
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,842
See?

80
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,940
These recipes...

81
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,950
...with such neat handwriting...

82
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,188
...were written
by my father-in-law.

83
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:37,093
These recipes are ancient.

84
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,827
They all wrote here.

85
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:44,702
His parents brought them
from abroad.

86
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,805
"Preparation...

87
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,668
...for peach jam. "

88
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:59,878
"Pick ripe peaches. "

89
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:04,681
I learned this from the old man,
Roberto's father.

90
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:08,158
He learned from his mother.

91
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,927
It's written here: Granny.

92
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:14,524
You should've seen...

93
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,396
...how patient he was
in teaching me.

94
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,595
I'm not from here.

95
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:42,622
Here are the baskets.

96
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,699
Mercedes, come to bed!

97
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:51,833
Come here!

98
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:53,044
Here's what you asked me for.

99
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:55,147
Thanks.

100
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,401
So, is everything OK?
Come here, leave that.

101
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:22,707
Show me that.
Come on.

102
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:36,457
My boy, my Chango!

103
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:39,928
One day I'll make a champ
out of you!

104
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,620
We'll go in a minute.

105
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:21,153
Get out of here!

106
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:29,799
I told you a thousand times!

107
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:32,062
I don't want the dog
in the house!

108
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:38,669
Let's go, Félix.

109
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:18,711
Here.

110
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,657
Sleep boy.

111
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:05,756
Sleep boy... Sleep boy...
The sun...

112
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:09,097
Sleep boy.

113
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:13,335
The sun is no longer warming you.

114
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:15,939
Sleep boy.

115
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,942
The moon watches over
your sleep.

116
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,979
Sleep boy.

117
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:25,378
Tomorrow you'll run...

118
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:28,008
...in the fields.

119
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:31,046
Sleep boy.

120
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:46,716
Look at all these colours!

121
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:49,659
The red tomato...

122
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:51,591
This is nice.

123
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:54,022
This is orange.

124
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:57,032
Look at the orange, Chango.

125
00:28:57,168 --> 00:28:58,567
Look.

126
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,597
Look.

127
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:04,938
How do you see things,
Changuito?

128
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:08,637
Yellow!

129
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:13,346
There's a bug
that can change colours.

130
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:15,350
My grandma showed it to me.

131
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,580
It turned blue, then red...

132
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:19,690
...and then yellow.

133
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:22,086
Weird bug.

134
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:33,767
Goddammit! Don't fuck around
with me, bitch!

135
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:16,005
Things grow easily here.

136
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,876
Over there...

137
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:25,188
Anyway, we lost the house there.

138
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:27,515
I came over here...

139
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,026
...and then they all left.

140
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:38,231
What about your mum and dad?

141
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:41,630
I don't know. I never met them.

142
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:46,403
Do you have any brothers?

143
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:47,943
No.

144
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,220
A girlfriend...

145
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:05,623
- Someone?
- No.

146
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:09,428
You're alone?

147
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:11,599
I had a grandmother.

148
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,433
She died?

149
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:17,498
Yes.

150
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,105
It's getting cold.

151
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:52,135
Fuck this rain!

152
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:58,472
I had to run.

153
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,446
My work will get fucked up.

154
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:04,883
I'll have to start over.

155
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:07,855
And then I get paid shit.

156
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:12,392
What am I going to do?

157
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:20,770
Good.

158
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,597
Better than the old man's.

159
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:26,405
No.

160
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:27,875
Yes, it is.

161
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:30,480
The old man
didn't see much at the end...

162
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,015
...and used too much sugar.

163
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:36,084
- No.
- Don't be stubborn.

164
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:39,551
I know my father's cooking.
Try it.

165
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,345
Tomorrow you'll run...

166
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:17,539
...in the fields.

167
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:19,673
Sleep boy.

168
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,737
Let's sit down to eat.

169
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,574
Sleep boy.

170
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:23,373
The sun is no longer warming you.

171
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:26,381
Sleep boy.

172
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:29,914
The moon watches over
your sleep.

173
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:52,498
Come on...

174
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:54,941
...show me some punches.

175
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:58,412
Come on, Félix.

176
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,415
Come on!

177
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,212
Shit, come on!

178
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:06,750
Hit!

179
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,532
Look at me dancing like a fool...

180
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:48,528
Goodbye.

181
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:53,000
Félix, I brought you cigarettes.

182
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:55,199
Thanks.

183
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,016
Tomato! Peach!

184
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:50,820
Jam, lady!

185
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:04,668
Tomato, sir.

186
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:55,244
Here, that's it.

187
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:02,889
Listen, Chango.

188
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,958
This is very important.

189
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:12,001
Remember they day your mother
handed you over to me?

190
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,400
When you grabbed my hand?

191
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:18,902
I knew very well
what you meant by that.

192
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:21,101
I know you need me.

193
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,115
But don't worry.

194
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:27,447
I won't leave you alone.

195
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:29,610
You'll never be alone again.

196
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:31,921
Got it?

197
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:11,956
- Want some mate?
- No, thanks.

198
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:13,461
Have another one.

199
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:19,430
Let's go home.

200
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:23,463
It's still early.

201
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,906
When I say something,
you listen!

202
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:02,171
Am I clear?

203
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:13,056
Where do you think you're going?

204
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,123
You'll do as I say!

205
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:54,860
- How are you today?
- Fine.

206
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,827
Have some mate.

207
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:02,469
Have a biscuit.

208
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:19,714
It's good.

209
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:23,490
Bring jam.

210
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:33,069
Excuse me.

211
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:29,718
Is everything here?

212
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:45,870
Hand me that.

213
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:51,781
You take the bike.
I'll go with this.

214
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:13,014
Excuse me.

215
00:48:15,692 --> 00:48:18,160
- Can I heat up some water?
- Go ahead.

216
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:19,622
Thanks.

217
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:02,949
Fucking dog!

218
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:04,951
I told you, bitch!

219
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:36,078
You fucking bitch!

220
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:39,785
Who do you think you are?

221
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:33,572
She left.

222
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:37,070
Mercedes left.

223
00:53:38,748 --> 00:53:41,046
I looked for her everywhere.

224
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:46,579
I'll find her.

225
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:49,587
Leave me alone...

226
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:05,737
Nobody saw her leave town.

227
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:08,508
Not by bus...

228
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:10,643
...not by train...

229
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:12,742
...not even on foot.

230
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:41,068
What's up, Chango?

231
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:47,549
Goddammit!

232
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,621
Are you OK, Roberto?

233
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:09,529
Easy!

234
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:14,031
Easy, Roberto.

235
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:18,132
Stop! Stop!

236
00:56:18,408 --> 00:56:21,377
It's me, Félix! It's me!

237
00:56:52,642 --> 00:56:58,638
Stop crying, goddammit!

238
00:56:58,782 --> 00:57:00,943
Stop crying!

239
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,617
I can't take it anymore!

240
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:05,983
Stop crying,
I just can't take it!

241
00:57:06,122 --> 00:57:08,056
Please, stop crying!

242
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:10,091
Stop crying!

243
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:12,661
I can't take it!

244
00:57:12,996 --> 00:57:15,430
I couldn't sleep a wink last night.

245
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:17,863
I couldn't sleep at all.

246
00:57:18,535 --> 00:57:21,698
I just can't take it anymore.

247
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:40,478
Look at all these bubbles.

248
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:50,158
Look how they float.

249
00:57:58,007 --> 00:58:00,441
- It's hot.
- Yes.

250
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,846
The boy crapped again.

251
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,584
All the time.

252
00:58:27,103 --> 00:58:29,037
Shall I get you cigarettes?

253
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,969
Thanks.

254
01:03:22,098 --> 01:03:23,998
BLESSED ALL THE CHILDREN

255
01:08:50,993 --> 01:08:53,359
Hello. A ham sandwich.

256
01:08:53,496 --> 01:08:55,464
- White bread?
- Yes.

257
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:57,759
- To eat here or to go?
- I'll take it.

258
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:00,464
Two pesos.

259
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:06,872
Thanks.

260
01:09:37,473 --> 01:09:38,906
Good morning.

261
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:36,861
A beer.

262
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:39,090
What's wrong with the baby?

263
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:41,465
Why is he crying?

264
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:49,441
What's up, pal?

265
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:54,408
Why are you crying?

266
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:55,847
Hello.

267
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:39,117
He is so cute.

268
01:11:40,863 --> 01:11:42,990
Let's show him to the baby.

269
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:45,794
Hello.

270
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,473
Do you like it?

271
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,047
Thanks.

272
01:12:40,589 --> 01:12:42,853
Freeze, right there.

273
01:12:42,991 --> 01:12:45,482
Give me what you have.

274
01:12:45,627 --> 01:12:47,993
Don't try to be smart.

275
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:50,030
Hand over all you have!

276
01:12:50,733 --> 01:12:52,132
Is that all?

277
01:12:52,267 --> 01:12:54,201
Nothing else?

278
01:12:55,671 --> 01:12:58,139
Don't be smart. Stay put.

279
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:54,927
Come on, I don't have all day.

280
01:13:56,632 --> 01:13:58,827
Move the bed away from the wall.

281
01:15:00,195 --> 01:15:02,060
Do you want some?

282
01:15:02,464 --> 01:15:03,897
It's free.

283
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:07,066
Finish it or give it to the kid.

284
01:15:10,205 --> 01:15:11,797
OK, let's go.

285
01:15:12,608 --> 01:15:15,168
- Bye, Cadillac!
- See you around.

286
01:15:17,813 --> 01:15:19,405
Later.

287
01:15:38,934 --> 01:15:40,629
Sit down.

288
01:16:06,495 --> 01:16:08,793
Do you know of any job?

289
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:18,035
Is it yours?

290
01:16:18,173 --> 01:16:19,765
Yes.

291
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:43,839
A little change...

292
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:49,148
Some change...

293
01:20:16,978 --> 01:20:17,945
Thanks.

294
01:20:27,088 --> 01:20:28,578
Hello.

295
01:20:32,694 --> 01:20:34,423
Give me a croissant.

296
01:20:34,563 --> 01:20:37,691
How are you?

297
01:21:01,823 --> 01:21:04,758
When you fight
you look as if you were dancing.

298
01:21:04,893 --> 01:21:07,054
- Get the hell out of here!
- Calm down.

299
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:09,629
How do you get
those puppets out?

300
01:21:09,764 --> 01:21:12,460
Just put a coin in and see, idiot!

301
01:21:12,634 --> 01:21:15,660
I don't even have
enough for beer.

302
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:20,971
- Selling something?
- No.

303
01:21:21,109 --> 01:21:23,407
What about that bag?

304
01:21:23,945 --> 01:21:26,641
I'm sleeping in the park.

305
01:21:27,916 --> 01:21:32,580
Sometimes, I do odd jobs.

306
01:21:33,788 --> 01:21:35,756
Little jobs.

307
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:37,222
Small stuff.

308
01:21:37,492 --> 01:21:40,984
It's easy. People get scared
and give you everything.

309
01:21:43,031 --> 01:21:44,828
If you're interested...

310
01:21:44,966 --> 01:21:46,991
...you can come with me.

311
01:21:47,135 --> 01:21:49,695
I mean, both of you.

312
01:21:53,942 --> 01:21:55,773
What do you say?

313
01:21:58,647 --> 01:22:00,080
They call me Cadillac.

314
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:03,679
Cadillac.

315
01:22:05,053 --> 01:22:07,180
"Los Fabulosos Cadillacs".

316
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:10,821
Don't you know the band?

317
01:22:10,959 --> 01:22:12,392
No.

318
01:22:18,166 --> 01:22:19,758
The cops don't fuck with us.

319
01:22:38,253 --> 01:22:39,777
Let's go.

320
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:20,723
Come in.

321
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:24,498
Nati, I want you
to meet someone.

322
01:23:26,968 --> 01:23:29,801
Félix, Nati, my sister.

323
01:23:29,938 --> 01:23:31,200
And him...

324
01:23:31,473 --> 01:23:33,600
His son, Chango.

325
01:23:34,075 --> 01:23:35,508
He's so cute.

326
01:23:35,643 --> 01:23:37,076
Hello, baby.

327
01:23:54,662 --> 01:23:57,130
I'll be back in a while.

328
01:24:15,016 --> 01:24:19,510
Look at this pretty doll.

329
01:24:20,121 --> 01:24:25,684
You're not a girl
but it doesn't matter.

330
01:24:27,896 --> 01:24:29,864
Look.

331
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:39,570
That's where you get off...

332
01:24:46,481 --> 01:24:49,644
I'm making spaghetti,
do you want some?

333
01:24:50,485 --> 01:24:52,009
I'm not hungry. Thanks.

334
01:24:52,153 --> 01:24:54,747
There's enough,
only Dany and I eat here.

335
01:24:54,889 --> 01:24:57,687
- Look, I got paid with this.
- Wow! Great!

336
01:24:57,826 --> 01:24:59,817
For a job today.

337
01:25:00,061 --> 01:25:02,996
Apparently it's new,
but if it isn't... it's still good!

338
01:25:03,131 --> 01:25:05,326
This is what they paid you with?

339
01:25:05,467 --> 01:25:07,094
It's great!

340
01:25:45,607 --> 01:25:48,041
- Do you want something?
- An ice cream.

341
01:25:48,843 --> 01:25:49,639
Let's go.

342
01:26:05,527 --> 01:26:08,894
We're not going to Japan.
We're doing a job right here.

343
01:26:40,662 --> 01:26:42,562
It sounds good.

344
01:26:42,797 --> 01:26:44,424
The stereo.

345
01:26:46,167 --> 01:26:48,658
I'll give you your share later.

346
01:26:51,773 --> 01:26:54,139
They said to take bus 148.

347
01:27:02,183 --> 01:27:04,947
I didn't know this place.
It's crowded.

348
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:08,617
Where are you from?

349
01:27:08,756 --> 01:27:10,121
Paraná.

350
01:27:12,193 --> 01:27:14,093
Your son was born there?

351
01:27:15,697 --> 01:27:17,722
Yes, that's right.

352
01:27:26,608 --> 01:27:27,939
Lady?

353
01:27:31,446 --> 01:27:36,509
- Juárez and Lambaré is that way?
- No, that way.

354
01:27:36,651 --> 01:27:38,141
Thanks.

355
01:27:38,419 --> 01:27:40,614
We were going the wrong way.

356
01:27:40,755 --> 01:27:42,814
Lady, do you have the time?

357
01:27:44,459 --> 01:27:46,518
- Twenty to ten.
- Thanks.

358
01:27:46,661 --> 01:27:48,151
We're on time.

359
01:28:03,478 --> 01:28:06,777
You don't always get
a cool stereo like today.

360
01:28:06,914 --> 01:28:11,078
But every now and then
I get a good job.

361
01:28:11,986 --> 01:28:12,953
Here it is.

362
01:28:13,688 --> 01:28:16,088
Green... Renault.

363
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:24,124
Just follow me.

364
01:28:27,535 --> 01:28:30,095
I don't care if it's
used or stolen.

365
01:28:30,672 --> 01:28:32,105
As long as it sounds good.

366
01:28:34,208 --> 01:28:36,073
Once, we stole some speakers...

367
01:28:36,210 --> 01:28:38,405
...from a nightclub.

368
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:40,147
Still got them.

369
01:29:03,671 --> 01:29:04,899
Let's go!

370
01:29:08,109 --> 01:29:09,076
You bastard!

371
01:29:11,412 --> 01:29:12,709
Stop!

372
01:29:12,847 --> 01:29:14,747
Let me go!

373
01:29:16,584 --> 01:29:21,044
- Stop!
- Bastard!

374
01:29:24,559 --> 01:29:25,924
- Let me go!
- Come here!

375
01:29:26,461 --> 01:29:27,587
Come here!

376
01:29:32,461 --> 01:32:27,587
