1
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:03,194
LOVE ME NOT

2
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,694
<i># I'M late... #</i>

3
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:10,029
<i># I'M late... #</i>

4
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,669
<i># I'M late... #</i>

5
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:19,472
<i># I have to find you
before this sun rises. #</i>

6
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:25,448
<i># I'M late... #</i>

7
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:29,487
<i># I'M late... #</i>

8
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,389
<i># I'M late... #</i>

9
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:39,097
<i># Cross the light on red taxi driver,
and leave Me at Pueyrredón. #</i>

10
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:42,393
<i># It's been so Many days... #
This is called silence,</i>

11
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:46,235
and as you know,
it's forbidden in here.

12
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:50,309
If you don't speak,
you don't sell.

13
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,675
If you don't sell,
the group's average goes down,

14
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,874
and everyone losses their bonus.

15
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,110
Do you get it?

16
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:02,817
The telemarketer's commandments...

17
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,754
Stick to the script.

18
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:08,658
Smile while you talk.

19
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:16,234
Formality, security, confidence.

20
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,571
<i>And above all, we are here...</i>

21
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:22,233
<i>to sell. Sell.</i>

22
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,809
Sell, sell, sell.

23
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:26,905
Okay?

24
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:31,179
Let's go, Clara!
Positive attitude!

25
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:39,480
...from Barcelona.
Happy birthday!

26
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,492
- You alright?
- Yes, why?

27
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,867
- You are always late.
- He didn't see me coming anyway...

28
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:53,906
Yes, you are controlled
by a system.

29
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,701
- Do you say so?
- Yes, of course.

30
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:01,338
Good morning... Ms. Amaya?

31
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:03,805
Ms. Amaya, this is Clara
from Cosmética Verde's,

32
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:07,250
main branch in Barcelona.
Happy birthday.

33
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,220
This is Clara,
from Cosmética Verde.

34
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,586
I'm calling from the main branch
in Barcelona...

35
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,429
<i>I always thought
that after some time,</i>

36
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,732
<i>people reach a deep understanding
of themselves.</i>

37
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,307
<i>Nevertheless, there is not much
about me that I have learned.</i>

38
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,739
<i>I know I enjoy cooking,
buying second hand clothes,</i>

39
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,681
<i>and coffee latte in a big cup.</i>

40
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,923
<i>I know I'm not lucky at games,</i>

41
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,157
<i>and at love...
Excuse me? It's not the same.</i>

42
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,457
Nice and pretty is not the same.
It's like wanting or loving.

43
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,194
Do you think wanting
is the same as loving?

44
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,390
Do you want me
or do you love me?

45
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:58,231
We've known each other
for two weeks!

46
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,895
That's why! I think there's stuff
it's good to set up...

47
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,442
straight from the beginning, so
we know what we are talking about.

48
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:09,107
- Do you want me or do you love me?
- What?

49
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:12,848
I adore you! How about you?

50
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:16,354
I think I need to go
to the bathroom.

51
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,390
<i>You may think
no man is good for me,</i>

52
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:21,092
<i>but I'm suspicious
of anyone falling for me.</i>

53
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,718
Can we talk?

54
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,757
What's going on?

55
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:29,134
That's what I'd like to know.
What's going on.

56
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:33,137
- Why?
- With us... What are we?

57
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:36,506
Lovers, friends, a couple?

58
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,543
Intimate friends?

59
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,147
<i>I'll be back.
Sometimes I think couples...</i>

60
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:44,546
<i>are like meals.</i>

61
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,881
<i>Everything is relative to
the combination of the ingredients.</i>

62
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,511
What are we going to do?

63
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,852
<i>Sometimes it works, sometimes...</i>

64
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:54,450
Let's sail, my loved one.
I go on stern.

65
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:55,994
<i>With my last ex...</i>

66
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,928
<i>we were like vinegar and cream.</i>

67
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,558
<i>An impossible mix.</i>

68
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:05,094
<i>Or the delivery boy.</i>

69
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:07,202
<i>With him we were
like watermelon and wine,</i>

70
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:09,741
<i>two delicious things... if apart.</i>

71
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:13,778
Honey... today
is our two month anniversary.

72
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:17,881
Don't you think it's time
we move in together?

73
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,024
<i>Now, while I cook, I remember
some of my ex boyfriends.</i>

74
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,135
<i>I can't believe
after so many flavors...</i>

75
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:45,434
<i>I keep looking
for that perfect combination.</i>

76
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,642
Hello...

77
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,886
I want to know it all.
What do you love? What do you hate?

78
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:02,358
Are you passionate?
You are passionate...

79
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:05,226
- Right?
- I don't know, it depends...

80
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,832
I don't know...

81
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:08,490
Tell me your fantasies,
I want to know it all.

82
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:10,534
Wouldn't you rather
know my name first?

83
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:14,095
No, quick questions and answers.

84
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:17,876
- On top or below?
- Next one.

85
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:19,902
Beach or mountain?

86
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:24,476
Never tried it at the mountain.
At the beach is good.

87
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,117
The sand is somehow awkward,
but it's good.

88
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:28,915
No, I mean just to go, to visit,
which one do you like better?

89
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,819
Oh... no, beach for sure, for sure.

90
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,824
I'm totally the beach type.
Definitely the beach.

91
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:37,989
Underwear. Sexy, sporty?
Lycra of cotton?

92
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:41,792
- Next one. Day or night?
- You.

93
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:47,538
You... are so mysterious...

94
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:50,036
You are so intense...

95
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,843
What shall we do?

96
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:56,004
Do we stay here
or go somewhere else?

97
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,713
<i>Come on, tell me more...
Is he cute?</i>

98
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,687
Yes, he's pretty cute.

99
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:47,321
But I think he waxes.

100
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,552
It's strange for a man
to get a wax, right?

101
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,959
- Orgasms?
- Excuse me?

102
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,556
- How many?
- Do you keep count?

103
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,936
Of course. Don't you?

104
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:04,001
- I don't ask you about that stuff.
- Well, I do. Come on. How many?

105
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:09,138
He uses strange words.

106
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:12,016
I think he looks at himself
in the mirror while we are...

107
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,477
But... Do you like him
or not, Clara?

108
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,851
- Yes, I do.
- So?

109
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:18,288
I don't know...
I don't know, don't know...

110
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,795
<i>Receive in your cell phone...</i>

111
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,128
<i>all the oriental wisdom
of the Kamasutra.</i>

112
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:31,966
<i>Send your message to *6969,
and receive every day...</i>

113
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,131
<i>the ancient experience
from India...</i>

114
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,639
<i>Become the expert...
Is there any movie?</i>

115
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,175
<i>Every woman wants to be with...
Eh?</i>

116
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:41,272
- A movie.
- Eh?

117
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:43,338
<i>Have a good time
with your couple...</i>

118
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:46,247
<i># If your eyes are lethal... #
More?</i>

119
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:49,753
<i># And I die every tiMe

121

<i># and your eyes are My heaven... #</i>

122
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,687
<i>Watch it!
# The sea is happy... #</i>

123
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:01,890
<i># when it hits the rocks... #</i>

124
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:05,465
<i># I would be More happy... #</i>

125
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:09,200
<i># if your lips hit My Mouth... #</i>

126
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:13,536
<i># I love you as Much
as I love My eyes, #</i>

127
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:16,739
<i># as Much as I love My eyes,
I love you, #</i>

128
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,942
<i># although I love My eyes More... #</i>

129
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:23,350
<i># because it was theM

130
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,854
<i># I love you as Much
as I love My eyes, #</i>

131
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,927
<i># as Much as I love My eyes,
I love you, #</i>

132
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:33,065
<i># although I love My eyes More... #</i>

133
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:36,629
<i># because it was theM
who saw you first. #</i>

134
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,309
So good!

135
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,692
- Hello...
- Hello.

136
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,157
- Everything all right?
- Yes.

137
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,964
- Cool! Maté. May I?
- Yes, of course.

138
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:13,336
What do you study?

139
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,972
Arts. Combined.

140
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,034
What do they combine?

141
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:24,041
- Hello, Antonio.
- Hello, Isabel.

142
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:27,384
- How do you do?
- Please, Isabel...

143
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,384
You need to do something
about the guy in the second floor.

144
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:30,888
What do you want me to do with him?
What's the matter?

145
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:32,719
He is unbearable.
Loud music at two A. M...

146
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,520
at 3 A. M... On top of that...

147
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,820
But does it bother you?
It doesn't bother me.

148
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,829
- No, he lives on the other side.
- I live afar...

149
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,962
If you are hit by a car
you die, right?

150
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:45,464
If you are hit hard, yes.

151
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:50,437
Do you go to heaven?

152
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,443
Some go some place else.

153
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:58,807
- I'd rather go to heaven.
- You do?

154
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,452
- Bye...
- Bye, Isabel.

155
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:05,054
Do you like her?

156
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:07,216
- Isabel?
- Yes.

157
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,455
She's pretty, isn't she?

158
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:16,834
<i>- Hello...
- It's me. Can you open?</i>

159
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,370
<i>- Yes, I'll be down in a minute.
- Okay.</i>

160
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,336
<i>- Is it open?
- Yes, thank you.</i>

161
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:45,988
Greediness bursts the bag.

162
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,095
- Thanks.
- You are welcome.

163
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,368
I'm ready, let's go.

164
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,738
- Bye.
- Bye.

165
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:14,419
<i>We wanted to honor you
on your birthday. Happy birthday!</i>

166
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,250
Oh!

167
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:18,159
- What happened?
- Did you get cut too?

168
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:21,722
<i>People! The system is down.</i>

169
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,060
<i>- You have the day off.
- Same old, same old...</i>

170
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,694
Excuse me. Who is going
to pay us for this day?

171
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,796
You work on a commissión basis,
darling.

172
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:30,034
You sell, you get paid.
You don't sell, you don't get paid.

173
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,133
- So then...
- Well, darling...

174
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:32,972
It's not my fault
the system went down...

175
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,513
Not mine either.
What...

176
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,572
Let's go. Let's go.

177
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,284
<i># You are the Most beautiful death, #</i>

178
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:49,358
<i># and your eyes are My heaven... #</i>

179
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:54,462
<i># The sea is happy
when it hits the rocks, #</i>

180
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:58,828
<i>How much?
# I would be More happy... #</i>

181
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:01,805
Clau... Do you know
how much the phone bill is?

182
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:06,540
<i># I love you as Much
as I love My eyes, #</i>

183
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,610
<i># as Much as I love My eyes, #
300 pesos.</i>

184
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,942
I'll call you later
so I can get my stuff out.

185
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,351
- You can keep it.
- The apartment is mine!

186
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,882
I wasn't talking
about the apartment.

187
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:28,924
A 300 pesos phone bill?
You do talk!

188
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,846
- Here you are.
- Thank you...

189
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,018
You dropped it earlier today.

190
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,453
You didn't need to...

191
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,562
On the contrary,
it's not a problem.

192
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,074
What happened?

193
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:20,178
But... What's the problem?

194
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,453
<i>Is it serious?</i>

195
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,886
<i>Come here...</i>

196
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:29,356
- Tell me something nice.
- Oh... Lots of things.

197
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:32,220
- You are nice people.
- Nice people...

198
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:33,822
- Yes...
- Tell me something better...

199
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,025
- You are a...
- You have nice clothes.

200
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,660
That! And you are a good friend.

201
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:41,131
- You are sincere, you are fun...
- You are pretty.

202
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:42,935
Yes. Pleasant...

203
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:45,169
If I were all of that, these things
wouldn't happen to me...

204
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,212
I can't understand
why this has to happen to me.

205
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,373
Well... It's good
to be alone though.

206
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:52,646
You can find yourself and...

207
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:56,050
I've been finding myself
for 26 years now, Andy...

208
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:59,252
Think positive,

209
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,552
not everything is dramatic.

210
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,323
You have to leave?

211
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,030
- Yes, but if you don't want to...
- No, go.

212
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,828
- We can stay a little longer.
- No, go...

213
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:10,458
- Go, no problem.
- We can...

214
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:12,836
- Sure?
- Yes.

215
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,770
- Let's go, baby.
- Thanks.

216
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,643
- Sure you are going to be fine?
- Yes.

217
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:20,508
We are sleeping at my mom's.

218
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,479
You can call us there, okay?

219
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,812
<i>Get well.
Everything will be all right.</i>

220
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:27,817
<i>Let's go, Viole.</i>

221
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:31,489
<i>Let's call her later, okay?</i>

222
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,730
<i># This way... #</i>

223
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:50,304
<i># as a rose torn by the wind... #</i>

224
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,942
<i># This way... #</i>

225
00:16:55,014 --> 00:17:00,281
<i># as a leave dried by the sun... #</i>

226
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,452
<i># This way... #</i>

227
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:10,927
<i># like old paper

228
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:17,492
<i># this way My soul
your iMage forgot... #</i>

229
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:22,037
<i># This way... #</i>

230
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:28,978
<i># as the night leaves
after the day... #</i>

231
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,779
<i># This way... #</i>

232
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:39,552
<i># as a boat sails into deep water... #</i>

233
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,323
<i># This way... #</i>

234
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:49,598

through the fingers... #</i>

235
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,503

236
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,806
<i># this way I let you go, #</i>

237
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:01,308
<i># without even thinking about it... #</i>

238
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:07,608
<i># Today, #</i>

239
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:13,755
<i># I aM so Ionely

240
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:19,895

241
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,565

242
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:29,673

243
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:32,538
<i># Maybe, just Maybe... #</i>

244
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,939
<i># you are thinking that I don't want

245
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,848

246
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,116

248
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,196
<i># This way... #</i>

249
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:57,830
Shit.

250
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,168
WHAT A NIGHT!

251
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:00,956
- How are you?
- Hello.

252
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,766
Hi.

253
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,794
I'm your neighbor.

254
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,005
Actually... I don't live here.

255
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,534
It's just for tonight
because I had a problem,

256
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:13,167
and a friend of mine, Andy,
who lives here... Do you know her?

257
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,509
- No.
- Her daughter Violeta? No?

258
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,309
It's just
that I had some trouble...

259
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:21,008
They lent me the apartment
for tonight...

260
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:24,014
I went out to the balcony and...

261
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:27,557
I dropped the...

262
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,958
That. Thanks.

263
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:31,618
It's my friend's.
I don't wear it.

264
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:34,254
I do! I do! Just not this kind...

265
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:41,796
I'm upstairs.
If you need anything just...

266
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:43,941
- Let me know.
- Sure.

267
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:45,737
I'm upstairs.

268
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,439
<i>See you later.</i>

269
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:59,123
I'm hungry, Teo.
What can we have?

270
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:38,653
- Hello.
- Hello.

271
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:43,827
- Do you have chicken ravioli?
- We do.

272
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,431
How do you cook the breaded meat?
Fried or in the oven?

273
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:47,904
Both ways.

274
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:52,502
Fish... Is it fresh?

275
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:55,910
Yes, of course...
We have stewed tripe too.

276
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,047
A coffee latte, please...

277
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,189
In a big cup!

278
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,089
Coffee latte.

279
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:24,940
- How are they doing?
- Barely trying.

280
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,047
I haven't introduced myself.
I'm Clara.

281
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:32,549
- Goal!
- Goal!

282
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:36,046
You are? What's your name?

283
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:39,123
Mi tripe! The tripe!

284
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:43,326
If you don't tell I'm going to come
up with a name for you myself.

285
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,289
Teo.

286
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:59,510
Kick it, you moron!

287
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:01,805
He is no good. He could
have scored! Did you see?

288
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:04,780
- It was off-side.
- No, no, no. It wasn't.

289
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,279
It was for the Tele-beam.

290
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:14,454
Goal! Goal!

291
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,245
- Wait, wait...
- What's the problem?

292
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:41,078
I think I'm being followed.

293
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:44,114
- By whom?
- The key, take out the key.

294
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:52,627
Hurry, hurry...

295
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:02,872
Scary, huh?

296
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:08,242
Oh, no!

297
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:13,211
No, it can't be...

298
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,518
Are you coming in?

299
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:17,555
Would you have
a piece of wire by any chance?

300
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:19,850
Today I went out without any...

301
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:21,754
And a flashlight?

302
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:25,226
Apparently I left it with the wire.

303
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:33,128
Do you come in?

304
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:40,172
What a night, huh?

305
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,955
The reception
is not very good in here...

306
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:33,127
- Excuse me?
- No, never mind.

307
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,189
Oh, I thought
you were about to say something.

308
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:40,234
No, it's okay, don't worry.

309
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:43,099
I'll stay here, I'll wait here.

310
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,468
I guess she won't take long.

311
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:48,337
It would be kind of weird...
for me to go to your house.

312
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:50,175
We don't know each other, right?

313
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:52,840
I was about to offer you a blanket.

314
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:59,518
Actually, I have
an empty room in here.

315
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:01,023
Oh...

316
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:08,298
- Scared?
- Excuse me?

317
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:10,596
If you are afraid...

318
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,598
What would I be afraid of?

319
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:15,706
Maybe that I would attack you
in the middle of the night,

320
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:17,799
and steal your organs.

321
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,776
You are funny...

322
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,912
No, I appreciate it but...

323
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,142
No, I'll wait here.

324
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:29,509
As you wish.

325
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,317
Why don't we let destiny decide?

326
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,853
I'll call her one more time,
and if she doesn't answer...

327
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,527
- No...
- No.

328
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,131
Would you like to come in?

329
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:50,607
- Okay then...
- Come in.

330
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,305
Excuse me.

331
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,552
Are you going to stand there?
Come in.

332
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:07,451
That's your room.

333
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:30,306
You are very hospitable...

334
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:32,482
for an organ thief.

335
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:35,885
You can't imagine
how much I appreciate this...

336
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:41,454
Good night, right?

337
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:10,240
<i>Hello, I'm trying to contact
Ms. Irma.</i>

338
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:13,335
Ms. Irma, happy birthday.

339
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:16,341
I'm calling from the main branch
of Cosmética Verde in Barcelona...

340
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:19,282
Good morning...
It's Clara, from Cosmética Verde.

341
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:21,249
I'm trying to contact Ms. Ana,

342
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:23,286
I'm calling from the main branch
in Barcelona...

343
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:27,287
I'm calling to offer you
a new line of cosmetics...

344
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:30,293
Cosmética Verde wants
to greet you for your birthday...

345
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:34,760
...for only 29.99 Euros.
Eyeliner at just 32 Euros...

346
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:37,724
- That one is crap.
- Hey!

347
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:39,870
- Think about it and call me.
- We are launching a campaign...

348
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:42,838
- Cut the call right now you both!
- I'm speaking...

349
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:45,165
Who was it?

350
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:47,912
Who said what I just heard?

351
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:49,912
It was me.

352
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:53,011
I was just talking
and it slipped. Sorry.

353
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:55,944
This is not typical of you,
not at all.

354
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:01,382
Thanks.

355
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,506
<i>Would pay for the days I use it.</i>

356
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:17,507
I've already told you
it's not for rent.

357
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:22,273
What if... you lend it to me
and I pay you?

358
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,482
Oh, sorry!

359
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:29,776
Then it wouldn't be a loan.

360
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:33,884
Apart from that, there are
a lot of pensions in the area.

361
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:36,188
- Pawn 4 bishop 3.
- But I can't pay that.

362
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:39,227
Just a few days
until I get something to rent.

363
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,695
Is it cute?

364
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:43,391
Sort of, kind of short.

365
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:46,403
Hey kid! Who is the blind one here?
Your grandfather or you?

366
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:48,063
She is an ángel.

367
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:50,107
Shut your mouth,
you filthy old man.

368
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:52,734
I swear you won't even notice
I'm here.

369
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:57,309
Young lady...
When I say no, it's my final word.

370
00:31:57,382 --> 00:32:00,112
Bishop 5, knight queen.

371
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:02,112
Check mate.

372
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:22,866
Didn't you forget about anything?

373
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:25,573
No, I think I have everything.

374
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:39,918
I wrote down my work address
just in case.

375
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:48,824
Are you planning on letting down
this formality tone sometime soon?

376
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,263
Since I'm a child I
speak this way to my elders.

377
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:53,031
Since I was a child.
I'm used to it.

378
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:54,899
Then I'll speak
the same way to you.

379
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:56,473
Just to keep things even.

380
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:58,337
I don't think that's possible.

381
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:01,338
I mean, the difference
between us two is obvious.

382
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:03,437
Yes, and you are bad mannered.

383
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:07,613
Respect for the elders... Didn't
they teach you that as a child?

384
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:10,519
You keep treating me
as a dinosaur...

385
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,790
and you are back on the street.

386
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:16,886
Sorry.

387
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:35,568
This one's old.

388
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:37,637
- Even if old you could clean it.
- I mean from being old!

389
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:42,750
Sorry.

390
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,948
Listen, I like things straight.

391
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:49,452
I am not in favor
of life together...

392
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:53,789
even more with strangers.

393
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:58,265
So I think that even if
you are staying for a short time,

394
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,699
you and I should come to terms...

395
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,103
Some kind of rules. Okay?

396
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:07,535
Rule number 1:

397
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:12,080
No crumbles or underwear
in the shower.

398
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:16,220
Rule number 2:

399
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:19,120
Those machines from hell
you brought...

400
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:22,186
- go off at 8.
- Eh? Why?

401
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,821
PM. Maximum limit
of life together, five days,

402
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:29,495
for the sake of both of us.

403
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,699
Ah... sorry.

404
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,899
This is a copy of the keys.

405
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,212
Avoid the sewers, please.

406
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:46,614
Sorry, but... You said
you wanted to keep things even.

407
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:49,310
I'd like to set
a couple of rules too then.

408
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,615
I believe
I'm entitled to it, right?

409
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:54,219
No.

410
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:04,200
THANKS

411
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,209
Clara...

412
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:26,213
Marital status: Pitiful...
Occupation: Horrifying.

413
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,475
I'm sick and tired
of selling this crap.

414
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:50,473
Excuse me... Sir?

415
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,873
Yes, good afternoon.
I'm looking for Clara.

416
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:55,973
Clara?

417
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:58,513
Yes, Clara...
What's so funny about that?

418
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,544
Look who's here, Clara!

419
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:01,846
Clara...

420
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:03,944
Excuse me...
Am I saying something stupid?

421
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:05,955
I'm looking for Clara,
yes, Clara, Clara.

422
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:07,888
There is no Clara here.

423
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:10,450
- There isn't?
- What are you doing here?

424
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:14,329
Oh, no... I wanted to...
I came to tell you...

425
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,832
Take a break... Clara.

426
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:20,935
Come here.

427
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,171
- What happened?
- What happened?

428
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:27,109
That I was locked out of my own
house, that's what happened.

429
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:28,577
How?

430
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:30,279
That's what I want
to find out. How!

431
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:32,441
How is that possible?
This has never happened to me!

432
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:34,108
But what happened?

433
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:36,116
I left my keys inside.

434
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:39,213
What a coincidence...

435
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,451
Do you want me
to lend you a blanket?

436
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:43,493
How funny...

437
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:47,555
This is so unusual!
It never happened to me!

438
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:49,156
What?

439
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:51,428
I've already told you!
Leaving my keys inside!

440
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:53,231
There's always a first time.

441
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:56,304
Thanks...

442
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,531
Clara.

443
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:05,315
Apparently he forgot
his keys inside.

444
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:10,915
Ventura...
What a handsome father you've got!

445
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,621
My father? He's not my father.
He's a friend.

446
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,193
- Is he married? Single?
- Married.

447
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:24,192
Why did you say he was married?

448
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,966
- "María Antonieta Bruno".
- María what?

449
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:35,545
María Antonieta Bruno.

450
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,947
- "José Saravia".
- Check mate.

451
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:44,749
"We'll always remember
you lovingly."

452
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:49,882
"Camilo Blas...
Your life intersected mine...

453
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:54,020
like a shooting star.
I'll always love you."

454
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,628
Clarita?

455
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,333
She is at work.

456
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:05,336
She is your girlfriend, right?

457
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:08,711
- Excuse me?
- Since you two live together...

458
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:11,040
He is always doing things
upside down.

459
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:14,309
He first lives with her,
then he falls in love.

460
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:20,689
<i>Good night...</i>

461
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:22,692
Good night.

462
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:26,558
- What happened?
- Why?

463
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,795
- It's smells like something burns.
- I like it well done.

464
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:32,827
Come on! I don't know
how you can breathe like this...

465
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:34,995
I like it well done.
Is there a problem with that?

466
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:37,233
Well done? This is not
well done, it's burnt.

467
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:38,467
- It may be burnt for you.
- No...

468
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:40,874
- It's well done to me.
- Can't you see that?

469
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:42,970
- What? Where?
- Let me see...

470
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:46,482
What are you doing?
Hey, what are you doing?

471
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,643
You can't eat that.
You can't eat that...

472
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,209
- You are not throwing that out...
- It's all burnt...

473
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:52,755
- No, the beef doesn't go.
- What are you doing? No, no, no...

474
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:55,084
- I don't like it in the kitchen.
- Enough... Get out!

475
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:57,160
No. I'm cooking.
Get out! Out!

476
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,696
- You don't throw out food!
- Bye... See you later...

477
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:03,365
Bitch!

478
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:41,130
What are you doing?

479
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:43,729
When I'm about to cook,
I need inspiration.

480
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:51,572
If your inspiration comes from that
I'd start calling for a pizza!

481
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:38,695
- Do you drink wine?
- Yes.

482
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:42,430
Thanks.

483
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:51,206
So?

484
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:56,011
What is it?

485
00:41:57,414 --> 00:42:01,043
It's good.
I forgive you for the steak.

486
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:04,045
Toast?

487
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:07,785
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

488
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:14,798
- What's your name again?
- I didn't tell you my name.

489
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,332
And I'm not going to.

490
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:21,867
I adopted Clara as a name
when I started at the call center,

491
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:23,804
I just had finished my relation...

492
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,933
with the man who was
the love of my life and...

493
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:28,067
I wanted to be reset.

494
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:30,875
Young people should come
with subtitles included...

495
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:34,111
- What do you mean by reset?
- I wanted to erase my last...

496
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:37,719
23 years. More or less.

497
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:40,257
What does that have to do
with your name?

498
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:41,882
My name is awful.

499
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:43,324
- What's your name?
- None of your business.

500
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,383
- Tell me what your name is.
- I'm not going to.

501
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:45,621
Why wouldn't you tell me?

502
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:47,027
Not a chance.

503
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:55,937
The Clara thing is...

504
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:57,730
there are many call centers.

505
00:42:57,808 --> 00:43:01,209
So, they name all of us the same
to identify it.

506
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:04,042
There is another one at Bucharest
where everyone is called Lola.

507
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:07,008
Why do you keep working there?

508
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,647
I'm not sure...

509
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,881
You'd do fine as a cook...

510
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:15,586
- Do you think so?
- I do think so.

511
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:22,396
Do you have any kids, Teo?

512
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:31,166
I didn't have any...
They didn't come, I don't know...

513
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:37,513
What did you call me? Teo?

514
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:40,277
Did you just christen me?
Why do you call me Teo?

515
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:42,251
I just came up with it.
Don't you like it?

516
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:43,981
Teo?

517
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:47,820
- Yes, I like it. It suits you.
- Okay, Clara.

518
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:28,047
<i>- What's that balloon for?
- So it doesn't get lost.</i>

519
00:45:28,158 --> 00:45:29,989
<i>- It looks like it's flying.
- Yes.</i>

520
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:31,356
- Swimming, with the paws...
- What's it's name?

521
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:32,986
- Caty.
- Whose is it?

522
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:35,427
It's Teo's.
But he has her locked at all times.

523
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:38,265
She should sunbathe,
it'll do her good.

524
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:40,434
You can give her some lettuce too.

525
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:42,165
- Do you have lettuce at home?
- Yes.

526
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:45,467
Look at you taking Teo's turtle
out for a ride...

527
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:48,874
- Tying balloons to it...
- I feel good around him.

528
00:45:48,946 --> 00:45:51,744
I see were this goes...
You are getting hooked...

529
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:55,444
- Don't start...
- You can't get hooked...

530
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:57,214
- Stop it.
- He is an old man...

531
00:45:57,287 --> 00:46:00,347
You are pretty, young,
you can get something better.

532
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:03,324
- Better, yes... Good morning!
- Yes, yes... Yes, younger.

533
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:04,655
Good morning, giris.

534
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:07,226
- He makes me laugh.
- If you want to laugh...

535
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:10,130
I can set you up with my cousin
Chimichurri, the clown.

536
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,293
<i>Chimichurri? Is this a joke?</i>

537
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:14,699
<i>I'm telling you this
because I care about you.</i>

538
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:23,805
What's this?

539
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:27,206
Don't you like it?

540
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,309
- It's nice.
- Ah...

541
00:46:29,386 --> 00:46:30,944
Hold on...
I want to give you...

542
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:34,624
the rent money.

543
00:46:35,893 --> 00:46:37,520
Oh, you scared me.

544
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:52,338
<i>- How are you?
- How are you, Isabel?</i>

545
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:55,003
<i>I came for the phone number
of the plumber you recommended.</i>

546
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,443
- Oh, Ponce. Let me get it. Hold on.
- Yes.

547
00:47:04,788 --> 00:47:07,348
- Hi!
- Hello.

548
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:15,556
Clara, Isabel.
Isabel, Clara.

549
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:18,166
Isabel is the building
superintendent.

550
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:20,362
Clara is... a friend in disgrace,

551
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:22,370
whom I'm helping with housing
arrangements for a few days.

552
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:25,267
- Oh! Sub-letting?
- Eh?

553
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,105
That's prohibited.

554
00:47:27,377 --> 00:47:29,140
What did I tell you?
Just a few days!

555
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:32,842
- Okay... I'm leaving... Bye.
- I'll walk with you.

556
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:43,625
Bye...

557
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:49,927
Secrets in front of others...
That's tacky. What did she say?

558
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,134
That I should find
someone of my age.

559
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:55,095
She is right.

560
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:58,164
Hello, hello, Ms. Carmen...

561
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:07,980
Ventura...
Estévez wants to see you.

562
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,580
Maybe he noticed I was late?

563
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:17,452
No... Anita told me he announces
the promotions. Go...

564
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,893
How do you see yourself
as a supervisor?

565
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:38,942
Yes, come in...

566
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:42,850
No, no, no... Yes, yes, yes,
it's the right person.

567
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,719
Yes, of course, yes.

568
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:50,583
No, it's the profile
we are looking for.

569
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:53,252
Okay...

570
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:55,798
Okay, I'll call you back.
Good bye.

571
00:49:02,806 --> 00:49:05,434
- Venturi...
- Ventura, with an "a".

572
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:07,638
Ventura with an "a".

573
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:11,440
You know you are a fundamental
part of this company, don't you?

574
00:49:11,581 --> 00:49:13,674
You have always been
an excellent employee.

575
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:16,344
Your productivity level
is at it's best.

576
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:17,818
Thank you.

577
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:22,517
It's a shame you had
that accident the other day...

578
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:25,384
What accident?

579
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:30,395
You referred in bad terms about
one of the company's products.

580
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:34,899
- That is a serious fault, Venturi.
- Ventura.

581
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:37,867
Sadly,

582
00:49:38,842 --> 00:49:41,208
we'll have to let you go.

583
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,473
What do you mean let me go?

584
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:46,239
No... Where?

585
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:54,220
Trust me,
I feel as bad as you about this.

586
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:59,295
Wouldn't you feel a little bit
better if you didn't fire me?

587
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,041
- Hello...
- Oh... Isabel...

588
00:50:49,112 --> 00:50:53,139
- I'm collecting the services money.
- Oh... Come in, come in.

589
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:58,183
- I'll get the money.
- Okay.

590
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:04,593
This place looks nice...

591
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:11,764
Here.

592
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:15,136
- Good...
- The tenant?

593
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:17,636
She is not here.

594
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:20,005
- You are dating, aren't you?
- No...

595
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:22,236
- Why would you come up with that?
- Why not?

596
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:25,543
She's very pretty.
And you are a man, aren't you?

597
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:28,217
Of course... Why?

598
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:32,185
Just that sometimes we search
for love in the most unusual place,

599
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:37,688
and find it
in the least expected place.

600
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:40,456
Well, that's true...

601
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:44,324
I'm not sure if you are...

602
00:51:44,468 --> 00:51:47,130
too polite, too shy,

603
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:49,897
too dumb...

604
00:51:58,482 --> 00:51:59,881
Clara!

605
00:52:01,017 --> 00:52:02,780
Sorry, Isabel.

606
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,545
Apologies taken,
but this won't stay like this.

607
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:05,985
No, no, of course.

608
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:08,284
Excuse me...
Clara!

609
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:12,027
Clara, open up, please.

610
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:17,232
<i>- Please Clara!
- I'm not here!</i>

611
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:20,431
Don't act as a child, open up.

612
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:24,529
You are the one acting as a child.

613
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:26,235
Can you tell me what's going on?

614
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:28,741
<i>Nothing! Nothing at all!
Why do you think something happens?</i>

615
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:31,576
<i>- Nothing is wrong with me.
- You don't act accordingly.</i>

616
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:37,911
- Clara...
- Congratulations.

617
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:39,917
I wasn't aware
of your excellent taste.

618
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,449
- Can I get through?
- Please.

619
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:47,996
What do you mean by taste?

620
00:52:52,435 --> 00:52:54,403
<i>- Clara...
- Occupied.</i>

621
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:59,140
<i>It's wrong for a man to be alone.
It's okay. He is entitled to it.</i>

622
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:01,677
Really, I don't know
what you are talking about.

623
00:53:01,778 --> 00:53:03,268
<i>I'm talking about your girlfriend.</i>

624
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:05,246
<i>About that girlfriend of yours.</i>

625
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,506
<i>It's not bad for a man your age.</i>

626
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:11,113
What I find somehow out of place...

627
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:12,813
is you having to do it
right here in the living room...

628
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:14,948
You are not living alone any more.
I don't know if you remember...

629
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:17,721
- I am living here too...
- Yes... as if easy to forget...

630
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:19,722
<i>At least when you were young
you could do it in the porch.</i>

631
00:53:19,796 --> 00:53:22,162
<i>Nowadays there is no respect...</i>

632
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:23,995
Listen to me.
Is there a remote chance...

633
00:53:24,067 --> 00:53:25,466
you are kind of jealous?

634
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:28,026
<i>Come on!
What are you talking about!</i>

635
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:30,102
Isabel was here to collect
the services money, just that.

636
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:32,334
<i>- Yes, sure, the services money...
- Yes.</i>

637
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:33,842
<i>You obviously pay cheap.</i>

638
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:36,435
Okay. I can give you this...
The situation was a bit confusing,

639
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:38,376
but nothing happened.
We tripped...

640
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:40,847
fell over the couch,
and that's when you came in.

641
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:43,010
That was it.

642
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,987
What's wrong?

643
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:59,130
Hey! It's not such a big deal...

644
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,597
No... I got fired.

645
00:54:03,206 --> 00:54:04,730
You got fired?

646
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:08,409
I guess these
are tears of joy then.

647
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:13,406
You don't get it.
I'm telling you I was fired.

648
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,810
That's the best thing
that could happen to you.

649
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:22,450
Actually, it would have been
more heroic just to quit, but...

650
00:54:23,226 --> 00:54:25,217
at least you don't have to go
back there.

651
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:27,828
Clara...

652
00:54:28,398 --> 00:54:31,663
There's life beyond
the call center. Don't worry.

653
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,801
I'm a mess.

654
00:54:35,972 --> 00:54:37,906
Why don't you take
a nice shower...

655
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:40,369
and we go out to celebrate.

656
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,405
What is there to celebrate?

657
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,906
That you'll be able to find
something better.

658
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:39,401
- Good evening...
- Hi, guys!

659
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:44,798
What happened?

660
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:27,612
What's going on?

661
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:32,652
Push...

662
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:45,601
Where are we going?

663
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:48,496
I don't know...
Where would you like to go?

664
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:53,007
I know!
Keep going straight.

665
00:56:55,678 --> 00:56:57,202
Okay.

666
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:30,310
Thanks.

667
00:57:35,018 --> 00:57:38,419
- I don't know what I'm going to do.
- Don't get depressed...

668
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:43,388
Imagine how bad it is to work...
that we get paid for it.

669
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:46,890
- I need to work.
- You'll find something.

670
00:57:49,899 --> 00:57:51,628
Let's have a job interview.

671
00:57:52,101 --> 00:57:53,625
Let's practice.

672
00:57:53,736 --> 00:57:56,034
Pros and cons. Let's see...

673
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:01,370
I think I'm a good partner...

674
00:58:02,445 --> 00:58:06,472
Cons, I'm disperse,
always arrive late.

675
00:58:06,549 --> 00:58:08,642
That's a problem I have.

676
00:58:08,718 --> 00:58:11,152
- A disaster...
- Yes...

677
00:58:11,221 --> 00:58:14,418
The labor market
can't take so much honesty.

678
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,088
Let's see, you ask me.

679
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:19,187
Okay...

680
00:58:19,362 --> 00:58:21,830
Why would you like to be
a part of our company?

681
00:58:22,932 --> 00:58:26,368
To work
in such a prestigious place...

682
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:28,131
would be a great challenge for me,

683
00:58:28,571 --> 00:58:32,098
- and I love challenges.
- I hate challenges.

684
00:58:32,242 --> 00:58:35,405
It doesn't matter. Lie, lie.

685
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:37,742
No employer
wants to know the truth.

686
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:40,645
- Come on. Keep asking.
- Let's see... Pros and cons.

687
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:45,318
Pros, I'm extremely responsible
and caring for the details,

688
00:58:45,488 --> 00:58:48,252
and my cons, too self demanding...

689
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:50,690
and sometimes
on the workaholic side.

690
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:53,795
I'm not sure I could do it. I hate
speaking nicely about myself.

691
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:56,798
"I promise to be wonderful and meet
the expectations" is not my thing.

692
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:58,834
- Then be yourself...
- I hate being myself,

693
00:58:58,902 --> 00:59:01,029
and I hate it when people say so.
What does it mean to "be myself"?

694
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:04,301
I am myself. And myself
needs to work... urgently.

695
00:59:05,642 --> 00:59:08,873
Hate, hate, hate...
When is the time for a little love?

696
00:59:10,313 --> 00:59:11,803
Thanks.

697
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:14,816
Thank you.

698
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:20,749
Why are you alone?

699
00:59:21,324 --> 00:59:22,791
My parents live far away.

700
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:24,690
I came to the city
because I needed to work...

701
00:59:24,827 --> 00:59:27,796
No... What I mean is why
don't you have a boyfriend.

702
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:32,429
I'm not sure.
Guys who fall in love with me...

703
00:59:32,502 --> 00:59:33,992
are not my type.

704
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:35,230
My type of guy...

705
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:37,432
is the one
who will never fall for me.

706
00:59:37,707 --> 00:59:39,572
Every time I start dating someone,

707
00:59:39,642 --> 00:59:41,405
the first thing I do
is list him all the reasons...

708
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:43,308
he has to dump me.

709
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:44,710
I'd rather have
a premature failure,

710
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:46,806
to disappoint him beforehand.
It saves on time and reproaches.

711
00:59:46,883 --> 00:59:48,077
Okay...

712
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,378
Let's have our first date.

713
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:54,885
Disappoint me.
Hit yourself...

714
00:59:55,191 --> 00:59:57,716
as hard as you can,

715
00:59:57,827 --> 00:59:59,886
and don't be shy while you do it.

716
01:00:00,063 --> 01:00:02,554
Do you want me to give you reasons
not to fall in love with me?

717
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:06,498
- Why not?
- I'm not perfect.

718
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:09,364
That actually inspires me
some confidence.

719
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:12,206
I have a sort of tragic sense
about existence...

720
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:15,210
which always pushes me to think
the worst out of every situation.

721
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:20,071
Okay, if you had to score yourself
between 1 and 10...

722
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:22,311
what would you get?

723
01:00:25,588 --> 01:00:27,146
A 6?

724
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:29,619
Did you ever think...

725
01:00:29,892 --> 01:00:32,360
that all the reasons
for a guy to get spooked...

726
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:36,821
could also be the ones for him
to fall in love with you?

727
01:00:38,101 --> 01:00:40,592
Every idea is reversible.

728
01:00:41,204 --> 01:00:42,967
Think about it
the other way around.

729
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:45,569
Turn them over.

730
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,163
No.

731
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:20,072
- What?
- No.

732
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:22,277
Please, go out to dance.

733
01:01:22,412 --> 01:01:25,313
Do it for me. Go, go.

734
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:27,609
- Excuse me.
- I'll eat the dessert.

735
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:45,790
Waiter...

736
01:01:48,571 --> 01:01:51,301
Could you bring me
something to write on?

737
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:19,498
- Bye.
- See you.

738
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:24,137
- What? No, no, no...
- What do you mean no?

739
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:26,471
- Don't make me. Please, no...
- Come on. Please...

740
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:28,635
- But you were doing so good...
- You'll like it. You'll like it.

741
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:10,514
Here, you are going
to get a cold...

742
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:14,946
Ah! I'm breathless...

743
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:28,498
Close your eyes...
and make a wish.

744
01:03:28,571 --> 01:03:31,335
When the train is passing
you have to make a wish. Come on...

745
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:39,408
- What are you doing?
- What's wrong?

746
01:03:41,217 --> 01:03:43,412
Clara, I could be your father.

747
01:03:43,886 --> 01:03:45,615
But you are not.

748
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:50,523
- Let's go, let's go.
- I don't want to leave.

749
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:54,326
I don't want to go back.

750
01:03:58,634 --> 01:04:00,568
<i>Take me far away.</i>

751
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:16,169
Come in.

752
01:05:19,215 --> 01:05:20,580
This is nice.

753
01:05:25,554 --> 01:05:27,522
<i>- Clara...
- Yes!</i>

754
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:30,185
I've found this clothes for you.
Why don't you try them?

755
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:36,731
<i>Thanks.</i>

756
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:38,452
<i>Sir, Sir...
Sir, Sir...</i>

757
01:06:38,627 --> 01:06:40,424
<i>Sir, Sir, Sir...</i>

758
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:42,653
<i>Sir...</i>

759
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:44,864
You are at home.

760
01:06:45,301 --> 01:06:48,361
- Excuse me?
- You are at home.

761
01:07:40,823 --> 01:07:42,552
I went shopping...

762
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:54,998
Brought a dress for you.

763
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,169
Thanks.

764
01:08:12,621 --> 01:08:14,418
Is she your wife?

765
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:21,163
- She is pretty.
- Was.

766
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:57,165
I didn't know you painted.

767
01:08:58,701 --> 01:09:00,225
Used to.

768
01:09:00,669 --> 01:09:02,261
Why did you stop?

769
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,637
Inspiration left me.

770
01:09:17,453 --> 01:09:19,216
Do you like Rodin?

771
01:09:20,623 --> 01:09:22,318
Didn't know him.

772
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:31,993
This is Camille Claudel,
and this is him.

773
01:09:32,067 --> 01:09:33,625
Who is Camille Claudel?

774
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:38,629
His disciple. He was her big...
Iove and teacher.

775
01:09:39,775 --> 01:09:42,801
She was so young...
What was the age difference?

776
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:45,174
A lot.

777
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:47,181
A lot like us?

778
01:09:48,951 --> 01:09:52,717
Sort of a tragic story.
She ended up in a nuthouse.

779
01:09:53,656 --> 01:09:55,988
She probably had a good time
before that.

780
01:11:58,347 --> 01:11:59,905
You let me down.

781
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:01,279
Why?

782
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:02,644
When I woke up
and didn't see you,

783
01:12:02,785 --> 01:12:05,151
I thought you would be
preparing breakfast.

784
01:12:07,456 --> 01:12:10,755
- I'm not a good host.
- No, you suck.

785
01:12:17,966 --> 01:12:19,661
Is something wrong?

786
01:12:20,069 --> 01:12:22,230
No... What could be?

787
01:12:22,604 --> 01:12:25,232
Mystery bores me, you know?

788
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:29,841
Are you regretting this?

789
01:12:32,948 --> 01:12:35,178
This is a mistake, Clara.

790
01:12:40,155 --> 01:12:41,952
What is a mistake?

791
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:46,419
Feeling something for me
is a mistake?

792
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:48,829
That is inevitable.

793
01:12:50,499 --> 01:12:52,967
Who wouldn't feel
something for you?

794
01:12:54,403 --> 01:12:56,200
So?

795
01:12:59,475 --> 01:13:02,035
The mistake is you
feeling something for me.

796
01:13:26,935 --> 01:13:28,596
Is this about your wife?

797
01:13:29,371 --> 01:13:30,929
About it all.

798
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:34,701
I don't understand
what you are trying to say.

799
01:13:35,177 --> 01:13:37,008
Your wife is gone...

800
01:13:40,015 --> 01:13:41,778
Let's be realistic.

801
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:46,679
Each one of us invented
the other our own way.

802
01:13:46,822 --> 01:13:48,517
Inventing?

803
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:51,518
I don't get it.
Do you think this is invented?

804
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:53,527
Maybe you are idealizing me.

805
01:13:53,629 --> 01:13:55,426
Do you think I don't know
what kind of person you are?

806
01:13:56,465 --> 01:13:58,524
Do you think I don't know
you have a rotten character,

807
01:13:58,634 --> 01:14:00,898
you are distrustful,
close minded, that you snore?

808
01:14:01,036 --> 01:14:02,867
- I don't snore.
- Yes, you snore.

809
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:07,638
There is a big difference
between you and me.

810
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:10,542
- Which is?
- Time's on your side, not on mine.

811
01:14:11,847 --> 01:14:14,407
You are speaking
as if you'd be about to die.

812
01:14:15,083 --> 01:14:18,177
Why don't you bury yourself alive
now so you save some time?

813
01:14:19,054 --> 01:14:20,885
What you need...

814
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:24,049
I won't be able to always give.

815
01:14:27,196 --> 01:14:29,824
Why do you think
you know what I need?

816
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:33,196
I do.

817
01:14:36,905 --> 01:14:38,896
Trust me...

818
01:14:39,608 --> 01:14:41,542
before it's too late.

819
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,305
It's already late.

820
01:15:09,438 --> 01:15:13,033
<i># Don't ask Me not to bleed... #</i>

821
01:15:14,977 --> 01:15:18,310
<i># if your knife is still buried... #</i>

822
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:22,544
<i># inside of Me... #</i>

823
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:28,016
<i># Don't ask Me
to heal Myself instantly. #</i>

824
01:15:30,225 --> 01:15:35,492
<i># Give Me days,
give Me Months... #</i>

825
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:43,629
<i>If I look for you
in the water of my mouth...</i>

826
01:15:45,807 --> 01:15:50,972
<i># If I see you deep in My eyes... #</i>

827
01:15:53,448 --> 01:15:57,248
<i># Don't ask Me
not to be irresponsible... #</i>

828
01:15:57,352 --> 01:15:59,684
FOR RENT

829
01:16:00,489 --> 01:16:05,392
<i># If I don't stop loving you... #</i>

830
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:26,003
<i># If I write
another stupid love song... #</i>

831
01:16:27,215 --> 01:16:32,881
<i># If I like it so Much
I write Music for it too... #</i>

832
01:16:35,557 --> 01:16:40,961
<i># If I tell you it caMe out
while thinking about you... #</i>

833
01:16:42,831 --> 01:16:48,736
<i># It's not a lie
even if I'M a good liar... #</i>

834
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:56,036
<i># Don't ask Me
not to be irresponsible... #</i>

835
01:16:58,013 --> 01:17:03,645
<i># If I don't stop loving you... #</i>

836
01:17:24,606 --> 01:17:26,403
- Hello.
- Hello.

837
01:17:27,175 --> 01:17:28,301
Nice to meet you.

838
01:17:28,377 --> 01:17:31,244
What would your pros and cons be?

839
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:33,304
Pros... I love challenge.

840
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:36,747
I'm extremely responsible,
caring for the details...

841
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:39,253
Cons...

842
01:17:42,424 --> 01:17:46,053
too self demanding and sometimes
on the workaholic side.

843
01:17:46,862 --> 01:17:48,022
Well...

844
01:17:48,964 --> 01:17:52,024
Can we do a little test?
We'll see how that results.

845
01:17:52,601 --> 01:17:53,795
Okay.

846
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:20,691
When can you start?

847
01:18:45,287 --> 01:18:48,222
<i>I can now say I've learnt
two new things about me.</i>

848
01:18:49,091 --> 01:18:51,719
<i>It really bothers me that everyone
tries to be unforgettable,</i>

849
01:18:53,395 --> 01:18:55,693
<i>mostly because some get to be.</i>

850
01:18:56,598 --> 01:18:58,532
<i>I have also learnt
that in the kitchen of love,</i>

851
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:01,865
<i>sometimes impossible
combinations come out perfect.</i>

852
01:19:05,507 --> 01:19:08,169
<i>Although I try to think
about the future, truth is...</i>

853
01:19:08,944 --> 01:19:10,411
<i>I can't imagine it.</i>

854
01:19:11,346 --> 01:19:13,814
<i>That could be an advantage,</i>

855
01:19:14,683 --> 01:19:16,207
<i>since at the end,</i>

856
01:19:18,186 --> 01:19:20,245
<i>no one knows
what's there for us.</i>

857
01:19:36,805 --> 01:19:38,295
Excuse me...

858
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:29,503
Now that you know my name,
you have to tell me yours.

859
01:22:34,349 --> 01:22:37,216
- Don't even think I'm telling you.
- Why not?

860
01:22:37,285 --> 01:22:39,480
You already know mine,
tell me yours.

861
01:22:40,488 --> 01:22:42,922
Don't you remember
I like things even?

862
01:22:52,367 --> 01:22:56,030
- So?
- You are going to laugh at it.

863
01:22:56,104 --> 01:22:57,628
- Why would I laugh?
- Promise me?

864
01:22:57,706 --> 01:22:59,571
- Across my heart.
- Sure?

865
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:02,633
I am not going to laugh
at your name... God! Please...

866
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:15,046
<i>You are laughing.</i>

867
01:23:15,323 --> 01:23:19,157
<i>- No, why would I be laughing?
- You are laughing...</i>

868
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:20,000
