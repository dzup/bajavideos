00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,960
Title£ºGOZU

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Sorry uncle

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I only have beef.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
My father don't let me out.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I am terribly sorry, uncle.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I meant to give you.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Ater all can you read my letter?

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
What a pity. I am so sorry.

9
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,040
I meant to give you.....

10
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,040
Brother

11
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,040
Hello, hello.

12
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,040
Carry it for me.

13
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,880
Brother, Boss is here.

14
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,440
Welcome.

15
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,840
Thanks for coming.
Thanks for coming.

16
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,920
Let`s start.

17
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:13,080
Now, if anyone has any news
to report, please do so.

18
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,840
Anything?

19
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,280
Haven`t you got any?

20
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,120
Since there seems to be no news...

21
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,960
Hey, the chick you were with the
other day, with those huge...

22
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,360
No, no...
- Did you do her?

23
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,640
No, no.

24
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,280
My, my... you stupid fool!

25
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,040
If no one has any announcement,
let me proceed with updates.

26
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,800
What?

27
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,680
What I`m about to tell you is all a
joke, so please don`t take it seriously.

28
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,040
Did you see the dog outside?

29
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,760
The dog?

30
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,440
The dog.

31
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,440
Please don`t stare.

32
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:48,080
That must be a yakuza dog trained
to only attack only yakuza.

33
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,280
A yakuza dog?

34
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,240
A yakuza dog.

35
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,000
That?

36
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,720
We all need to be careful.

37
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,840
No one seems to have any
announcement to make...

38
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,720
So let`s move on to greetings from Boss.

39
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,680
Yeah, well, I really don`t have
a lot to say this month but...

40
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,000
Boss!

41
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,680
Gotta kill it before it kills us.

42
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,040
The Great Yakuza Horror Theatre
GOZU

43
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,760
Are we there yet?

44
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,720
Just a little longer.

45
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,120
Did Boss tell you anything?

46
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,520
About what?

47
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,600
About this trip to Nagoya to see clients.

48
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,440
Isn`t it strange?

49
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,120
To have me visit clients at such a time?

50
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,240
Um, can I go take a leak? Excuse me.

51
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,760
Minami.

52
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,000
Yes.

53
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,960
What do you think of our family?

54
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,440
I think it`s a good family.

55
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,800
Our family will continue to
decline if this keeps up...

56
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,280
As long as Boss is in charge.

57
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,200
It will be fine as long as we
have you, Brother Ozaki.

58
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,680
All Boss cares about now is the woman.

59
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,480
It`s hopeless when one falls
for a woman at that age.

60
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:40,160
I`m planning to ask him to retire.

61
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,520
Depending on how it goes, I
might kill him and get killed.

62
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,600
Will you put your trust in me
and stick with me to the end?

63
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:10,960
Brother, I`ve been ready for this
since when you saved my life.

64
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:17,240
I`ll stick with you to the end no matter what.

65
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,560
Bad news...

66
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,920
Stop the car!

67
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,640
Minami, get out! Get out!

68
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,040
Yes!

69
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,320
Down! Down!

70
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,640
Wh... what is it?

71
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:43,760
That`s a yakuza car designed
to... run over yakuza.

72
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,800
Brother, it doesn`t look like
anything but a regular car.

73
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,000
Plus, there`s no such thing as a yakuza car.

74
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,440
Minami...

75
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:34,040
If anything happens to me,
please take care of my things.

76
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,560
Die.

77
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,280
Brother!

78
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,520
Go now.

79
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,920
Go now!

80
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,160
Brother... Brother!

81
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,920
Yes, it`s Minami.

82
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,720
Where are you?

83
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,320
Just before Nagoya.

84
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,200
You`re late. And Ozaki?

85
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,080
He`s asleep.

86
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,600
That`s convenient. Hurry on.

87
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,680
You aren`t still hesitating, are you?

88
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,560
I`m telling you Ozaki is crazy.

89
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,320
Hurry and take him to the
disposal site in Nagoya.

90
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,560
Understood?

91
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,360
Understood.

92
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,080
1 km to Nagoya

93
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,800
Brother...

94
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:32,600
Brother? Brother?

95
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:29,240
Well, it`s more cold today.

96
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,600
It was warmer yesterday.

97
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,040
It`s definitely colder today!

98
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,560
What, you don`t believe me...
you stupid idiot!

99
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,760
I said it`s cold!

100
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:49,520
Hold on! It`s going to beep, so let me
put in another coin. Hold on a second.

101
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,280
Welcome.

102
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,000
Yeah, sure it was super hot
until the day before yesterday...

103
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:06,920
Coffee.

104
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,160
...I was walkin` around in short sleeves.

105
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,440
You don`t believe me?

106
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,080
Everyone agrees.

107
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,480
It was hot, right?

108
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,040
Look, everyone says yeah...

109
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,000
Walkin` around in short sleeves.
You don`t believe me?

110
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,840
Everyone agrees.
It was hot, right?

111
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,200
Look, everyone says yeah...

112
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,920
Here you are.

113
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,400
I only ordered coffee.

114
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,160
It`s on the house.

115
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,760
Enjoy.

116
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,960
What?

117
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:24,320
You`re not from Nagoya, are you?

118
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,560
Not from Nagoya, are you?

119
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,280
Not from Nagoya?

120
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,400
Not from Nagoya, are you?

121
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,520
Hey!

122
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,320
It was hot, he goes.

123
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,920
I go it was.

124
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,440
I go it was hot, and he goes Spot.

125
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,200
He said that?

126
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,520
Doesn`t make sense at all!

127
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,720
What a strange one!

128
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,080
Really. Strange, you know.

129
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:37,960
Then it goes beep, I go
I`m running out of coins...

130
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:52,280
Excuse me, did someone come in?

131
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,120
Who do you mean by someone?

132
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,520
Someone came in while I
was in the bathroom, right?

133
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,160
Did anyone just come in?

134
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,080
Well...
- Did someone?

135
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,200
No. We don`t know, right?

136
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,080
Did someone?
- Well, ready to go?

137
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,080
I don`t understand what
you`re saying, you idiot!

138
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,560
You killed Ozaki for sure, right?

139
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,800
Then there`s no way dead Ozaki goes
anywhere by himself, is there? Idiot.

140
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,480
What`re we gonna do if he`s alive?

141
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,200
He even wants to take my life!

142
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:55,640
Anyhow, just find his dead body or whatever
and bring it to the yakuza disposal site!

143
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,400
Understood?

144
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,800
Ouch!

145
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,800
The ladle's rubbing against me. Ouch!

146
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,840
It hurts, hurts!! Ouch!

147
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,120
Are you near Nagoya now?

148
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,040
Yes. Close.

149
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:32,880
There`s someone I know who`s headed a
family for a long time called Shiroyama Group.

150
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,280
That`s the ''Shi-ro-ya-ma'' Group.

151
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:40,240
Go to him. He might help you.

152
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,880
Sure, the address is around here.

153
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,880
But I`ve never heard of the Shiroyama Group.

154
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,400
I was told they lived here for a long time.

155
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,280
Then they may have gone somewhere else.

156
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,240
But... you mean if they've gone somewhere...

157
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,400
Why don`t you ask the police?

158
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,840
That`s your best bet.

159
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,120
What is it?

160
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,240
What is it?

161
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,400
Where's the Shiroyama Group located?

162
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,400
Shiroyama Group?

163
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,480
What`s the address?

164
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,680
This address is where Shin-ho Farm is.

165
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,120
What?

166
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,360
But... the man at the temple
said he didn`t know where.

167
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,440
You`re not from Nagoya, are you?

168
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,040
Tokyo?

169
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,120
Yokohama?

170
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,800
I`m from Hong Kong.

171
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,480
What does the Shiroyama Group do?

172
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,520
Thanks but I`ll find it myself.

173
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,920
Out of the range...

174
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,000
It`s a bone.

175
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,160
It was a bone as I suspected, a bone.

176
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,960
You got a flat tire.

177
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,880
Need a hand?

178
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,560
Does my face bother you?

179
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:38,520
Stare at it all you want. I hate it
when people pretend it's not there.

180
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:52,000
I was born with a pigment
defect just around here.

181
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,280
Is it creepy?

182
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,480
Not really...

183
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,280
My factory carries lots of tires.

184
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,360
I`m sure there`s one that fits your car.

185
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,520
We all need to help one another, you know.

186
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,760
Can you sing Yosaku?

187
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,760
No.

188
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,440
Have you ever killed a man?

189
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,320
No.

190
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,040
I see.

191
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,640
I bet you eat curry over rice and hashed
meat over rice together, don`t you?

192
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,400
No.

193
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,760
Hey, your grandma`s name is Kiriko, right?

194
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,680
It`s Keiko.

195
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,320
Keiko...

196
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:57,280
Wait a minute... hey, what`re
you trying to find out?

197
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:03,520
Well, I thought we`re much alike, you and me.

198
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,640
Shiro... yama... Group...

199
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:16,920
Hmm, that man named Mr.
Azamawari doesn`t quite ring a bell.

200
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,720
Hey, do you know him?

201
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,920
No, I don`t know him.

202
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:33,440
Your ''brother'' that disappeared, is
he someone that important to you?

203
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,600
Yes.

204
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,680
Then I might lend you a helping hand.

205
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,640
We all need to help one another, you know.

206
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,920
On one condition, however.

207
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:55,800
If you can answer the question I`m about
to ask, I`ll help you find your brother.

208
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:03,520
But if you can`t answer, I won`t help you,
plus I`ll take something important to you.

209
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,520
I got no money if that`s what you mean.

210
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,520
Is money what`s important to you?

211
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,600
My life?

212
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,640
That`s not what I want.

213
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:23,960
I`m just gonna take something
that`s extremely important to you.

214
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,240
Do you wanna give it a shot?

215
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,160
I do.

216
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,760
Alright.

217
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,000
Then here`s the question.

218
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:59,680
What passes by, though it`s not moving?

219
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,680
I`ll give you 30 seconds.

220
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:09,440
30...29...28...27...26...

221
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:16,200
25...24...23...22...21...

222
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:20,200
20...1 1... 10 seconds remaining.

223
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,440
You skipped some. Hey, you skipped! Skipped!

224
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,440
I didn`t skip.

225
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,520
That`s not...not enough time like this!

226
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:32,640
5...4...3...2...1...

227
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,240
Wait... Time!

228
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,840
It`s time that passes by!

229
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,280
...0.

230
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,920
You got it!

231
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,520
Congratulations!

232
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,160
As promised, I`ll help you find your brother.

233
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,840
No`se, help him.
- Yes, I will.

234
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:06,120
He knows this area... at least most of it.

235
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,760
Thank you.

236
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:17,920
The sun`s going down soon so we`ll
commence our investigation tomorrow.

237
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,160
No, that won't work. I`m in a hurry.

238
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,760
We`re the ones helping you out and
we expect you to go by our schedule.

239
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,720
If you don`t like it, please
go ahead on your own.

240
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,880
Haste makes waste.

241
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:54,040
Masakazu Inn

242
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,160
Let`s go.

243
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,360
Hello.

244
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,960
Hello?

245
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,640
Hello!

246
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,000
Hello!!

247
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,920
Hello?

248
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,760
Welcome.

249
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:14,920
I`m sorry, I was digging up
some lotus root in the field.

250
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,760
Need a room?

251
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,720
Is there a vacancy?

252
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,520
A double room?

253
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,160
Single, please.

254
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,920
There`s only one small room available.

255
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,360
You`re okay with that,
right? That`s fine, please.

256
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,240
Kazuo!! A guest.

257
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:14,280
Rustic cuisine or seasonal
Masakazu Inn

258
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,280
Show him to the room.

259
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,960
Which room?

260
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,080
That room!

261
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,400
Please come in.

262
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,280
Well, thank you for everything today.

263
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,320
I`ll see you tomorrow.

264
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,360
No, I`ll be fine.

265
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,400
Well, I need to see what kind of room it is.

266
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,720
I`m concerned.

267
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,400
Would you like dinner?

268
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,240
Yes, please.

269
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,600
Well...

270
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:34,120
Let me consult the owner.

271
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,440
It`s a pretty good room.

272
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,800
Yeah.

273
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,160
I could stay here, too...

274
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,480
Do you mind?

275
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,520
Well, you`ll see me tomorrow.

276
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:59,440
Aren`t you cold-hearted.
After I did so much for you.

277
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,960
I...I do appreciate it.

278
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,720
I just can`t sleep well with
somebody else in the room.

279
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,920
I won`t do anything weird to you.

280
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,200
Well...

281
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,080
That`s not the issue...

282
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,760
I really can`t?

283
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,920
I`m sorry...

284
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,160
I see.

285
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,400
I`ll go home.

286
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,000
That`s what you want, right?

287
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,760
Who do you think you are? Idiot.

288
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,680
Did your friend leave?

289
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,880
Yes.

290
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,680
Are you having a meal?

291
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,960
Oh, if you don`t serve food,
I can go outside to eat.

292
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:58,240
Oh no, we can prepare it.

293
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,400
We just don`t have many ingredients today.

294
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:12,880
Normally, we can prepare Course A, but
we can only prepare Course B today.

295
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,560
Is that alright with you?

296
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,880
That Course B is fine.

297
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,560
Yes, we`ll prepare it then.

298
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,520
Oh, sir, it`ll be a while before
the dinner will be ready.

299
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,720
Would you like to take a bath first?

300
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,480
Then I`ll do that.

301
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:39,960
Oh, it`s down the hall to
the end and you turn left.

302
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:45,640
Well, we have this beautiful gum tree, and...

303
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,760
How`s the water temperature?

304
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,120
It`s fine.

305
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,160
I see.

306
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,560
What is it?

307
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:41,240
Shall I scrub your back?

308
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,920
No thanks.

309
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,600
Really?

310
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,120
No, it`s okay! I can do it myself!

311
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:57,480
Lately, I`ve been getting many
guests who turns me down like that.

312
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,680
Please hand me your towel.

313
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,480
It`s okay.

314
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:17,680
You don`t have to hide yourself.

315
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,440
That`s a big one you`ve got.

316
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,240
Aren`t my breasts big?

317
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,480
What?

318
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,520
I still got milk, too.

319
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,520
Would you like to drink it?
- Huh?

320
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:13,000
No, of course, I won`t drink that!

321
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:20,960
Lately I`ve been getting so many
guests who turns me down like that.

322
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:23,960
Here.

323
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,760
I don`t want it.

324
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,120
Go ahead.

325
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,320
I said I don`t want it!

326
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,240
It`s just a joke.

327
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:47,960
The dinner is... is ready!

328
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,800
See you later.

329
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,360
Excuse me.

330
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,560
Hey, this here, why did you give me so much?

331
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,320
It`s free service.

332
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:02,080
Even for free service...

333
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,640
No, wait...it`s okay.

334
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,440
I can do it myself.

335
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,040
Excuse me.

336
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,600
Hey, Minami!

337
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,560
Did your phimosis operation go well?

338
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,600
Yes, it went okay.

339
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,720
Let me see it.

340
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:40,480
Huh? Oh, it`s not much to see.

341
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,680
I said let me see it.

342
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:42,800
No, really...

343
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,960
Let me see it or I`ll fuckin` kill you!

344
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,640
Okay...

345
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,280
Wait, just a second.

346
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,240
Here.

347
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,720
Oh, so that`s what it looks like.

348
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:03,240
I guess.
- It looks like Frankenstein's dick, doesn`t it?

349
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,640
But your cock's still great. Really impressive.

350
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Well... Brother, can I...cover it now?

351
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,400
Yeah. So you can fuck women, at last. Right?

352
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,640
Yes.

353
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,040
I`ve got a gift for you.

354
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,520
What`s this?

355
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,320
Women`s undies.

356
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,840
Thank you.

357
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:36,040
Give them to the woman you wanna fuck.

358
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,360
Yes.

359
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,960
They`re a good-luck charm, so you`ll do fine.

360
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,360
They`re Givenchy crotchless-panties.

361
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,360
Oh, thank you.
- That`s quality stuff, so use them well.

362
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,680
It`s Givenchy, you know.
- Yes, yes, I got it.

363
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,480
Alright? Don`t you throw them away.
- I won`t throw them away.

364
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,560
You let her wear them and fuck her in them.

365
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,160
In them?
- Fuck her with them on.

366
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,360
Fuck her with them on?

367
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,960
Cause there`s a hole in them.

368
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:03,720
Use them well.
- Got it. I`ll use them well. Thanks.

369
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:49,920
We selected Course A for your breakfast.

370
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,360
Good morning.

371
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,040
What happened to you?

372
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:42,000
Can`t you see? I got injured.

373
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,440
I had a feeling something bad
was gonna happen yesterday.

374
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:51,120
That`s why I didn`t wanna
go home. It`s all your fault.

375
00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:01,520
I`ve got some tires for you, so
first let`s go and change your tire.

376
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,680
When we`re done with the
tires, where shall we go?

377
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,720
I see the coffee shop re-opened.

378
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,600
They`d gone out of business
and was abandoned before.

379
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:49,320
I see they re-opened.

380
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,240
Welcome.

381
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,280
They were here yesterday, too.

382
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,240
They look suspicious, don`t they?

383
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,560
Ready to order?

384
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:50,040
Coffee. No custard, please.

385
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:53,520
Coffee for me, too. With custard.

386
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,480
Yes.

387
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,720
They might know something.

388
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:10,720
Don`t know. I asked them yesterday
but they just kind of dodged me.

389
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:13,040
Let me go ask.

390
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,440
Excuse me, can I ask you a question?

391
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:31,000
Aren`t you little No`se from West junior high?

392
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,040
What?

393
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,080
It`s little No`se! It sure is!
- What?

394
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,480
What do you mean what?,
you`re little No`se!

395
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,480
It`s little No`se!

396
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,360
Well, well, I recognized you right away!

397
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,320
Little No`se, have a seat!

398
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,640
It`s been a long time...
- ...Little Komatsu and Little Shiro?

399
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:49,240
What on earth are you doing here?
- It`s been a long time.

400
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,320
To run into you guys here...

401
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:53,320
Have a cup to drink with us.
- Oh, I ordered something over there...

402
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,320
That`s alright, don`t be shy.

403
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,560
Hey, bring...bring something for him over here!

404
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,440
You`re sitting over there?

405
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:04,080
Oh, let us have Little No`se
for a little while, okay?

406
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:06,920
It`s been a long time.

407
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,200
What happened to your head?
- I fell again.

408
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:16,440
Falling again. You were falling all
the time since you were little!

409
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,720
I can`t move well since I fell.
- A disaster with this one!

410
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:22,320
Oh, you`ve got a cane.

411
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:27,680
I can barely get up and walk.
- Hey, come on, don`t get up!

412
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:32,040
Let me ask you again about yesterday.

413
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:35,880
Who`s this?

414
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:39,560
He`s an acquaintance of sorts...

415
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:44,840
Yesterday while I was in the bathroom,
did you see another customer come in?

416
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:48,800
Do you remember anything?

417
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,640
No.

418
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:55,000
I can`t understand a thing
about what you`re saying.

419
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,760
I was here yesterday, right?

420
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,920
About what time?

421
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,520
You know I was here around noon.

422
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,160
I don`t remember too well.

423
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,960
I remember even if you don`t.

424
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:25,160
You`re conspiring against me,
aren`t you? Right? Conspiring.

425
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,840
You`re tired.

426
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:27,880
What the fuck did you say, you bastard?
You`re tired.

427
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:29,960
What the fuck did you say, you bastard?

428
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:35,440
Mr. Minami, hold on! Mr. Minami!

429
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,440
If you assault me like that,
I won't stay quiet, either!

430
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,520
Hold up!

431
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,600
I won`t stay quiet!

432
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,080
Let`s go, No`se.

433
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:57,000
Well, please go by yourself if you want.

434
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,560
What the hell are you saying?

435
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:03,680
You should hire an investigator
if you want to look for someone.

436
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:08,520
I never had any desire to help you anyway.

437
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,320
It was cold yesterday, wasn`t it?

438
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:12,560
It was cold.

439
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:17,200
It was hot the day before, wasn`t it?
- It was hot.

440
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,520
You wore short sleeves, didn`t you?
- I did.

441
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:27,280
You see. I told you...

442
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:04,960
Wait out there. No`se

443
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:20,520
So you`re looking for someone.

444
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,200
Go ahead.

445
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,560
Thanks.

446
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:31,120
And has there been any clue?

447
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:35,920
None.

448
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:40,320
I`m sorry.

449
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,720
Well, Mr. Minami...

450
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,200
Have you heard of psychics?

451
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:02,200
Yeah, something like ESP, right?

452
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,120
Well, I guess there`s something in common.

453
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:16,120
Actually, my brother Kazu over there
has always had this mysterious power.

454
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:23,598
He`s a medium.

455
01:00:31,316 --> 01:00:32,395
Did you say...a medium?

456
01:00:38,314 --> 01:00:39,953
Yes.

457
01:00:47,350 --> 01:00:58,146
He lets the spirit possess his body, and
the spirit speaks words through him.

458
01:01:00,346 --> 01:01:10,102
The spirit may have an idea about the
whereabouts of the man you`re looking for.

459
01:01:32,376 --> 01:01:33,734
Would you like to ask?

460
01:01:39,374 --> 01:01:42,212
Can he really do it?

461
01:01:43,372 --> 01:01:47,010
I think it`s worth trying.

462
01:01:52,370 --> 01:01:55,448
Well, then...

463
01:02:11,404 --> 01:02:14,283
So you're brother and sister...

464
01:02:35,397 --> 01:02:39,395
Thanks for waiting.

465
01:02:39,396 --> 01:02:42,754
Then, let`s proceed.

466
01:02:45,433 --> 01:02:48,751
Kazu, take your shirt off.

467
01:02:49,353 --> 01:02:50,432
What?

468
01:02:51,512 --> 01:02:53,791
You`ve always done this.

469
01:02:54,351 --> 01:02:56,630
Come on, hurry up, take it off.

470
01:02:57,030 --> 01:02:59,748
The candy drop, the candy here.

471
01:03:00,869 --> 01:03:02,227
Come on, hurry up.

472
01:03:04,188 --> 01:03:05,786
Hurry up and take it off.

473
01:03:21,342 --> 01:03:25,939
Now, we`ll invoke the spirit.

474
01:03:26,501 --> 01:03:29,179
Please repeat this in your mind:

475
01:03:29,859 --> 01:03:35,656
De`an keru kemista amore. ``

476
01:03:36,018 --> 01:03:37,136
What?

477
01:03:48,813 --> 01:03:52,371
Can you read that once?

478
01:03:55,572 --> 01:04:00,769
De`an keru kemista...amore.

479
01:04:01,409 --> 01:04:06,167
Ah! That`s fine!

480
01:04:07,487 --> 01:04:14,644
Now let`s begin. Kazu, are you ready?

481
01:04:27,482 --> 01:04:33,000
Spirit, decend!

482
01:04:46,515 --> 01:04:50,393
Spirit, appear!

483
01:04:50,954 --> 01:04:52,353
Ouch! It hurts!

484
01:04:53,233 --> 01:04:56,352
Spirit, appear!

485
01:05:09,509 --> 01:05:11,508
It hurts, sister!

486
01:05:11,508 --> 01:05:13,667
How`s that? Has the spirit come down?

487
01:05:14,507 --> 01:05:16,026
No such thing will ever appear!

488
01:05:16,946 --> 01:05:19,345
Come down!

489
01:05:22,504 --> 01:05:25,222
It hurts!

490
01:05:25,543 --> 01:05:27,542
Please, please help me!

491
01:05:27,542 --> 01:05:29,541
What...can you have the spirit appear?

492
01:05:29,542 --> 01:05:30,461
No, I can`t do that!

493
01:05:30,462 --> 01:05:31,541
Get up!

494
01:05:31,541 --> 01:05:34,540
Wait...your brother says he's not a medium!

495
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:36,939
Whether he can do it or not...is not the issue!

496
01:05:41,538 --> 01:05:46,536
...She`s crazy...

497
01:05:46,536 --> 01:05:55,173
Even if he can`t, managing to deliver somehow
is the spirit of service and motto of our inn!

498
01:05:56,534 --> 01:05:58,293
There!

499
01:06:00,092 --> 01:06:02,050
It hurts!
- You...

500
01:06:02,052 --> 01:06:03,731
It hurts, sister!

501
01:06:05,011 --> 01:06:06,489
Wait...

502
01:06:47,597 --> 01:06:48,316
Mr. No`se.

503
01:06:49,517 --> 01:06:51,076
Mr. Minami...

504
01:06:52,595 --> 01:06:53,994
I`m scared...

505
01:06:55,594 --> 01:06:57,113
...scared.
- What? What?

506
01:07:00,593 --> 01:07:04,950
You saw the two at the coffee
shop, in silver and in gold.

507
01:07:05,272 --> 01:07:06,831
Yes.

508
01:07:14,589 --> 01:07:19,507
I was so scared I couldn`t
say no. Please forgive me.

509
01:07:21,587 --> 01:07:25,305
Well, I understand now. I see.

510
01:07:27,625 --> 01:07:29,184
I`m scared, Mr. Minami.

511
01:07:30,304 --> 01:07:35,261
I`m scared... scared...

512
01:07:36,622 --> 01:07:41,620
Don`t be so scared. You`re an adult now, okay?

513
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:42,978
It`s not that.

514
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:46,018
Not that...well, what do you mean?

515
01:07:46,379 --> 01:07:59,414
You know ... the manager
... of the coffee shop.

516
01:08:00,615 --> 01:08:02,014
Yes, at the shop back there, right?

517
01:08:06,652 --> 01:08:09,010
He`s been dead.

518
01:08:18,648 --> 01:08:24,325
He died three years ago, in a car accident.

519
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:50,878
How come the dead guy`s here?

520
01:08:51,599 --> 01:08:55,037
You`re asking the wrong person.

521
01:08:56,916 --> 01:09:00,354
By the way, I`ve got breaking news.

522
01:09:00,956 --> 01:09:06,153
Those two saw someone
who might be your brother.

523
01:09:06,834 --> 01:09:08,033
Is that true?

524
01:09:08,993 --> 01:09:11,272
You went to the bathroom, right?

525
01:09:12,472 --> 01:09:21,508
While you were there, a man of about 40
wandered in, asking where to get sticky rice.

526
01:09:23,628 --> 01:09:25,466
Sticky...rice?

527
01:09:26,427 --> 01:09:30,425
The two told him he should
go to a rice shop for rice...

528
01:09:30,426 --> 01:09:35,383
...and gave him the address for
the nearest rice shop. Here it is.

529
01:09:59,097 --> 01:10:01,935
Sticky rice?

530
01:10:03,096 --> 01:10:06,294
Yeah, I seem to remember someone
looking for that yesterday.

531
01:10:09,094 --> 01:10:12,812
Did he look something like this?

532
01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:20,929
Something like that.

533
01:10:25,728 --> 01:10:27,007
Something like that.

534
01:10:29,727 --> 01:10:33,725
What did he do after he bought sticky rice?

535
01:10:35,726 --> 01:10:38,365
He asked if I carried sesame
seeds or azuki beans.

536
01:10:39,125 --> 01:10:40,243
Sesame and azuki?

537
01:10:41,724 --> 01:10:45,082
Unfortunately I`d run out of them...

538
01:10:46,002 --> 01:10:49,121
But I told him perhaps they might
carry them at a liquor store.

539
01:10:50,761 --> 01:10:52,800
Did he go to a liquor store?

540
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:54,919
Probably.

541
01:10:55,759 --> 01:10:57,117
Which liquor store?

542
01:10:57,758 --> 01:11:00,476
I told him about the closest
liquor store around here.

543
01:11:00,678 --> 01:11:01,997
Where is it?

544
01:11:06,755 --> 01:11:08,593
Are you...going to the store?

545
01:11:08,755 --> 01:11:10,754
I think so.

546
01:11:10,754 --> 01:11:12,273
I advise against it.

547
01:11:13,754 --> 01:11:15,193
Why`s that?

548
01:11:17,753 --> 01:11:23,110
The wife of the store owner... is an American!

549
01:11:25,790 --> 01:11:27,789
Is it bad if she`s an American?

550
01:11:27,789 --> 01:11:29,747
Of course it is!

551
01:11:32,187 --> 01:11:36,904
The store`s always only carried Japanese sake.

552
01:11:37,106 --> 01:11:44,183
And it`s hopeless 'cause the owner`s wife
is now more Japanese than a Japanese!

553
01:11:44,184 --> 01:11:47,702
'Cause an American selling
Japanese sake is wrong, isn`t it!

554
01:11:52,662 --> 01:11:54,380
Can you give me the address of the store?

555
01:12:00,739 --> 01:12:02,658
Do you like Americans?

556
01:12:03,618 --> 01:12:06,216
I haven`t seen him. Have you seen him?

557
01:12:06,817 --> 01:12:13,055
Though I am not totally cer-tain, a man whom
I suspect is the person you de-scribed...

558
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:21,172
...ur, visited the store in the
evening and did indeed in-quire...

559
01:12:22,252 --> 01:12:31,808
...to ask a question to query, Have you
got sesame seeds and azuki beans?``

560
01:12:31,810 --> 01:12:33,888
Oh, so he came.

561
01:12:34,329 --> 01:12:36,767
That`s when I was out playing pachinko, was it?

562
01:12:36,767 --> 01:12:42,964
Yes, just when you were out doing
pachinko, the customer visited and...

563
01:12:42,966 --> 01:12:47,443
...he bought, ur, sesame and azukoo.

564
01:12:48,324 --> 01:12:51,762
So, do you know where he went?

565
01:12:51,923 --> 01:12:53,602
I do.

566
01:12:54,362 --> 01:12:57,160
If you know, just tell them.

567
01:12:57,921 --> 01:12:59,320
I`m sorry.

568
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:04,958
The man said to me to in-quire, Is
there a cheap inn around here?

569
01:13:04,958 --> 01:13:13,874
So I offered to tell him about the
inn that I happened to know about.

570
01:13:24,992 --> 01:13:27,430
Which inn is it?

571
01:13:28,072 --> 01:13:40,827
It`s called Ma-sa-ka-zu inn, run by two siblings.

572
01:13:46,865 --> 01:13:48,864
Thank you for coming!

573
01:15:15,198 --> 01:15:16,397
Oh, it`s you.

574
01:15:19,917 --> 01:15:22,115
Have you found the man you were looking for?

575
01:15:28,953 --> 01:15:34,310
Did you receive another customer
other than me last night?

576
01:15:43,948 --> 01:15:45,107
Did you?

577
01:16:25,975 --> 01:16:34,092
You don`t have to yell.

578
01:16:38,972 --> 01:16:40,371
Kazu...

579
01:16:44,330 --> 01:16:47,089
What time was that about?

580
01:16:49,008 --> 01:16:54,766
About...1 o`clock...at night, I think.

581
01:16:55,526 --> 01:16:56,965
He was here?

582
01:16:57,525 --> 01:16:59,444
It was so late...

583
01:17:00,925 --> 01:17:07,163
...so I refused him at first...

584
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:17,719
...but he said anywhere would do...

585
01:17:21,318 --> 01:17:30,154
...so I ended up showing
him to the storage upstairs.

586
01:17:33,475 --> 01:17:36,833
Room upstairs, you mean, over there?

587
01:17:38,273 --> 01:17:44,230
It`s the room right above yours.

588
01:17:47,669 --> 01:18:00,704
Those who deliver milk are
healthier than those who drink it.

589
01:19:12,283 --> 01:19:13,562
Brother...

590
01:19:15,682 --> 01:19:17,201
It`s his smell.

591
01:19:24,879 --> 01:19:26,477
Where did he go?

592
01:19:27,439 --> 01:19:33,636
He seems to have left early in
the morning. Without paying.

593
01:19:34,557 --> 01:19:39,034
We didn`t know what to do, so we took his...

594
01:19:40,234 --> 01:19:47,271
...sticky rice, sesame seeds and azuki beans...

595
01:19:48,152 --> 01:19:54,030
...that he had left and made some red rice.

596
01:20:02,508 --> 01:20:05,106
Can I sleep in this room tonight?

597
01:20:05,147 --> 01:20:10,104
This isn`t a room for guests.

598
01:20:15,224 --> 01:20:26,220
The room you stayed in last night is
available, so why stay in a room like this?

599
01:20:26,899 --> 01:20:29,377
'Cause my brother might come back.

600
01:20:31,458 --> 01:20:40,095
We`ll charge you the regular rate, is that okay?

601
01:22:37,139 --> 01:22:38,418
Brother...

602
01:22:43,177 --> 01:22:44,456
Brother?

603
01:26:34,545 --> 01:26:41,422
''I`ll wait for you at the disposal site. Ozaki.''

604
01:26:51,299 --> 01:26:52,777
Brother!

605
01:27:36,244 --> 01:27:37,523
Hello!

606
01:27:42,602 --> 01:27:43,921
Brother?

607
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:55,519
Brother!

608
01:27:57,438 --> 01:27:58,717
Brother!

609
01:28:00,877 --> 01:28:02,396
Brother!!

610
01:28:05,356 --> 01:28:06,435
Brother!

611
01:28:35,226 --> 01:28:37,304
Who do you want to dispose?

612
01:28:43,583 --> 01:28:49,500
Didn`t this man come here yesterday or today?

613
01:28:55,300 --> 01:28:56,619
He did.

614
01:28:58,899 --> 01:29:00,178
Really?

615
01:29:01,138 --> 01:29:02,736
Who do you want to dispose?

616
01:29:04,418 --> 01:29:07,016
He was lying on the ground at the doorway.

617
01:29:08,016 --> 01:29:09,415
On the ground...

618
01:29:09,536 --> 01:29:11,095
Someone brought him here, I guess.

619
01:29:12,854 --> 01:29:14,812
Where`s that man now?

620
01:29:17,653 --> 01:29:19,371
He`s dead.

621
01:29:21,491 --> 01:29:23,250
Who do you want to dispose?

622
01:29:23,971 --> 01:29:26,049
We pressed him.

623
01:29:32,009 --> 01:29:34,087
Did you kill my brother, you bastard?

624
01:29:36,247 --> 01:29:37,766
Probably.

625
01:29:39,686 --> 01:29:41,445
Put that away.

626
01:29:43,525 --> 01:29:48,242
What was inside is in here.

627
01:29:49,123 --> 01:29:50,402
Who do you want to dispose?

628
01:30:05,438 --> 01:30:06,757
What patterns did he wear?

629
01:30:09,157 --> 01:30:10,916
Oh, here it is.

630
01:30:22,753 --> 01:30:24,312
It`s pretty good.

631
01:30:29,830 --> 01:30:32,268
This is your Brother.

632
01:30:32,870 --> 01:30:34,468
This one right here!

633
01:31:13,816 --> 01:31:15,615
It took you long enough.

634
01:31:24,933 --> 01:31:28,371
I waited for you a long time, Mr Minami.

635
01:31:31,810 --> 01:31:33,009
Who...?

636
01:31:33,211 --> 01:31:36,249
I`m Ozaki, your brother.

637
01:31:37,809 --> 01:31:39,927
Did you find this place right away?

638
01:31:43,007 --> 01:31:44,326
Who the hell are you?

639
01:31:46,326 --> 01:31:48,005
You don`t believe me, do you?

640
01:31:48,286 --> 01:31:52,124
How can I? My brother`s a man, you know!

641
01:31:54,084 --> 01:31:57,922
''Did your phimosis operation go well, Minami?''

642
01:32:00,642 --> 01:32:02,240
''Let me see it.''

643
01:32:04,521 --> 01:32:09,799
''Oh, so that`s what it looks like
after a phimosis operation.''

644
01:32:10,438 --> 01:32:13,836
''Looks like the Frankenstein's
cock, doesn`t it?''

645
01:32:13,917 --> 01:32:18,754
''But your thing is always large
and fine. Very impressive.''

646
01:32:23,634 --> 01:32:25,033
How`s that?

647
01:32:31,632 --> 01:32:33,590
What do you think of my outfit?

648
01:32:37,630 --> 01:32:39,309
Doesn`t look good, does it?
- What?

649
01:32:39,710 --> 01:32:43,588
I`ll go and change, so please
wait for a little while.

650
01:32:58,744 --> 01:33:00,222
Wait a minute!

651
01:33:01,063 --> 01:33:02,301
What is it?

652
01:33:06,061 --> 01:33:09,099
Are you surprised because I became pretty?

653
01:33:09,540 --> 01:33:13,258
Stop it already. Who the hell are you?

654
01:33:13,659 --> 01:33:15,857
You still don`t believe me.

655
01:33:16,538 --> 01:33:17,776
Of course, I can`t!

656
01:33:19,337 --> 01:33:21,736
What can I do to make you believe me?

657
01:33:23,616 --> 01:33:24,974
How about...

658
01:33:29,294 --> 01:33:32,372
You are still a virgin.

659
01:33:33,933 --> 01:33:40,250
You used a picture of mating dogs
the first time you masturbated.

660
01:33:40,771 --> 01:33:49,768
You get the urge from time to time
to shave all your pubic hair off.

661
01:33:50,927 --> 01:33:52,246
How do you know all those things?

662
01:33:52,686 --> 01:33:54,685
You told me all those things.

663
01:33:56,246 --> 01:33:58,444
Brother Ozaki is the only person I told them to.

664
01:33:58,684 --> 01:34:02,522
I`m telling you, I am Ozaki.

665
01:34:41,631 --> 01:34:44,270
Brother`s been disposed of properly.

666
01:34:45,710 --> 01:34:47,749
Sorry for troubling your mind.

667
01:34:48,789 --> 01:34:52,067
There`s just one small problem that arose...

668
01:34:52,348 --> 01:34:55,706
No, Brother`s been disposed fine.

669
01:34:58,386 --> 01:35:01,145
Yes... Well, it`s kind of hard to explain.

670
01:35:01,425 --> 01:35:03,983
Can I explain when I get back to the office?

671
01:35:04,664 --> 01:35:07,982
Yes. I`ll be back by tomorrow morning.

672
01:35:09,103 --> 01:35:10,742
So long.

673
01:36:11,762 --> 01:36:13,360
Bastard!

674
01:36:14,242 --> 01:36:15,561
You still wanna do it?

675
01:36:15,562 --> 01:36:18,240
Alright! Alright!

676
01:36:31,916 --> 01:36:34,555
What are you doing going with that man!?

677
01:36:35,155 --> 01:36:36,873
'Cause he asked me.

678
01:36:41,033 --> 01:36:43,032
Aren`t you my brother!?

679
01:37:10,545 --> 01:37:12,344
Sorry about this hotel.

680
01:37:15,543 --> 01:37:17,141
I apologize.

681
01:37:18,302 --> 01:37:20,221
I don`t mind.

682
01:37:22,301 --> 01:37:30,818
We`re leaving early tomorrow morning.
So, please rest...well.

683
01:37:37,816 --> 01:37:40,294
Wouldn`t you like to sleep with me here?

684
01:37:45,814 --> 01:37:49,532
I`m fine. I`ll sleep here.

685
01:37:50,492 --> 01:37:51,891
Is that so.

686
01:37:58,849 --> 01:37:59,688
I`ll turn out the light.

687
01:38:00,809 --> 01:38:02,368
Good night.

688
01:41:55,895 --> 01:41:58,654
Trying to do something nasty?

689
01:42:00,454 --> 01:42:03,532
Excuse me! Excuse me!

690
01:42:06,572 --> 01:42:08,971
Wanna do something nasty?

691
01:42:16,049 --> 01:42:17,808
Please excuse me.

692
01:42:22,966 --> 01:42:28,084
If you feel like doing nasty,
you can wake me anytime.

693
01:43:37,662 --> 01:43:38,941
Thanks.

694
01:44:02,695 --> 01:44:06,493
About last night... please forgive me.

695
01:44:08,653 --> 01:44:11,412
I was waiting, thinking you`d come to me.

696
01:44:19,209 --> 01:44:20,528
Brother...

697
01:44:24,008 --> 01:44:26,887
I`m gonna report to the office first.

698
01:44:27,807 --> 01:44:36,044
But I think it`ll be a problem if you`re with me.
So please rest at a hotel or some place today.

699
01:44:37,124 --> 01:44:39,802
I`m coming with you to the office.

700
01:44:41,123 --> 01:44:43,561
I`d like to say hello to Boss.

701
01:44:57,558 --> 01:45:00,116
Well, I don`t get it.

702
01:45:02,076 --> 01:45:03,194
Do you?

703
01:45:03,835 --> 01:45:05,154
No.

704
01:45:05,995 --> 01:45:08,313
You?
- No.

705
01:45:11,153 --> 01:45:13,672
You don`t make any sense at all, you know.

706
01:45:14,593 --> 01:45:17,712
I understand if you don`t.

707
01:45:18,311 --> 01:45:22,109
I still can`t believe it myself. But...

708
01:45:23,149 --> 01:45:25,668
But that woman is definitely brother.

709
01:45:27,549 --> 01:45:28,787
What?

710
01:45:30,428 --> 01:45:33,146
You wanna end up in the disposal site yourself?

711
01:45:34,546 --> 01:45:38,663
If you keep talking nonsense like that, you will.

712
01:45:45,143 --> 01:45:46,621
But it`s true!

713
01:45:46,623 --> 01:45:48,844
Is this the office of the Azamawari Group?

714
01:45:48,844 --> 01:45:50,629
Not yet!
- Who are you?

715
01:45:55,112 --> 01:46:00,547
I`m Sakiko, the daughter of Torada who
was under your boss` wing a long time ago.

716
01:46:01,858 --> 01:46:03,682
I`m Azamawari.

717
01:46:05,984 --> 01:46:07,848
Who did you say it was?

718
01:46:10,110 --> 01:46:13,957
My name is Sakiko, the
daughter of Ushikichi Torada.

719
01:46:14,634 --> 01:46:16,736
Ushikichi Torada...

720
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:20,266
Does that ring a bell?

721
01:46:36,971 --> 01:46:39,906
Come have a seat.

722
01:46:44,588 --> 01:46:46,452
Torakichi Ushida, is it?

723
01:46:46,453 --> 01:46:48,198
It`s Ushikichi Torada.

724
01:46:51,452 --> 01:46:58,355
My father always said you had helped him
a lot, all the time, when he was alive.

725
01:46:58,554 --> 01:47:00,220
When he was alive?

726
01:47:00,498 --> 01:47:02,560
He died of cancer last month.

727
01:47:03,870 --> 01:47:05,337
I see.

728
01:47:05,775 --> 01:47:12,122
I`m very sorry...I see.

729
01:47:13,114 --> 01:47:16,406
Oh, I got it!

730
01:47:16,408 --> 01:47:23,231
He was the type of man who`d fight
against anyone for justice, wasn`t he?

731
01:47:23,232 --> 01:47:24,699
Exactly.

732
01:47:25,692 --> 01:47:29,658
Ah, Tora! It`s Tora.

733
01:47:29,659 --> 01:47:32,396
I used to look after him way back when.

734
01:47:34,936 --> 01:47:41,006
I see, I see, so you`re Tora's daughter.

735
01:47:41,245 --> 01:47:44,220
Actually, I came to ask you a favor.

736
01:47:44,220 --> 01:47:45,449
A favor?

737
01:47:45,728 --> 01:47:50,289
Could you please find me a job?

738
01:47:50,291 --> 01:47:55,448
A job?
- Actually, I`d like to work here.

739
01:47:55,449 --> 01:47:56,718
Here?

740
01:48:01,796 --> 01:48:03,858
What are you thinking?

741
01:48:09,375 --> 01:48:11,437
Sakiko.
- Yes.

742
01:48:13,739 --> 01:48:19,333
Well, I`d like to sort out some paperwork
at home immediately. Can you help me?

743
01:48:19,333 --> 01:48:20,959
Yes, my pleasure.

744
01:48:21,952 --> 01:48:23,737
Hey!
-Yeah!

745
01:48:23,737 --> 01:48:26,712
What are you doing?
- Tell him to go to the square.

746
01:48:33,815 --> 01:48:35,243
Have a good day!

747
01:49:04,524 --> 01:49:06,943
There`s no need to worry.

748
01:49:08,610 --> 01:49:12,616
I`ll take care of everything
for you from now on.

749
01:49:12,618 --> 01:49:14,879
So don`t worry about a thing.

750
01:49:15,672 --> 01:49:17,060
Is that true?

751
01:49:20,195 --> 01:49:23,051
It is true.

752
01:49:34,677 --> 01:49:36,581
Do you want to take a shower?

753
01:49:42,294 --> 01:49:47,650
Which smell would you prefer, soap or me?

754
01:49:52,571 --> 01:49:54,911
You, of course!

755
01:49:57,173 --> 01:50:00,057
Just a moment! Let me get ready.

756
01:50:27,121 --> 01:50:29,639
I can`t get it up without this.

757
01:50:41,140 --> 01:50:42,480
Ouch!

758
01:50:47,438 --> 01:50:51,338
It`s coming, coming, coming!

759
01:51:27,911 --> 01:51:32,380
Oops, I was about to come too soon.

760
01:52:45,280 --> 01:52:46,660
Help!

761
01:52:51,415 --> 01:52:53,446
What`s that?
-Help me!

762
01:53:01,494 --> 01:53:03,414
What? Minami!

763
01:53:06,456 --> 01:53:09,176
What are you doing?
- Help me! Hurry!

764
01:53:17,740 --> 01:53:19,540
What the hell are you doing, Minami?

765
01:53:27,063 --> 01:53:29,103
I won`t give my brother to anyone!

766
01:53:34,145 --> 01:53:36,905
What are you saying, you stupid punk!

767
01:53:45,069 --> 01:53:47,389
Get up!

768
01:55:37,309 --> 01:55:38,788
Minami...

769
01:55:48,834 --> 01:55:50,248
Brother...

770
01:56:01,690 --> 01:56:06,945
Please take this.

771
01:56:07,917 --> 01:56:09,493
What is this?

772
01:56:09,858 --> 01:56:12,849
Givenchy crotchless panties.

773
01:56:18,146 --> 01:56:20,247
A gift from my brother.

774
01:56:21,582 --> 01:56:27,443
But I want you to have it, brother.

775
01:56:29,305 --> 01:56:34,317
Thank you. I will use them carefully.

776
01:57:04,034 --> 01:57:05,696
That`s great!

777
01:57:18,993 --> 01:57:20,377
Come.

778
01:57:28,690 --> 01:57:30,352
Put it inside me.

779
01:57:58,451 --> 01:58:00,238
It's wonderful.

780
01:58:16,695 --> 01:58:19,132
Are you sure about this?

781
01:58:20,757 --> 01:58:22,300
It`s alright.

782
01:58:23,114 --> 01:58:25,145
Leave it to your brother...

783
01:58:32,215 --> 01:58:34,165
I`m already like this.

784
01:58:58,748 --> 01:59:00,250
Right here...

785
01:59:14,391 --> 01:59:17,153
You can come inside...

786
01:59:30,685 --> 01:59:35,284
Come in deeper. Deeper...

787
01:59:43,459 --> 01:59:45,663
I might break you, brother.

788
01:59:46,729 --> 01:59:51,823
I`m fine. I beg you, deeper...

789
01:59:58,782 --> 02:00:00,582
Deeper, please!

790
02:00:16,787 --> 02:00:18,347
I came...

791
02:05:50,206 --> 02:05:51,486
Brother?

792
02:06:09,572 --> 02:06:10,908
Minami!

793
02:06:40,605 --> 02:06:41,860
Brother...

794
02:06:42,914 --> 02:06:44,250
Brother?

795
02:07:02,239 --> 02:07:04,329
The woman became normal again
when we put her in hot water.

796
02:07:36,886 --> 02:07:42,875
I am sorry.

797
02:07:42,875 --> 02:07:51,861
Uncle, here is the milk.

798
02:07:51,862 --> 02:08:00,848
Father doesn't let me out.

799
02:08:00,848 --> 02:08:12,827
But it's all non-sense.

800
02:08:12,831 --> 02:08:21,817
Please read this letter.

801
02:08:36,915 --> 02:08:42,783
What did you know?

802
02:08:57,884 --> 02:09:03,873
Who did you meet?

803
02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:33,829
Uncle...
