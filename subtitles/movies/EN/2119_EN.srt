1
00:01:35,912 --> 00:01:37,470
It's late.

2
00:01:38,448 --> 00:01:40,348
I'll just finish this reel...

3
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,254
- Shall I close it?
- Yes.

4
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:53,586
THE THREE WISHES

5
00:02:58,694 --> 00:03:01,356
If the shuttle was included,
why did you say no?

6
00:03:04,033 --> 00:03:05,660
Are you tired?

7
00:03:06,836 --> 00:03:10,294
So why did you stay up so long?

8
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,568
It's very nice.

9
00:04:20,776 --> 00:04:23,267
Yes, better than I'd expected.

10
00:04:35,324 --> 00:04:37,656
Actually, I love it.

11
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:09,415
Breakfast from 7 to 10,
lunch from 12 to 2.

12
00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:13,425
Walking tour 3 p.m.,
City tour 10, 12, 2 o'clock...

13
00:05:14,263 --> 00:05:17,926
Tea 5 to 7, dinner 8 to 11.

14
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:36,277
Hurry up with that stuff
or we'll miss lunch.

15
00:05:58,407 --> 00:05:59,704
Excuse me.

16
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,510
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

17
00:06:25,735 --> 00:06:29,000
- Fancy a walk?
- OK, let's go.

18
00:06:42,551 --> 00:06:44,883
Hats, wraparounds,

19
00:06:45,955 --> 00:06:48,321
hats... Hello there.

20
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,017
- How are things?
- Fine.

21
00:06:52,361 --> 00:06:54,886
Hats, wraparounds, would you like
to see anything?

22
00:06:55,398 --> 00:06:57,889
- Yes, this one?
- Yes, certainly.

23
00:07:02,371 --> 00:07:04,601
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

24
00:07:05,608 --> 00:07:07,508
It's lovely...

25
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,577
And this one?

26
00:07:18,487 --> 00:07:21,320
That really suits you, madam.
Will you take it?

27
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:20,581
You ought to know...

28
00:08:22,284 --> 00:08:24,775
that I don't make love
to older women.

29
00:08:33,662 --> 00:08:35,186
It's a joke...

30
00:08:43,472 --> 00:08:45,940
That really suits you, madam.
Will you take it?

31
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,769
That's enough.

32
00:09:14,904 --> 00:09:19,500
<i>If I decide to commit suicide,
it'll be on a beach at night...</i>

33
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:21,876
<i>or during the day, I don't know.</i>

34
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,177
During the day...

35
00:09:27,283 --> 00:09:30,775
I'd lie down in the sun, face up,

36
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,588
nice and quiet...

37
00:09:38,527 --> 00:09:40,961
But a woman would appear
to rescue you...

38
00:09:43,632 --> 00:09:45,566
I don't think so...

39
00:09:47,436 --> 00:09:48,835
I don't think so...

40
00:09:59,782 --> 00:10:01,215
Enough.

41
00:10:14,663 --> 00:10:16,324
Will you shut up?

42
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,906
Stop it, Victoria...

43
00:10:34,516 --> 00:10:37,644
- Stop it!
- What's up, Pablo? What's wrong?

44
00:10:38,954 --> 00:10:40,888
- I'm feeling dizzy.
- Ah, yes?

45
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,650
Yes.

46
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,724
Well, just say:
"Vicky, I'm feeling dizzy",

47
00:10:46,996 --> 00:10:49,328
but don't shout at me...

48
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,867
Have you gone crazy?

49
00:10:53,469 --> 00:10:56,063
Answer me, Pablo, have you gone mad?

50
00:10:59,608 --> 00:11:01,269
Pablo...

51
00:13:41,804 --> 00:13:43,738
Agustina, how are you?

52
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,966
Are you well?

53
00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:52,310
I'm really pleased.

54
00:13:53,882 --> 00:13:55,543
Yes...

55
00:13:58,654 --> 00:14:00,281
Very well...

56
00:14:03,826 --> 00:14:05,453
Alright...

57
00:14:07,996 --> 00:14:11,659
No, mum's at the coast and...

58
00:14:12,734 --> 00:14:15,430
I'm looking at some paintings
somewhere...

59
00:14:17,005 --> 00:14:21,271
Yes, of course, certainly...

60
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,283
Look, I'll call you back
in a while, OK?

61
00:14:32,354 --> 00:14:35,414
A big kiss to you,
a big kiss.

62
00:14:36,758 --> 00:14:38,885
I love you too.

63
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,589
Bye.

64
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,589
Ana?

65
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,634
Hello.

66
00:17:02,537 --> 00:17:04,368
What are you doing here?

67
00:17:05,641 --> 00:17:07,575
What are you doing here?

68
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,561
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.

69
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,502
So... what are you doing here?

70
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,752
I'm spending a few days meditating...

71
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:57,882
In fact...

72
00:17:57,959 --> 00:17:59,893
I left my husband yesterday.

73
00:18:00,028 --> 00:18:02,588
I was married for almost ten years.

74
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:06,734
And after giving it lots of thought
I made the decision...

75
00:18:06,802 --> 00:18:08,463
and here I am...

76
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,470
You separated yesterday?

77
00:18:12,774 --> 00:18:14,401
Yes.

78
00:18:17,245 --> 00:18:18,837
But why?

79
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,544
I don't know.

80
00:18:23,552 --> 00:18:26,248
We need to stop and think...
sometimes.

81
00:18:27,889 --> 00:18:31,723
Like when you wake up one morning
and something's bugging you...

82
00:18:31,927 --> 00:18:34,794
and that something is your partner.

83
00:18:34,963 --> 00:18:37,761
That's when you need
to stop and think...

84
00:18:42,337 --> 00:18:44,703
The tide's coming in,
shall we move back?

85
00:18:48,744 --> 00:18:51,736
A friend once said something
very wise.

86
00:18:52,347 --> 00:18:54,941
She compared Diego, her partner,

87
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,946
to Nacho,
a guy she'd met somewhere...

88
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:01,284
We shouldn't compare, but in this
case it's valid...

89
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,551
She said:

90
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:06,557
- Diego's fallen asleep in the armchair.
- Here?

91
00:19:06,628 --> 00:19:08,823
Yes... She thought:

92
00:19:09,765 --> 00:19:12,757
That idiot Diego's
fallen asleep in the armchair again.

93
00:19:13,268 --> 00:19:17,227
But then Nacho falls asleep in the
same armchair,

94
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:21,740
and she thinks: How cute Nacho looks
asleep in the armchair...

95
00:19:21,877 --> 00:19:23,538
That's how it is.

96
00:19:25,514 --> 00:19:30,451
Perhaps your friend was a bore and
the guys just fell asleep.

97
00:19:30,886 --> 00:19:35,653
No. I'm not saying it's always
the way but...

98
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,655
some partners are for life
but others aren't.

99
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:41,929
We just need to realize in time.

100
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,467
Well, perhaps you realized in time.

101
00:19:47,803 --> 00:19:50,271
I don't know. I'm not sure...

102
00:19:50,372 --> 00:19:51,964
- No?
- No...

103
00:19:54,543 --> 00:19:57,603
- Are you married?
- Yes.

104
00:19:59,514 --> 00:20:02,347
Actually my wife will be waiting
for me in the hotel.

105
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:06,285
Really? Go back, then.
She must be worried.

106
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,854
I don't think so...

107
00:20:08,323 --> 00:20:11,486
- No?
- No...

108
00:20:14,663 --> 00:20:17,564
- Have you got kids?
- No.

109
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:21,833
- Sorry, I was curious.
- That's fine. I didn't want kids.

110
00:20:22,571 --> 00:20:24,300
Why?

111
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,501
Because...

112
00:20:27,676 --> 00:20:29,769
I'll tell you in a minute.
Do you know what?

113
00:20:30,612 --> 00:20:33,445
I left my phone in the bar
where I had lunch...

114
00:20:33,715 --> 00:20:36,445
It's near here. Can I ask you
to watch my stuff,

115
00:20:36,518 --> 00:20:38,509
- and I'll be back in five minutes...
- I'll go with you.

116
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,888
There's no need. I'll leave my bag
with you and I'll be right back.

117
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:45,323
- I want to go with you.
- I'll leave my things here.

118
00:20:45,594 --> 00:20:47,619
- And if you don't come back?
- I'll be back.

119
00:20:47,762 --> 00:20:49,457
I'm coming with you.

120
00:20:53,068 --> 00:20:55,730
It's not like I didn't want kids.

121
00:20:56,438 --> 00:21:01,637
At first I just wanted to enjoy
being with my partner.

122
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,742
Then I started working hard...

123
00:21:06,414 --> 00:21:08,882
and couldn't find the right time.

124
00:21:09,451 --> 00:21:13,478
Then when I stopped
looking for excuses,

125
00:21:13,989 --> 00:21:18,426
I realized I couldn't imagine Juan
as the father of my kids.

126
00:21:19,461 --> 00:21:22,453
It's strange because I reckon
he'd be an excellent father,

127
00:21:23,465 --> 00:21:25,695
but I just didn't want
kids with him.

128
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,634
And in that process
you went through,

129
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:34,638
did you imagine any particular
father for your children?

130
00:21:39,014 --> 00:21:40,743
- No.
- No?

131
00:21:41,716 --> 00:21:43,581
But I should start trying
to imagine it,

132
00:21:43,685 --> 00:21:47,451
because I don't have so many years
left for existential matters...

133
00:21:47,956 --> 00:21:52,723
You do... four, five...

134
00:22:00,368 --> 00:22:02,393
- And you?
- What?

135
00:22:03,338 --> 00:22:04,828
Have you got kids?

136
00:22:05,974 --> 00:22:07,601
One daughter...

137
00:22:07,976 --> 00:22:10,638
How odd.
I could never see you as a father.

138
00:22:13,982 --> 00:22:17,782
- What's he playing?
- I don't know...

139
00:22:48,883 --> 00:22:50,817
Shall we go?

140
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,559
So why could you never see me
as a father?

141
00:23:03,865 --> 00:23:05,560
I don't know.

142
00:23:07,602 --> 00:23:10,594
- How old is she?
- Six.

143
00:23:11,006 --> 00:23:15,409
Agustina's her name. She's staying
with her grandparents...

144
00:23:15,577 --> 00:23:17,568
Are you happy with your wife?

145
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:26,853
Am I happy with my wife?

146
00:23:42,837 --> 00:23:44,634
- I don't know.
- No?

147
00:23:44,739 --> 00:23:47,503
No, no.

148
00:23:49,544 --> 00:23:52,809
We've been together for a long time,
and have many things in common...

149
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,513
But I don't know...

150
00:24:00,288 --> 00:24:04,349
When I wake up in the morning and
see her beside me in bed,

151
00:24:05,393 --> 00:24:09,796
I'm neither happy nor sad...

152
00:24:09,898 --> 00:24:11,627
You haven't answered my question.

153
00:24:27,615 --> 00:24:31,415
Do you think there is a
precise moment in time...

154
00:24:31,686 --> 00:24:35,782
when you can say:
From now on...

155
00:24:36,491 --> 00:24:41,360
I don't love that woman and I don't
enjoy doing what I used to with her.

156
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:43,790
I don't think so.

157
00:24:43,898 --> 00:24:48,801
I don't mean a precise moment
of infidelity.

158
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,861
No, it's a bit like what
you were just saying.

159
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,905
Life follows its course,

160
00:24:57,779 --> 00:24:59,007
and one day you realize...

161
00:24:59,547 --> 00:25:04,348
that what you liked
about the woman you loved,

162
00:25:05,553 --> 00:25:09,182
are the things that most annoy you
or bother you...

163
00:25:13,461 --> 00:25:14,894
Shall we go on?

164
00:25:17,332 --> 00:25:20,893
It's a little like what happens
with your eyesight.

165
00:25:21,002 --> 00:25:24,768
It hasn't happened to me but people
say that one day you begin...

166
00:25:24,939 --> 00:25:28,306
to lose your eyesight, right?

167
00:25:28,943 --> 00:25:33,676
They say that happens
at a precise moment in time.

168
00:25:33,848 --> 00:25:37,944
You go to a restaurant,
they give you a menu,

169
00:25:39,687 --> 00:25:43,589
but you have to move it around
in order to see it properly, right?

170
00:25:43,658 --> 00:25:46,252
If somebody could tell you when...

171
00:25:46,361 --> 00:25:49,330
I'm serious. What's so funny?

172
00:25:50,265 --> 00:25:51,857
It's...

173
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:54,961
I'm laughing because I've just
remembered something daft,

174
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:58,431
- shall I tell you?
- OK.

175
00:25:59,741 --> 00:26:04,235
Not long ago my ex started wearing
glasses but couldn't accept it.

176
00:26:04,345 --> 00:26:08,714
So I could be sitting at home
reading or something,

177
00:26:09,384 --> 00:26:13,411
and I'd hear in the background:
"Where the hell did I leave my glasses?"

178
00:26:13,521 --> 00:26:17,480
It was his sort of stock phrase...

179
00:26:18,293 --> 00:26:20,955
I'll be there soon... honest.

180
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:28,767
Go on, I interrupted you.
What were you saying?

181
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:31,999
Where was I?

182
00:26:32,774 --> 00:26:34,708
Oh, yes.

183
00:26:35,944 --> 00:26:39,812
We all think that at one magical
moment you'll fall in love,

184
00:26:39,948 --> 00:26:42,883
and you'll want to spend all
your life with that person.

185
00:26:43,051 --> 00:26:46,487
What I wanted to know was:

186
00:26:46,588 --> 00:26:48,647
Is there also an exact moment...

187
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:53,224
when that stops for ever?

188
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,833
It's as if...

189
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,731
the relationship crashes,
or you crash...

190
00:27:06,674 --> 00:27:08,801
Like a crash... let me think
about that...

191
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:12,641
Alright, a crash,
but my question is:

192
00:27:14,315 --> 00:27:18,411
Do you crash one day and find that
everything bugs you about them,

193
00:27:18,786 --> 00:27:23,917
or do you crash the day you realize
there are many things that bug you?

194
00:27:25,326 --> 00:27:27,692
- It's very complicated.
- It is.

195
00:27:27,795 --> 00:27:29,524
This is it.

196
00:27:31,633 --> 00:27:34,625
- Will you wait?
- Of course.

197
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,500
I'll be right back.

198
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,169
That's lucky.
You weren't very hopeful.

199
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,225
I was...

200
00:28:34,495 --> 00:28:36,326
OK, where were we?

201
00:28:37,598 --> 00:28:40,624
According to you we were
busy crashing.

202
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,701
You could also ask yourself,

203
00:28:46,374 --> 00:28:49,775
not only if it's a process or if
there's a moment of rupture,

204
00:28:49,877 --> 00:28:51,902
but you could also ask...

205
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:54,808
if you were ever really happy
with that person,

206
00:28:54,949 --> 00:28:58,783
or if life simply brought
you together. Don't you think?

207
00:28:59,454 --> 00:29:03,220
- Yes, that's different, isn't it?
- Yes...

208
00:29:03,858 --> 00:29:05,792
but doesn't it scare you
to think it?

209
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:17,337
I don't know... I don't know...

210
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:25,470
The fact is I don't stop
to think very often.

211
00:29:25,546 --> 00:29:27,605
I don't have the time...

212
00:29:29,884 --> 00:29:32,853
Life is what happens and
I get carried along...

213
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:38,518
At times I feel very tired...

214
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,825
You're in a bad way...

215
00:29:47,802 --> 00:29:51,898
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

216
00:30:00,314 --> 00:30:02,680
I'd imagined so many chance meetings
with you,

217
00:30:03,651 --> 00:30:06,449
but never like this.

218
00:30:07,655 --> 00:30:09,816
How then?
With you swearing a lot at me?

219
00:30:10,591 --> 00:30:12,252
Yes, a lot.

220
00:30:15,863 --> 00:30:17,728
This is a short cut...

221
00:30:19,367 --> 00:30:21,392
- I dreamt about you several times...
- Oh, yes?

222
00:30:21,502 --> 00:30:23,265
Yes, several...

223
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:28,339
In one particular dream...
shall I tell you?

224
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:29,671
Go on.

225
00:30:30,978 --> 00:30:35,642
I was trying to contact you
by phone,

226
00:30:37,652 --> 00:30:42,419
and as I dialed your number
the phone disintegrated.

227
00:30:43,491 --> 00:30:47,757
And there was an elderly woman
helping me,

228
00:30:47,862 --> 00:30:51,628
by bringing the missing keys
I needed to dial your number.

229
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,560
But I still couldn't contact you...

230
00:30:56,737 --> 00:30:59,433
It's amazing what happens in dreams,

231
00:30:59,907 --> 00:31:02,467
like when you dream about
somebody who's dead,

232
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:06,374
but it's so real that you wake up
thinking they're still alive.

233
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:10,642
I used to dream about you too.

234
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:16,714
They were sort of weird
recurring dreams,

235
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:23,363
but they always ended in the
same maze with glass walls,

236
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:29,666
and I'd try to touch you or
cry out to you,

237
00:31:30,872 --> 00:31:32,772
but my voice wouldn't come.

238
00:32:06,908 --> 00:32:10,844
- I'm going for a swim.
- It's cold.

239
00:32:11,479 --> 00:32:13,379
No, it's not.

240
00:32:13,948 --> 00:32:15,643
I'll come with you then.

241
00:32:16,617 --> 00:32:18,278
OK.

242
00:32:50,851 --> 00:32:53,479
- You're still the same...
- Don't you believe it.

243
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:56,887
After you fucked things up for me,
I changed... a lot...

244
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:59,818
- So that's for me?
- Yes.

245
00:33:04,999 --> 00:33:06,933
Stop it, put me down...

246
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:12,532
- Didn't you want a swim?
- You go in first.

247
00:33:12,773 --> 00:33:14,798
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

248
00:33:15,876 --> 00:33:18,606
- Lf I freeze it's your fault.
- Alright.

249
00:33:19,647 --> 00:33:21,205
Go on in.

250
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:29,781
- You're so beautiful...
- And 12 years older.

251
00:33:34,562 --> 00:33:37,258
You're much more beautiful
now, really...

252
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:42,459
You have a magical quality, unreal.

253
00:33:43,904 --> 00:33:45,929
Because I'm like an apparition
here on the beach.

254
00:33:46,007 --> 00:33:48,032
No, I mean it.

255
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:52,911
You have an expression I'd never seen
before. I love looking at you...

256
00:33:55,383 --> 00:33:58,614
Whenever I thought of you
I used to spit poison.

257
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,685
- Ana?
- What?

258
00:34:04,992 --> 00:34:07,825
- I have to go.
- What?

259
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:11,557
I have to go. I love being here with you
but I have to go, really.

260
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:17,828
- But we can meet tomorrow.
- No, don't bother.

261
00:34:17,905 --> 00:34:19,338
- No, we can meet.
- It's OK, no problem. Don't worry.

262
00:34:19,407 --> 00:34:21,841
- Pablo, go away, it's alright.
- Listen...

263
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:23,743
- Listen, listen...
- Just go.

264
00:34:23,778 --> 00:34:25,336
- Everything's OK, Pablo. No problem.
- Listen.

265
00:34:25,413 --> 00:34:29,907
I want to see you tomorrow, please.

266
00:34:33,487 --> 00:34:36,684
Here on the beach at five o'clock?

267
00:34:41,062 --> 00:34:43,360
- Yes?
- Yes.

268
00:34:48,936 --> 00:34:50,870
Tomorrow at five, here?

269
00:34:53,607 --> 00:34:55,404
I'll be waiting.

270
00:36:03,344 --> 00:36:05,676
I ordered a bottle
of well chilled white wine,

271
00:36:05,846 --> 00:36:09,543
but you brought a bottle which was
practically warm. So listen to me,

272
00:36:10,618 --> 00:36:14,679
bring me a very cold bottle with a
bucket of ice, if you'd be so kind?

273
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,586
- Yes.
- Thank you very much.

274
00:36:17,691 --> 00:36:21,752
Haven't you seen all the tables she has
to wait on? It's not her fault.

275
00:36:23,464 --> 00:36:25,591
It's not my fault though, is it?

276
00:36:27,535 --> 00:36:30,698
You don't drink white wine anyway
so keep out of this.

277
00:36:33,641 --> 00:36:36,838
So you could have ordered
something for both of us.

278
00:36:37,011 --> 00:36:39,809
Victoria, did I or didn't I ask you
what you wanted to drink?

279
00:36:39,914 --> 00:36:43,748
Yes, you asked me but you'd
already ordered the white wine.

280
00:36:47,922 --> 00:36:52,382
What's up with you? You went crazy on
the beach, you were rude to me,

281
00:36:52,626 --> 00:36:54,685
and you get upset because I'm drinking
white wine. What's wrong?

282
00:36:54,862 --> 00:36:56,830
You were the one
who got angry and left the beach.

283
00:36:57,531 --> 00:36:59,431
You insulted me.

284
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,469
- Lower your voice.
- You insulted me, Victoria.

285
00:37:03,637 --> 00:37:07,368
My wife thinks I can't have white wine
so forget it. What do you want?

286
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:10,444
Nothing, nothing at all.
The white's fine, leave it.

287
00:37:10,511 --> 00:37:11,842
Take it away...

288
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,304
Leave it... leave it.

289
00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:21,588
Did you have to tell the waitress
what bothers me and what doesn't?

290
00:37:24,558 --> 00:37:27,493
Look, if I have to go through all that,

291
00:37:27,595 --> 00:37:30,257
we'd be here for hours, Victoria.

292
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:39,897
I'm going to bed.

293
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,741
Congratulations.

294
00:37:46,981 --> 00:37:50,417
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

295
00:37:50,918 --> 00:37:53,386
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

296
00:37:54,388 --> 00:37:55,719
That's very kind.

297
00:38:00,828 --> 00:38:02,386
Hello?

298
00:38:02,997 --> 00:38:04,931
Hello, love. How are you?

299
00:38:07,334 --> 00:38:09,302
Thank you so much.

300
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:13,439
You're up very late.
Go on, off to bed with you.

301
00:38:13,941 --> 00:38:15,875
Yes, darling, we'll talk tomorrow...

302
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:18,205
Go on then. No, don't put her on.

303
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,941
Me too, darling. A big kiss.

304
00:38:22,783 --> 00:38:25,980
Hello? Thank you very much.

305
00:38:26,954 --> 00:38:28,751
Are you coping OK with Agus?

306
00:38:31,725 --> 00:38:33,420
Yes, lovely...

307
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:35,919
Great...

308
00:38:36,463 --> 00:38:38,454
It's lovely, it really is.

309
00:38:38,732 --> 00:38:41,462
Yes, lots of love. Bye.

310
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,834
Blow...

311
00:39:09,296 --> 00:39:10,957
Happy birthday, Victoria.

312
00:41:27,601 --> 00:41:28,932
Hang on...

313
00:41:34,675 --> 00:41:36,609
Let me close the door...

314
00:41:41,482 --> 00:41:44,542
- I don't know if I can walk.
- Yes, you can.

315
00:41:45,385 --> 00:41:47,546
We'll just go over to the bed.

316
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,411
We'll be thrown out.

317
00:42:15,015 --> 00:42:19,714
- What's this?
- Balloons, did you bring them?

318
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,983
- No.
- No? Champagne.

319
00:42:25,759 --> 00:42:28,956
- Hang on.
- They're lovely!

320
00:42:39,506 --> 00:42:42,236
- Give me another one.
- No, here, give it to me.

321
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:09,769
Cheers, happy birthday
and may you be very happy.

322
00:43:23,717 --> 00:43:25,582
I haven't got an ashtray.

323
00:43:40,601 --> 00:43:42,967
- Want some?
- Yeah...

324
00:43:43,937 --> 00:43:46,963
- Are you sure?
- Very.

325
00:44:11,965 --> 00:44:13,728
This is for me.

326
00:44:17,371 --> 00:44:19,931
- Want some?
- No, no more.

327
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:21,931
- Want a little?
- I don't want any more.

328
00:44:22,276 --> 00:44:24,005
Have some with me.

329
00:44:32,486 --> 00:44:33,919
I want some more.

330
00:49:44,698 --> 00:49:47,258
Pass me your glass

331
00:49:47,334 --> 00:49:50,303
Stop it.

332
00:49:50,837 --> 00:49:53,431
- Let's drink to that!
- To life!

333
00:49:53,506 --> 00:49:55,633
- To life as single girls!
- What?

334
00:49:55,942 --> 00:49:57,842
I'd die if I wasn't able to be with a
guy just once a week.

335
00:49:57,944 --> 00:49:59,844
Is that why you raped your ex?

336
00:49:59,946 --> 00:50:02,744
You're great! You really make me feel
much better.

337
00:50:02,816 --> 00:50:05,842
I had a date the other day,
but the guy stood me up.

338
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:10,256
I was looking gorgeous when Carlos
turned up to leave the kids.

339
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:13,882
Well, we put them to bed
and things took their course...

340
00:50:15,662 --> 00:50:17,527
Give me that...

341
00:54:52,739 --> 00:54:54,604
And again...

342
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:19,555
You did quite well even at forty...
really well.

343
00:55:41,621 --> 00:55:42,883
Stop it!

344
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:46,258
Stop it! What are you doing?

345
00:55:50,697 --> 00:55:54,531
One, two, three, four, up!

346
00:55:54,634 --> 00:55:58,297
One, two, three, four, both arms!

347
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:01,464
One, two, three, four, to the side!

348
00:56:01,541 --> 00:56:05,170
One, two, three, four, both arms!

349
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:08,645
One, two, three, four, and turn!

350
00:56:08,781 --> 00:56:10,578
One, two, three, four.

351
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:58,956
You knew we'd lost each other...

352
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:02,251
- Victoria, I'm talking to you.
- I'm listening, Pablo.

353
00:58:02,428 --> 00:58:05,363
You knew we'd lost each other,
so why didn't you answer the phone?

354
00:58:05,865 --> 00:58:08,698
- We hadn't lost each other.
- We'd lost each other.

355
00:58:08,768 --> 00:58:12,534
I stopped to look at some stuff and when
I got to the corner you'd gone.

356
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:16,375
And you knew we had to return
the bikes, didn't you?

357
00:58:16,509 --> 00:58:19,501
I came to the hotel to return mine
and thought you'd do the same.

358
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:22,737
But you should have been
more alert, Victoria.

359
00:58:22,849 --> 00:58:24,373
Alright, I'm sorry.

360
00:58:25,518 --> 00:58:27,748
I thought you'd forgotten the time
once again.

361
00:58:33,893 --> 00:58:36,225
That's Julián coming in over there.

362
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:43,200
- I thought he'd look different.
- Really? What like?

363
00:58:43,369 --> 00:58:44,927
I don't know, just different.

364
00:58:46,539 --> 00:58:48,268
Are you going to say hello?

365
00:58:50,643 --> 00:58:52,508
I don't think so...

366
00:59:02,655 --> 00:59:04,145
Vicky!

367
00:59:04,557 --> 00:59:06,184
Hello, Julián!

368
00:59:06,259 --> 00:59:08,420
I can't believe it...
You haven't changed a bit.

369
00:59:08,528 --> 00:59:11,691
No! I've changed.
Time passes and isn't very kind...

370
00:59:11,831 --> 00:59:13,230
- Are you talking about me?
- Not at all.

371
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:14,891
- You're not very kind.
- No, you look good.

372
00:59:15,568 --> 00:59:17,433
- It's been ages!
- Hasn't it!

373
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:20,300
Let me introduce my husband.
Pablo, Julián. Julián, Pablo.

374
00:59:20,406 --> 00:59:21,566
- Hello, pleased to meet you.
- How do you do?

375
00:59:21,674 --> 00:59:24,336
- Congratulations on the lovely hotel.
- Yes, it's beautiful.

376
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:26,571
- Are you having a good time?
- Great.

377
00:59:27,013 --> 00:59:28,810
- Did you see the show last night?
- Yes.

378
00:59:28,881 --> 00:59:30,381
Yes, it was lovely.

379
00:59:30,416 --> 00:59:33,283
Are you staying for the release of
balloons on the beach tonight?

380
00:59:33,352 --> 00:59:37,288
- No, we have to be at the port at 10.
- What a shame! It's great!

381
00:59:37,356 --> 00:59:38,389
- Really?
- Yes...

382
00:59:38,424 --> 00:59:39,982
- What are you drinking? Coffee?
- Yes.

383
00:59:40,293 --> 00:59:44,229
Let me invite you to try some vodkas.
It's our speciality.

384
00:59:44,363 --> 00:59:45,853
- No, no, that's fine.
- I'll be right back!

385
00:59:49,368 --> 00:59:52,860
- Hadn't you decided not to say hello?
- He said hello to me.

386
00:59:54,407 --> 00:59:56,932
Drinking vodka at this time in the
afternoon is absurd.

387
00:59:57,009 --> 01:00:00,308
- So what do you want me to do?
- Keep it short because I want to go.

388
01:00:03,382 --> 01:00:06,545
A few months ago, Alejandra Méndez
told me you'd opened this hotel.

389
01:00:06,619 --> 01:00:09,884
- Do you remember Alejandra?
- Yes, she was here for a few days.

390
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:12,821
So when Pablo invited me to Colonia
and I saw the hotel leaflet,

391
01:00:12,892 --> 01:00:15,759
- I guessed it was yours.
- Sorry, when did you arrive?

392
01:00:16,062 --> 01:00:17,222
- Yesterday?
- Yesterday.

393
01:00:17,296 --> 01:00:19,628
Yesterday? And you were
going to leave without saying hello?

394
01:00:19,732 --> 01:00:22,792
No, I didn't want to bother you...
If I happened to see you, fine...

395
01:00:22,902 --> 01:00:25,700
So, if you happened to see me...
Thanks.

396
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:31,876
Pablo, start with this cherry-flavoured
one. It's not too strong.

397
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:36,713
Vicky, this one's made from wheat,
it's smoother.

398
01:00:38,017 --> 01:00:39,507
And this one's for me.

399
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:46,347
Do you live here?

400
01:00:46,459 --> 01:00:49,758
My house is three blocks away, but I
spend most of the day in the hotel.

401
01:00:49,829 --> 01:00:51,387
Except Mondays, which is my day off.

402
01:00:51,497 --> 01:00:54,728
I escape from the world
and go fishing all day.

403
01:00:54,834 --> 01:00:56,028
Wonderful!

404
01:00:56,636 --> 01:00:59,935
- Do you like fishing?
- No, I don't actually...

405
01:01:01,974 --> 01:01:05,671
Tell me about yourself. How's life
treated you? How's the singing?

406
01:01:06,345 --> 01:01:08,939
- No. Totally forgotten.
- I don't believe it, Vicky.

407
01:01:09,015 --> 01:01:10,710
You were going to be
the famous one in the class.

408
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:13,883
- No, I took up design...
- Good!

409
01:01:13,986 --> 01:01:16,511
Actually she copies designs
from old films.

410
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:19,383
I get my inspiration from old films.

411
01:01:19,458 --> 01:01:21,449
- Do you have a brand name?
- No, not yet.

412
01:01:21,661 --> 01:01:25,495
- Look, I designed this T-shirt.
- Really? What is it? Let's see.

413
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:27,258
- Do you like it?
- I love it.

414
01:01:27,333 --> 01:01:30,359
- And what went wrong here?
- You're wicked, Vicky.

415
01:01:30,469 --> 01:01:31,936
You used to have beautiful curls.

416
01:01:33,406 --> 01:01:37,274
- Well, I'll be 40 in a few months.
- Yes, you were one of the youngest.

417
01:01:37,376 --> 01:01:40,812
Right... And your birthday's...
don't tell me...

418
01:01:42,815 --> 01:01:45,909
- 9th March.
- The 10th. You were close.

419
01:01:46,052 --> 01:01:49,021
That's today, Vicky...
But Miss Fernández Carrizo...

420
01:01:49,855 --> 01:01:54,019
Happy birthday! What an honour
that you're celebrating it here!

421
01:01:54,327 --> 01:01:55,760
Thanks. Fernández Carrizo?

422
01:01:55,828 --> 01:01:59,696
I'd forgotten I used to be Carrizo.
I'm only Fernández now.

423
01:01:59,765 --> 01:02:03,360
I can recite the whole register:
Agostini, Belardi, Cáceres,

424
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:06,836
Caseros, Cohen, Epstein,
Fernández Carrizo...

425
01:02:07,773 --> 01:02:12,710
Let's drink to that...
Pablo, Vicky.

426
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:17,783
- Many happy returns.
- Thanks.

427
01:02:20,886 --> 01:02:25,789
- Matienzo 2571.
- No, that's too much.

428
01:02:25,858 --> 01:02:29,462
- I can't believe you remember that.
- As if I could forget.

429
01:02:29,497 --> 01:02:32,226
We used to have all our parties
at her place...

430
01:02:32,331 --> 01:02:35,630
Your parents were angels. I don't know
what they're like as in-laws...

431
01:02:35,701 --> 01:02:38,864
- I can't complain.
- Do they still have that house?

432
01:02:39,438 --> 01:02:42,740
No, they sold it. It was demolished
a few years ago,

433
01:02:42,775 --> 01:02:45,801
and they built a hideous tower block
with a swimming pool.

434
01:02:46,045 --> 01:02:49,674
- What a shame! How old was it?
- It must've been built in 1920...

435
01:02:49,782 --> 01:02:53,486
Pablo, sorry, you can't smoke here.
You're not angry, are you?

436
01:02:53,521 --> 01:02:55,852
No, not at all. Come on.

437
01:02:56,322 --> 01:03:00,258
I remember the patio, the lights,
the ombú tree...

438
01:03:00,826 --> 01:03:03,818
By that ombú I told
Adriana Barrios I loved her,

439
01:03:03,929 --> 01:03:06,420
on your 13th or 14th.

440
01:03:06,732 --> 01:03:10,668
Then we had the 5th year party to raise
money for the Bariloche trip.

441
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:12,937
How could I forget?

442
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:15,633
"Invite your mates and get them
to invite their mates..."

443
01:03:16,409 --> 01:03:18,434
And as a result, they burnt
the armchairs with cigarettes,

444
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:20,409
and stole my dad's CD collection.

445
01:03:20,479 --> 01:03:24,677
- No, did CDs exist then?
- No, I suppose they were cassettes.

446
01:03:24,784 --> 01:03:27,344
Well, they stole some sort of music.
I got into deep shit!

447
01:03:27,753 --> 01:03:31,484
- Victoria, I'm going out for a smoke.
- No, let's go.

448
01:03:31,657 --> 01:03:34,854
No, stay and talk. I'll have a smoke
and I'll be back, OK?

449
01:03:43,402 --> 01:03:46,701
- How long have you been married?
- Eight years.

450
01:03:46,839 --> 01:03:48,466
Eight years?

451
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:53,807
- And you?
- What?

452
01:03:55,314 --> 01:03:58,545
- Are you in a relationship?
- Yes.

453
01:03:58,617 --> 01:04:01,245
- Yes? Tell me more...
- No, one question each.

454
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:04,380
- No.
- Yes, let's see.

455
01:04:09,628 --> 01:04:13,223
- Is it true you no longer sing?
- It's true.

456
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,630
And... is eight years a long time?

457
01:04:18,504 --> 01:04:20,233
That was two questions.
It's my turn.

458
01:04:20,306 --> 01:04:22,604
Hold it.
Leave your hand right there.

459
01:04:23,809 --> 01:04:28,303
This is Vicky's hand.
Her whole being is reflected there,

460
01:04:28,414 --> 01:04:32,851
her intelligence, her character,
her strength and weakness...

461
01:04:33,486 --> 01:04:34,817
Let go.

462
01:05:05,751 --> 01:05:07,582
Your coffee's getting cold.

463
01:05:09,555 --> 01:05:11,182
Do you want it?

464
01:05:11,790 --> 01:05:13,587
No, thanks.

465
01:05:52,665 --> 01:05:56,658
What was that film where Juliette
Binoche played with a sugar lump?

466
01:05:57,303 --> 01:05:58,668
I don't know.

467
01:06:02,474 --> 01:06:06,570
Yes, a film in which she was married
to a musician,

468
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:10,714
and they crashed the car into a tree...

469
01:06:12,284 --> 01:06:16,448
- And she was left completely alone.
- I don't remember.

470
01:06:17,923 --> 01:06:22,622
- But you really liked it.
- I don't remember.

471
01:06:25,764 --> 01:06:28,597
- You don't remember.
- I'm telling you I don't remember.

472
01:06:30,569 --> 01:06:33,470
Why didn't you take up cinema
if you're so fond of films...

473
01:06:33,539 --> 01:06:35,939
instead of copying trash all your life?

474
01:06:51,957 --> 01:06:53,788
Do you know what, Pablo?

475
01:06:59,365 --> 01:07:01,424
I'm a little tired.

476
01:07:26,258 --> 01:07:28,624
- Sorry, I didn't mean that.
- No...

477
01:07:28,827 --> 01:07:31,557
- Please don't leave.
- No, I want to go back to the hotel.

478
01:07:31,697 --> 01:07:33,980
- Stay.
- Leave me alone, let me go.

479
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:36,264
- Let's go to the bullring.
- No.

480
01:07:36,335 --> 01:07:39,304
- You wanted to go.
- No, I want to go back, I want a bath,

481
01:07:39,405 --> 01:07:41,430
to pack... and to have
some peace and quiet...

482
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:44,604
- I want to be alone for a while.
- No, listen, let's do this...

483
01:07:47,012 --> 01:07:51,676
Go to the room, have a bath,
get changed... look at me,

484
01:07:52,718 --> 01:07:55,482
and we meet at the bullring
in an hour.

485
01:07:57,690 --> 01:07:59,385
Alright?

486
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:09,927
Hey, forgive me, please.

487
01:08:13,405 --> 01:08:15,532
Do you forgive me?

488
01:08:16,442 --> 01:08:18,410
Sorry.

489
01:10:57,603 --> 01:11:02,404
You know what, Pablo?
I don't understand you.

490
01:11:03,775 --> 01:11:06,505
You wanted to meet,
so I came and waited.

491
01:11:06,612 --> 01:11:08,512
- I know, sorry.
- Honestly...

492
01:11:08,614 --> 01:11:09,911
I'm sorry.

493
01:11:11,783 --> 01:11:15,651
Shall we go back to the beach?
Yeah?

494
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:18,516
I'd rather have a coffee.

495
01:11:36,842 --> 01:11:39,538
What was your first night
of freedom like?

496
01:11:40,646 --> 01:11:41,806
- Very good.
- Good?

497
01:11:41,914 --> 01:11:43,643
Yes, very good.

498
01:11:43,949 --> 01:11:46,474
A party in the hotel, music, booze...

499
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:48,543
- Men, sex?
- No, if only...

500
01:11:48,654 --> 01:11:51,646
A night to remember. Right?

501
01:11:52,724 --> 01:11:56,751
What I will always remember will be
my first afternoon of freedom.

502
01:11:58,931 --> 01:12:00,455
Me too.

503
01:12:46,678 --> 01:12:48,339
Do you miss him?

504
01:12:53,385 --> 01:12:55,376
No, I don't think so.

505
01:12:56,521 --> 01:12:59,786
Perhaps I miss being with someone...

506
01:13:02,494 --> 01:13:05,258
Last night when I went down
to the party in the hotel alone,

507
01:13:05,864 --> 01:13:09,732
it was weird, neither good nor bad...

508
01:13:09,901 --> 01:13:11,801
Any regrets?

509
01:13:14,539 --> 01:13:17,940
Hello. I'll have an orange
and peach shake, please.

510
01:13:19,544 --> 01:13:23,310
- Didn't you want a coffee?
- They make good shakes here.

511
01:13:24,249 --> 01:13:25,739
Coffee for me.

512
01:13:29,521 --> 01:13:31,580
Regrets?

513
01:13:33,759 --> 01:13:37,627
No. It was very hard,

514
01:13:39,698 --> 01:13:41,393
I felt something here...

515
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:46,300
that grew and grew every day.

516
01:13:48,407 --> 01:13:50,807
- Poor guy, if he could hear you now...
- No...

517
01:13:52,644 --> 01:13:57,343
He's very sweet.
I was the one who couldn't cope...

518
01:14:00,619 --> 01:14:04,385
I know the feeling.

519
01:14:07,492 --> 01:14:09,926
Why, is your wife sweet too?

520
01:14:12,931 --> 01:14:14,558
Yes.

521
01:14:16,935 --> 01:14:18,869
Does that make you jealous?

522
01:14:20,906 --> 01:14:24,307
I don't like my ex-partners
falling in love with other women.

523
01:14:26,478 --> 01:14:28,446
Your ex-partners?

524
01:14:33,051 --> 01:14:34,951
Now that's interesting.

525
01:14:36,321 --> 01:14:39,381
- Do you have many?
- Are you jealous?

526
01:14:40,826 --> 01:14:42,555
Very.

527
01:14:44,963 --> 01:14:46,362
- So?
- What?

528
01:14:46,465 --> 01:14:48,933
- Many or a few?
- What difference does it make?

529
01:14:51,870 --> 01:14:54,668
None. I’m just curious.

530
01:15:16,394 --> 01:15:18,294
A few...

531
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:25,827
After you walked out, or left me...

532
01:15:26,304 --> 01:15:27,794
- or what shall we say?
- No problem.

533
01:15:27,906 --> 01:15:30,397
Don't tell me
if you don't want to no.

534
01:15:33,478 --> 01:15:36,606
- Alright, I won't.
- No problem.

535
01:15:44,956 --> 01:15:47,015
- You know something?
- What?

536
01:15:49,027 --> 01:15:52,485
- You're dying to tell me.
- You're dying to know.

537
01:16:02,874 --> 01:16:04,603
Thanks.

538
01:16:07,546 --> 01:16:10,606
No, I'll have it, thank you.

539
01:16:20,525 --> 01:16:23,187
It was hard for me
to go steady with a guy.

540
01:16:23,528 --> 01:16:26,258
It was as if in each relationship
I wanted to get one back on you.

541
01:16:34,573 --> 01:16:37,667
Do you know who I went out with
soon after you left me?

542
01:16:39,377 --> 01:16:40,844
No, who with?

543
01:16:43,815 --> 01:16:45,715
With Santiago.

544
01:16:47,953 --> 01:16:50,717
- Are you serious? With Santiago?
- Yes.

545
01:16:51,323 --> 01:16:52,847
Well, well...

546
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:58,456
Bastard.
He never said a word about it.

547
01:16:58,797 --> 01:17:00,856
I was very depressed.

548
01:17:03,935 --> 01:17:05,596
What happened?

549
01:17:06,338 --> 01:17:09,466
Nothing. After two months I'd had
enough. He was very stupid.

550
01:17:09,941 --> 01:17:12,705
I did it to spite you,
but you never found out, so...

551
01:17:12,777 --> 01:17:15,268
- He wasn't that stupid...
- He was a bore.

552
01:17:16,648 --> 01:17:19,674
Waiter, here's the money...

553
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:23,615
If you're in a hurry and have to go,
just go.

554
01:17:23,722 --> 01:17:27,249
I want to go back to the beach
for a little air...

555
01:18:05,797 --> 01:18:07,389
Shall we go?

556
01:18:17,676 --> 01:18:20,270
This is a sort of déjà vu.

557
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:50,974
How did you meet your ex?

558
01:18:53,411 --> 01:18:55,436
He was a teacher at the university.

559
01:18:56,715 --> 01:18:58,342
Did you continue at the faculty...

560
01:18:58,450 --> 01:19:00,748
Yes, I graduated, won awards...

561
01:19:02,887 --> 01:19:04,787
You missed out
on a very famous publicist.

562
01:19:04,856 --> 01:19:06,380
Really?

563
01:19:06,458 --> 01:19:10,588
No, not famous, but I'm doing OK...
can't complain...

564
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:14,196
You didn't think I'd go on, did you?

565
01:19:16,401 --> 01:19:17,891
Quite honestly...

566
01:19:18,336 --> 01:19:21,362
- No.
- I guessed...

567
01:19:21,906 --> 01:19:23,635
And you?

568
01:19:24,409 --> 01:19:27,776
I remember the party
your dad threw when you graduated...

569
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:30,542
You do? Me too.

570
01:19:33,718 --> 01:19:36,744
Poor guy, he had great hopes.

571
01:19:38,456 --> 01:19:41,823
He'd already imagined what and where
my first building would be,

572
01:19:42,761 --> 01:19:45,855
- how many floors it'd have...
- And...?

573
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:48,262
- I never practiced
- No?

574
01:19:48,433 --> 01:19:51,596
No, no, no.

575
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:56,670
The problem with my dad came then...
and I had to take charge of the factory,

576
01:19:56,775 --> 01:19:59,801
at first I thought it wouldn't be
for long but...

577
01:20:00,311 --> 01:20:01,801
I'm still there...

578
01:20:07,385 --> 01:20:10,786
I never thanked you
for coming over that day.

579
01:20:11,356 --> 01:20:13,722
I didn't do it for you...

580
01:20:19,030 --> 01:20:22,727
- Were you already seeing Santiago?
- No.

581
01:20:24,402 --> 01:20:26,996
Amazing, isn't it?
After those months with Santiago...

582
01:20:27,739 --> 01:20:30,867
I heard nothing more of you, as if the
earth had swallowed you up.

583
01:20:33,945 --> 01:20:38,678
Amazing because in two years
I didn't move or change my number...

584
01:20:39,451 --> 01:20:42,477
Well, in the street, a cinema...

585
01:20:42,887 --> 01:20:46,823
Don't you find there are people you
always meet and others never?

586
01:20:47,058 --> 01:20:49,526
Yeah, it happens.

587
01:20:49,627 --> 01:20:51,686
There are people
I never want to meet...

588
01:20:51,796 --> 01:20:54,356
and I see them all the time...

589
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,500
There's a supplier at the factory...

590
01:20:58,103 --> 01:20:59,627
Watch it!

591
01:21:00,972 --> 01:21:02,496
Hang on...

592
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:10,944
Do you still argue with people?

593
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:14,381
Why do you ask?

594
01:21:14,986 --> 01:21:19,650
You used to be... how can I say...

595
01:21:22,393 --> 01:21:24,418
temperamental...

596
01:21:25,463 --> 01:21:29,661
Over time the defects get better or
worse. They're never the same.

597
01:21:34,005 --> 01:21:37,338
- Your answer?
- What do you think?

598
01:21:37,408 --> 01:21:39,342
I don't think. I'm asking you.

599
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:51,318
So I was temperamental?

600
01:21:53,358 --> 01:21:54,848
And what were you like?

601
01:21:55,727 --> 01:21:57,695
Gorgeous.

602
01:21:58,963 --> 01:22:01,431
And what about now?

603
01:22:03,801 --> 01:22:05,462
What do you think?

604
01:22:10,909 --> 01:22:13,810
I used to like you, a lot,

605
01:22:16,781 --> 01:22:18,806
but now I really like you...

606
01:22:28,426 --> 01:22:31,884
- You owe me something from yesterday.
- What?

607
01:22:33,298 --> 01:22:37,462
- You left me swimming by myself.
- And that's why you won't kiss me?

608
01:22:39,270 --> 01:22:41,238
Let's go for a dip?
Are you coming for a swim?

609
01:22:41,306 --> 01:22:43,001
- No, let's stay here...
- Come on...

610
01:22:43,308 --> 01:22:46,766
No, let's stay here... please...

611
01:22:47,745 --> 01:22:50,509
- Why, do you have to leave?
- No, but let's stay here...

612
01:22:51,983 --> 01:22:54,008
Come for a swim.

613
01:23:00,792 --> 01:23:02,623
Coming?

614
01:23:06,397 --> 01:23:09,560
No, you go, I'll wait here, OK?

615
01:26:04,609 --> 01:26:06,270
Are you alright?

616
01:26:11,549 --> 01:26:12,880
You're OK, aren't you?

617
01:26:14,819 --> 01:26:16,286
Are you alone?

618
01:27:16,981 --> 01:27:18,710
Victoria!

619
01:27:21,385 --> 01:27:22,977
Victoria!

620
01:27:26,657 --> 01:27:28,522
Victoria!

621
01:27:33,264 --> 01:27:34,959
Victoria!

622
01:31:02,606 --> 01:31:04,699
We shouldn't have come.

623
01:31:08,512 --> 01:31:10,377
I think it was very important for us...

624
01:31:19,457 --> 01:31:22,688
Otherwise it would have taken us much
longer to make a decision.

625
01:31:32,503 --> 01:31:34,437
You're the one who's making it.

626
01:31:56,727 --> 01:31:58,524
