1
00:00:00,857 --> 00:00:03,917
To those who loved this world...

2
00:00:04,127 --> 00:00:06,925
...and knew friendly company therein:

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:12,033
This Reunion is for you.

4
00:01:28,144 --> 00:01:32,706
498 Years Earlier

5
00:01:35,906 --> 00:01:37,779
Why did humankind even bothered.

6
00:01:39,701 --> 00:01:41,907
You rack everything you've ever made, and start over.

7
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:46,396
Like there'll be any different after that.

8
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:54,226
I supposed we're not good at facing our memories,

9
00:01:54,957 --> 00:01:57,534
We'd rather kill the past .

10
00:01:57,944 --> 00:02:02,226
Find something worthwile among the rubble
and build the future with that.

11
00:02:03,406 --> 00:02:05,610
And that's the reason why you hide Mother?

12
00:02:06,771 --> 00:02:07,788
To kill the past?

13
00:02:10,685 --> 00:02:14,141
We were trying to rid ourselves
of a more immediate problem.

14
00:02:15,482 --> 00:02:17,634
You don't mean the stigma?

15
00:02:18,462 --> 00:02:21,670
But you're the one who brought
that on yourself in the first place.

16
00:02:23,456 --> 00:02:24,703
I see.

17
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:29,759
I guess you really do have a short memory.

18
00:02:31,104 --> 00:02:33,490
No, not me.

19
00:02:34,396 --> 00:02:36,900
You see, it is my choice to forget.

20
00:02:50,117 --> 00:02:51,777
2 Weeks Ago

21
00:02:52,202 --> 00:02:55,127
<i>Tseng! Look at this.</i>

22
00:02:55,311 --> 00:02:55,938
<i>Hm?</i>

23
00:02:58,897 --> 00:03:00,489
<i>Found it.</i>

24
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,564
<i>Not a pretty sight, is it?</i>

25
00:03:04,736 --> 00:03:06,727
Who cares?
Just get the damn thing.

26
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:08,634
<i>Reno, I'm counting on you.</i>

27
00:03:09,408 --> 00:03:10,966
You got it.

28
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,511
<i>Whoa!</i>

29
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:30,710
<i>Senpai, hurry!</i>

30
00:03:32,823 --> 00:03:34,120
<i>Senpai!</i>

31
00:03:34,324 --> 00:03:36,554
<i>Who the hell is that?</i>

32
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:42,690
<i>Elena!</i>

33
00:03:44,234 --> 00:03:46,031
<i>Go! Get out!</i>

34
00:03:53,888 --> 00:03:55,193
<i>Tseng-san!</i>

35
00:04:08,224 --> 00:04:10,709
<i>You are going to give her back eventually.</i>

36
00:04:40,844 --> 00:04:42,641
<i>The Lifestream.</i>

37
00:04:42,846 --> 00:04:46,805
<i>That's what we call the river of life
that circles our planet...</i>

38
00:04:47,017 --> 00:04:51,954
<i>... giving life to the world
and everything in it.</i>

39
00:04:53,323 --> 00:04:56,656
<i>The Shinra Electric Power Company
discovered a way...</i>

40
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,694
<i>... to use the Lifestream
as an energy source.</i>

41
00:05:00,897 --> 00:05:06,699
<i>Because of Shinra's energy, we were
able to live very comfortable lives.</i>

42
00:05:06,903 --> 00:05:10,964
<i>But wasn't that because we were
taking away from the planet's life?</i>

43
00:05:11,174 --> 00:05:14,405
<i>A lot of people thought so.</i>

44
00:05:15,645 --> 00:05:22,073
<i>Shinra used their power to try and
stop anybody who got in their way.</i>

45
00:05:23,386 --> 00:05:28,449
<i>Shinra had a special group
of warriors called SOLDIER.</i>

46
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:32,353
<i>And all the SOLDIERs
had Jenova cells put inside them.</i>

47
00:05:32,562 --> 00:05:35,929
<i>Jenova was a calamity that fell
from the sky a long, long time ago...</i>

48
00:05:36,132 --> 00:05:39,431
<i>... and tried to destroy the planet.</i>

49
00:05:41,004 --> 00:05:43,871
<i>Anyway, there was one SOLDIER
named Sephiroth...</i>

50
00:05:44,074 --> 00:05:47,202
<i>... who was better than the rest.</i>

51
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:52,006
<i>But when he found out about the
terrible experiments that made him...</i>

52
00:05:52,215 --> 00:05:55,480
<i>... he began to hate Shinra.</i>

53
00:05:55,685 --> 00:06:00,622
<i>And then, over time,
he began to hate everything.</i>

54
00:06:03,847 --> 00:06:08,250
<i>Shinra and the people against them.</i>

55
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,419
<i>Sephiroth, who hated
the planet so much...</i>

56
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,351
<i>... he wanted to make it go away.</i>

57
00:06:14,557 --> 00:06:17,355
<i>And the people who tried to stop him.</i>

58
00:06:17,994 --> 00:06:20,861
<i>There were a lot of battles.</i>

59
00:06:21,898 --> 00:06:26,358
<i>For every battle,
there was more sadness.</i>

60
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:32,201
<i>Someone I love went back
to the Lifestream too.</i>

61
00:06:33,743 --> 00:06:36,337
<i>And then, it came.</i>

62
00:06:36,546 --> 00:06:38,275
<i>The chosen day.</i>

63
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:44,113
<i>In the end, the planet itself had to
make the battles stop for good.</i>

64
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:49,121
<i>The planet used the Lifestream
as a weapon...</i>

65
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:52,488
<i>... and when it burst out
of the earth...</i>

66
00:06:52,695 --> 00:06:56,529
<i>... all the fighting,
all the greed and sadness...</i>

67
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:59,668
<i>... everything was washed away.</i>

68
00:07:05,056 --> 00:07:09,015
<i>"Sadness was the price
to see it end. "</i>

69
00:07:09,227 --> 00:07:12,754
<i>It's been two years
since they told me that.</i>

70
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,288
Move it, move it.

71
00:08:02,012 --> 00:08:04,519
Whoa.

72
00:08:10,512 --> 00:08:11,726
Sis, let's go.

73
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:12,748
Yeah.

74
00:08:33,205 --> 00:08:40,168
<i>But it looks like the planet
is a lot angrier than we thought.</i>

75
00:08:45,466 --> 00:08:47,661
<i>They call it geostigma.</i>

76
00:08:51,789 --> 00:08:55,452
Well, Marlene?
How does it look?

77
00:08:58,629 --> 00:09:03,896
Please. Please don't
take Denzel away.

78
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:14,516
<i>"The commission report release this
morning has reveal"</i>

79
00:09:14,686 --> 00:09:19,027
<i>"That lifestream concentration at the atmosphere"</i>

80
00:09:19,137 --> 00:09:22,658
<i>"Has been drop to a mere
hundred of a levels 2 years ago."</i>

81
00:09:23,504 --> 00:09:24,804
<i>"However, the concentration remains toxic"</i>

82
00:09:24,984 --> 00:09:28,070
<i>"Around the Shinra Company main building
as well as the company's mako reactors."
He's not here anymore.</i>

83

<i>"To prevent the onset of Geostigma"</i>

84

<i>"The commission does advice that you
stay away from these facilities"</i>

<i>"Next up. Should Shinra be held
financial responsible for the crisis?"</i>

87
00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:46,708
Cloud, where is he now?

88
00:10:00,409 --> 00:10:04,106
Strife Delivery Service.
You name it, we ship...

89
00:10:06,115 --> 00:10:08,106
May I ask who's calling?

90
00:10:13,623 --> 00:10:15,682
Yeah, I remember you.

91
00:10:36,812 --> 00:10:39,178
<i>You got a call from Reno.
He's in Healin.</i>

92
00:10:39,382 --> 00:10:41,282
<i>Says he's got work for you.</i>

93
00:10:41,484 --> 00:10:44,078
<i>Cloud, how have you been?</i>

94
00:10:44,286 --> 00:10:45,719
<i>You have no more messages...</i>

95
00:11:55,891 --> 00:12:00,123
Hey, Kadaj?
Is that where Big Brother lives?

96
00:12:00,696 --> 00:12:02,027
Yeah.

97
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:04,791
Think he'll be happy to see us?

98
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,696
- Not a chance.
- Don't cry, Yazoo.

99
00:12:08,637 --> 00:12:10,867
But Mother's with him?

100
00:12:12,141 --> 00:12:14,439
Maybe not.

101
00:12:14,643 --> 00:12:15,940
Oh, don't cry, Loz.

102
00:12:22,384 --> 00:12:24,511
Look, here he comes.

103
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:06,254
Where's Mother?

104
00:13:10,366 --> 00:13:12,857
We know you hid her, Brother.

105
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,775
Don't tell me you're leading me on?

106
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,710
Because I think
you do have Mother there.

107
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:30,283
No need to shout.

108
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:34,345
Put the president on.

109
00:13:35,224 --> 00:13:37,089
You're starting to bother me.

110
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,860
Don't run away.

111
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:08,429
<i>Hey, it's me, Barret!</i>

112
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:12,838
<i>I did it! A new oil field!
O-IL-FIELD!</i>

113
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:14,773
<i>A huge one, too!</i>

114
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,596
<i>And we're sticking to plan, so soon
I'll be able to come visit Marlene!</i>

115
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,331
<i>Tell her for me!
See ya!</i>

116
00:15:23,794 --> 00:15:25,762
<i>Reno called again.</i>

117
00:15:26,163 --> 00:15:30,395
<i>He says to hurry,
but he sounded kind of strange...</i>

118
00:15:31,268 --> 00:15:33,031
<i>Be careful, okay?</i>

119
00:16:01,365 --> 00:16:03,560
Okay, so you're good.

120
00:16:12,509 --> 00:16:14,807
Yeah, Rude, looking sharp!

121
00:16:22,686 --> 00:16:26,178
Just as expected
from an ex-SOLDIER.

122
00:16:34,498 --> 00:16:36,864
You haven't rusted a bit.

123
00:16:43,707 --> 00:16:48,606
Is that you, Rufus?
You've got no luck either...

124
00:16:53,417 --> 00:16:55,385
- The day of the explosion...
- What do you want?

125
00:16:55,586 --> 00:16:57,611
...I managed to get out...
- Who were the guys that attacked me?

126
00:16:57,821 --> 00:16:59,311
...before it colla...
- I'm leaving.

127
00:17:02,392 --> 00:17:04,519
We need your assistance.

128
00:17:04,728 --> 00:17:07,253
- Not interest...
- I acknowledge that Shinra...

129
00:17:07,464 --> 00:17:10,160
...owes the planet a lot.

130
00:17:10,367 --> 00:17:13,530
It goes without saying
that my company and I...

131
00:17:13,737 --> 00:17:16,797
...are the ones who put
the world in the sorry state it's in.

132
00:17:17,007 --> 00:17:20,636
So we feel we have a responsibility
to set things right.

133
00:17:20,844 --> 00:17:21,970
I'm still out here!

134
00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:24,204
We've already taken the first step...

135
00:17:24,414 --> 00:17:28,009
...by conducting an investigation
in Sephiroth's wake.

136
00:17:29,271 --> 00:17:36,214
It's been 2 years, now that that the
world is on the speed again, what's the threat now?

137
00:17:37,142 --> 00:17:42,912
Well, that one's easy, Geostigma.

138
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:48,655
And we have to think Sephiroth is the one responsible.

139
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:58,210
The people blame Mako energy, Mako reactors,
even the Lifestream for causing the stigma

140
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,228
However, isn't it wrong
to put a blame on it?

141
00:18:01,228 --> 00:18:08,700
The Lifestream existed as long as the Planet and even
Mako evergy has been part of our life for 40 years.

142
00:18:08,989 --> 00:18:14,204
And yet there's no mention about
stigma in recorded history.

143
00:18:14,753 --> 00:18:20,247
So, what happen during our time
to change all that?

144
00:18:20,247 --> 00:18:22,682
I can only think of one thing.

145
00:18:23,459 --> 00:18:25,477
Sephiroth's awaken.

146
00:18:25,512 --> 00:18:26,657
Sephiroth is dead.

147
00:18:26,692 --> 00:18:28,505
Of course, but what about
his mind?

148
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:35,938
What if somehow he dissolve into the
Lifestream coursing with the Planet undiffuse.

149
00:18:37,195 --> 00:18:41,288
I know, it's merely my speculation.

150
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:44,121
But, there are possibilities right?

151
00:18:44,939 --> 00:18:48,681
And we can't cure the
stigma until we know the truth.

152
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:54,332
So we took the first step,
and went to look for traces of Sephiroth.

153
00:18:54,332 --> 00:18:59,315
Do you by any chance,
still remember where is it?

154
00:18:59,168 --> 00:19:01,105
<i>At the Northern Cave!</i>

155
00:19:01,653 --> 00:19:02,933
What do you think we found?

156
00:19:04,521 --> 00:19:08,787
We didn't find anything. You can relax.

157
00:19:10,227 --> 00:19:13,492
However, not all went as planned.

158
00:19:13,697 --> 00:19:18,430
We were interrupted.
It was the three who attacked you.

159
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:31,345
<i>Tseng-san!</i>

160
00:19:33,466 --> 00:19:35,131
Kadaj's gang.

161
00:19:36,728 --> 00:19:37,778
Kadaj?

162
00:19:37,786 --> 00:19:42,991
Really, what could they be thinking?

163
00:19:42,992 --> 00:19:44,755
What does that have to do with me?

164
00:19:44,756 --> 00:19:47,101
<i>You are going to give her back eventually.</i>

165
00:19:48,004 --> 00:19:52,540
Your ties with Sephiroth run
as deep as our too Cloud.

166
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:58,515
And if Kadaj’s goal is to prepare
for an imminent occasion

167
00:19:58,515 --> 00:20:01,877
We should be prepared
for the upcoming threat.

168
00:20:01,877 --> 00:20:02,812
Prepare?

169
00:20:05,057 --> 00:20:06,211
Sephiroth...

170
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:09,539
...resurrection.

171
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:10,655
Are you done talking?

172
00:20:10,655 --> 00:20:12,616
Let's get things clear.

173
00:20:13,369 --> 00:20:18,274
In order to battle with Kadaj,
we need someone with your expertise.

174
00:20:18,506 --> 00:20:20,143
Will you join us?

175
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:23,649
SOLDIER member, Cloud.

176
00:20:25,561 --> 00:20:26,669
Former.

177
00:20:30,843 --> 00:20:34,505
What's this stuff about 'Mother'?

178
00:20:34,565 --> 00:20:38,953
Beats me. Didn't Kadaj mention
anything to you?

179
00:20:39,218 --> 00:20:40,633
Rufus.

180
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,277
Are you hiding something from me?

181
00:20:43,673 --> 00:20:47,837
I never keep a secret,
especially from a comrade.

182
00:20:49,085 --> 00:20:52,534
I'm sure you wanted to learn
more about the stigma?

183
00:20:52,822 --> 00:20:56,017
Obviously for the sake of
those orphan you live with.

184
00:20:58,038 --> 00:21:01,957
Don't you want to see the
smile of the children?

185
00:20:56,353 --> 00:21:01,848
Think about it. Don't you want
to put smiles back on their faces?

186
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:08,157
All we want in the end
is to rebuild our world, Cloud.

187
00:21:16,941 --> 00:21:19,205
- But I...
- Come on, Cloud.

188
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:23,005
Together, we can rebuild Shinra!

189
00:21:24,081 --> 00:21:25,742
Not interested.

190
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,318
- Reno!
- Reno!

191
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,737
Does Cloud live here?

192
00:21:53,944 --> 00:21:56,139
I guess he does.

193
00:22:04,088 --> 00:22:05,112
What's this?

194
00:22:24,275 --> 00:22:28,177
It's just like Denzel. Is Cloud sick?

195
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,604
Why didn't he just say something?

196
00:22:31,815 --> 00:22:34,147
Did he leave because he's sick?

197
00:22:34,351 --> 00:22:36,785
He wants to fight alone.

198
00:22:36,987 --> 00:22:38,921
- Fight?
- No.

199
00:22:41,725 --> 00:22:43,886
I don't think he will.

200
00:22:44,094 --> 00:22:45,789
Tifa?

201
00:22:48,465 --> 00:22:50,126
Let's go back, Marlene?

202
00:22:52,169 --> 00:22:54,364
No! I wanna see Cloud!

203
00:22:59,076 --> 00:23:00,907
...I guess you're right.

204
00:23:03,414 --> 00:23:06,008
- It'd be nice to see him, huh?
- Yeah.

205
00:23:06,584 --> 00:23:09,280
Hey, what should we do when he gets here?

206
00:23:09,486 --> 00:23:11,317
We'll all go home!

207
00:23:11,522 --> 00:23:15,117
Before that, we'll lecture him!

208
00:23:15,326 --> 00:23:17,055
Agreed!

209
00:23:19,841 --> 00:23:22,478
Now we just have to find Tseng and Elena.

210
00:23:25,241 --> 00:23:27,309
The other employees give you any leads?

211
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:28,837
Nothing yet.

212
00:23:34,284 --> 00:23:38,518
Who have thought, Shinra's employee return to work.

213
00:23:38,609 --> 00:23:42,992
Now that's dedicate.
I'm telling you this going to be a fresh start.

214
00:23:43,568 --> 00:23:47,469
Well, those who alive have a lot to atone for.

215
00:23:50,008 --> 00:23:53,923
It's been 2 years already, right?

216
00:23:53,923 --> 00:23:56,802
It seems a lot longer than that.

217
00:23:58,137 --> 00:24:00,202
What a nightmare huh?

218
00:24:00,525 --> 00:24:03,011
The world was almost done for.

219
00:24:03,011 --> 00:24:05,555
And we're a part of it.

220
00:24:08,165 --> 00:24:12,446
Seriously though,
how we're supposed to atone for that?

221
00:24:13,609 --> 00:24:16,944
Too bad the directors not around.

222
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,688
Elena too.

223
00:24:23,123 --> 00:24:25,131
I hope they're still alive.

224
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:26,911
It's alright.

225
00:24:26,911 --> 00:24:31,432
Tseng is just like the President.
They always escape from the death god.

226
00:24:31,756 --> 00:24:33,728
I'm sure of that.

227
00:24:33,728 --> 00:24:35,349
You got that right.

228
00:24:43,836 --> 00:24:45,842
<i>Found you.</i>

229
00:24:57,851 --> 00:24:59,637
Church?

230
00:25:02,058 --> 00:25:04,277
Ah, I know that one.

231
00:25:05,901 --> 00:25:07,470
I'll be waiting.

232
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:39,136
<i>Your call to Sector 7 cannot be reached at the moment.</i>

233
00:26:40,452 --> 00:26:44,207
<i>Your call to Sector 7 cannot be reached at the moment.</i>

234
00:26:45,444 --> 00:26:49,505
<i>Your call to Sector 7 cannot be reached at the moment.</i>

235
00:26:50,602 --> 00:26:54,817
<i>Your call to Sector 7 cannot be reached at the moment.</i>

236
00:26:56,065 --> 00:27:00,280
<i>Your call to Sector 7 cannot be reached at the moment.</i>

237
00:27:34,921 --> 00:27:38,140
Cloud, you rarely call back
aren't you?

238
00:27:38,321 --> 00:27:40,199
Anything happen?

239
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,608
Cloud?

240
00:27:45,115 --> 00:27:46,912
No it's not.

241
00:27:47,302 --> 00:27:51,153
Who's this?
Isn't this Cloud's phone?

242
00:27:51,365 --> 00:27:53,008
I don't know.

243
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:54,985
Who are you?

244
00:27:56,246 --> 00:28:02,384
I don't know. Please, I don't know
what to do, I can't do this.

245
00:28:05,072 --> 00:28:07,486
Are you crying?

246
00:28:15,999 --> 00:28:18,148
What happen?
Are you okay?

247
00:28:18,148 --> 00:28:21,194
- Cloud! Cloud!
- Where are you?

248
00:28:28,834 --> 00:28:29,833
Oi!

249
00:28:36,009 --> 00:28:37,533
Are you alright?

250
00:29:20,716 --> 00:29:22,533
I hate liars.

251
00:29:23,048 --> 00:29:26,424
I apologize.
This time you'll get the truth.

252
00:29:26,424 --> 00:29:30,393
The object you seek fell from the helicopter
while we were running from you.

253
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:33,069
What a ridiculous story.

254
00:29:33,937 --> 00:29:35,657
Is that right?

255
00:29:36,258 --> 00:29:38,225
I swear it.

256
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:42,398
Then swear on these.

257
00:29:49,183 --> 00:29:53,643
- Why are you doing this?
- We need Mother's power.

258
00:29:54,321 --> 00:29:57,381
The Reunion is coming
and we need her.

259
00:29:58,125 --> 00:29:59,717
Reunion?

260
00:30:00,127 --> 00:30:03,494
My brothers and sisters who share
Mother's cells will all assemble.

261
00:30:03,697 --> 00:30:06,632
And together, we'll take revenge
on the planet.

262
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:11,065
We've already sent out the invitations,
but you know.

263
00:30:11,271 --> 00:30:14,638
Someone's gone and hidden
the guest of honor.

264
00:30:14,841 --> 00:30:15,865
Invitations?

265
00:30:16,643 --> 00:30:21,273
The stigma.
But you know all about that.

266
00:30:21,815 --> 00:30:26,252
Mother's memetic legacy lives on in
the Lifestream and makes it happen.

267
00:30:27,054 --> 00:30:33,050
She does so much for us, and we
don't even know where to find her.

268
00:30:34,094 --> 00:30:40,590
But what can we do, we're just
remnants of Mother's legacy.

269
00:30:40,801 --> 00:30:46,000
Until we find Mother and receive
her cells, we can't be whole again.

270
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,775
Geostigma and a legacy
aren't enough.

271
00:30:49,977 --> 00:30:52,946
Not for a true Reunion.

272
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,374
What do you mean?

273
00:30:56,516 --> 00:31:00,953
Mr. President, surely you've noticed?

274
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:38,900
Sorry, sorry.

275
00:31:42,887 --> 00:31:43,894
The stigma!

276
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:51,409
Can't you people just stay indoors?

277
00:32:05,942 --> 00:32:06,995
Here.

278
00:32:37,774 --> 00:32:39,867
I said I'd live out both our lives.

279
00:32:41,745 --> 00:32:44,009
Easier said than done.

280
00:32:44,214 --> 00:32:47,615
You wanna be in SOLDIER?
Hang in there!

281
00:32:47,984 --> 00:32:49,008
Hey, how're you doing?

282
00:32:49,219 --> 00:32:52,347
What're you gonna do
once we get to Midgar?

283
00:32:52,882 --> 00:32:55,371
We're friends, right?

284
00:33:03,115 --> 00:33:05,397
Old man, stop somewhere behind a rock.

285
00:33:05,591 --> 00:33:07,231
Cloud, we’re getting off!

286
00:33:10,828 --> 00:33:13,471
My dreams and pride...

287
00:33:14,837 --> 00:33:16,915
...You can have them all.

288
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,981
You're...

289
00:33:20,514 --> 00:33:23,129
...the proof that I existed.

290
00:33:25,548 --> 00:33:29,771
On that day,
I swore I'll never forget.

291
00:33:30,367 --> 00:33:33,483
But, I...

292
00:33:40,741 --> 00:33:43,380
Don't pretend you're sad.

293
00:33:44,662 --> 00:33:48,064
Why tremble with anger that's not even there.

294
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:52,856
Do you know why, Cloud?

295
00:33:52,857 --> 00:33:57,344
All you are, is an empty puppet.

296
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:25,850
Wanna play?

297
00:34:29,156 --> 00:34:31,351
I guess that's a no.

298
00:34:33,493 --> 00:34:35,654
Where's Mother?

299
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:44,496
It stinks.

300
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:49,937
- Hey, where's Mother?
- There's no one here!

301
00:34:51,411 --> 00:34:53,902
Fine. Play with me.

302
00:35:07,928 --> 00:35:09,555
This'll be fun.

303
00:36:25,805 --> 00:36:27,432
Tifa!

304
00:36:55,569 --> 00:36:57,503
She's not here.

305
00:36:59,339 --> 00:37:00,966
I'm not crying!

306
00:37:02,676 --> 00:37:05,372
Got it. I'll bring it.

307
00:37:10,584 --> 00:37:12,108
Time to finish this.

308
00:38:10,477 --> 00:38:12,035
Cloud!

309
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:13,592
Run!

310
00:38:31,939 --> 00:38:34,579
About earlier, I'm sorry.

311
00:38:36,475 --> 00:38:38,023
Thank you.

312
00:38:46,021 --> 00:38:47,291
My brother...

313
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:51,786
Isn't around anymore.

314
00:38:53,737 --> 00:38:54,998
I see.

315
00:38:56,189 --> 00:38:59,482
You've got the stigma too?

316
00:39:00,306 --> 00:39:02,094
Come on, they're gonna fix us.

317
00:39:55,031 --> 00:39:56,521
Tifa?

318
00:39:58,668 --> 00:40:00,067
Tifa!

319
00:40:06,977 --> 00:40:08,035
You're late...

320
00:40:08,244 --> 00:40:10,075
Who did this?

321
00:40:12,082 --> 00:40:14,175
He didn't say.

322
00:40:15,552 --> 00:40:17,144
Marlene?!

323
00:40:25,595 --> 00:40:26,584
No...

324
00:41:36,833 --> 00:41:39,131
You're pretty heavy.

325
00:41:39,569 --> 00:41:43,096
You were living with some kids, right?

326
00:41:43,306 --> 00:41:44,967
They ain't here.

327
00:41:49,245 --> 00:41:50,769
Is that okay with you?

328
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,017
I...

329
00:42:05,962 --> 00:42:08,487
You're a real handful.

330
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,153
Tifa said to take you home, kid.

331
00:42:26,025 --> 00:42:27,357
Hold on tight.

332
00:43:02,517 --> 00:43:04,532
Who are these people
that's going to fix us?

333
00:43:07,946 --> 00:43:09,087
I don't know.

334
00:43:14,326 --> 00:43:15,907
Anyone is fine.

335
00:43:34,113 --> 00:43:36,911
So Big Brother was hiding it.

336
00:43:38,885 --> 00:43:42,412
This is the power of the Lifestream.

337
00:43:45,124 --> 00:43:50,721
This materia will give us
renewed power.

338
00:43:52,689 --> 00:43:56,284
So, those were a gift from Mother?

339
00:43:56,284 --> 00:43:58,300
Yea, it should be.

340
00:43:59,158 --> 00:44:01,662
Then, Brother is hiding Mother too?

341
00:44:02,113 --> 00:44:05,026
No. It's that President guy.

342
00:44:05,026 --> 00:44:09,634
Keeping things hidden is something
Shinra's people are very good at

343
00:44:10,801 --> 00:44:15,062
Then we have to look everywhere
that have to do with Shinra.

344
00:44:16,557 --> 00:44:19,490
Pretty soon, we'll have plenty of helps.

345
00:44:20,071 --> 00:44:22,374
This is fun!

346
00:44:24,477 --> 00:44:26,079
But first.

347
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:29,587
We need to have a talk with Brother.

348
00:44:30,113 --> 00:44:33,520
He likes to pretend as if he's
not a part of the family.

349
00:44:34,141 --> 00:44:37,228
He makes me sad, really sad.

350
00:44:45,319 --> 00:44:46,607
Right?

351
00:45:07,317 --> 00:45:09,444
Reno and Rude are looking.

352
00:45:14,558 --> 00:45:18,654
You have geostigma, don't you.

353
00:45:19,596 --> 00:45:23,225
So it's okay to just give up and die.
Is that what you think?

354
00:45:27,904 --> 00:45:29,565
It knew it.

355
00:45:30,307 --> 00:45:32,070
There's no cure.

356
00:45:32,576 --> 00:45:35,477
That's not stopping Denzel
from fighting.

357
00:45:35,912 --> 00:45:38,142
Don't run. Let's fight it together.

358
00:45:38,348 --> 00:45:41,374
<i>We can help each other,
I know we can.</i>

359
00:45:44,688 --> 00:45:47,657
Or do we have to be a real family
for that to work?

360
00:45:47,858 --> 00:45:49,519
I...

361
00:45:51,028 --> 00:45:53,724
...am not fit to help anyone.

362
00:45:54,364 --> 00:45:57,856
Not my family, not my friends.

363
00:45:58,068 --> 00:45:59,592
No one.

364
00:46:02,506 --> 00:46:04,406
Dilly-dally, shilly-shally...

365
00:46:09,346 --> 00:46:11,940
Dilly-dally, shilly-shally...

366
00:46:12,316 --> 00:46:14,978
I think she wants you
to move on.

367
00:46:15,485 --> 00:46:17,146
Did you find them?

368
00:46:17,354 --> 00:46:19,720
Only a witness.

369
00:46:19,923 --> 00:46:22,551
Saw them being taken away.

370
00:46:22,759 --> 00:46:26,251
- Where are they?
- The Forgotten City.

371
00:46:27,064 --> 00:46:28,725
Their base.

372
00:46:41,845 --> 00:46:46,680
I've received a special power from Mother.

373
00:46:46,883 --> 00:46:49,147
The power to fight...

374
00:46:50,087 --> 00:46:52,351
...against a planet
that torments its people.

375
00:46:55,592 --> 00:46:59,358
She gave this power to all her children.

376
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:01,727
That's right.

377
00:47:02,966 --> 00:47:05,400
You and I are brethren.

378
00:47:06,269 --> 00:47:07,964
Brothers and sisters chosen...

379
00:47:08,171 --> 00:47:12,301
...when we inherited Mother's memetic
legacy through the Lifestream.

380
00:47:13,844 --> 00:47:15,869
But...

381
00:47:16,613 --> 00:47:20,105
...the planet doesn't like that.

382
00:47:20,517 --> 00:47:23,953
It's trying to hold us back.

383
00:47:24,788 --> 00:47:30,351
That's why it's been racking our bodies
with pain, filling our hearts with doubt!

384
00:47:32,629 --> 00:47:34,688
I will heal you.

385
00:47:35,365 --> 00:47:38,163
Then we will go to Mother.

386
00:47:38,368 --> 00:47:42,828
We will join as a family
and strike back at the planet!

387
00:47:47,577 --> 00:47:50,068
Do as I do.

388
00:48:36,426 --> 00:48:37,757
Denzel.

389
00:48:42,232 --> 00:48:43,494
Denzel!

390
00:48:55,447 --> 00:48:57,076
Mother, look.

391
00:48:58,038 --> 00:49:00,754
All my new siblings.

392
00:49:02,304 --> 00:49:07,360
They will keep me company
until I found you.

393
00:49:46,028 --> 00:49:48,087
You came.

394
00:49:50,032 --> 00:49:53,024
Even though you're about to break.

395
00:49:54,303 --> 00:49:56,635
That's a good sign.

396
00:49:57,973 --> 00:49:59,531
I wanna ask something!

397
00:50:00,342 --> 00:50:02,435
Why exactly did you come here for?

398
00:50:04,513 --> 00:50:07,971
I think I want to be forgiven...

399
00:50:10,385 --> 00:50:12,580
Yes, I want to be forgiven.

400
00:50:13,622 --> 00:50:15,055
By who?

401
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:06,664
Glad you could make it.

402
00:51:06,875 --> 00:51:07,864
I'm here for the kids.

403
00:51:08,076 --> 00:51:11,671
See this man? He's our big brother.

404
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,609
But you know,

405
00:51:14,817 --> 00:51:17,047
It's a shame...

406
00:51:18,387 --> 00:51:20,446
He's a traitor.

407
00:51:23,792 --> 00:51:25,020
Cloud!

408
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:47,567
I really can't save anyone, right?

409
00:53:48,403 --> 00:53:51,600
Vincent. What do you know
about this?

410
00:53:53,342 --> 00:53:55,242
I come here often.

411
00:53:57,679 --> 00:54:00,147
I've seen what Kadaj's group
is doing.

412
00:54:01,917 --> 00:54:03,578
The stigma.

413
00:54:03,986 --> 00:54:06,648
Inside our bodies, we all have
a current like the Lifestream.

414
00:54:06,855 --> 00:54:09,619
When alien matter infests the body,
this current is what fights it off.

415
00:54:11,593 --> 00:54:15,359
There's a flow through the body like the Lifestream...

416
00:54:15,998 --> 00:54:18,899
It fights against the invasion of harmful substances.

417
00:54:21,203 --> 00:54:23,433
Harmful substances...

418
00:54:23,772 --> 00:54:27,469
The Sephiroth gene.
Jenova's memetic legacy.

419
00:54:28,143 --> 00:54:29,132
Call it what you want.

420
00:54:31,546 --> 00:54:32,774
You're well-informed.

421
00:54:33,615 --> 00:54:35,515
Tseng and Elena.

422
00:54:35,717 --> 00:54:38,743
They were brought here half-dead.

423
00:54:39,154 --> 00:54:41,588
They must have been
brutally tortured.

424
00:54:42,824 --> 00:54:45,122
I did what I could to save them...

425
00:54:45,861 --> 00:54:48,125
...but it was ugly.

426
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:49,854
Tortured?

427
00:54:50,265 --> 00:54:51,755
They had it coming.

428
00:54:51,967 --> 00:54:54,094
They got their hands
on Jenova's head.

429
00:54:54,936 --> 00:54:57,803
Then the "Mother"
Kadaj is looking for...

430
00:54:58,006 --> 00:55:02,500
Heaven's dark harbinger.
The calamity, Jenova.

431
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:06,176
If they wanted to,
they could make another Sephiroth.

432
00:55:07,616 --> 00:55:09,243
Kadaj...

433
00:55:09,785 --> 00:55:11,343
What is he?

434
00:55:12,454 --> 00:55:14,149
I'd rather not know.

435
00:55:25,634 --> 00:55:26,623
Marlene!

436
00:55:26,835 --> 00:55:29,030
Cloud! Denzel and Tifa!

437
00:55:29,237 --> 00:55:30,670
Tifa is all right.

438
00:55:30,872 --> 00:55:32,897
I wanna talk to her!

439
00:55:38,046 --> 00:55:39,638
Do you have it?

440
00:55:41,049 --> 00:55:43,017
I can't believe it!

441
00:55:45,153 --> 00:55:47,951
Vincent, will you take Marlene
back to the bar?

442
00:55:48,723 --> 00:55:50,816
I'm gonna go get some answers
from Shinra.

443
00:55:51,026 --> 00:55:53,017
- You know I can't.
- But...

444
00:55:53,495 --> 00:55:54,962
Cloud, that's enough!

445
00:55:55,163 --> 00:55:58,394
Why won't you listen to what we're trying to say?

446
00:56:01,837 --> 00:56:05,102
Marlene, please give me some time.

447
00:56:05,307 --> 00:56:07,605
There's a battle to be fought...

448
00:56:07,809 --> 00:56:10,334
...but it's not as simple
as just fighting it. You understand, right?

449
00:56:10,545 --> 00:56:12,206
No, I don't!

450
00:56:12,414 --> 00:56:15,212
Cloud, is this really about the fight?

451
00:56:17,586 --> 00:56:18,610
<i>Where are they?</i>

452
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:20,754
<i>The Forgotten City.</i>

453
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:23,180
Ajit.

454
00:56:26,661 --> 00:56:28,128
Please take care of it.

455
00:56:34,669 --> 00:56:37,729
- I have to talk to Rufus.
- Stop running!

456
00:56:38,406 --> 00:56:39,566
I know.

457
00:56:39,774 --> 00:56:42,265
Even if you find the kids,
you might not be able to help them.

458
00:56:42,477 --> 00:56:44,911
Maybe something will happen
that can never unhappen.

459
00:56:45,113 --> 00:56:46,671
That scares you, doesn't it?

460
00:56:46,882 --> 00:56:49,180
But you need to think about now.
Take it in.

461
00:56:49,384 --> 00:56:51,909
You think you've got it hard? Tough.

462
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,588
Sharing your life
with other people is hard.

463
00:56:54,789 --> 00:56:56,279
I know you don't want to be alone.

464
00:56:56,491 --> 00:56:59,858
You might not answer the phone,
but you won't throw it away either.

465
00:57:02,831 --> 00:57:06,164
Why don't you just go to Ajit.

466
00:57:13,975 --> 00:57:17,934
Why do we have to lose out
to our memory?

467
00:57:24,352 --> 00:57:28,288
<i>But I let you die.</i>

468
00:57:29,057 --> 00:57:31,651
<i>Really, you're always drifting...</i>

469
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:35,318
<i>Cloud, why can't you
forgive yourself?</i>

470
00:57:38,266 --> 00:57:41,201
Are sins ever forgiven?

471
00:57:41,903 --> 00:57:43,302
I've never tried.

472
00:57:43,705 --> 00:57:45,138
Tried it?

473
00:57:45,774 --> 00:57:46,832
Tried it...

474
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:53,277
Marlene, let's go home.

475
00:57:58,019 --> 00:57:59,316
I'm gonna try.

476
00:57:59,955 --> 00:58:01,855
I'll let you know how it goes.

477
00:58:21,443 --> 00:58:23,843
<i>It's me, Reeve.</i>

478
00:58:24,045 --> 00:58:25,876
<i>How's work going?</i>

479
00:58:26,481 --> 00:58:29,848
<i>I saw your flyer. How the hell
do you stay in business?</i>

480
00:58:30,051 --> 00:58:32,019
<i>You never change, Cloud.</i>

481
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:36,012
<i>I was thinking about helping you out,
but I guess I'll call back another time.</i>

482
00:58:36,224 --> 00:58:38,317
<i>- Later.
- Surprise! It's me, Yuffie.</i>

483
00:58:38,526 --> 00:58:41,359
<i>So, hey, all the kids
are missing from Wutai.</i>

484
00:58:41,563 --> 00:58:45,590
<i>Have you heard anything?
Give me a ring and fill me in, okay?</i>

485
00:58:50,739 --> 00:58:54,505
<i>I never blamed you, not once.</i>

486
00:58:55,310 --> 00:59:00,009
<i>You came for me.
That's all that matters.</i>

487
00:59:38,753 --> 00:59:42,211
- Hey, are you listening?
- Why the hell are you doing this?

488
01:00:31,257 --> 01:00:32,918
Denzel?

489
01:00:37,897 --> 01:00:40,525
Denzel. Denzel!

490
01:01:01,253 --> 01:01:03,312
And what are we up to?

491
01:01:11,356 --> 01:01:14,285
Mother's here, isn't she?

492
01:01:14,653 --> 01:01:16,044
How do you figure?

493
01:01:16,183 --> 01:01:18,412
This, what you call it?

494
01:01:18,713 --> 01:01:19,985
Monument.

495
01:01:20,569 --> 01:01:22,267
I bet Shinra made it.

496
01:01:22,267 --> 01:01:24,912
Wow, you used your head, didn't you?

497
01:01:25,673 --> 01:01:26,810
Am I wrong?

498
01:01:27,211 --> 01:01:28,299
Who knows.

499
01:01:28,647 --> 01:01:31,548
We don't know anything about it either.

500
01:01:33,786 --> 01:01:37,313
I see, as if anyone would trust you.

501
01:01:41,762 --> 01:01:42,454
Rude!

502
01:01:43,277 --> 01:01:44,833
Say something!

503
01:02:03,986 --> 01:02:05,048
Does it hurt?

504
01:02:07,876 --> 01:02:08,956
Yea.

505
01:02:08,956 --> 01:02:12,139
But, not as bad as Denzel's.

506
01:02:13,272 --> 01:02:14,810
Can it be cure?

507
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:17,550
I don't know.

508
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:24,314
For Denzel's sake, you've been trying
so hard to find a cure for it.

509
01:02:24,999 --> 01:02:26,867
You knew about that?

510
01:02:27,351 --> 01:02:31,029
Cloud, you should clean-up your desk sometimes.

511
01:02:32,481 --> 01:02:33,663
I guess so.

512
01:02:35,768 --> 01:02:42,947
Say Cloud, because you can't fix Denzel's stigma,
is that the reason why you left?

513
01:02:43,799 --> 01:02:46,889
Or is it because you had the stigma too?

514
01:02:48,028 --> 01:02:52,834
I just thought I could take care for myself.

515
01:02:53,214 --> 01:02:55,849
That's what I think.

516
01:02:56,810 --> 01:03:01,498
How can you look after your family if you can't
even take a good care of yourself.

517
01:03:02,626 --> 01:03:06,007
Or, at least that is what daddy would say.

518
01:03:06,439 --> 01:03:09,247
Cloud, don't give up.

519
01:03:12,999 --> 01:03:17,879
You, and Denzel, and Tifa always
be there to help me.

520
01:03:18,875 --> 01:03:21,856
You're always there whenever I needed you.

521
01:03:23,186 --> 01:03:27,067
For now, it's my turn.

522
01:03:27,068 --> 01:03:28,114
Sure.

523
01:03:37,666 --> 01:03:41,526
Say, Kadaj.
I've got a question for you.

524
01:03:42,711 --> 01:03:44,838
Just one question then.

525
01:03:45,387 --> 01:03:50,830
You said you needed Jenova cells
in order to return to what you were.

526
01:03:51,106 --> 01:03:52,915
What does that mean?

527
01:03:54,209 --> 01:03:58,553
He's coming back.

528
01:04:01,086 --> 01:04:02,913
Sephiroth.

529
01:04:03,238 --> 01:04:04,670
The nightmare.

530
01:04:04,670 --> 01:04:05,916
So they say.

531
01:04:05,916 --> 01:04:07,362
You mean...

532
01:04:07,477 --> 01:04:10,124
I don't know Sephiroth.

533
01:04:10,124 --> 01:04:13,900
But I know he's close.

534
01:04:15,257 --> 01:04:16,888
It gets under my skin.

535
01:04:16,888 --> 01:04:20,992
What if Mother loves him
more than..?

536
01:04:21,121 --> 01:04:23,240
Poor little remnants.

537
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:27,574
It doesn't matter.
You'll meet the same fate either way!

538
01:04:27,574 --> 01:04:31,486
Mother came to this planet
after a long journey.

539
01:04:31,486 --> 01:04:35,039
To rid the cosmos of fools like you.

540
01:04:35,866 --> 01:04:39,175
But you know about it as well.

541
01:04:41,665 --> 01:04:45,280
Nothing's changed
since Mother came here.

542
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:48,311
I have to change it.
To make her happy.

543
01:04:48,311 --> 01:04:54,100
There's nothing I wouldn't do,
if she only asked.

544
01:04:55,075 --> 01:04:57,138
Hmph, the nightmare comes again, huh?

545
01:04:57,167 --> 01:05:03,106
As long as you exist, the nightmares
will come again and again.

546
01:05:05,282 --> 01:05:08,007
The Lifestream
courses through our planet...

547
01:05:08,647 --> 01:05:12,280
... back and forth across
the borders of life and death.

548
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:15,544
If that cycle is the very truth of life...

549
01:05:15,752 --> 01:05:19,383
... then history, too,
will inevitably repeat itself.

550
01:05:19,383 --> 01:05:22,216
So go on, bring your Jenovas
and your Sephiroths.

551
01:05:22,426 --> 01:05:25,750
It won't matter.

552
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:28,898
We'll do as life dictates...

553
01:05:28,932 --> 01:05:33,929
... and stop you every single time.

554
01:05:35,206 --> 01:05:40,774
Mr. President, is that an excuse
for taking Mother?

555
01:05:40,774 --> 01:05:43,590
Don't tell me
you're feeling remorse?

556
01:05:43,625 --> 01:05:45,138
Remorse?

557
01:05:45,816 --> 01:05:49,377
Why, I've never had this much fun.

558
01:05:55,387 --> 01:05:56,738
Glad to hear that.

559
01:05:57,155 --> 01:06:00,738
Now let's put
an end to all this.

560
01:07:06,069 --> 01:07:08,367
Denzel, we've got to get away!

561
01:07:56,887 --> 01:07:58,081
This is...

562
01:08:30,287 --> 01:08:31,777
Is it coming after us?

563
01:08:31,988 --> 01:08:33,353
Why don't you go ask it?

564
01:09:11,194 --> 01:09:13,526
Having fun yet?

565
01:09:13,730 --> 01:09:15,823
Not at all!

566
01:09:21,938 --> 01:09:23,997
Can't you guys just call it a day?!

567
01:09:26,209 --> 01:09:27,403
We will.

568
01:09:27,611 --> 01:09:30,739
If you give back Mother,
that'll be the end of everything.

569
01:09:38,355 --> 01:09:39,447
Damned punks...

570
01:09:39,656 --> 01:09:42,750
...what do you need
Jenova's head for?

571
01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:57,196
Forget your little Reunion
and get a grip!

572
01:09:58,208 --> 01:10:00,836
All we want is to be with Mother!

573
01:10:05,281 --> 01:10:10,082
Mother will know what's best.
She'll tell us what to do.

574
01:10:10,854 --> 01:10:13,322
Now, where is she?

575
01:10:27,904 --> 01:10:31,601
Mother, mother.
It's Jenova's frigging head!

576
01:10:31,808 --> 01:10:34,641
- Hey!
- Don't talk about Mother like that.

577
01:10:34,844 --> 01:10:36,106
Unforgiven!

578
01:10:39,115 --> 01:10:40,878
We're sorry...

579
01:10:41,551 --> 01:10:43,178
That's right...

580
01:10:43,386 --> 01:10:45,286
Wait, why are we apologizing?

581
01:11:34,671 --> 01:11:36,002
Tifa?

582
01:11:40,944 --> 01:11:42,809
Bastard!

583
01:11:55,859 --> 01:11:57,724
You look after Mom.

584
01:11:57,927 --> 01:11:58,985
Barret!

585
01:12:00,230 --> 01:12:02,164
Marlene's safe, right? Huh?

586
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:19,271
I can't match this!

587
01:12:51,481 --> 01:12:53,381
Who's using my materia?!

588
01:12:53,583 --> 01:12:55,050
The bad guys, naturally.

589
01:12:55,251 --> 01:12:57,276
Dammit!

590
01:12:57,974 --> 01:12:58,950
Who's that?

591
01:13:03,884 --> 01:13:06,738
The latest model, Sierra!

592
01:13:07,514 --> 01:13:10,047
I'll let you ride it later!

593
01:13:11,124 --> 01:13:12,785
Where's the phone shop?

594
01:13:15,395 --> 01:13:16,521
Who's that person?

595
01:13:16,730 --> 01:13:18,061
These are our friends.

596
01:13:21,263 --> 01:13:23,514
Denzel, can you make it to the bar?

597
01:13:51,578 --> 01:13:52,208
Enough!

598
01:13:56,055 --> 01:13:56,679
Tifa!

599
01:14:02,330 --> 01:14:03,054
Denzel!

600
01:14:25,995 --> 01:14:26,979
Cloud!

601
01:14:37,646 --> 01:14:39,389
I'm sorry I'm a little late.

602
01:14:40,679 --> 01:14:41,928
It's alright.

603
01:14:48,748 --> 01:14:49,982
Are you alright?

604
01:14:53,094 --> 01:14:55,528
Marlene's safe. I took her home.

605
01:14:58,233 --> 01:15:00,463
It feels a little lighter.

606
01:15:03,939 --> 01:15:08,342
Maybe I wore it down by dragging it along so much.

607
01:15:12,547 --> 01:15:16,847
I'm going back to the bar.
I'll be waiting with Marlene.

608
01:15:19,921 --> 01:15:22,822
You're gonna come home,
right, Cloud?

609
01:16:03,526 --> 01:16:05,174
I can do this!

610
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:09,308
You're late dammit!

611
01:19:13,543 --> 01:19:18,173
Isn't this fun Boss?
What should we summon next?

612
01:19:27,256 --> 01:19:30,521
- Mother?
- A good son would have known.

613
01:19:44,207 --> 01:19:46,198
Go, Cloud!

614
01:20:04,961 --> 01:20:06,792
Haiya!

615
01:20:20,910 --> 01:20:22,502
Fly!

616
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:32,810
It's not over yet!

617
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:12,227
Here!

618
01:22:03,613 --> 01:22:04,705
Mother!

619
01:22:12,588 --> 01:22:13,885
- Boss!
- Boss!

620
01:22:57,525 --> 01:22:58,674
Boss!

621
01:24:37,438 --> 01:24:39,845
You mess up with the wrong guy.

622
01:25:32,161 --> 01:25:33,206
Rude!

623
01:25:45,919 --> 01:25:48,196
This is bad! This is bad!
This is bad yo!

624
01:25:49,892 --> 01:25:53,060
Ooh, Rude.
You're alright.

625
01:25:53,270 --> 01:25:54,235
Yea.

626
01:25:54,473 --> 01:25:56,152
I'm just peachy.

627
01:26:26,769 --> 01:26:28,458
Senpai!

628
01:28:21,985 --> 01:28:24,453
Hey, partner.

629
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:28,990
This thing got any bite?

630
01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:32,528
Shinra technology at its finest.

631
01:28:32,729 --> 01:28:34,629
Oh, so you made this.

632
01:28:35,265 --> 01:28:37,893
I don't know about the power, but it sure is flashy.

633
01:28:38,101 --> 01:28:39,864
Oh-hoh!

634
01:28:40,237 --> 01:28:42,933
You like that, don't you, partner?

635
01:28:43,406 --> 01:28:45,874
No overtime tonight, eh?

636
01:30:00,150 --> 01:30:01,845
Mother!

637
01:30:14,764 --> 01:30:16,391
Mother...

638
01:30:17,634 --> 01:30:19,761
Mother!

639
01:32:03,340 --> 01:32:06,104
<i>Let's go, Cloud.</i>

640
01:32:35,171 --> 01:32:38,197
I've finally found Mother.

641
01:32:39,275 --> 01:32:41,106
So, what happens now?

642
01:32:43,646 --> 01:32:46,638
Mother will tell me, you'll see.

643
01:32:47,617 --> 01:32:50,984
I guess a remnanets won't know anything.

644
01:32:53,390 --> 01:32:56,518
So what if I'm a puppet.

645
01:33:01,898 --> 01:33:06,335
You used to be no different!

646
01:33:32,429 --> 01:33:35,455
Cloud, I brought you materia!

647
01:33:36,499 --> 01:33:39,195
- Don't shake it!
- Yo, Cid! Land this junk heap.

648
01:33:39,402 --> 01:33:41,836
Shut up! You want off, you jump!

649
01:33:42,472 --> 01:33:43,996
Let them fight by themselves.

650
01:33:46,643 --> 01:33:49,373
Kadaj is an avatar of Sephiroth.

651
01:33:49,846 --> 01:33:51,473
Think of him as
a sort of larval form.

652
01:33:51,915 --> 01:33:54,349
Larva? You mean
he's some kinda insect?

653
01:33:54,551 --> 01:33:56,018
Calm down, Princess!

654
01:33:56,219 --> 01:33:58,449
So that punk's gonna
become Sephiroth?

655
01:33:58,655 --> 01:34:02,489
Wait, Cloud, does he know that?

656
01:34:03,660 --> 01:34:04,786
Probably.

657
01:34:05,361 --> 01:34:07,090
I see.

658
01:34:08,164 --> 01:34:09,426
Let's leave them alone.

659
01:34:09,632 --> 01:34:12,567
I don't get it!
Someone explain it to me!

660
01:34:12,769 --> 01:34:14,031
This is man talk.

661
01:34:14,237 --> 01:34:16,000
Sexist. Sexist!

662
01:34:16,206 --> 01:34:18,367
Will you calm down, Princess!?

663
01:34:18,575 --> 01:34:20,236
Some of the men
ain't following either.

664
01:34:20,443 --> 01:34:24,379
Two years ago...
During our last battle

665
01:34:24,581 --> 01:34:27,812
...do you remember
what it was like to be strong?

666
01:34:28,017 --> 01:34:29,848
It's only been two years...

667
01:34:30,053 --> 01:34:32,749
...but somehow that strength
has slipped away.

668
01:34:32,956 --> 01:34:35,789
I think Cloud's found it
again though.

669
01:34:37,260 --> 01:34:38,454
I'll give him 10 minutes.

670
01:34:38,661 --> 01:34:41,960
Always a pain in the ass, that Cloud.

671
01:34:43,199 --> 01:34:44,860
At least he's honest.

672
01:36:00,677 --> 01:36:04,875
I'll show you my Reunion.

673
01:36:25,535 --> 01:36:28,868
It's been a while, Cloud.

674
01:36:44,020 --> 01:36:45,954
Your stigma is gone?

675
01:36:47,924 --> 01:36:49,448
How unfortunate.

676
01:36:49,792 --> 01:36:52,556
Just what do you really want?

677
01:36:52,762 --> 01:36:56,163
The ghosts of geostigma victims.

678
01:36:56,366 --> 01:36:59,961
They will rejoin the Lifestream
and circle the planet...

679
01:37:00,169 --> 01:37:03,661
Eventually it infringes on the planet...

680
01:37:03,873 --> 01:37:06,535
What I really want, Cloud...

681
01:37:07,143 --> 01:37:11,603
...is to sail the darkness of the cosmos
with this planet as my vessel...

682
01:37:12,749 --> 01:37:16,150
...just as my mother did long ago.

683
01:37:22,759 --> 01:37:25,956
Then one day we'll find
a new planet...

684
01:37:26,162 --> 01:37:29,154
...and on its soil we'll create
a shining future.

685
01:37:29,365 --> 01:37:31,196
What will happen to this planet?

686
01:37:31,401 --> 01:37:35,531
Well, that's up to you to decide.

687
01:37:56,926 --> 01:37:58,120
Sister?

688
01:38:44,807 --> 01:38:46,934
Where did you find this strength?

689
01:38:47,310 --> 01:38:49,540
I don't feel like telling you.

690
01:39:24,547 --> 01:39:27,311
I've thought of
a wonderful present for you.

691
01:39:34,090 --> 01:39:36,058
Shall I give you despair?

692
01:39:46,436 --> 01:39:50,338
Kneel. Beg for forgiveness.

693
01:41:41,341 --> 01:41:45,745
Is this the pain you felt before, Cloud?

694
01:41:46,713 --> 01:41:48,679
Let me remind you again,

695
01:41:48,755 --> 01:41:51,984
And this time, engraved into your memory.

696
01:42:18,206 --> 01:42:20,796
What do you treasure most?

697
01:42:22,508 --> 01:42:25,353
I want the joy of taking it from you.

698
01:42:32,034 --> 01:42:34,477
So, what if they look hopeless?

699
01:42:34,718 --> 01:42:37,188
If it were me, I still
wouldn't give up.

700
01:42:40,826 --> 01:42:42,534
Embrace your dreams.

701
01:42:42,939 --> 01:42:46,986
Also, whatever happen protect your
honor as a SOLDIER.

702
01:42:47,619 --> 01:42:50,209
You never made as a SOLDIER.

703
01:42:50,209 --> 01:42:52,672
But it's the feeling that count, the feeling.

704
01:42:53,703 --> 01:42:55,074
Zacks.

705
01:42:56,262 --> 01:42:59,198
Well, do you need a help there?

706
01:43:06,431 --> 01:43:10,303
You already beat him once didn't you?
This should be an easy one, right?

707
01:43:10,685 --> 01:43:11,939
Yea.

708
01:43:14,497 --> 01:43:18,254
Never forget.

709
01:43:18,537 --> 01:43:19,669
I am...

710
01:43:21,072 --> 01:43:23,464
...the proof that you existed.

711
01:43:31,181 --> 01:43:35,447
How sad.
You who understand nothing.

712
01:43:36,512 --> 01:43:38,479
There is nothing I don't treasure!

713
01:44:15,038 --> 01:44:19,031
Stay in my memories
where you belong.

714
01:44:24,748 --> 01:44:30,311
I will never be a memory.

715
01:45:00,117 --> 01:45:02,017
Brother...

716
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:05,888
<i>Kadaj?</i>

717
01:45:19,703 --> 01:45:23,833
<i>You can let it go now, if you want.</i>

718
01:45:28,512 --> 01:45:31,310
Mother, is that you?

719
01:45:32,382 --> 01:45:36,216
<i>Everyone's waiting,
if you're ready to go.</i>

720
01:47:00,570 --> 01:47:02,367
He did it!
That's how it goes!

721
01:47:02,572 --> 01:47:05,541
A man!
Cloud-san's a man!

722
01:47:05,742 --> 01:47:07,869
See? Just like I told you.
He can do anything if he puts his mind to it.

723
01:47:08,078 --> 01:47:10,069
Hold on tight, you guys!

724
01:47:18,955 --> 01:47:23,324
You were always with us, weren't you?

725
01:47:24,027 --> 01:47:25,824
Thank you.

726
01:48:06,636 --> 01:48:10,367
Let's all go home together.

727
01:48:14,678 --> 01:48:17,841
And play with everyone...

728
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:45,467
Cloud!

729
01:48:51,314 --> 01:48:54,442
Cloud said he'd come home.

730
01:49:17,233 --> 01:49:18,177
Let's go.

731
01:50:43,249 --> 01:50:45,114
Mom?

732
01:50:46,385 --> 01:50:51,379
<i>Why does everyone
keep calling me that?</i>

733
01:50:53,392 --> 01:50:56,122
<i>I guess they must be fond of you.</i>

734
01:50:57,029 --> 01:51:00,328
<i>I think this one's outgrown me.</i>

735
01:51:01,133 --> 01:51:06,230
<i>Tough luck, friend.
Looks like your place isn't here.</i>

736
01:52:03,629 --> 01:52:07,690
She said to wait here for Cloud.

737
01:52:09,769 --> 01:52:11,896
Welcome home.

738
01:52:21,914 --> 01:52:23,939
Im home.

739
01:52:26,852 --> 01:52:29,616
There are still children
with the stigma.

740
01:52:38,531 --> 01:52:42,262
Okay, it's time to get fixed up.

741
01:52:44,603 --> 01:52:46,594
It's okay.

742
01:52:48,140 --> 01:52:50,005
Be strong.

743
01:53:42,328 --> 01:53:45,923
- Last one in is a rotten egg!
- It worked, it worked!

744
01:54:33,612 --> 01:54:38,174
You're all right now, aren't you?

745
01:55:01,707 --> 01:55:06,735
Yeah.
I'm not alone.

746
02:00:44,704 --> 02:00:47,066
<i>And all my hopes and dreams</i>

747
02:00:47,067 --> 02:00:49,934
<i>Aren't for anyone</i>

748
02:00:49,935 --> 02:00:53,812
<i>I keep them safe and sound</i>

749
02:00:55,859 --> 02:00:58,739
<i>And hope this picture is</i>

750
02:00:58,740 --> 02:01:02,035
<i>Not yours anymore</i>

751
02:01:02,036 --> 02:01:05,554
<i>But can you hear me now?</i>

752
02:01:07,773 --> 02:01:10,414
<i>Now that’s okay man</i>

753
02:01:10,415 --> 02:01:13,450
<i>I’ll say it across this land, </i>

754
02:01:13,451 --> 02:01:17,088
<i>You should’ve kissed me baby</i>

755
02:01:19,330 --> 02:01:22,068
<i>So try and stop me</i>

756
02:01:22,069 --> 02:01:25,153
<i>Or so forgive this light</i>

757
02:01:25,154 --> 02:01:28,721
<i>Cuz I can’t beg all night</i>

758
02:01:28,783 --> 02:01:33,261
<i>Until my heart stops beating</i>

759
02:01:33,262 --> 02:01:36,426
<i>You’ll never hear me say</i>

760
02:01:36,427 --> 02:01:39,287
<i>I won’t kiss you</i>

761
02:01:40,112 --> 02:01:41,658
<i>If I say,</i>

762
02:01:41,659 --> 02:01:44,793
<i>Its lost its beating</i>

763
02:01:44,794 --> 02:01:48,187
<i>If I can’t find my way</i>

764
02:01:48,188 --> 02:01:50,770
<i>It’s over now</i>

765
02:01:52,098 --> 02:01:54,020
<i>That I won’t</i>

766
02:01:54,021 --> 02:01:57,869
<i>Break away</i>

767
02:01:57,869 --> 02:02:02,594
<i>Until the day
(Whoa, whoa)</i>

768
02:02:02,595 --> 02:02:08,751
<i>I’m never backing down
(Whoa, whoa)</i>

769
02:02:08,752 --> 02:02:13,857
<i>And hear me say
(Whoa, whoa)</i>

770
02:02:13,858 --> 02:02:19,989
<i>I’ll keep it safe and sound
(Whoa, whoa)</i>

771
02:02:19,990 --> 02:02:22,677
<i>I’ll keep it safe and…</i>

772
02:02:22,677 --> 02:02:25,136
<i>This hopeless feeling</i>

773
02:02:25,137 --> 02:02:28,133
<i>This fear of falling down</i>

774
02:02:28,134 --> 02:02:32,198
<i>But I’m not crashing now</i>

775
02:02:34,244 --> 02:02:37,069
<i>For all this bleeding</i>

776
02:02:37,070 --> 02:02:40,112
<i>It wasn’t worth the sound</i>

777
02:02:40,113 --> 02:02:43,955
<i>A million screaming out loud</i>

778
02:02:43,956 --> 02:02:45,632
<i>And still </i>

779
02:02:45,633 --> 02:02:48,300
<i>The earth comes reeling</i>

780
02:02:48,301 --> 02:02:51,273
<i>The curtain calls my name</i>

781
02:02:51,274 --> 02:02:54,872
<i>I’m not afraid</i>

782
02:02:54,914 --> 02:02:57,200
<i>And I know</i>

783
02:02:57,201 --> 02:02:59,693
<i>You may not miss me</i>

784
02:02:59,694 --> 02:03:02,722
<i>But I am not ashamed</i>

785
02:03:02,723 --> 02:03:06,792
<i>The choice I made</i>

786
02:03:06,793 --> 02:03:08,666
<i>But I can</i>

787
02:03:08,667 --> 02:03:12,421
<i>Let this go</i>

788
02:03:12,422 --> 02:03:17,638
<i>Until the day
(Whoa, whoa)</i>

789
02:03:17,639 --> 02:03:23,711
<i>I’m never backing down
(Whoa, whoa)</i>

790
02:03:23,712 --> 02:03:29,017
<i>Just hear me say
(Whoa, whoa)</i>

791
02:03:29,018 --> 02:03:34,822
<i>I’ll keep it safe and sound
(Whoa, whoa)</i>

792
02:03:34,823 --> 02:03:35,896
<i>I’ll keep it safe and…</i>

793
02:03:35,897 --> 02:03:38,932
<i>No dashing car</i>

794
02:03:38,933 --> 02:03:41,713
<i>Or a dying star</i>

795
02:03:41,714 --> 02:03:45,944
<i>That’s raced into the ground</i>

796
02:03:47,018 --> 02:03:49,820
<i>Like the final words</i>

797
02:03:49,821 --> 02:03:52,965
<i>Of the passengers</i>

798
02:03:52,966 --> 02:03:57,445
<i>Will the angels give it all?</i>

799
02:03:58,005 --> 02:03:59,989
<i>Will the world</i>

800
02:03:59,990 --> 02:04:04,369
<i>Watch us burn?</i>

801
02:04:04,370 --> 02:04:08,726
<i>Until the day
(Whoa, whoa)</i>

802
02:04:08,727 --> 02:04:14,566
<i>I’m never backing down
(Whoa, whoa)</i>

803
02:04:14,567 --> 02:04:20,181
<i>Just hear me say
(Whoa, whoa)</i>

804
02:04:20,182 --> 02:04:26,031
<i>I’ll keep it safe and sound
(Whoa, whoa)</i>

805
02:04:26,032 --> 02:04:31,533
<i>Keep it safe and sound
(Whoa, whoa)</i>

806
02:04:31,714 --> 02:04:37,215
<i>Keep it safe and sound
(Whoa, whoa)</i>

807
02:04:37,610 --> 02:04:43,111
<i>Keep it safe and sound
(Whoa, whoa)</i>

808
02:04:43,259 --> 02:04:48,760
<i>Keep it safe and sound
(Whoa, whoa)</i>
