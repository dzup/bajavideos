1
00:00:01,043 --> 00:00:02,692
The ball I threw

2
00:00:02,884 --> 00:00:05,109
while playing in the park

3
00:00:05,301 --> 00:00:07,871
has not yet reached the ground

4
00:00:12,858 --> 00:00:16,809
I don't give a damn if
a woman's breasts are like magnolias

5
00:00:17,423 --> 00:00:18,689
or like figs

6
00:00:20,991 --> 00:00:24,865
if her skin feels
like a peach or sandpaper...

7
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:29,430
It's irrelevant

8
00:00:30,082 --> 00:00:32,960
if she wakes up
with breath like an aphrodisiac

9
00:00:34,302 --> 00:00:36,834
or an insecticide.

10
00:00:37,678 --> 00:00:38,522
I'm perfectly

11
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,517
willing to put up with

12
00:00:41,706 --> 00:00:42,780
a nose

13
00:00:43,394 --> 00:00:46,540
that'd win first prize
at a carrot show.

14
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,222
But on one thing

15
00:00:52,562 --> 00:00:55,209
I am intransigent.

16
00:00:56,398 --> 00:00:59,237
On no account whatsoever
will I forgive a woman

17
00:01:02,651 --> 00:01:03,802
who cannot fly.

18
00:01:09,211 --> 00:01:11,666
If she can't,
she'd better forget me.

19
00:01:53,902 --> 00:01:59,810
THE DARK SIDE OF THE HEART

20
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,836
I didn't know not having you

21
00:03:48,335 --> 00:03:52,939
could be as sweet as calling you,
even if you won't come...

22
00:03:53,974 --> 00:03:55,854
that your absence could be

23
00:03:56,545 --> 00:03:58,578
as painful
as hitting my head

24
00:03:58,885 --> 00:04:00,035
while thinking of you.

25
00:04:17,682 --> 00:04:18,449
I like it.

26
00:04:19,024 --> 00:04:19,677
Yes.

27
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:25,124
Was I right to have your friend
from Buenos Aires come over?

28
00:04:25,354 --> 00:04:28,154
I'd like to discuss how many shots

29
00:04:28,346 --> 00:04:30,725
of our product will be shown.

30
00:04:31,185 --> 00:04:34,944
That's up to you.
You're in the best position to decide.

31
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,394
Please excuse me.
It was a pleasure, but I have to

32
00:04:40,008 --> 00:04:40,852
take off.

33
00:04:45,187 --> 00:04:45,954
I'm sorry.

34
00:04:48,678 --> 00:04:49,407
You animal!

35
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:54,240
Your manners are beginning to tire me.

36
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:59,112
We fly any way we can.
Gives'em something to tell their wives.

37
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:02,565
Pick up your check
before I change my mind.

38
00:05:03,601 --> 00:05:05,327
And call before you go back.

39
00:05:05,634 --> 00:05:06,746
Yes, master.

40
00:05:06,976 --> 00:05:08,242
I have another job for you.

41
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:12,079
But please don't
come to the presentation.

42
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,032
Hi, I need some vegetables.

43
00:06:14,148 --> 00:06:16,833
We're the caravels three

44
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:20,631
of Captain Christopher Colombus.

45
00:06:20,822 --> 00:06:24,544
We're sailing
to the virgin-continent

46
00:06:24,697 --> 00:06:26,500
with it's new conqueror!

47
00:07:37,277 --> 00:07:38,505
A beer, please.

48
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,931
I don't give a damn
if a woman's breast

49
00:08:07,122 --> 00:08:10,191
are like magnolias or
dried figs...

50
00:08:12,301 --> 00:08:15,524
if her skin feels
like a peach or sandpaper...

51
00:08:16,406 --> 00:08:18,247
It's totally

52
00:08:18,746 --> 00:08:19,897
irrelevant

53
00:08:20,204 --> 00:08:23,234
if she wakes up with breath
like an aphrodisiac

54
00:08:24,193 --> 00:08:26,495
or an insecticide.

55
00:08:27,838 --> 00:08:30,907
I'm perfectly willing to put up

56
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,743
with a nose that'd win
first price at a carrot show.

57
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:36,584
But on one thing

58
00:08:39,346 --> 00:08:40,804
I am intransigent.

59
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:46,405
On no account whatsoever will
I forgive a woman who cannot fly.

60
00:08:49,704 --> 00:08:52,312
If she can't,
she'd better forget me.

61
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,340
Training flights, $50.

62
00:08:57,798 --> 00:08:59,524
Domestic flights, $70.

63
00:08:59,678 --> 00:09:01,136
International, $100.

64
00:09:25,687 --> 00:09:27,260
My tactic is to watch you

65
00:09:28,104 --> 00:09:30,789
learn how you are,
love you as you are.

66
00:09:32,784 --> 00:09:34,472
To talk to you

67
00:09:34,664 --> 00:09:36,045
listen to you

68
00:09:37,464 --> 00:09:40,149
build with words
an indestructible bridge.

69
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,249
To stay in your memory...
I don't know how

70
00:09:46,441 --> 00:09:48,013
or under what pretext

71
00:09:49,164 --> 00:09:50,660
but to stay with you.

72
00:09:54,075 --> 00:09:55,494
My tactic is to be frank

73
00:09:57,335 --> 00:09:58,947
and to know you are frank.

74
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:02,591
To sell each other no pretences

75
00:10:04,164 --> 00:10:07,079
so no curtain or abyss
comes between us.

76
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:10,800
My stratey,
is even deeper and simpler:

77
00:10:11,683 --> 00:10:13,754
That one day, I don't know how

78
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,593
under what pretext,
you'll finally need me.

79
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,700
'Tactis'... by Mario Benedetti.

80
00:10:20,582 --> 00:10:22,040
Are you taking me somewhere?

81
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:27,027
I bet you've read Onetti too.

82
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,978
I'm not here
to discuss literature, honey.

83
00:10:31,784 --> 00:10:34,776
This is a cabaret,
not a literary cafe.

84
00:10:35,544 --> 00:10:36,618
Yeah, sorry.

85
00:10:37,653 --> 00:10:38,536
Your place?

86
00:10:39,533 --> 00:10:40,914
I'll cost you more.

87
00:11:15,516 --> 00:11:16,974
Because you are mine

88
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,662
and are not mine.

89
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:22,115
Because I think of you.

90
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,605
Because the night has open eyes.

91
00:11:26,142 --> 00:11:29,940
Because the night passes,
and I say "love".

92
00:11:57,024 --> 00:11:58,942
Funny place to keep books.

93
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:03,545
A habit I got into
during the military regime.

94
00:12:07,842 --> 00:12:09,491
Why do you like poetry?

95
00:12:10,412 --> 00:12:11,524
What do you do?

96
00:12:12,905 --> 00:12:14,133
Justice of the Peace.

97
00:12:17,969 --> 00:12:19,542
Your time's almost up.

98
00:12:20,693 --> 00:12:22,189
Want to do it or not?

99
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:26,293
Why do you like poetry?

100
00:12:29,286 --> 00:12:30,743
It's part of my job.

101
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:35,500
It allows me to meet
sophisticated people, like you.

102
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:41,408
A guy who likes poetry
can't be that bad.

103
00:12:42,405 --> 00:12:44,208
He may be broke, but...

104
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:47,201
if he has money, he spends it.

105
00:12:53,952 --> 00:12:55,180
It's $100.

106
00:12:56,062 --> 00:12:57,328
At home, it's $100.

107
00:12:58,901 --> 00:13:00,282
Better pay me now.

108
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,598
Excuse me?

109
00:13:28,324 --> 00:13:29,782
Do you know Benedetti?

110
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,273
Does he work here?

111
00:13:34,654 --> 00:13:36,265
Do you want to go to heaven?

112
00:13:36,802 --> 00:13:38,912
Don't worry, whores enter first.

113
00:13:39,909 --> 00:13:40,983
May I have a coffee?

114
00:13:41,943 --> 00:13:42,595
Sure.

115
00:14:34,076 --> 00:14:35,917
Sorry, forgot the keys.

116
00:14:47,272 --> 00:14:48,193
How did it go?

117
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:51,492
I met an unusual woman.

118
00:14:51,722 --> 00:14:53,218
How many tits?

119
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:00,891
Hello.

120
00:15:01,466 --> 00:15:03,269
I'm Eric, a friend of Gustavo's.

121
00:15:06,185 --> 00:15:07,297
They pay you?

122
00:15:07,566 --> 00:15:08,947
Yeah, I'll go to a hotel.

123
00:15:12,054 --> 00:15:13,013
What do you do?

124
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,356
I'm cold.

125
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,044
I mean, in life.

126
00:15:16,197 --> 00:15:17,770
I teach languages.

127
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,928
You're not writing.

128
00:16:33,304 --> 00:16:34,608
I'm with my train.

129
00:16:36,219 --> 00:16:37,102
How do you like it?

130
00:16:38,483 --> 00:16:39,749
I just bought it.

131
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:45,733
Always losing them when I move.

132
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,035
When did you stop writing?

133
00:16:49,531 --> 00:16:50,758
Had to go on a trip.

134
00:16:53,789 --> 00:16:55,822
Maybe you have
nothing more to say.

135
00:17:01,423 --> 00:17:03,379
Or maybe you've realized that

136
00:17:04,377 --> 00:17:06,602
I'm the most important woman
in your life.

137
00:17:09,517 --> 00:17:10,438
Or maybe

138
00:17:12,586 --> 00:17:14,427
you've decided to keep silent

139
00:17:16,154 --> 00:17:18,340
so I may dictate my words to you.

140
00:17:19,683 --> 00:17:20,680
Your words!

141
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:26,051
They might be suitable
for military communiques

142
00:17:26,818 --> 00:17:28,007
But for a poem...?

143
00:17:30,693 --> 00:17:33,263
Found the one who flies?

144
00:17:34,414 --> 00:17:35,526
Not yet.

145
00:17:36,984 --> 00:17:39,900
You're hiding something.
-I always do!

146
00:17:40,974 --> 00:17:43,467
That's what you like best.

147
00:17:43,736 --> 00:17:44,771
Like it?

148
00:17:46,574 --> 00:17:48,646
I don't like anything, Oliverio.

149
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,584
Poor thing.

150
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,001
You're so boring.

151
00:18:10,244 --> 00:18:11,203
What is it?

152
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:13,696
I don't know.

153
00:18:15,768 --> 00:18:18,300
I was thinking-some day
I'll have to take you.

154
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:21,599
I don't know how I'll break it.

155
00:18:22,788 --> 00:18:24,629
It's easier with others.

156
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,468
But I don't know how I'll tell you.

157
00:18:28,657 --> 00:18:29,424
I pity you.

158
00:18:29,961 --> 00:18:30,690
Why?

159
00:18:31,304 --> 00:18:32,839
You have a shitty job.

160
00:18:38,631 --> 00:18:39,629
Like some coffee?

161
00:18:42,813 --> 00:18:43,465
A smoke?

162
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,298
Ridiculous,
worrying about your health.

163
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:53,822
I've spotted a few jobs for you.

164
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,930
Bank manager...interesting.

165
00:18:57,352 --> 00:19:00,766
It just says assistant,
but leave it to me.

166
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:03,067
The man there is getting old.

167
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:05,446
No need to find me a job.

168
00:19:06,597 --> 00:19:07,709
I'm alright.

169
00:19:09,052 --> 00:19:11,392
How can I explain? I'm a poet.

170
00:19:11,814 --> 00:19:12,543
A poet?

171
00:19:14,614 --> 00:19:15,650
I am a poet.

172
00:19:16,878 --> 00:19:18,527
What kind of job is that?

173
00:19:19,026 --> 00:19:24,473
Where does it say,
"Poet required, good salary"?

174
00:19:28,731 --> 00:19:31,148
I'm trying to make
you see reason

175
00:19:33,258 --> 00:19:34,639
so you finally grow up.

176
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:36,979
What for?

177
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,800
My nerves stick to the mud

178
00:19:48,871 --> 00:19:50,099
to the walls

179
00:19:53,168 --> 00:19:54,817
and embrace the branches.

180
00:19:56,198 --> 00:19:58,040
They penetrate the earth

181
00:19:58,231 --> 00:20:02,528
scatter though the air,
and reach for the sky.

182
00:20:02,873 --> 00:20:05,559
Marble and horses
have veins like mine.

183
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,978
You're delirious!

184
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:10,200
All pain hurts my flesh, my bones.

185
00:20:10,622 --> 00:20:12,962
I've died so often seeing bulls slain.

186
00:20:13,538 --> 00:20:14,995
You're completely crazy.

187
00:20:15,686 --> 00:20:18,525
You're mad, a sick child.

188
00:20:19,062 --> 00:20:22,936
An irresponsible idiot
I should force to suicide.

189
00:20:23,512 --> 00:20:26,082
If I see a cloud, I fly with it.

190
00:20:26,274 --> 00:20:28,844
If a woman goes to bed,
I go with her.

191
00:20:29,036 --> 00:20:30,340
You scare me.

192
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:33,102
How often I've asked,
"Am I that stone?"

193
00:20:33,294 --> 00:20:35,826
If I follow a corpse, I stay by it.

194
00:20:36,018 --> 00:20:38,396
If an egg is laid, I cackle.

195
00:20:38,626 --> 00:20:41,618
If someone thinks of me,
I'm already a memory.

196
00:20:43,613 --> 00:20:45,033
He bothering you?

197
00:20:45,263 --> 00:20:45,723
Yes!

198
00:21:34,749 --> 00:21:38,048
Today's man,
as evolved as he thinks he is

199
00:21:38,509 --> 00:21:42,498
hasn't totally accepted
his sexuality as God intended.

200
00:21:43,649 --> 00:21:45,759
Most of our problems

201
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:49,135
are caused by people
who haven't had a good fuck.

202
00:21:50,247 --> 00:21:53,355
Badly fucked army officers
and politicians...

203
00:21:53,892 --> 00:21:55,695
The masses are fucked too

204
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:00,106
but they are unable
to find answers

205
00:22:00,298 --> 00:22:03,214
to the sexual violence
of exploitation.

206
00:22:08,316 --> 00:22:10,387
In North America, you know

207
00:22:10,848 --> 00:22:14,722
an exhibition like this
would be sponsored by...

208
00:22:15,643 --> 00:22:17,522
American Express.

209
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:19,172
Here

210
00:22:19,978 --> 00:22:24,274
It can be closed at any time
because some hypocrite reports it.

211
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:29,530
An artist should live
where Art is motivated

212
00:22:29,721 --> 00:22:32,330
by the hope of being subversive.
Otherwise

213
00:22:33,021 --> 00:22:35,744
it's just,
how do you say, occup...

214
00:22:35,974 --> 00:22:37,202
Occupation therapy...

215
00:22:37,432 --> 00:22:40,808
as permitted in the madhouse.
You know that.

216
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,227
Something's wrong.

217
00:22:42,534 --> 00:22:46,831
Mrs Dolores Harriet de Lopez Meller

218
00:22:47,061 --> 00:22:51,818
Would like a 9 foot dick for
her summer house living room.

219
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:54,848
She'll pay with American Express.

220
00:22:55,078 --> 00:22:56,575
It's the same everywhere.

221
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:00,526
Oli, I'm hungry.
Did you write anything?

222
00:23:08,006 --> 00:23:11,229
"You sail through my blood
and know my borders

223
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,607
and wake me up at midday

224
00:23:13,876 --> 00:23:17,673
to lay me down in your memory.
You, my Fury

225
00:23:18,249 --> 00:23:20,819
my patience,
tell me what the hell I'm doing.

226
00:23:21,011 --> 00:23:24,348
Why do I need you?
Who are you, silent one

227
00:23:24,655 --> 00:23:27,149
running through me,
my passion's reason?

228
00:23:27,341 --> 00:23:29,566
Why do I want to fill myself

229
00:23:29,757 --> 00:23:31,752
with me, to cover you, finish you...

230
00:23:33,977 --> 00:23:37,123
to mingle only
with your dear bones, you

231
00:23:37,353 --> 00:23:39,463
my one country against oblivion."

232
00:23:40,038 --> 00:23:44,181
If she doesn't say yes after this,
I'll kill her!

233
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:46,330
What do I owe you?

234
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:49,207
Well, it's quite a long poem.

235
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:54,731
Three steaks would do it,
but make them thick.

236
00:24:50,892 --> 00:24:54,230
Excuse me, sir. The manager
was hoping you'ld pay your bill.

237
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:59,140
Tell him not to worry.
I'll take care of it now.

238
00:25:13,832 --> 00:25:15,482
They say I'm

239
00:25:15,712 --> 00:25:17,131
no longer myself...

240
00:25:18,896 --> 00:25:22,579
that I'm crazier than yesterday.

241
00:25:22,732 --> 00:25:26,262
City of crazy hearts.

242
00:25:31,786 --> 00:25:33,282
Crazy!

243
00:25:41,261 --> 00:25:43,639
I don't want to go out to smoke.

244
00:25:43,831 --> 00:25:46,785
Don't want to walk
the streets with...

245
00:25:47,015 --> 00:25:47,936
you!

246
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:51,043
I don't want to wonder

247
00:25:51,235 --> 00:25:54,879
who put the grass
in the old drawer.

248
00:25:58,946 --> 00:26:00,902
Good morning, valium!

249
00:26:01,094 --> 00:26:02,858
Good morning, ma'am.

250
00:26:03,089 --> 00:26:05,429
Good morning, doctor.

251
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:08,229
I curse your love

252
00:26:08,383 --> 00:26:10,339
your boundless realm

253
00:26:10,531 --> 00:26:12,564
your desire for pain!

254
00:26:16,822 --> 00:26:19,354
In this fucking city!

255
00:26:21,004 --> 00:26:24,878
Fucking city!

256
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:06,040
I long for nothing
in this moment of eternity

257
00:27:06,232 --> 00:27:08,457
which is all,
when I desire nothing.

258
00:27:09,454 --> 00:27:09,991
Thanks.

259
00:27:25,182 --> 00:27:28,175
Too corporal, limited, compact...

260
00:27:28,366 --> 00:27:31,129
I'll open my pores, disintegrate...

261
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,893
not too much, though.

262
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:35,041
Thank you.

263
00:27:36,653 --> 00:27:40,757
As musical instrument, the clarinet
is richer than the dictionary.

264
00:27:42,138 --> 00:27:43,136
Thank you.

265
00:27:44,824 --> 00:27:48,161
Hope has so many vacants lots.

266
00:28:12,329 --> 00:28:14,247
Anybody in the vagina?

267
00:28:15,398 --> 00:28:16,127
Hi.

268
00:28:16,971 --> 00:28:19,272
Where's Gustavo?
-In jail.

269
00:28:19,848 --> 00:28:21,037
Again!

270
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:24,413
They closed the exhibition.
Greath, huh?

271
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:28,287
We have to pay the...mail.

272
00:28:28,479 --> 00:28:29,477
The 'bail'.

273
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,392
And the money?

274
00:28:33,351 --> 00:28:34,118
Well...

275
00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:38,952
The lady who wanted to buy
that big work...remember?

276
00:28:39,527 --> 00:28:40,448
Here she is.

277
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:43,210
What will you do?

278
00:28:43,785 --> 00:28:46,739
I'll tell her
I'm his dealer in Montreal.

279
00:28:49,386 --> 00:28:51,151
Better yet, in New York!

280
00:28:53,107 --> 00:28:57,596
She should buy it now,
because he's controversial.

281
00:28:58,823 --> 00:29:02,161
His prices are going to skyrocket!

282
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,884
How about that?

283
00:29:49,959 --> 00:29:51,685
We could meet at other times.

284
00:29:52,069 --> 00:29:53,450
You're my lawyer.

285
00:29:53,642 --> 00:29:54,831
I'm also your son.

286
00:29:56,327 --> 00:30:00,010
When are you going to stop
acting like a fool, Dad?

287
00:30:00,394 --> 00:30:03,002
Don't you start scolding me.

288
00:30:04,728 --> 00:30:06,915
And don't kiss your mother for me!

289
00:30:08,334 --> 00:30:10,214
Thank you, counsellor!

290
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:12,708
Thank those who paid the bail.

291
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,789
I may be crazy,
but I do love you.

292
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,044
Buddies!

293
00:30:33,346 --> 00:30:36,607
I thought you might be hungry
so I wrote this.

294
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:37,681
Let's see...

295
00:30:42,783 --> 00:30:44,548
Worth at least 3 steaks!

296
00:30:45,967 --> 00:30:48,000
But what I really need

297
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:51,491
is an oh so warm, oh so pink

298
00:30:51,721 --> 00:30:55,020
huge, throbbing, juicy...

299
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,526
Champagne.

300
00:31:48,803 --> 00:31:51,757
I don't think
it's a sonnet she needs.

301
00:31:51,949 --> 00:31:53,407
Did you notice?
-What?

302
00:31:53,637 --> 00:31:54,865
Her hair.

303
00:31:55,517 --> 00:31:56,629
She has a mustache

304
00:31:57,396 --> 00:31:58,739
hair on her arms...

305
00:31:59,314 --> 00:32:00,427
A hormone problem.

306
00:32:02,767 --> 00:32:05,567
These women have a sex
like a vacuum cleaner

307
00:32:06,987 --> 00:32:08,291
or a suction cup.

308
00:32:10,056 --> 00:32:12,472
There's no defending yourself

309
00:32:13,316 --> 00:32:15,388
even with prickly underwear

310
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,841
or a lightning rod
for your balls.

311
00:32:19,032 --> 00:32:22,868
It's all useless. They push
their sex on you with such violence...

312
00:32:23,751 --> 00:32:27,165
Before you know it,
you're on a roller-coaster

313
00:32:27,357 --> 00:32:30,234
of endless spasms.

314
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:35,144
You must resign yourself to keeping

315
00:32:36,333 --> 00:32:37,868
motionless for months

316
00:32:39,517 --> 00:32:41,397
if you hope to recover

317
00:32:41,589 --> 00:32:43,469
the weight you lost in an instant.

318
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,388
Why'd you choose me?

319
00:33:33,032 --> 00:33:34,375
I liked your mustache.

320
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,901
First time I heard that compliment.

321
00:33:40,743 --> 00:33:42,200
Still...

322
00:33:43,083 --> 00:33:44,771
must've liked something else.

323
00:33:46,573 --> 00:33:47,533
Are you married?

324
00:33:49,873 --> 00:33:50,640
Not anymore.

325
00:33:50,985 --> 00:33:52,174
Would you marry again?

326
00:33:55,013 --> 00:33:56,471
Don't panic!

327
00:33:56,816 --> 00:34:00,575
You'll never hear me say,
"I'm pregnant, gotta marry me."

328
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,644
Marriage isn't important.

329
00:34:04,373 --> 00:34:06,560
You can live without marriage, but...

330
00:34:07,404 --> 00:34:08,555
still...

331
00:34:10,358 --> 00:34:12,429
you can't live without love.

332
00:34:14,769 --> 00:34:16,112
What do you think?

333
00:34:17,186 --> 00:34:21,751
Can you move over?
There's a crease that's bothering me.

334
00:34:22,403 --> 00:34:24,130
That's it.

335
00:34:47,722 --> 00:34:48,719
What brings you here?

336
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,944
I'm waiting for him.

337
00:34:52,939 --> 00:34:53,706
Does he know?

338
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,008
Sure.

339
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:58,156
He asked for one last

340
00:34:58,386 --> 00:34:59,614
hot chocolate.

341
00:35:06,212 --> 00:35:07,862
Always with young people.

342
00:35:09,972 --> 00:35:11,621
You like kids.

343
00:35:12,273 --> 00:35:15,074
Fucking death, cruel death

344
00:35:15,304 --> 00:35:18,795
useless death, implacable death

345
00:35:18,987 --> 00:35:20,483
inexorable death

346
00:35:20,713 --> 00:35:23,053
mysterious death

347
00:35:23,245 --> 00:35:26,275
sudden death, accidental death

348
00:35:27,273 --> 00:35:29,383
death while on duty...

349
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:33,219
What would you do without me?

350
00:35:44,459 --> 00:35:47,911
I don't exist by myself, Oliverio,
try to understand.

351
00:35:49,062 --> 00:35:50,175
I'm an instrument.

352
00:35:51,019 --> 00:35:52,093
You follow orders.

353
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:55,200
Why can't you take me?

354
00:35:56,619 --> 00:35:57,924
Are you in love with me?

355
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:02,220
Sometimes I think
you're dying for it.

356
00:36:03,563 --> 00:36:06,555
You'd love to feel
my hand between your legs

357
00:36:07,706 --> 00:36:11,312
to have me squeeze your tits,
fucking death!

358
00:36:12,961 --> 00:36:15,263
A poet talking like a truck driver!

359
00:36:16,491 --> 00:36:18,063
Or growing up?

360
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:24,585
I'd take you, but you
still use words that stop me

361
00:36:26,043 --> 00:36:29,956
As long as you say them,
I'm forbidden to touch you.

362
00:36:30,876 --> 00:36:31,835
Which words?

363
00:36:33,945 --> 00:36:37,973
As time goes by
you'll forget them.

364
00:36:39,814 --> 00:36:42,346
Then you'll be at my mercy.

365
00:36:46,374 --> 00:36:47,602
Have you found her?

366
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,060
Who?

367
00:36:52,666 --> 00:36:53,740
The one who flies.

368
00:37:08,854 --> 00:37:09,621
Yes.

369
00:37:11,846 --> 00:37:13,304
What's the product?

370
00:37:16,143 --> 00:37:18,023
It's a new campaign.

371
00:37:18,406 --> 00:37:19,327
Sure...

372
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:24,160
I can come up with a few ideas
in a day or two.

373
00:37:25,887 --> 00:37:29,186
Not by mail,
I'd rather meet you.

374
00:37:40,426 --> 00:37:43,265
Don't stay motionless
by the roadside.

375
00:37:44,109 --> 00:37:47,408
Don't freeze joy
or love half-heartedly.

376
00:37:47,868 --> 00:37:49,441
Don't save yourself

377
00:37:49,633 --> 00:37:51,321
now or ever.

378
00:37:51,474 --> 00:37:52,510
Don't save yourself.

379
00:37:53,584 --> 00:37:55,003
Don't become serene.

380
00:37:56,269 --> 00:37:59,338
Don't keep only
a still corner in this world.

381
00:38:00,489 --> 00:38:01,678
Don't let your eyelids drop

382
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,865
heavy like judgments.

383
00:38:05,246 --> 00:38:07,010
Don't stay without lips.

384
00:38:08,123 --> 00:38:09,888
Don't sleep without dreams

385
00:38:10,885 --> 00:38:12,304
imagine you're bloodless

386
00:38:12,496 --> 00:38:14,683
or judge yourself in haste.

387
00:38:18,826 --> 00:38:21,856
But if, after all,
you can't help it

388
00:38:22,278 --> 00:38:24,733
and freeze joy,
love half-heartedly

389
00:38:25,309 --> 00:38:27,994
save yourself and become serene

390
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:31,447
keep only a still corner
in this world

391
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:33,365
and let your eyelids drop

392
00:38:33,633 --> 00:38:35,283
heavy with judgments

393
00:38:35,782 --> 00:38:39,081
stay without lips,
sleep without dreams

394
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:42,610
imagine you're bloodless,
judge yourself in haste

395
00:38:43,684 --> 00:38:46,178
and stay motionless
by the roadside

396
00:38:46,906 --> 00:38:48,287
and save yourself.

397
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,011
then

398
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,505
don't stay with me.

399
00:39:34,743 --> 00:39:36,086
How do you feel.

400
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,884
Like a 100 dollars!

401
00:39:40,267 --> 00:39:40,920
Good!

402
00:39:44,104 --> 00:39:44,794
And you?

403
00:39:44,986 --> 00:39:46,175
When did you arrive?

404
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:48,132
Today.

405
00:39:48,515 --> 00:39:50,280
And came straight here...

406
00:39:51,047 --> 00:39:51,891
sex fiend!

407
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:57,377
And in Buenos Aires?
-There I go to mass.

408
00:40:00,254 --> 00:40:02,057
What did you say you do?

409
00:40:02,364 --> 00:40:03,515
Something absurd...

410
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:05,893
I was Justice of the Peace.

411
00:40:07,658 --> 00:40:09,384
Now I'm an astronaut.

412
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:14,601
I write. When I need money

413
00:40:15,177 --> 00:40:16,941
I rent myself, do advertising.

414
00:40:17,363 --> 00:40:19,128
So you're a whore like me.

415
00:40:24,115 --> 00:40:26,340
Did you think about me?

416
00:40:28,296 --> 00:40:29,409
No, bad memory.

417
00:40:33,859 --> 00:40:34,818
I'm lying.

418
00:40:35,815 --> 00:40:38,999
Once...I found a book
by Benedetti in the bathroom.

419
00:40:39,536 --> 00:40:40,802
In the bathroom?

420
00:40:43,027 --> 00:40:43,756
What'll you have.

421
00:40:44,753 --> 00:40:48,781
Don't waste your money here.
Wait a minute and we'll go.

422
00:40:57,451 --> 00:41:01,632
Because the night passes,
and I say "love".

423
00:41:03,052 --> 00:41:06,313
Because you came
to get your picture

424
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:09,919
and are better
than all your pictures.

425
00:41:10,916 --> 00:41:14,752
Because you are beautiful
from head to soul.

426
00:41:15,596 --> 00:41:18,818
Because you are good to me
from head to soul.

427
00:41:19,547 --> 00:41:23,882
Because you hide sweetly
behind pride

428
00:41:24,112 --> 00:41:28,064
small and sweet,
armor-plated heart.

429
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:32,322
Because you are mine
and are not mine.

430
00:41:32,935 --> 00:41:37,539
I must love you, beloved.
I must love you.

431
00:41:38,421 --> 00:41:42,526
Even if this wound pains me doubly.

432
00:41:43,025 --> 00:41:45,902
Even if I look for you
and don't find you.

433
00:41:46,554 --> 00:41:48,932
And when the night passes

434
00:41:49,393 --> 00:41:51,272
and you are mine

435
00:41:51,502 --> 00:41:53,421
and not mine.

436
00:42:12,294 --> 00:42:15,018
No, wait! Please!

437
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:16,668
Stop!

438
00:42:22,192 --> 00:42:23,189
What's wrong?

439
00:42:24,033 --> 00:42:24,915
I don't know.

440
00:42:27,064 --> 00:42:28,330
I felt a pain.

441
00:42:30,708 --> 00:42:31,744
I'm sorry.

442
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:39,301
Don't worry, I won't
charge you this time.

443
00:42:46,666 --> 00:42:48,546
Worked at the cabaret long?

444
00:42:50,157 --> 00:42:51,577
This one? A year.

445
00:42:52,191 --> 00:42:53,073
And before?

446
00:42:54,339 --> 00:42:58,328
I went to a boarding school
run by nuns.

447
00:43:00,937 --> 00:43:02,088
How much do you make a month?

448
00:43:02,126 --> 00:43:02,471
How much do you make a month?

449
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:05,502
Enough to live on.

450
00:43:07,765 --> 00:43:09,031
Not much, it seems.

451
00:43:10,182 --> 00:43:11,180
I'm saving up.

452
00:43:13,635 --> 00:43:14,364
For what?

453
00:43:15,591 --> 00:43:17,087
To go to Europe.

454
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:20,425
My best friend lives in Barcelona.

455
00:43:22,381 --> 00:43:25,220
How much more do you need?
-A little

456
00:43:26,563 --> 00:43:26,678
[ Skipped item nr. 14 ]

457
00:43:26,754 --> 00:43:27,675
Get dressed.

458
00:43:28,404 --> 00:43:30,974
I have to meet a girlfriend
at the club.

459
00:43:35,232 --> 00:43:36,230
Do you have a man?

460
00:43:37,841 --> 00:43:39,107
A pimp?

461
00:43:41,946 --> 00:43:43,864
I'm a freelancer.

462
00:43:47,355 --> 00:43:49,119
Do you want to be my pimp?

463
00:43:50,922 --> 00:43:54,029
You put up the place,
I find the girls.

464
00:43:55,986 --> 00:43:57,060
A couple of friends...

465
00:43:59,362 --> 00:44:00,436
Could be a good business.

466
00:44:02,316 --> 00:44:03,428
A pimp...

467
00:44:05,078 --> 00:44:07,149
Never occurred to me before.

468
00:44:09,221 --> 00:44:10,295
I'll think it over.

469
00:44:16,586 --> 00:44:18,236
Free for lunch tomorrow?

470
00:44:18,849 --> 00:44:21,995
Lunch?
Give me a call and we'll see.

471
00:44:22,379 --> 00:44:23,146
Got a phone?

472
00:44:29,591 --> 00:44:31,777
Never look at a whore
in broad daylight.

473
00:44:34,846 --> 00:44:36,035
When you going back?

474
00:44:40,294 --> 00:44:42,518
I'd stay for you;
if not, tomorrow.

475
00:44:47,697 --> 00:44:48,580
Bon voyage.

476
00:44:58,055 --> 00:44:59,014
Enough!

477
00:45:00,165 --> 00:45:02,121
Tonight I'll shut the door.

478
00:45:03,387 --> 00:45:04,730
I'll put on my coat

479
00:45:05,727 --> 00:45:08,873
set aside these notes
that speak only of you.

480
00:45:11,021 --> 00:45:12,863
I lie about your whereabouts

481
00:45:14,819 --> 00:45:15,970
my body forever shaking me.

482
00:45:16,008 --> 00:45:16,545
my body forever shaking me.

483
00:45:46,582 --> 00:45:48,194
Have you put on weight?

484
00:45:49,575 --> 00:45:51,838
That was just a political joke!

485
00:45:55,444 --> 00:46:00,162
There's an ad for a marketing
manager. You'd like that.

486
00:46:00,354 --> 00:46:04,075
I don't need work.
Besides, I've got money!

487
00:46:06,569 --> 00:46:10,290
What'll you do with it?
How long will it last?

488
00:46:10,482 --> 00:46:11,748
I don't know.

489
00:46:12,668 --> 00:46:14,356
But I have an idea.

490
00:47:00,582 --> 00:47:01,886
Morning, young man.

491
00:47:02,347 --> 00:47:04,034
My hand is always late.

492
00:47:04,265 --> 00:47:07,295
Another hand
mixes with mine to form a hand.

493
00:47:09,137 --> 00:47:12,129
When about to sit
I notice my body sits

494
00:47:12,321 --> 00:47:15,121
in another body
that just sat where I sit.

495
00:47:15,389 --> 00:47:19,302
Entering a house I discover
I was there before I arrived.

496
00:47:19,955 --> 00:47:22,179
I may not attend my funeral.

497
00:47:22,601 --> 00:47:25,977
As they sprinkle commonplaces
over me, I may

498
00:47:26,246 --> 00:47:30,350
already be dressed as a skeleton,
yawning at their phony tears.

499
00:47:31,271 --> 00:47:32,575
Have a good day.

500
00:47:40,171 --> 00:47:40,938
Hi, Oli!

501
00:47:43,547 --> 00:47:47,613
You know, we Canadians are
very concerned about our health.

502
00:47:47,882 --> 00:47:50,337
This is aerobics Latin-style!

503
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:01,538
What's new?

504
00:48:02,536 --> 00:48:06,065
I've been thinking of
displaying my works in front of

505
00:48:08,712 --> 00:48:11,551
the Government House
and the Cathedral.

506
00:48:13,853 --> 00:48:18,302
A work of art in an exhibition
is like a caged bird.

507
00:48:19,799 --> 00:48:21,678
We must go out into the streets

508
00:48:22,215 --> 00:48:24,057
and reach the people.

509
00:48:25,706 --> 00:48:27,394
Art in freedom!

510
00:48:27,624 --> 00:48:29,005
Back in jail, you mean.

511
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:33,992
I'm hungry. You didn't
happen to write something.

512
00:48:34,721 --> 00:48:39,171
Don't forget me.
I'm working up an appetite!

513
00:48:47,074 --> 00:48:50,718
"We don't build a house
to stay at home.

514
00:48:51,562 --> 00:48:54,362
We don't love to stay in love

515
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,702
and we don't die to die.

516
00:48:57,508 --> 00:49:00,232
We have an animal's
thirst and patience."

517
00:49:01,152 --> 00:49:04,068
Odd. Doesn't sound
like a love poem to me.

518
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:09,208
Sure it's a love poem!
Read it to her, she'll understand.

519
00:49:11,433 --> 00:49:13,735
It's written specially for women.

520
00:49:15,308 --> 00:49:19,873
Ok. Anyway, the last one
drove her wild. She's dying for me!

521
00:49:20,295 --> 00:49:21,177
What'll it be?

522
00:49:21,522 --> 00:49:23,939
Anything. A mixed grill.

523
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:25,857
I've got very good meat.

524
00:49:26,509 --> 00:49:28,773
Animal! We'll starve cause of you.

525
00:50:15,075 --> 00:50:17,761
Stop wasting time on this nonsense.

526
00:50:19,142 --> 00:50:20,868
We're as lonely as shit.

527
00:50:22,249 --> 00:50:23,591
We have to do something.

528
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:26,967
Let's look for a chick.

529
00:50:28,502 --> 00:50:31,264
Even if she can't fly,
we'll get some action.

530
00:50:55,317 --> 00:50:58,347
I can overlook
every fault in a woman

531
00:50:59,114 --> 00:51:01,569
except her not being able to fly.

532
00:51:03,718 --> 00:51:05,214
I'd need radar.

533
00:51:05,904 --> 00:51:07,132
I'm blind.

534
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:34,177
Shirt.

535
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:41,581
Pants.

536
00:51:50,327 --> 00:51:51,900
You're covering your chest.

537
00:52:04,904 --> 00:52:05,748
Red.

538
00:52:10,966 --> 00:52:11,886
White.

539
00:52:25,543 --> 00:52:26,387
Green.

540
00:53:23,814 --> 00:53:24,735
Blue!

541
00:54:22,431 --> 00:54:23,965
We get off at the next stop.

542
00:54:52,238 --> 00:54:54,002
When won't I see you again?

543
00:54:55,268 --> 00:54:56,036
Soon.

544
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:02,902
Call me.

545
00:55:37,313 --> 00:55:40,382
Aren't you ashamed?
How is it possible?

546
00:55:40,688 --> 00:55:42,760
How could you fall so low?

547
00:55:43,144 --> 00:55:45,484
You're unfit to live among people.

548
00:55:45,752 --> 00:55:46,366
Mom?

549
00:55:51,775 --> 00:55:52,849
Yes, son.

550
00:56:01,365 --> 00:56:03,245
You could've been so happy!

551
00:56:03,859 --> 00:56:06,851
You're cultivated,
intelligent, selfisch...

552
00:56:07,427 --> 00:56:10,035
But what have you been doing all your life?

553
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:14,255
Cheating and cheating.
Nothing but cheating.

554
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,211
And now, as usual

555
00:56:16,403 --> 00:56:19,971
the only one really cheated
is yourself.

556
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:23,653
You've never given yourself.

557
00:56:27,605 --> 00:56:29,561
You'd prefer anything.

558
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:31,326
rather than face yourself.

559
00:56:31,748 --> 00:56:34,395
How can you stand
so much emptiness?

560
00:56:34,932 --> 00:56:37,387
Why do you strive
to fill it with nothing?

561
00:56:37,617 --> 00:56:38,576
You're unable

562
00:56:38,806 --> 00:56:41,722
to lend a hand
or open your arms.

563
00:56:41,914 --> 00:56:44,023
It drives me to despair.

564
00:56:44,637 --> 00:56:46,901
I feel like crying.

565
00:57:26,435 --> 00:57:27,509
Anyone buying it?

566
00:57:27,892 --> 00:57:31,460
You'd be the first.
Who spends money on poetry today?

567
00:57:33,033 --> 00:57:33,953
I'll take it.

568
00:57:41,587 --> 00:57:45,232
What's wrong?
Is the publishing industry in crisis?

569
00:57:46,152 --> 00:57:47,955
On my tail again!

570
00:57:50,257 --> 00:57:53,441
Remember, I'm everywhere.
-What now, feeling lonely?

571
00:57:54,976 --> 00:57:57,086
Want me to do what I said?

572
00:57:59,426 --> 00:58:00,768
Are you horny?

573
00:58:05,832 --> 00:58:06,906
Taking all of them?

574
00:58:11,778 --> 00:58:15,346
You know, you're just
a small-time death.

575
00:58:19,565 --> 00:58:21,292
A little bit phony, a bit...

576
00:58:23,095 --> 00:58:24,054
stupid.

577
00:58:28,695 --> 00:58:29,846
Unprofessional, boring...

578
00:58:29,885 --> 00:58:30,614
Unprofessional, boring...

579
00:58:50,792 --> 00:58:52,058
You're not

580
00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:53,899
a bullfighting death

581
00:58:57,505 --> 00:58:59,883
a guerilla warfare death

582
00:59:01,188 --> 00:59:02,530
a Formula-1 death.

583
00:59:08,707 --> 00:59:11,469
You're a pensioner's death

584
00:59:14,806 --> 00:59:17,607
a nuthouse blues death

585
00:59:20,484 --> 00:59:23,246
a low-rent-housing death

586
00:59:24,358 --> 00:59:26,583
a poor neighborhood death,
a tv death

587
00:59:28,846 --> 00:59:31,493
a mediocre death.

588
00:59:32,644 --> 00:59:34,371
Anonymous. Cowardly.

589
00:59:37,439 --> 00:59:39,396
There's a position open

590
00:59:39,588 --> 00:59:40,969
in an advertising agency.

591
00:59:41,544 --> 00:59:43,079
I had nothing to do with it.

592
00:59:44,306 --> 00:59:47,490
Fool wouldn't wait for me,
took an overdose.

593
00:59:48,795 --> 00:59:50,559
A big agency.
-Shove it!

594
00:59:53,168 --> 00:59:54,587
Sometimes I wonder

595
00:59:55,431 --> 00:59:59,037
why you try so hard
to convince me you're a poet.

596
01:00:06,786 --> 01:00:07,553
Sad because your books don't sell?

597
01:00:10,392 --> 01:00:11,198
Something I said?

598
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:15,456
Listen to me, Oliverio

599
01:00:16,837 --> 01:00:19,829
before you let loose
one of your idiocies...

600
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:25,622
You may behave like a child,
but you're not.

601
01:00:25,967 --> 01:00:27,041
You're an adult.

602
01:00:27,885 --> 01:00:30,187
You should know that love is a trap

603
01:00:30,724 --> 01:00:34,291
designed so men
perpetuate the species.

604
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:37,706
A mechanism.

605
01:00:38,396 --> 01:00:40,966
as necessary as my work.

606
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:43,038
Nothing else.

607
01:00:44,802 --> 01:00:45,915
Just that.

608
01:00:47,258 --> 01:00:49,061
I may intervene in love

609
01:00:50,864 --> 01:00:52,513
even if it's not always fair.

610
01:00:56,388 --> 01:00:59,341
Love can never
pas through your hands.

611
01:00:59,533 --> 01:01:03,408
Justice can never
pass through your hands.

612
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:07,896
Even if they kill in the name
of the law, and die for love.

613
01:01:28,842 --> 01:01:30,683
You blame me as if I were

614
01:01:31,527 --> 01:01:33,598
responsible for everything.

615
01:01:35,018 --> 01:01:38,317
I'm only playing my role.
Just like you.

616
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:41,156
I know no more than you.

617
01:01:41,693 --> 01:01:44,800
I know one side,
you know the other.

618
01:01:45,912 --> 01:01:48,828
Ask He who is
Responsible for Everything!

619
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:53,470
Give me a letter of introduction.
You must know him.

620
01:01:54,582 --> 01:01:57,728
I work for him, I've never met him.

621
01:01:58,495 --> 01:01:59,646
You work for him?

622
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:03,636
I think I do.

623
01:02:05,093 --> 01:02:09,390
It would be horrible to realize
there was never anyone...

624
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:12,612
that I worked for nobody,
or nothing.

625
01:02:13,648 --> 01:02:16,141
There's nothing personal
in what I do.

626
01:02:17,791 --> 01:02:22,049
It would be awful
to discover I'm carrying out orders

627
01:02:24,389 --> 01:02:25,732
nobody has given.

628
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:31,793
A death worrying about
God's existence...How underdeveloped!

629
01:02:45,181 --> 01:02:47,713
Why don't you
buy yourself a nice dress?

630
01:02:49,094 --> 01:02:51,050
We'll get drunk
and I'll say to you

631
01:02:51,856 --> 01:02:54,119
all the things
no one's ever said to you.

632
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,112
You'll forget everything.

633
01:02:59,298 --> 01:03:03,096
If God exists, he'll forgive you.
If not, you'll have lived a bit.

634
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:05,781
I'd be known as

635
01:03:07,584 --> 01:03:10,922
the man who vanquished death
by winning her love.

636
01:03:13,262 --> 01:03:14,758
The planet would change.

637
01:03:16,484 --> 01:03:19,476
A love song
would prove more significant

638
01:03:19,668 --> 01:03:21,279
to the history of mankind

639
01:03:22,699 --> 01:03:24,924
than the 'Marseillaise',
the 'Internationale'...

640
01:03:25,154 --> 01:03:27,724
those hymns you danced to till now.

641
01:03:30,486 --> 01:03:31,369
Sorry...

642
01:03:32,941 --> 01:03:34,514
but I have to get off.

643
01:03:37,046 --> 01:03:38,580
I'm going to the hospital.

644
01:03:40,537 --> 01:03:44,296
One of those cheap jokes you like.

645
01:03:47,404 --> 01:03:48,439
See you.

646
01:04:25,535 --> 01:04:29,601
I forbid my personalities
to interrupt while I'm playing.

647
01:04:30,023 --> 01:04:32,977
Especially you,
you're always crying.

648
01:04:35,739 --> 01:04:37,888
You fall apart over everything!

649
01:04:48,821 --> 01:04:50,240
Want to borrow the train?

650
01:04:53,961 --> 01:04:55,879
Ride a roller-coaster?

651
01:04:56,646 --> 01:04:58,296
Give my dick some action?

652
01:04:58,488 --> 01:05:00,943
No, it only wants one kind of action.

653
01:05:01,633 --> 01:05:03,628
Besides, I don't feel well.

654
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:05,393
Am I smoking too much?

655
01:05:05,585 --> 01:05:09,344
Keep acting like a jerk
and I'll die of sadness.

656
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:11,070
Queer!

657
01:07:45,437 --> 01:07:47,509
And before?
-I was a whore.

658
01:07:49,274 --> 01:07:53,225
Never try to find out a woman's past.
You may be disappointed.

659
01:07:54,759 --> 01:07:57,406
By daylight
one can ask certain questions.

660
01:08:00,245 --> 01:08:01,434
I was married.

661
01:08:02,930 --> 01:08:04,158
We had a daughter.

662
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:07,457
My husband was jailed
by the regime.

663
01:08:08,339 --> 01:08:09,567
He disappeared.

664
01:08:11,063 --> 01:08:12,597
I had to eat somehow

665
01:08:12,789 --> 01:08:15,820
and keep my daughter
at the nun's school.

666
01:08:24,835 --> 01:08:26,369
My dad's in Buenos Aires.

667
01:08:27,367 --> 01:08:29,707
Really. In the suburbs.

668
01:08:30,090 --> 01:08:32,277
He is an Evangelist preacher.

669
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:34,425
It's true.

670
01:08:35,269 --> 01:08:38,415
But it's all the same.
Truth, lies...

671
01:08:39,719 --> 01:08:42,021
It's always like that with a whore.

672
01:08:45,512 --> 01:08:47,008
Did you go to college?

673
01:08:47,775 --> 01:08:51,458
You go to college,
you work, you grow up

674
01:08:51,688 --> 01:08:53,184
you screw, you read

675
01:08:53,376 --> 01:08:56,330
you enjoy yourself,
you suffer, you live...

676
01:08:56,521 --> 01:08:57,557
Does it matter how?

677
01:08:59,130 --> 01:09:01,278
You work with your imagination

678
01:09:02,429 --> 01:09:06,572
when you don't turn it
into a fucking whore to earn

679
01:09:06,764 --> 01:09:09,871
some fucking dollars
so you can fuck a whore.

680
01:09:10,293 --> 01:09:11,943
Imagine my fucking life!

681
01:09:16,393 --> 01:09:18,426
How old were you during the coup?

682
01:09:19,347 --> 01:09:20,919
When it began, a little girl.

683
01:09:21,917 --> 01:09:22,876
And when it was over?

684
01:09:23,835 --> 01:09:25,293
Twenty-two or so.

685
01:09:27,786 --> 01:09:29,743
But it wasn't their fault.

686
01:09:30,471 --> 01:09:32,274
They made many people whores

687
01:09:32,466 --> 01:09:34,077
but didn't decide my career.

688
01:09:36,379 --> 01:09:37,338
Were you afraid?

689
01:09:39,333 --> 01:09:42,555
Yes...and I've also been hungry.

690
01:09:43,399 --> 01:09:46,200
So please quit bugging me
and let's eat.

691
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,321
Ana!

692
01:10:02,512 --> 01:10:03,548
Gypsy!

693
01:10:07,384 --> 01:10:09,034
Curly is getting married!

694
01:10:11,336 --> 01:10:12,832
I'm marrying Walter.

695
01:10:20,274 --> 01:10:22,614
Oliverio, this is Gypsy.

696
01:11:19,082 --> 01:11:20,962
Looking at a whore by daylight

697
01:11:23,033 --> 01:11:25,527
is like seeing a movie
with the Iights on

698
01:11:27,023 --> 01:11:29,095
or a nightcIub ot 10 am...

699
01:11:29,286 --> 01:11:32,854
the dust swept up by the cleaners
swirling in the sun

700
01:11:36,192 --> 01:11:39,145
or realizing
the poem you cried over

701
01:11:39,337 --> 01:11:41,562
barely interests you the next day.

702
01:11:44,401 --> 01:11:46,166
Imagine this fucking world

703
01:11:46,971 --> 01:11:49,273
if we had to face it as it is!

704
01:11:50,692 --> 01:11:53,071
Seeing the actor
who plyed Hamlet

705
01:11:53,262 --> 01:11:54,720
at the soup kitchen.

706
01:11:57,559 --> 01:12:00,628
Empty when you're paid
and feel nothing.

707
01:12:04,617 --> 01:12:07,955
Sad, when you get paid
and DO feel something.

708
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:18,619
Like finding in a drawer
a photo of the whore at age nine

709
01:12:22,187 --> 01:12:24,681
or letting you be with me

710
01:12:24,834 --> 01:12:27,059
knowing that when
the magic is over

711
01:12:27,212 --> 01:12:29,821
you'll be with a woman
like me in Montevideo

712
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:36,719
My baby.

713
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:29,351
You have to go.

714
01:16:33,149 --> 01:16:33,762
A client.

715
01:16:33,954 --> 01:16:35,220
Can't let him down.

716
01:16:37,867 --> 01:16:39,555
He's Japanese, pays very well.

717
01:16:42,432 --> 01:16:43,430
Will I see you later?

718
01:16:50,104 --> 01:16:51,370
You can't stay.

719
01:17:03,454 --> 01:17:04,605
What's wrong?

720
01:17:05,948 --> 01:17:07,214
Want to marry me?

721
01:17:09,209 --> 01:17:10,244
To redeem me?

722
01:17:17,456 --> 01:17:18,799
I'm thirty.

723
01:17:20,372 --> 01:17:21,983
I could't live any other way

724
01:17:23,364 --> 01:17:24,975
and don't know if I'd want to.

725
01:17:26,510 --> 01:17:27,507
Don't be a jerk.

726
01:17:29,463 --> 01:17:30,614
Run out of money?

727
01:17:32,226 --> 01:17:33,108
Screw you!

728
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:37,750
Don't mess up my life
and my work cause

729
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:40,051
you've got a crush and no dough!

730
01:18:01,073 --> 01:18:02,608
Crying one's heart out

731
01:18:03,874 --> 01:18:05,332
Crying a flood of tears

732
01:18:06,329 --> 01:18:09,014
Crying over digestion and sleep...

733
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:12,620
Crying at ports and portals...

734
01:18:13,771 --> 01:18:16,073
These fellow tears,
these yellow tears.

735
01:18:17,147 --> 01:18:20,331
To open the faucets
and dams of crying

736
01:18:21,213 --> 01:18:24,282
Soaking one's soul,
one's undershirt

737
01:18:25,165 --> 01:18:27,850
flooding sidewalks and parks.

738
01:18:28,272 --> 01:18:30,612
To swim away from our crying.

739
01:18:31,993 --> 01:18:34,755
To study anthropology crying.

740
01:18:35,944 --> 01:18:38,246
Attend family birthdays crying.

741
01:18:39,857 --> 01:18:41,890
Going across Africa, crying.

742
01:18:43,463 --> 01:18:45,918
Crying like an owl or a crocodile.

743
01:18:47,069 --> 01:18:49,908
if it's true that owls
and crocodiles always cry.

744
01:18:50,828 --> 01:18:53,284
Crying it all out, but well

745
01:18:54,204 --> 01:18:55,547
with the nose

746
01:18:56,007 --> 01:18:57,350
the knees

747
01:18:57,772 --> 01:19:00,189
crying through navel and mouth.

748
01:19:00,956 --> 01:19:03,526
Crying out of love, hatred, joy.

749
01:19:04,178 --> 01:19:07,094
Crying in a tux,
for flatulence or gauntness.

750
01:19:08,245 --> 01:19:10,776
Crying by improvisation, by rote.

751
01:19:11,736 --> 01:19:13,615
Crying through all insomnia

752
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:15,994
all day long.

753
01:19:39,778 --> 01:19:41,964
Where's Gustava?
-In jail.

754
01:19:43,767 --> 01:19:45,570
Thirty days, this time.

755
01:19:45,762 --> 01:19:49,292
Public disorder and
who knows what other shit.

756
01:19:56,695 --> 01:19:58,038
Bitch!

757
01:20:00,493 --> 01:20:03,294
I'm writing to my ex-wife,
the last one.

758
01:20:04,444 --> 01:20:06,516
Know what she's asking for?

759
01:20:06,823 --> 01:20:08,204
Money!

760
01:20:09,815 --> 01:20:10,966
Shall we go eat?

761
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:13,191
Don't have a poem.

762
01:20:13,805 --> 01:20:17,602
Forget it, today it's on me.

763
01:20:17,986 --> 01:20:20,211
I came into some money.
We're rich.

764
01:20:21,055 --> 01:20:22,091
How's Gustavo?

765
01:20:22,628 --> 01:20:25,428
Fine! I went to see him yesterday.

766
01:20:25,773 --> 01:20:29,188
He's great,
earning a fortune in jail.

767
01:20:29,494 --> 01:20:33,791
The motherfucker shapes bread
into cocks inscribed:

768
01:20:33,983 --> 01:20:38,126
"Smile. A politician
is fucking you right now."

769
01:20:40,197 --> 01:20:42,576
I came for a month
and stayed a year.

770
01:20:42,883 --> 01:20:44,609
I like it here.

771
01:20:45,184 --> 01:20:47,256
On that trip I met a woman.

772
01:20:47,678 --> 01:20:49,826
You can't imagine what it was like.

773
01:20:50,478 --> 01:20:53,624
She gave me these blow jobs
that made me her slate.

774
01:20:53,854 --> 01:20:56,002
Her 'slave'!
- If you like.

775
01:20:56,885 --> 01:21:00,491
That's why I stayed a year.
Then things started to sour.

776
01:21:00,874 --> 01:21:03,713
You can't base
your whole life around that.

777
01:21:05,785 --> 01:21:06,897
But I like it...

778
01:21:08,585 --> 01:21:10,580
I like this nuthouse a lot.

779
01:21:12,421 --> 01:21:16,065
Even before I first came here
I knew I would.

780
01:21:17,370 --> 01:21:20,630
I dreamed of seeing
the country of Cartazar.

781
01:21:20,822 --> 01:21:21,781
Borges

782
01:21:22,318 --> 01:21:23,853
Biay Casares...

783
01:21:24,697 --> 01:21:25,963
It was an obsession.

784
01:21:27,727 --> 01:21:29,492
With other countries

785
01:21:29,914 --> 01:21:32,484
it's easy to imagine how they are.

786
01:21:33,136 --> 01:21:36,627
But with Argentina,
it's not easy.

787
01:21:39,044 --> 01:21:41,960
It's chaos.
You don't know where it'll lead.

788
01:21:43,225 --> 01:21:46,793
The promise of heaven and hell
at the same time.

789
01:21:48,021 --> 01:21:49,095
Fascinating.

790
01:21:50,399 --> 01:21:52,164
Besides, you know what?

791
01:21:52,662 --> 01:21:56,537
At home everything
is planned, calculated.

792
01:21:57,803 --> 01:21:59,759
Even my death is planned.

793
01:22:01,064 --> 01:22:04,286
Here, I can still dream
many different lives.

794
01:22:06,971 --> 01:22:08,544
A nice country.

795
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:10,577
It has a great future.

796
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:15,219
The only thing missing
is how to survive the present.

797
01:22:17,636 --> 01:22:19,094
Now, let's eat.

798
01:22:20,168 --> 01:22:22,239
Didn't write anything. We'll pay.

799
01:22:22,776 --> 01:22:26,344
No need for poems now.
I'm getting married.

800
01:22:27,533 --> 01:22:28,684
Congratulations!

801
01:22:28,761 --> 01:22:30,334
Thank you.

802
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:33,786
You have to come to the party.
Where's Gustavo?

803
01:22:34,553 --> 01:22:38,888
He's having a show.
But he'll be at the party. When is it?

804
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:40,077
Next month.

805
01:22:40,806 --> 01:22:41,650
Just right!

806
01:22:42,609 --> 01:22:44,297
Steaks, as usual?

807
01:22:45,448 --> 01:22:48,555
No meat for me.
A big salad with everything.

808
01:22:48,824 --> 01:22:49,936
And you?

809
01:22:50,166 --> 01:22:52,775
A rib steak, fries and wine.

810
01:22:54,463 --> 01:22:55,806
Turning vegetarian?

811
01:22:56,573 --> 01:22:57,494
Yes.

812
01:23:04,284 --> 01:23:05,012
What is it?

813
01:23:06,969 --> 01:23:08,043
I have an idea.

814
01:23:21,623 --> 01:23:24,423
Keep this up
and I'll see a lot of you.

815
01:23:26,994 --> 01:23:29,909
Them too,
they must've robbed a bank.

816
01:23:38,886 --> 01:23:42,070
We couldn't decide
on a wedding present so...

817
01:23:43,067 --> 01:23:45,292
From your romantic period.

818
01:23:45,484 --> 01:23:47,555
She's still pretty.

819
01:23:48,016 --> 01:23:48,553
Right!

820
01:24:16,825 --> 01:24:19,894
Hey Karina! Meet my pals!

821
01:24:27,375 --> 01:24:28,871
A present for you.

822
01:24:29,024 --> 01:24:30,290
What is it?

823
01:24:32,093 --> 01:24:33,129
A sculpture.

824
01:25:28,792 --> 01:25:31,899
And who dares to say
my heart is crazed?

825
01:25:32,858 --> 01:25:37,653
And who dares to say
my heart isn't crazed?

826
01:25:39,418 --> 01:25:40,454
Look!

827
01:25:46,822 --> 01:25:48,088
There she is...

828
01:25:49,047 --> 01:25:52,000
the great Latin-American female

829
01:25:52,998 --> 01:25:57,064
capable of swallowing a man
through her mouth

830
01:25:57,448 --> 01:26:00,248
and giving birth
to him again and again.

831
01:26:01,974 --> 01:26:04,736
Queen of unpolluted territories

832
01:26:06,079 --> 01:26:09,762
able to repel urban plagues

833
01:26:10,145 --> 01:26:12,754
with the milk
of her sacred breasts.

834
01:26:14,097 --> 01:26:16,820
No duty-free-shop perfume for her!

835
01:26:17,204 --> 01:26:18,969
She smells of the liquids of life

836
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:20,081
secreted

837
01:26:20,350 --> 01:26:22,766
by countless pink vaginas

838
01:26:23,687 --> 01:26:25,912
like tropical fruits.

839
01:26:39,799 --> 01:26:41,871
I've never been to Corrientes.

840
01:26:42,523 --> 01:26:43,674
ll take you there.

841
01:27:42,789 --> 01:27:43,633
Mom?

842
01:28:12,511 --> 01:28:13,854
Hi, darling!

843
01:28:21,641 --> 01:28:22,754
A caffee?

844
01:28:25,132 --> 01:28:26,398
And your husband?

845
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:28,508
We're adults.

846
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:34,569
You glanced at your watch.
Is he very punctual?

847
01:28:38,060 --> 01:28:39,556
Another caffee, please

848
01:28:41,819 --> 01:28:42,778
How are you?

849
01:28:47,075 --> 01:28:48,226
When will you
let things go well for you?

850
01:28:52,676 --> 01:28:53,827
Are you in love?

851
01:28:58,468 --> 01:29:01,000
Come on, tell me. You're in love.

852
01:29:01,154 --> 01:29:03,877
I'll only state my name and number.

853
01:29:04,031 --> 01:29:06,716
Don't be silly.
I'm your wife...Your ex-wife.

854
01:29:10,399 --> 01:29:11,204
And you?

855
01:29:14,388 --> 01:29:16,000
Do you love that ass

856
01:29:16,153 --> 01:29:17,304
who pays your bills?

857
01:29:18,378 --> 01:29:19,874
Let's not start that.

858
01:29:23,672 --> 01:29:26,472
Does he dress you
in saliva negligees, like I did?

859
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:34,758
Some never change.
When will you grow up?

860
01:29:40,321 --> 01:29:41,241
What for?

861
01:29:44,541 --> 01:29:47,226
No, but seriously, tell me...

862
01:29:48,147 --> 01:29:50,793
Got a girIfriend, or still looking

863
01:29:50,947 --> 01:29:52,059
for the one who flies?

864
01:29:56,855 --> 01:29:57,890
It's very hard.

865
01:30:01,343 --> 01:30:01,957
What?

866
01:30:12,813 --> 01:30:13,619
Love.

867
01:30:17,838 --> 01:30:19,603
How to love without possessing?

868
01:30:21,943 --> 01:30:24,398
Or be loved without stifling?

869
01:30:27,390 --> 01:30:30,229
Love is a pretext
to appropriate the other

870
01:30:32,684 --> 01:30:34,718
to enslave the other

871
01:30:36,329 --> 01:30:38,592
to transform the other's life

872
01:30:41,584 --> 01:30:42,582
into your life.

873
01:30:46,264 --> 01:30:48,796
How to love
and ask nothing in return?

874
01:30:50,177 --> 01:30:52,210
And need nothing in return?

875
01:30:54,435 --> 01:30:58,924
If time hadn't passed,
I might feel that was a reproach

876
01:31:01,417 --> 01:31:03,527
I have a feeling you're scared.

877
01:31:04,409 --> 01:31:06,251
You're going through something

878
01:31:06,443 --> 01:31:07,593
big.

879
01:31:11,621 --> 01:31:13,770
Our usual mistake is to think

880
01:31:14,844 --> 01:31:17,030
only of what we're going through.

881
01:31:19,562 --> 01:31:21,826
It seems so important to us.

882
01:31:23,245 --> 01:31:27,465
Nothing about the other person
can be as important

883
01:31:29,690 --> 01:31:32,490
it's often a tragic contradiction.

884
01:31:37,515 --> 01:31:41,198
If time hadn't passed, that
would sound like self-criticism.

885
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:48,333
It's our most frequent mistake.

886
01:31:52,170 --> 01:31:54,471
Wanting the other
to be as we'd like

887
01:31:55,545 --> 01:31:56,696
not as he really is.

888
01:31:59,458 --> 01:32:01,185
When we realize our mistake

889
01:32:02,259 --> 01:32:03,985
sometimes it's too late.

890
01:32:09,356 --> 01:32:10,928
But don't be afraid.

891
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,918
It's not good to be alone.

892
01:32:15,532 --> 01:32:17,066
We grow old too soon.

893
01:32:20,097 --> 01:32:21,133
Who is she?

894
01:32:26,772 --> 01:32:28,383
It's complicated.

895
01:32:32,257 --> 01:32:33,101
Fight!

896
01:32:34,598 --> 01:32:36,516
Don't think about what you'll get

897
01:32:38,242 --> 01:32:39,853
but what she needs from you.

898
01:32:41,503 --> 01:32:42,922
What she expects from you.

899
01:32:45,914 --> 01:32:46,758
Dollars!

900
01:32:51,208 --> 01:32:53,932
Near the end of the world

901
01:32:54,776 --> 01:32:56,809
where my errant boat

902
01:32:59,072 --> 01:33:01,451
rides the waves...

903
01:34:04,747 --> 01:34:05,745
May I?

904
01:34:18,327 --> 01:34:19,095
What is it?

905
01:34:19,785 --> 01:34:23,238
$300. I want you for myself
for three days.

906
01:34:23,391 --> 01:34:26,613
Should give me a discount,
but we won't haggle.

907
01:34:29,989 --> 01:34:31,754
It's $100 each time.

908
01:34:32,521 --> 01:34:37,009
You might make a million and
ask me to spend ten years with you!

909
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:40,424
I'm not for sale, I'm for rent.

910
01:34:42,572 --> 01:34:43,684
I'm a client.

911
01:34:45,295 --> 01:34:46,370
You're a whore.

912
01:34:46,792 --> 01:34:49,055
I have money.
It's nothing personal.

913
01:34:49,861 --> 01:34:50,743
Rob a bank?

914
01:34:51,779 --> 01:34:55,730
No, they published my book.
It's a best-seller.

915
01:34:58,262 --> 01:35:01,484
I have a Japanese client,
just like you.

916
01:35:03,019 --> 01:35:04,553
Are you mad at me?

917
01:35:07,238 --> 01:35:09,271
This is about business.

918
01:35:09,655 --> 01:35:11,727
And sex, of course.

919
01:35:13,645 --> 01:35:15,333
I've no right to get angry.

920
01:35:17,519 --> 01:35:18,593
I'm sorry.

921
01:35:19,898 --> 01:35:22,545
I was a bit rude last time.

922
01:35:23,580 --> 01:35:25,614
You act like a kid sometimes.

923
01:35:26,611 --> 01:35:29,642
But not now.
You're a real man today.

924
01:35:30,601 --> 01:35:33,363
You look like
a lawyer or an accountant.

925
01:35:33,861 --> 01:35:36,163
Someone serious. Not an astronaut.

926
01:35:41,380 --> 01:35:42,301
My fly.

927
01:35:44,564 --> 01:35:45,331
What?

928
01:35:49,743 --> 01:35:51,853
Open it and put your hand in.

929
01:36:20,509 --> 01:36:21,928
I have no more.

930
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:24,652
What?

931
01:36:25,803 --> 01:36:26,954
No more dollars.

932
01:36:27,184 --> 01:36:31,519
I took on a job
just so I could see you.

933
01:36:31,864 --> 01:36:33,629
I want to go to your place.

934
01:36:34,741 --> 01:36:36,199
When I'm done here.

935
01:36:37,772 --> 01:36:39,191
Remember the address?

936
01:36:40,534 --> 01:36:42,068
Be there around four.

937
01:36:43,066 --> 01:36:44,984
I'll see a few clients.

938
01:36:45,291 --> 01:36:46,787
Don't stay here.

939
01:36:48,743 --> 01:36:50,508
Take your money,
you'll pay Iater.

940
01:36:50,661 --> 01:36:53,807
What do I want money for if...

941
01:36:54,152 --> 01:36:55,073
if I'm dying?

942
01:38:22,077 --> 01:38:23,074
YesI

943
01:38:23,688 --> 01:38:25,184
More!

944
01:39:29,095 --> 01:39:31,626
My loneliness is so crowded

945
01:39:34,427 --> 01:39:36,997
so full of nostalgia
and faces of you

946
01:39:38,378 --> 01:39:39,989
of long-ago goodbyes

947
01:39:41,217 --> 01:39:42,598
and weIcoming kisses

948
01:39:44,669 --> 01:39:47,048
taking off
and being left behind.

949
01:39:49,772 --> 01:39:53,569
It's so crowded I can organize it
like a procession

950
01:39:54,567 --> 01:39:57,636
by color, size and promises

951
01:39:58,710 --> 01:40:02,047
by period,
sense of touch and taste.

952
01:40:03,045 --> 01:40:05,768
I tremble no more
to embrace your absences

953
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:09,758
which attend and assist me
with my face of you.

954
01:40:11,561 --> 01:40:13,287
I'm full of shadows

955
01:40:14,131 --> 01:40:16,011
of nights and desires

956
01:40:16,088 --> 01:40:19,540
of laughter and also a curse.

957
01:40:22,302 --> 01:40:24,028
My guests gather

958
01:40:24,259 --> 01:40:25,947
gather like dreams

959
01:40:27,097 --> 01:40:29,821
with new animosities
and lack of candor.

960
01:40:30,550 --> 01:40:31,701
I exorcise them...

961
01:40:32,967 --> 01:40:35,192
I want to be alone
with my face of you.

962
01:40:36,534 --> 01:40:38,452
But your face turns away

963
01:40:39,105 --> 01:40:41,291
eyes of love no longer loving.

964
01:40:41,905 --> 01:40:45,281
Like food searching
for its hunger...endlessly.

965
01:40:45,511 --> 01:40:47,045
They extinguish my day.

966
01:40:48,618 --> 01:40:49,999
The walls leave

967
01:40:51,112 --> 01:40:52,685
the night remains.

968
01:40:53,605 --> 01:40:55,370
Nostalgia leaves

969
01:40:56,406 --> 01:40:57,825
nothing remains.

970
01:40:59,091 --> 01:41:01,278
My face of you closes its eyes.

971
01:41:02,543 --> 01:41:06,380
It's such a desolate loneliness.

972
01:41:10,101 --> 01:41:11,520
I don't remember you.

973
01:41:13,477 --> 01:41:15,088
I have a bad memory.

974
01:41:18,118 --> 01:41:19,269
Who were you?

975
01:41:20,957 --> 01:41:23,144
A sailor on the 'Toronto Star'?

976
01:41:25,791 --> 01:41:27,440
On the 'Havana Maru'?

977
01:41:29,627 --> 01:41:31,928
The astronaut who loved Benedetti?

978
01:41:34,575 --> 01:41:35,496
Can't recall.

979
01:41:35,841 --> 01:41:37,606
But you must.

980
01:41:39,371 --> 01:41:41,480
Tell me your final optimism.

981
01:41:42,555 --> 01:41:44,473
I offer you my last trust.

982
01:41:45,432 --> 01:41:49,114
Hope...so sweet,
so beautiful, so sad.

983
01:41:50,304 --> 01:41:52,375
Such a frail promise is useless.

984
01:41:55,406 --> 01:41:57,861
Still, we must measure each other.

985
01:41:59,549 --> 01:42:01,313
Such tame hope is useless

986
01:42:02,733 --> 01:42:06,531
such submissive,
such feeble, such humble anger...

987
01:42:07,566 --> 01:42:09,830
Cautious fury...it's useless.

988
01:42:11,403 --> 01:42:13,589
Wise anger...all useless.

989
01:42:15,891 --> 01:42:18,499
You're alone, I'm alone.

990
01:42:18,730 --> 01:42:20,418
We're next of kin.

991
01:42:22,182 --> 01:42:24,024
Loneliness can burn.

992
01:42:25,673 --> 01:42:26,747
Don't love me.

993
01:42:28,473 --> 01:42:31,312
Please don't love me.
Don't love me, don't!

994
01:43:05,646 --> 01:43:06,528
Well, Eric

995
01:43:07,948 --> 01:43:09,329
if it doesn't work out

996
01:43:10,096 --> 01:43:13,970
you always have a vagina here
to take refuge in.

997
01:43:14,699 --> 01:43:17,806
Why shouldn't it work,
you jealous old fart?

998
01:43:19,264 --> 01:43:22,525
Corrientes is a fine place
to start a new life.

999
01:43:24,136 --> 01:43:26,515
I'll teach her French and English.

1000
01:43:27,282 --> 01:43:32,000
She'll teach me
how to grow tomatoes and lettuce.

1001
01:43:32,499 --> 01:43:33,420
Whatever!

1002
01:43:34,801 --> 01:43:39,174
That's what Kennedy meant
by "Alliance for Progress".

1003
01:43:40,363 --> 01:43:41,782
But nobody understood.

1004
01:43:45,350 --> 01:43:47,076
Come on guys!

1005
01:43:47,690 --> 01:43:50,452
Let's not part
like 3 crybabies.

1006
01:43:50,644 --> 01:43:51,296
To the bar!

1007
01:44:21,525 --> 01:44:24,517
One moment.
You owe two weeks rent.

1008
01:44:24,939 --> 01:44:26,589
You have to pay.

1009
01:44:27,088 --> 01:44:28,814
I can't wait any longer.

1010
01:44:30,809 --> 01:44:32,803
I'll take care of it right away.

1011
01:44:56,319 --> 01:44:56,971
Hello.

1012
01:44:58,391 --> 01:44:59,196
Who?

1013
01:45:00,462 --> 01:45:02,572
He doesn't live here anymore.

1014
01:45:05,449 --> 01:45:09,285
No doubt about it-
Christ experienced physical love.

1015
01:45:10,321 --> 01:45:12,009
It's curious that

1016
01:45:12,815 --> 01:45:14,119
out of this life

1017
01:45:15,577 --> 01:45:20,333
grew a religion which,
contrary to its founder

1018
01:45:22,328 --> 01:45:25,857
banishes from it's realm
the most basic natural function

1019
01:45:26,855 --> 01:45:31,036
and opposes nothing
more fiercely than physical love.

1020
01:45:32,571 --> 01:45:34,029
I want to make

1021
01:45:35,179 --> 01:45:37,558
a series showing our beloved Christ

1022
01:45:38,056 --> 01:45:40,512
loving naturally.

1023
01:45:41,547 --> 01:45:43,465
Christ making love ?
-Yes.

1024
01:45:44,616 --> 01:45:46,304
The last piece would be

1025
01:45:46,803 --> 01:45:49,373
Christ fucking Death!

1026
01:45:50,025 --> 01:45:52,711
Death clutching her scythe

1027
01:45:52,864 --> 01:45:57,122
her legs spread,
her eyes open, bulging.

1028
01:45:57,659 --> 01:46:00,153
Christ astride her

1029
01:46:01,304 --> 01:46:02,339
serene

1030
01:46:03,222 --> 01:46:04,948
eyes closed

1031
01:46:05,677 --> 01:46:07,211
vanquishing her.

1032
01:46:09,935 --> 01:46:12,390
The triumph of Life over Death
through Love...Well?

1033
01:46:13,771 --> 01:46:16,840
They won't jail you,
they'll crucify you.

1034
01:46:21,981 --> 01:46:22,594
Yes?

1035
01:46:23,745 --> 01:46:25,011
Just a sec.

1036
01:46:25,356 --> 01:46:26,929
Oli, it's for you.

1037
01:46:27,236 --> 01:46:29,576
She called before.
Forgot to tell you.

1038
01:46:34,333 --> 01:46:35,867
l came to visit my dad.

1039
01:46:37,364 --> 01:46:38,783
Want to see me?

1040
01:46:40,317 --> 01:46:42,082
It's free in Buenos Aires.

1041
01:46:47,721 --> 01:46:48,987
Don't go.

1042
01:46:51,366 --> 01:46:55,969
It's bound to fail,
It's part of your immaturity.

1043
01:47:04,332 --> 01:47:06,365
You loathe love
as much as poetry.

1044
01:47:08,475 --> 01:47:09,587
What's the worry?

1045
01:47:10,661 --> 01:47:12,579
You'll get me in the end anyway.

1046
01:47:13,193 --> 01:47:14,536
Dead, you're mine.

1047
01:47:18,986 --> 01:47:20,981
Alive, you're someone else's.

1048
01:47:22,822 --> 01:47:27,809
I've just found the love of my life.
Can't waste time talking to Death.

1049
01:47:33,256 --> 01:47:35,827
Don't wait up, I'll be back late.

1050
01:49:32,829 --> 01:49:34,863
After knowing an ethereal woman

1051
01:49:37,356 --> 01:49:40,118
what does
an earthly one have to offer?

1052
01:49:46,103 --> 01:49:48,711
What difference, living with a cow

1053
01:49:51,013 --> 01:49:54,849
or with a woman whose bum
is 3 feet off the ground?

1054
01:49:57,266 --> 01:50:00,949
I can no longer conceive of
or even imagine

1055
01:50:04,746 --> 01:50:07,048
making love other than flying.

1056
01:50:13,109 --> 01:50:13,838
I love you.

1057
01:50:17,597 --> 01:50:18,403
Me too.

1058
01:50:21,127 --> 01:50:22,508
But I don't need you.

1059
01:50:27,380 --> 01:50:27,840
We've flown together.

1060
01:50:32,904 --> 01:50:34,400
What else do we need?

1061
01:50:55,691 --> 01:50:56,611
A whisky.

1062
01:50:59,143 --> 01:50:59,949
What happened?

1063
01:51:00,793 --> 01:51:03,171
Did she take you flying
and drop you?

1064
01:51:05,780 --> 01:51:08,043
I warned you you'd get hurt.

1065
01:51:08,733 --> 01:51:11,265
Better hurt than asleep,
like before.

1066
01:51:12,877 --> 01:51:14,027
You enjoy suffering?

1067
01:51:15,715 --> 01:51:18,055
Pain may remind you you're alive.

1068
01:51:21,163 --> 01:51:22,313
That's what love is

1069
01:51:23,196 --> 01:51:25,459
you stupid Death, just that.

1070
01:51:29,525 --> 01:51:32,901
How to explain?
lf you understood, you'd be alive.

1071
01:51:46,251 --> 01:51:47,901
Ana broke my heart

1072
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:50,855
and thus gave it life.

1073
01:51:52,236 --> 01:51:53,617
You'd never understand.

1074
01:51:54,959 --> 01:51:56,302
My poor Ana...

1075
01:51:57,223 --> 01:51:58,565
My beloved Ana...

1076
01:51:59,793 --> 01:52:02,632
I could never pay you
for what you did to me...

1077
01:52:05,624 --> 01:52:08,501
casting light
on the dark side of my heart.

1078
01:52:12,184 --> 01:52:14,562
Why did you choose to stay poor

1079
01:52:15,713 --> 01:52:17,362
while leaving me so rich?

1080
01:52:30,175 --> 01:52:31,173
Let's go, Mom.

1081
01:53:06,005 --> 01:53:06,926
To life!

1082
01:53:08,575 --> 01:53:09,688
No offense.

1083
01:53:30,441 --> 01:53:32,858
I propose to build a new canal

1084
01:53:33,932 --> 01:53:36,733
without dams, without damn-you's

1085
01:53:38,114 --> 01:53:39,955
linking your Atlantic gaze

1086
01:53:40,147 --> 01:53:41,643
and my Pacific nature.

1087
01:53:45,172 --> 01:53:46,515
Let me tell you right away.

1088
01:53:48,970 --> 01:53:51,233
l can forgive many things.

1089
01:53:52,039 --> 01:53:54,532
But on one thing I'm intransigent.

1090
01:53:55,645 --> 01:53:56,297
On no account

1091
01:53:56,565 --> 01:53:59,634
will I forgive a man
who cannot fly.

1092
01:54:01,054 --> 01:54:03,969
If he can't,
he's wasting his time with me.

1093
01:54:11,181 --> 01:54:14,672
Excuse me, may I use the phone?

1094
