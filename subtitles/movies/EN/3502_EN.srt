1
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,073
Hi! Hi! Hi!

2
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,998
Does it hurt?
Okay.

3
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,594
- Name?
- Kevin Abdela.

4
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,475
Kevin Abdela. Good, Mary.
You'll be fine.

5
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,550
So, fine.
She has to keep it on for four weeks.

6
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,592
Even when the pain stops,
she has to keep it on.

7
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,792
Let's wrap it up in ten minutes, folks, please!
Ten minutes, thank you!

8
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,831
- Najeeb?
- Yeah?

9
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,591
- We take two more, each.
- Two? - Ok, we can have four more.

10
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,712
She will have to give her
something for the fever.

11
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,431
Three times a day.

12
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,310
Come back here...

13
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,548
Najeeb, stretcher please!
Prepare to operate!

14
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,833
Easy, easy.
Come, come, come.

15
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,717
Tie me on the back.
I need help here.

16
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,110
She can make it. Check her pulse.
She can make it.

17
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,357
I need some light.

18
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,988
- Patient asleep?
- Yes, doctor.

19
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,758
Swabs.

20
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,395
Take the swab.

21
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,398
Clamp.
What's the pulse?

22
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,229
Pulse at 78. Stable.

23
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,079
Okay. Hold tight.

24
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,078
Clamp. Looks stable now.

25
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,311
I didn't think she'd make it.
I've seen that type of injury before.

26
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,796
It's the work of a local villain.
Big Man.

27
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,230
He takes bets with his boys -

28
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,399
as to what sex the child will be.
Then he cuts the girls open to see.

29
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,989
<i>"And Death gave back these
treasures for a song.</i>

30
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,232
<i>The nightingale sang on.</i>

31
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,592
<i>It sang of the quiet churchyard,
where white roses grow -</i>

32
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,360
<i>- where the elderflowers make the air sweet,</i>

33
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:53,078
<i>and where the grass is always green,
wet with the tears of those, who are still alive.</i>

34
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,719
<i>Death longed for his garden.</i>

35
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:02,517
<i>Out through the windows drifted
a cold gray mist as Death departed..</i>

36
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,917
<i>'Thank you, thank you' the emperor said.</i>

37
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,349
'Little bird from Heaven,
I know you of old.

38
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,952
I banished you once from my land -

39
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,755
and yet you have sung away
the evil faces from my bed, -

40
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,511
and Death from my heart.
How can I repay you?'

41
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,309
'You have already rewarded me,'
said the nightingale.

42
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,715
'I brought tears to your eyes,
when first I sang for you.

43
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:40,313
To the heart of a singer, those are
more precious than any precious stone.

44
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,514
But sleep now, and grow fresh and strong
while I sing. '

45
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,478
He sang until the emperor fell
into a sound, refreshing sleep, -

46
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,559
a sweet and soothing slumber. "

47
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,636
She used to read it to me
before I'd go to sleep.

48
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,355
- I think it's good, that he did it.
- So do I.

49
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,677
Hey, Hanna. This is my mother.
This is Hanna.

50
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,633
- You're the one they'll be staying with?
- Yes.

51
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,071
I think Christian is looking forward
to getting back home, right?

52
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,877
It's so hard to believe she's gone.

53
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,151
Christian?

54
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,355
I just want to tell you,
that you did really well.

55
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,314
I'm really proud of you.
Mom would have been too.

56
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,557
You don't have to say something
all the time, dad.

57
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,389
We can talk, can't we?

58
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,872
You don't have to on my account.

59
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,508
- Are you ready?
- Coming.

60
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,472
- Good morning, Mohammed.
- Good morning, sir.

61
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,953
Ok, let's go.

62
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,598
Hello.

63
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,710
Hello, my darling.

64
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,518
- Welcome.
- Hi, mom.

65
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,436
Here's so much space. Lots of peace
and quiet. I won't bother you.

66
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,668
Internet has been installed for you,
and you can choose which room you want.

67
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,390
- This is the smallest room.
- It's fine.

68
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,799
- You don't have to decide now.
- Can I choose myself or can't I?

69
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,788
Of course, but your desk and
your bed won't fit in here.

70
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,879
But you decide.

71
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,477
Your call.

72
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,640
The view is great.

73
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,951
You'll get it.

74
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,830
What's up, ratboy?

75
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,476
- Got air in your tyres?
- Lost your bottom jaw?

76
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,240
- Excited?
- Yes.

77
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,989
- Want me to come with you?
- No. Of course not.

78
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,515
- Take care.
- Yep.

79
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,715
- See you.
- Crawl between our legs, rat.

80
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,708
- Go home and eat some cheese.
- Aren't you a rat?

81
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,754
- Is there a problem?
- Walking fountain.

82
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,270
- Damn swede.
- Mutant! Damn you're ugly!

83
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,236
Fucking rat!

84
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,917
Please sit down and try to be quiet.

85
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,708
Sit down!
Whose is this?

86
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,876
This is Christian.
Be quiet.

87
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:35,191
Christian lived in lots of countries
and has just moved here from London.

88
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,632
- Does he speak danish?
- Of course he does, Trine.

89
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,873
Well, I'll just mark your
birthday on the calendar.

90
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,992
- When's your birthday?
- July 7th.

91
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,469
The same as Elias.
That's quite funny.

92
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,469
That's quite funny.
Be quiet.

93
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,956
You can sit next to Elias then.

94
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,719
- Stop it!
- Poor you!

95
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:14,438
Then we can talk about London during form time.
That'll be fun.

96
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:19,236
Now please get out your history books.

97
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,435
I don't wanna fight you.

98
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,591
No!

99
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,670
- Want to borrow my bicycle pump?
- No thanks. It's alright.

100
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,350
The took the valves too.
They always do that.

101
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,030
- I'll just walk. It's okay.
- Why not take some from the other bikes?

102
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,717
- Then he'll have to walk.
- Then today is his turn.

103
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,911
- Here.
- Thanks.

104
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,396
Letting other peoples' tyres down?
And who the hell are you?

105
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,709
I'm Christian.

106
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,230
Christian?
What are you doing with ratboy?

107
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,512
- Ratboy?
- Yeah, he's got the teeth of a rat.

108
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,233
I don't go around looking in other
peoples' mouths.

109
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,839
You're supposed to catch it.

110
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,077
And you'll just walk home, ratboy.

111
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,510
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

112
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,790
I'm really sorry.

113
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,991
- Want me to help you?
- No, I'm ok.

114
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,430
- You sure?
- Yeah.

115
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,160
I'm really sorry.

116
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,713
That one was really stuck in there.
How many did you eat?

117
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,319
Hi sweetheart.

118
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,113
- How was your day?
- It was alright.

119
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,915
- Look at me? Are you sure?
- Yes.

120
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,471
- Sure?
- Yes.

121
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,911
If you lie to me, I'll eat you up!

122
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,550
Me too!

123
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,156
Leave me alone!
Just leave me alone.

124
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,998
Elias...

125
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,877
I hate you.

126
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,398
- Aren't you sleeping?
- No, I had to finish my game.

127
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,951
- Is that blood on your shirt?
- We were playing soccer.

128
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,915
- Did someone punch you?
- No. It was an accident.

129
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,792
Won't you come down to the kitchen
and keep me company?

130
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,310
- That'd be nice.
- I'll be right there.

131
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,916
- Hi dad!
- Hi sweetheart.

132
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,113
- It's so good to see you.
- You too. I missed you.

133
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,991
- How are you?
- How was your trip?

134
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,270
Long. But alright.

135
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,638
Hi..

136
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,159
Hi.

137
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,672
Morten made you a present,
in case you were hungry.

138
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,360
- Did you get a haircut?
- No.

139
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,309
It was good hearing from you, Elias.

140
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:43,514
But now we'd like to talk to your parents
alone, if that's okay?

141
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,354
<i>- What do you say?
- Let's be reasonable.</i>

142
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,599
Elias isolates himself a lot.
We have to relate to that.

143
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,634
His tyres are let down every day.
The other kids call him ratboy.

144
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,230
It's not Sofus who lets his tyres down.

145
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,558
Made not him personally, but
he has his own little mafia.

146
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,991
He's behind it.

147
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,317
We shouldn't give Sofus too much credit...

148
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,559
Other pupils' tyres are let down too.

149
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,832
We are of course aware of that.

150
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,394
It's not an easy situation for Elias...

151
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,473
With you, Anton, who travels a lot.

152
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,275
It must be hard for Elias,
that his father is away so often.

153
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,359
And if there are other
problems between you...

154
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:53,032
- What problems are those?
- Your separation, Marianne.

155
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,629
Let me tell you something.

156
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,791
Don't you interfere with our personal life.

157
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,560
That has nothing to do with anything!

158
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:09,312
No, stop. I'm shocked that we
have to listen to this.

159
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:15,231
We'll end up having to move Elias
to another school, because Sofus is a...

160
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,754
...sadistic little psychopath!

161
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,669
If we could try -

162
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,759
to be a little constructive,
what do you suggest?

163
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,397
Maybe you should try
buying some flowers for mom?

164
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,155
Or some chocolate.

165
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,595
- You're even uglier up close.
- Fuck off!

166
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,439
Shut up. You're from Sweden.

167
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,394
- Kiss my shoe if you want to pass.
- What's up, loser?

168
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,596
You're so gross.

169
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:37,708
What's up, Elias? You know, yesterday?
If anyone asks...

170
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,993
- I won't tell.
- Nothing happened to him.

171
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,956
<i>Just keep your mouth shut.</i>

172
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,152
If you talk, you're dead.

173
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,429
- Never touch me again!
- I won't do anything.

174
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,393
Not me or anyone else.

175
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:14,232
I don't give a fuck if you die.
Do you understand?

176
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,268
Hide the knife. You'll be expelled.

177
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,195
We changed your medication.
You might get a little confused.

178
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,550
Did you eat anything yesterday?

179
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,709
It ate it all.
Pork roast. It was delicious.

180
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,037
- Then you are getting really confused, huh?
- Marianne?

181
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,388
They have called twice from Elias' school.
You have to call them back.

182
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:51,071
- You forgot to turn on your cellphone.
- I don't have it on me.

183
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,872
- You're lying, Elias. Why are you lying?
- I'm not lying.

184
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,913
Christian admitted that he had a knife.

185
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,918
He hit him several times in the head with a bicycle pump.

186
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,715
I only saw them hitting each other.
There was no knife.

187
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:18,389
Listen to me. Elias just told us
that you had a knife.

188
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,512
- I didn't have a knife.
- Okay.

189
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,631
If everyone is lying, then you tell me the truth.

190
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,991
He hit me.
Then I hit him.

191
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:34,912
- You hit him with a bicycle pump?
- I had to.

192
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,153
He's much bigger than me.
He was going to beat me up.

193
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,989
Elias, this is serious.

194
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,679
He might go blind on one eye.

195
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,270
Then he should leave people alone.

196
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,319
Hi.

197
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,512
- Hi, Marianne.
- Where is Elias?

198
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,469
- They are talking to the police.
- What happened?

199
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:17,674
It was a vicious assault.
Apparently there was a knife involved.

200
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,555
- That can't be right.
- That doesn't sound like Christian.

201
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,275
- They haven't found one.
- What has this got to do with Elias?

202
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,438
- Did Elias hit Sofus?
- We don't know.

203
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,316
The police are interviewing them, and
then we will find out what happened.

204
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,918
Is it true, that Sofus has been blinded?

205
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,759
- Who told you that?
- The police.

206
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,954
No. He will have a headache, and
probably get a scar, but he will be alright.

207
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,872
It could have been much worse.

208
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,794
Why didn't you tell me that he hit you?

209
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,276
Then we could have talked to him
and his parents.

210
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,950
- A lot of kids saw it.
- That's no answer.

211
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,599
If I hadn't fought back, then everyone
would think I was weak.

212
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,034
Just tell me if he had a knife.
I promise I won't tell anyone.

213
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,869
He didn't have a knife.
Stop asking.

214
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,634
If you hit him, then he will hit you.
It will never end.

215
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,310
Don't you understand?
That's how wars start.

216
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,559
Not if you hit hard enough the first time.
You don't know a damn thing about it.

217
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,231
It's like that in every school.
Now no one dares touch me.

218
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:54,316
I'm not going to ask you about the knife again.
You understand?

219
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,149
But I want you to know that
you can tell me everything.

220
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,871
Understand?

221
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,233
Yes.

222
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,990
<i>- It's me.
- Hi.</i>

223
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,835
<i>- Were you sleeping?
- No.</i>

224
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,631
What are you doing?

225
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,752
I'm at a discotheque.

226
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,070
<i>What do you want?</i>

227
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,436
<i>Just talk.</i>

228
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,509
<i>I'm bored without you.</i>

229
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,076
<i>- Did you talk to Elias?
- Of course.</i>

230
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,716
I miss you.

231
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,270
Don't do that.

232
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,074
I told you I was sorry.

233
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,232
And I mean that from the
bottom of my heart.

234
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,759
I was quite proud of us actually.

235
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,832
<i>I was.</i>

236
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:04,673
<i>Proud that we weren't like all the other idiots,
who just give up and get divorced..</i>

237
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,792
I was proud that we loved each other.

238
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,755
We still do.

239
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,111
But Anton...

240
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,315
I messed up big time.

241
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,476
I tried...

242
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,958
<i>I tried to explain, how it got that far -</i>

243
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,709
and I was so stupid.
I tried...

244
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,671
You only paid attention to her,
every time you were home.

245
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,273
<i>It still hurts.</i>

246
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,318
<i>Everything we had together.</i>

247
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,550
And when you were here, it was all lies.

248
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,797
It was all make-believe.

249
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,556
<i>I love you.</i>

250
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,239
<i>I would like to forgive you,
but I can't keep up.</i>

251
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:29,550
- That's how it is. Good night.
- No, wait. Don't hang up.

252
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,479
I think, we can
consider this matter closed

253
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:04,196
All of you messed up.

254
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,955
But you have learned that
no good comes from fighting.

255
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:14,631
- That's right.
- It could have ended much worse.

256
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,071
Now Elias and Sofus shake hands.

257
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,269
- I'm sorry, Elias.
- Good.

258
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,836
And Christian and Sofus.
Please shake hands.

259
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,110
Sorry.

260
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,756
And you'll be back monday,
no hard feelings, ok?

261
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,919
- Looking forward to the theme week?
- Yes.

262
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,351
- The whole school is excited.
- We're looking forward to it.

263
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:47,633
- What will you be doing, Sofus?
- I'm in the weapons group.

264
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,435
- We'll be making muskets.
- Of course you will.

265
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,871
- And Elias?
- I'm in the same group as Christian.

266
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,390
We'll be making a model of The Round Tower.

267
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,755
Want to walk with me, Christian?

268
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,913
No. Come on, Elias.

269
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,391
Here it is.

270
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,671
- Do you want it?
- Thanks.

271
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,349
Cool!

272
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,476
- Christian?
- Yes?

273
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,952
I'm leaving now. I'll try to
make the flight at four tomorrow.

274
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,152
I'll call you.

275
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:22,239
- You can stay for dinner, if you want?
- Thank you, but I should be going home.

276
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,353
- Then maybe in the weekend.
- Just go, dad.

277
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,799
See you.

278
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,673
- Take care, Elias.
- You too.

279
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,837
- Where's he going?
- London.

280
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,908
- Where's your mom?
- She's dead.

281
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:49,030
My parents are in the middle
of a divorce.

282
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,793
- Why did she die?
- She had cancer.

283
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,879
At first they thought, she'd get
well, but she didn't make it.

284
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,469
- She was cremated.
- Okay.

285
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:09,640
Funerals are disgusting. The bodies
rot and seep into the groundwater.

286
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,718
I want to be cremated when I'm dead.
What about you?

287
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:22,071
Perhaps.
I never really thought about it.

288
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,113
- What are we doing here?
- Going up.

289
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,239
- You can do that?
- of course.

290
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,474
Come on.

291
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,598
- Wow, this is crazy.
- Yeah.

292
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,948
I use to come here when I was
home on vacation.

293
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,952
- Where's your house?
- My house?

294
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,838
- Out there somewhere.
- Okay.

295
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,148
It's a long way down.

296
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,271
Yeah, like that.

297
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,272
We were on this silo down by the docks.

298
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,914
You can't do that.

299
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,908
Christian is up there every day.
You can see our house from up there.

300
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,908
I know it.
That's why I tell you not play there

301
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,396
It's dangerous.
Promise me that you won't do it again.

302
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,432
Don't "mmm" me.
Promise.

303
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,756
- Where's the pump?
- Here you go.

304
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,791
- Promise?
- Yeah.

305
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,151
- Promise what?
- That I won't go back up there.

306
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,590
Let's pump it up.

307
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,272
- Put it down here, boys.
- Can we have an ice cream?

308
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,995
- Yes. Put it down gently.
- I wanna try the swing.

309
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,436
Thanks for the help.

310
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,151
Kayaking was so much fun.

311
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,915
- Don't!
- Come on, boys.

312
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,276
Hey! What are you doing?
Morten!

313
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,712
Stop that. What are you doing?
Why are you fighting?

314
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,753
- What's going on?
- He took my swing.

315
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,032
- Why?
- He punched me for no reason.

316
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,596
- Why did you hit him?
- I didn't.

317
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,315
- Why are you fighting over a swing?
- What's going on here, man?

318
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,557
I was just using the swing, and
he came up and started bothering me.

319
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,196
- Don't steal his swing!
- Kids will be kids...

320
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:16,315
I don't wanna see you touch my boy again.
You understand?

321
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,398
- I didn't touch him.
- Get the hell outta here.

322
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,949
Fuck off!

323
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:27,073
What the hell is wrong with you?
Look at me.

324
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:32,229
You're always fighting.
Always fucking trouble with you.

325
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:36,718
- I'm sorry, dad.
- You did nothing wrong.

326
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,435
Doesn't it hurt?
Are we going to the hospital?

327
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:45,589
- No, we're not.
- I'm very sorry.

328
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:51,318
- Shouldn't you call the police?
- Yeah, dad. Call the police.

329
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,200
- No, I won't do that.
- He hit you.

330
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,279
Let's go home.
You can't eat your ice cream in the car.

331
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,153
End of discussion.

332
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,188
- We shouldn't be up here.
- Why not?

333
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,676
- What are you doing?
- Just hanging out.

334
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,110
I gotta get home.

335
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,876
- There he is.
- Who?

336
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,389
The idiot, who hit your dad.

337
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,353
Come on.

338
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,310
- There he is.
- We'll look up his address online.

339
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,274
- Hey! What the hell are you doing?
- Run dammit!

340
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,430
- Hey dad.
- Hey.

341
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,471
Come, sweetheart.

342
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,589
- You okay?
- Sure.

343
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:29,273
- What are you doing here?
- I just wanted to give you this.

344
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,510
I know where the guy who punched you works.

345
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,798
- How did you find out?
- I just did. He works there.

346
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,560
How did you find out?

347
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,196
Christian and I saw him.
It was on his car.

348
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,957
- Have you been up on that silo again?
- No no.

349
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,311
Christian might have been.
He's up there every day.

350
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,318
- But you haven't?
- I haven't.

351
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,875
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

352
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,072
Aren't you going to do something about it?

353
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,796
- Like what?
- Go and beat him up.

354
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,550
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

355
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:19,549
- Are you afraid?
- That's not the point.

356
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,437
You don't go around beating people up.
Nobody benefits from that.

357
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,108
What kind of world would we live in then?

358
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:33,871
He's an idiot. If I beat him up,
I'll be just as big an idiot.

359
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:38,596
I'll go to jail, and you'll have
no dad. He wins.

360
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,679
Maybe mom would like it, if
you weren't such a wimp.

361
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:51,476
I promised mom I'd be home, so I better get going.

362
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,636
Who's the wimp now?

363
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,552
You are.

364
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,870
- Bye!
- Say hi to your mom.

365
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,119
Hello?

366
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,232
Hello?

367
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:26,556
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm looking for a Lars.

368
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:30,469
- Say what?
- Does a Lars work here?

369
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,910
- Lars?
- Lars?

370
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,278
Lars!
Sweden calling.

371
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,959
- Hi.
- Hi.

372
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,277
Remember me?

373
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,916
I'm Anton.
We met on the playground.

374
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:00,511
You slapped me.
Remember?

375
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,029
Yeah, I remember.

376
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:11,749
- What do you want?
- Why did you do it?

377
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,753
- Don't touch my kids.
- I broke up a fight over a swing.

378
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,520
Good for you.
Know what you should do?

379
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,110
Stay away from me and my son.

380
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:28,636
And nothing will happen. Okay?
You understand?

381
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,550
Do you want me to tell
you why you did it?

382
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,197
No, shut the hell up.
And get your ass back to Sweden.

383
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:43,758
- Nobody understands you here anyway.
- Did you hit me because you could?

384
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:47,191
- That's right.
- Maybe you should shut up now, Lars.

385
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,956
Do you want me to hit you again?

386
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:56,836
You're an idiot, who likes to
feel you're in charge.

387
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,193
- You're not.
- Stop it, Lars.

388
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:05,029
- It's alright, boys.
- What do you want?

389
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:10,758
What do I want? I want to show the children
that I'm not afraid of you.

390
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,078
- You can't hurt me.
- You're not afraid of me?

391
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,831
And I can't hurt you?
That's exactly what I can do.

392
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:24,113
I think you should go now.
Take your kids, and go home.

393
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:31,759
- You frightened the children, when you hit me.
- Good.

394
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:36,715
They were very upset, and found out
where you work. That's why we're here.

395
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:41,596
That's very clever of them,
finding out where I work.

396
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,552
Good job.

397
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:48,117
You're such a big idiot, that you can't
even apologize when I'm here with the kids,

398
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,914
but continue to fight.

399
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,157
- Huh? Want some more?
- Let's go home.

400
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,555
Want some more?

401
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,797
Get the hell back to Sweden, you fag.

402
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,917
It didn't hurt.
I'm okay.

403
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,797
Let's go.
Thank you for seeing us.

404
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:16,033
It didn't hurt.
Nothing to be afraid of.

405
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,676
That's all he knows how to do.
He lost.

406
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,792
He's a moron.
You understand?

407
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,752
Understand what?

408
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:30,993
That he's a moron, and not worth our time.

409
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,632
- He's a big moron.
- Exactly.

410
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:38,673
I don't think he feels he lost.

411
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,790
- Maybe not, but he did.
- I'm not sure.

412
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:49,559
- Let's go. We're done here.
- Giant wanker moron.

413
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,594
- Get in the car.
- He was such an asshole.

414
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,076
- Giant wanker moron.
- That's enough.

415
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,831
- Giant wanker moron!
- Put your seatbelt on. Alright, stop.

416
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,673
- Should we let Morten try?
- Yes!

417
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,553
Wait a second. There.

418
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,316
Come on, Morten.

419
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,998
Perfect!

420
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:46,155
No, let go at the same time.

421
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,752
Look at that.

422
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:11,713
- Has the fever gone down?
- Yeah, it's gone down.

423
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,875
That's perfect.

424
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,557
There he is.

425
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:32,238
Everybody's afraid of him, but
no one does anything about it.

426
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:46,997
I'll try to find something we
can use as a fence.

427
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,189
Come here for a second.

428
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,598
Must be something my granddad bought.

429
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,752
We shouldn't keep it here.
It could blow up the whole house.

430
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:46,913
- They're just fireworks.
- You know how much black powder's in this?

431
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,598
Several pounds.

432
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:54,436
- You could make a huge bomb.
- Really?

433
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,552
Yeah. I'll show you online.

434
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,358
He just kept hitting your dad.

435
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:14,432
Your dad might not be afraid, but
he just kept hitting him.

436
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:20,151
If we get back at him, he
might learn his lesson.

437
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,798
- How loud will this be?
- Very.

438
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,675
- Won't anyone hear?
- Not out here.

439
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,430
Hold the bomb.

440
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,597
You want to light it?

441
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,750
You'll have to run.

442
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,838
- You do it.
- Are you sure?

443
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,833
- Run fast, ok?
- Yeah.

444
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:23,113
Fuck, that was sick!

445
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:30,073
Imagine if we use one of the big ones!

446
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:33,636
His car will be blown to pieces.

447
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:37,549
- Whose car?
- That asshole, Lars'.

448
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,469
- You want to blow up his car?
- Sure.

449
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:46,555
Someone will find out.
A car is really expensive.

450
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:50,230
- Your dad will be pleased.
- I'm not so sure.

451
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:55,070
Doesn't matter. No one will find out.
Are you in or out?

452
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,555
I'm not sure...

453
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:06,111
If you're not in, I would like
my knife back right now.

454
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,033
- Easy, easy.
- Stretcher! Stretcher!

455
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,512
Lift.

456
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,790
Keep on moving.
There's a pulse.

457
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,350
Move on! Up, up, up.

458
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:13,078
Prep the patient.
Put down IV.

459
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,236
Antibiotics.

460
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,959
- Thank you. Patient asleep yet?
- Yes.

461
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,878
Let me take a look.

462
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,112
Swab. Thank you.

463
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,440
Swab. Hold that please.

464
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:49,878
Tell him she's alive.

465
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:54,310
We've done all we can.
Now we must wait and see.

466
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,914
- Thank you, doctor.
- Ask him what happened.

467
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:12,751
People came in cars.
His wife could not run fast.

468
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,919
The Big Man cut open two
other girls, who died.

469
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,870
We'll know tomorrow.

470
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:41,397
- What have you got there?
- Nothing special

471
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:45,397
If it's nothing special,
then I can see it.

472
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:49,158
Mom, you can't do that!

473
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:58,191
Elias, this is a knife. Have you
been lying to me and to the police?

474
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:02,154
- Have you gone mad!?
- No.

475
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:05,875
- What the hell is going on?
- Nothing.

476
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,791
Nothing?

477
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:00,316
Christian...

478
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,278
Christian.

479
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,950
What the hell were you thinking?

480
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:10,755
Stabbing someone?
You want to ruin your life?

481
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:14,396
Look at me.
Look at me, Christian.

482
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,358
Look at me!

483
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:25,831
Christian... I love you.
But this isn't easy for me either.

484
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:28,554
We have to talk to each other.

485
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,910
Did you fuck her?

486
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,949
Did you fuck Elias' mom?

487
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:43,233
- Why would you say that?
- You want to, I can tell.

488
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:47,069
You achieve nothing by acting like this.

489
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:52,033
- You said we should talk.
- Stop it, right now!

490
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,515
Stop thinking and saying crap like that.

491
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:58,110
- It's not crap!
- It's crap!

492
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:02,472
- Is that why you're upset with me?
- You're such a liar!

493
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:05,638
Mom knew you were lying.
Everyone knows you're lying.

494
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:12,920
You know what, Christian?

495
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:17,352
If mom could see you know, she would
be very unhappy to see -

496
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:21,473
what you've become.
Why do you say such mean things?

497
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:25,389
- What did I do to you?
- I don't care who you're banging.

498
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:29,149
You don't tell me what's
right and wrong.

499
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:33,990
This is wrong. And illegal.
Never bring a knife to school again.

500
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,270
Do I make myself clear? Never!

501
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:41,592
You wanted her to die.

502
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,950
- No I didn't.
- Yes, you did!

503
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:50,270
You can't just say it was the
best thing for her.

504
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:54,519
She didn't want to die, and you gave up.
I can't stand people, who give up.

505
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,950
- Okay?
- Christian...

506
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,549
- Hi, Sofus.
- See you later. Have a nice day.

507
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:35,469
I didn't tell.
My mom found the knife and freaked out.

508
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:40,910
- Don't you believe me?
- Just leave me alone.

509
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:44,157
Don't text me any more.

510
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,800
It hurts all the way into his hand.

511
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,039
I can imagine that. I'm gonna give
him some pills and it will get better.

512
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,838
Easy. Easy. Stay calm.

513
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:37,876
Are you doctor?

514
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:40,513
Yes, I am.

515
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:45,035
Can you fix my leg?

516
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:03,275
I want to keep it.

517
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:08,150
- I don't want you to cut if off.
- I can try.

518
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:14,312
You can't have any weapons in the camp.

519
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:22,033
- I decide that!
- No.

520
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,796
I decide.

521
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:31,069
Weapons and cars gotta be far
away from the camp.

522
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:52,638
It's Big Man. He's the one,
that cuts the pregnant women.

523
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:55,751
He's a monster.

524
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:11,797
Cars gotta go away.
Cars and weapons gotta go far way from the camp.

525
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,959
Otherwise I can't treat you,
and you might lose your leg.

526
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,876
Nurse...

527
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:50,997
Nurse?

528
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:23,793
Don't help Big Man.
He's evil.

529
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:29,679
- Why do you want to help Big Man?
- Because I have to.

530
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:37,273
- He killed all my babies.
- I'm so sorry.

531
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,835
- He's evil.
- I have to go.

532
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,955
You are a strange man.

533
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,837
I think it's malaria.
I'm treating her for malaria.

534
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,792
She will be well in two, three days.

535
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:01,834
I thought we agreed upon
only two here at a time.

536
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,470
Take it easy, doctor.
See what they've brought me.

537
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:10,430
They leave now.

538
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:23,318
Still bad.
Why is it taking so long?

539
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:27,877
It's a bad infection.
It takes time. Okay?

540
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:30,719
I have to regain my strength.

541
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:35,390
You see Omar over there?
He wants to take my position.

542
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:47,309
- Are you my friend?
- No, I'm not.

543
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:50,913
But I'm doing my best to help you.

544
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,955
Everybody has killed here.

545
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:57,553
Men, women, children.

546
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:03,755
As long as I don't kill you,
we could be friends.

547
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:10,440
I can be a very powerful friend.

548
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:14,398
Answer me!

549
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:04,798
Bag.

550
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,670
- Bag.
- Anton.

551
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:15,478
Anton!

552
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:17,910
- She's gone.
- Bag.

553
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,031
She's gone.

554
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:24,909
- Anton.
- Bag.

555
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:30,353
- Check her pulse.
- Please, Anton, stop.

556
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:34,314
- She can make it.
- Look at me. She's gone.

557
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:36,998
She's gone.

558
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:50,556
Help me please.

559
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:25,120
Little pussy, big knife.

560
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:29,676
- What did you say?
- Little pussy, big knife.

561
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:35,030
Are you done with her?
Maybe Omar can have her.

562
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:38,391
Omar likes things, that don't move.

563
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:45,434
Now you go. Out.

564
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:50,595
Out, out! You leave! Leave!
Leave right now!

565
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:54,236
If you can stand up, you can go!
Go! Go!

566
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:58,149
You're not sick any more.
You leave! You go!

567
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:04,115
You go! You're not sick!
You leave the camp!

568
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:08,510
Doctor, I'm unarmed.
I've got enemies all over.

569
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:13,191
Not my responsibility.
You go now. You're not sick any more.

570
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:23,955
- Elias. Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, dad.

571
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,473
<i>Good to see you, my boy.</i>

572
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:32,752
Did we talk about calling each other today?

573
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:36,473
I just wanted to talk to you.

574
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:43,437
<i>I've have such a busy day.
I couldn't remember if we -</i>

575
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:46,359
planned to talk today.

576
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,350
<i>You know Christian?</i>

577
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:55,877
His granddad died a long time ago,
and left some fireworks in the barn.

578
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:59,589
<i>Nobody found them.</i>

579
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:06,033
Dad, can you hear me? I have to
tell you something important.

580
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:10,199
Christian made a bomb and he's
going to blow up a car.

581
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:15,238
Hello?

582
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:19,518
Dad?

583
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:24,800
<i>I'm here.</i>

584
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:33,074
<i>Could we... I have had
a very stressful day.</i>

585
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:37,717
Could we talk again tomorrow, same time?

586
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:43,558
Are you okay?
You seem weirder than usual.

587
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:46,831
<i>I'm okay.</i>

588
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,878
Can we talk tomorrow?

589
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:54,230
I have to go.

590
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,591
Okay, dad.

591
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:02,192
<i>I love you. Kisses.</i>

592
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:41,558
Come on.

593
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:47,311
I'm in.
I want to make that bomb..

594
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:52,152
Let's blow up the asshole's car.

595
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:56,516
I agree. He deserves it.

596
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:59,716
Come on, we've got classes.

597
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:07,675
What about the other cars?

598
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:11,714
The ones next to it will be hit too.
A lot of windows.

599
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:16,395
- What if there are people?
- There won't be any.

600
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:20,479
- How do you know?
- We'll do it early in the morning.

601
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:24,911
We'll do it sunday, when everybody's asleep,
and no one will get hurt.

602
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:30,595
- I have a soccer match sunday.
- Not a seven in the morning.

603
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:37,953
- Don't be such a pussy.
- I'm not.

604
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,958
You can't back out now.
Let's do it.

605
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:43,549
Sure.

606
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,351
Hold the fuse.

607
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,595
Finished playing?

608
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:23,997
If I died, would you stay here?

609
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:28,432
I don't wanna argue with you.
Don't give me that look. You're not going to die.

610
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:33,878
- I could.
- No, you couldn't.

611
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:37,629
Would you move back to London
or live here with grandma?

612
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:42,231
I would be so devastated that I
wouldn't want to live anywhere.

613
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:45,637
You would have to live somewhere,
even if I wasn't here.

614
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:48,912
Why won't you answer my questions?

615
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:52,396
What do you want me to say?

616
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:59,959
Like you would be homeless, if I died.
Why do you keep lying to me?

617
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:05,757
This is crazy.
I have never lied to you.

618
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:09,475
- Look at me. I haven't lied to you.
- You told me that mom would be ok!

619
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:15,270
- You told me she wasn't in pain.
- I'm just as upset about it as you.

620
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:19,519
I don't think you are.
You wanted her to die.

621
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:23,429
I know it. Admit it already!
You wanted her to die!

622
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:36,758
I did want her to die. In the end.

623
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:42,275
Because she wanted to.

624
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:49,436
I couldn't take it anymore.
And she couldn't take it anymore.

625
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:54,753
She was screaming in pain, and her
brain was eaten away by the cancer.

626
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:58,111
She asked me to help her so many times.
To do it.

627
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:01,756
I couldn't do it, because I knew
how sad it would make you.

628
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:05,270
And if that is giving up,
then I gave up.

629
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:08,118
I gave up.

630
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:12,472
But that doesn't mean that
I wanted her to die.

631
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:21,671
Christian.

632
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:35,038
Are you sure about this?

633
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:36,559
Yep.

634
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:41,792
- You made it bigger.
- Come on.

635
01:21:56,920 --> 01:21:58,399
Okay.

636
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:02,878
We've got about a minute before it blows.
We'll walk calmly back to our bikes.

637
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,594
Don't look back.

638
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:39,959
- No!
- What is it?

639
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:44,517
- Elias!
- Stop!

640
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:48,199
Go back! Back!
There's a bomb!

641
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:56,799
No!

642
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:02,671
- No!
- Elias!

643
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:07,473
Call an ambulance!

644
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:12,274
Elias? Elias!

645
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:37,273
- What have you got?
- Elias, age 12.

646
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:41,473
- He blew up a car.
- How is he doing?

647
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:45,116
Breathing steadily, but unstable pulse.

648
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:47,914
Okay. Someone take care of the mom please?

649
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:53,511
He's got a large open wound in his abdomen.

650
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:01,678
- Any other injuries?
- Stay here.

651
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:13,478
We'll pack the abdomen with tissues
and examine him thoroughly.

652
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:38,196
Listen to me.
What you did, is very bad.

653
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:41,995
But if others are involved,
that's another matter.

654
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:46,309
I have to make sure there isn't.

655
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:51,510
- I did it all on my own.
- With Elias?

656
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:55,599
It was my idea.
He just tagged along.

657
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:00,230
I called the shots.

658
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:04,877
So you haven't talked to anyone online?
Gotten ideas from someone?

659
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:08,834
No. Only the websites I told you about.

660
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:16,757
One of my colleagues are going to
ask you all these questions again.

661
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:02,189
How about your other son?
How's he doing?

662
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:05,358
He's at my mothers.
He doesn't know.

663
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:15,991
I would like you to stay here.
Just...

664
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:21,957
- Just stay here.
- Sure.

665
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:46,235
Christian is out here.
He would like to see Elias.

666
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:49,000
Can I send him in?

667
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:16,032
- How is he?
- Why aren't you with the police?

668
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:21,194
I was. My dad picked me up.

669
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:25,439
- Where's your dad?
- I would like to see Elias on my own.

670
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:31,356
You shouldn't be here.
You hear me?

671
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:35,596
You killed him, you psycho!

672
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:39,236
- You killed him.
- I did?

673
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:44,677
Just stay away, okay?
Just stay away.

674
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:49,351
You killed him because you're such
a spoiled, little brat -

675
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:52,677
who thinks he can control other
peoples' lives.

676
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:56,149
Just get out!

677
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:10,149
That's enough. Stop!

678
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:12,191
Come with me.

679
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:05,790
Marianne, we have the
results of the CT scanning.

680
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,754
No hemorrhaging in the brain.
Minimal free fluid in the pelvis.

681
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:14,636
Most likely from the operation.
And no sign of other injuries.

682
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:17,159
Thank you.

683
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:53,556
That's all from me.
Thank you for the help.

684
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:57,435
- What will happen to them now?
- I couldn't say.

685
01:29:57,640 --> 01:30:00,712
- Could they take him away?
- No.

686
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:04,276
There are mitigating circumstances.

687
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:07,358
It will be a case of malicious property damage.

688
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:10,393
Social services will take over.

689
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:13,797
Remember that your son saved those people.

690
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:19,199
- Hope he gets well soon.
- Thanks.

691
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:19,389
Elias? Elias?

692
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:23,593
Good.

693
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:27,028
I'll just remove this.

694
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:32,470
Look who's here.

695
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:38,873
Hi.

696
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:49,188
- I'm sorry.
- Honey...

697
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:53,669
- Don't be mad at Christian.
- We'll deal with that later.

698
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:58,396
- Later.
- It was my own fault.

699
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:02,278
I wanted to do it.

700
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:06,473
I talked Christian into it.

701
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:10,309
We'll talk about that later.
You just rest.

702
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:22,310
- How could he do such a thing?
- I don't know.

703
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:31,588
He'll be fine.

704
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:36,236
- He'll be okay.
- Yes.

705
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:46,799
I'll take you home, and then
I'm going to the summerhouse.

706
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:51,438
I don't know what to do.

707
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:04,316
Eva said he would hate me.

708
01:35:06,760 --> 01:35:08,990
Do you think he hates me?

709
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:13,794
She was so mean in the end.

710
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:20,235
She was...
She was so mean.

711
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:26,112
Bitter.

712
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:35,158
I don't know how to make it better.

713
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:51,393
He's my little boy, you know?

714
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:14,109
<i>- Yes?
- Is that Marianne?</i>

715
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:17,915
<i>- Yes.
- Hi, Marianne. Claus here.</i>

716
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:21,556
Christians dad.
Sorry to call you at this hour -

717
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:26,470
<i>but I can't find Christian.
Is he at your place?</i>

718
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:30,069
No, he's not here.

719
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:42,431
What was that about?

720
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:49,352
That was Christians dad.
Christian is missing.

721
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:50,310
I'm the one who called.

722
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:54,149
I checked the workshop,
but he wasn't there.

723
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:46,238
Christian! Christian.

724
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:57,392
It's Elias' dad, Christian.

725
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:01,670
Step away from the edge.

726
01:40:11,120 --> 01:40:14,112
Get away from the edge, Christian.

727
01:40:34,120 --> 01:40:36,588
Elias is going to be alright.

728
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:43,548
He's going to be okay.

729
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:58,434
You think I would come up here,
if Elias wasn't going to be okay?

730
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:04,799
I would be with him.
Wouldn't I?

731
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:11,319
He's going to be okay.

732
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:15,836
You have to believe me.

733
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:20,319
So I didn't kill him?

734
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:24,079
No.

735
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:34,115
I thought he was dead.

736
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:38,631
He's alive.

737
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:44,109
And he's going to be okay.

738
01:41:45,920 --> 01:41:48,673
I couldn't picture him.

739
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:54,196
- I don't know if children look younger.
- When they are dead?

740
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:58,152
Adults look like children, when they are dead.

741
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:05,238
I know my mom did.
She looked like a little girl.

742
01:42:08,240 --> 01:42:11,232
Like she never grew up.

743
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:18,276
Like she was never my mom.

744
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:29,789
I miss her so much.

745
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:48,757
Some times it feels, like there's
a veil between you and death.

746
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:54,753
But that veil disappears, when you...

747
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:59,829
...lose someone, you loved
or someone who was close to you -

748
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:04,397
and you see death clearly -

749
01:43:05,240 --> 01:43:07,435
for a second.

750
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:12,111
But later the veil returns -

751
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:16,829
and you carry on living.

752
01:43:18,120 --> 01:43:20,429
Then things will be alright again.

753
01:43:25,160 --> 01:43:27,276
You think so?

754
01:44:21,480 --> 01:44:23,232
Christian?

755
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:32,795
Elias' mom is downstairs, and
would like to talk to you.

756
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:54,830
Ow! Stop it. Just stop it.

757
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:57,634
It's not funny.
Stop it!

758
01:44:59,640 --> 01:45:01,392
Ow! Stop it!

759
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:06,037
- Morten, stop it already.
- That's enough.

760
01:45:06,240 --> 01:45:08,037
Take it easy.

761
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:21,475
- Stop it.
- Morten is so annoying.

762
01:45:21,680 --> 01:45:26,356
- Morten, come on. How are you?
- Look at this. He can't do anything.

763
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:28,278
Stop it!

764
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:31,358
Let's leave them alone and
go to the cafeteria.

765
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:34,233
- I want a Coke!
- You can have a small one.

766
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:37,193
- A large one.
- Didn't you have one when we got here?

767
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:39,914
I would like another one.

768
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:54,989
- Doesn't it hurt?
- They give me these pills.

769
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:06,149
I told the police everything
that happened.

770
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:09,510
Me too.

771
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:16,351
It's weird. I've slept for days,
but I'm still tired.

772
01:46:18,680 --> 01:46:22,639
- I just want to say I'm sorry.
- You don't have to.

773
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:24,759
Yes, I do.

774
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:30,472
- I've been an idiot.
