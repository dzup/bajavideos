1
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:48,772
RAIN

2
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,771
- And some small batteries.
- Okay.

3
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:43,993
<i>As you can see, Mónica, there's
a tailback at the tunnel entrance.</i>

4
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:46,964
<i>The demonstrators keep their claim up
in spite of the rain and the police,</i>

5
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,728
<i>who has been fencing the place
since this afternoon.</i>

6
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:52,804
<i>We will get close and try
to find out what their claim is.</i>

7
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:56,606
Hi.
Marlboro box, please.

8
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,011
And a hip flask of that.

9
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,547
Thank you.

10
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:07,219
Thank you.

11
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,521
Hi... Hi, Mom...

12
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:13,319
Mom?

13
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:14,723
Hello, yes...

14
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:16,829
No, it kept cutting out,
I couldn't hear a word.

15
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,864
Listen, Mom...

16
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:22,499
Fine, I got here fíne...
Yes, I'm working, lots of work...

17
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:26,230
Yes, the town's fíne. Small,
very nice...

18
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,331
I was calling to say happy
anniversary...

19
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,544
Okay, thanks.
Love to everyone.

20
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,976
Okay. Big kiss for all of you.

21
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,340
I can't hear you.

22
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,378
Okay.
I'll call you in a couple of days.

23
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:43,514
I said I'll call you.
No, no, no.

24
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:45,648
No, no, let me call you
in a few days.

25
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,387
Big kiss.
Bye, Mom. Same to you.

26
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,419
No, no, I mean no harm.
Shut the door...

27
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,159
Shut the door!

28
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,661
Please...

29
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,168
I'll get out in a second.

30
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:19,140
<i>Stay put.
Put your hands over the roof.</i>

31
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,506
Sorry.

32
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:44,000
Have it if you want.
I'm not going to fínish it.

33
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,391
- Do you want one?
- No, no.

34
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,228
I've got some,
I bought a pack.

35
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,166
Thanks a lot.

36
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:14,839
It doesn't work.
It got stolen.

37
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,300
Somebody broke the window
and took everything:

38
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,139
The stereo, the spare tire,
the lighter...

39
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:22,675
At least...

40
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,541
it's okay in here.

41
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,384
- It's warm.
- I can turn it off.

42
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,320
The heating...
If it's hot I'll turn it off.

43
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:35,725
No, please, it's fine like this.

44
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:59,942
You're hurt. You'll have
to get it looked at,

45
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:03,954
a pharmacy or something.

46
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:15,964
There's hot water
in this thermos...

47
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:20,102
and there's soap there.
Take it and clean it, disinfect it.

48
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:12,407
- Do you feel well?
- Yeah, yeah... I don't know...

49
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,043
It must have been the heating...

50
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:19,583
- And I've hardly slept these days.
- Yeah, you fell asleep...

51
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,453
Your mobile woke me up.

52
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,747
Maybe there's a message...

53
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,925
Thanks.

54
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:29,555
Well...

55
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,620
- I think I'd better be going.
- Yes.

56
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,666
Thanks a lot foryour help.

57
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,835
What?

58
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,833
Nothing... The ringtone...

59
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,846
Have you got a light?

60
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:02,152
Thanks.

61
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,606
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

62
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:07,213
- Sorry, I didn't mean to bother you.
- No, it's no trouble at all!

63
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:09,015
On the contrary.
Do you mind if I get in the car?

64
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,745
You look like you are pretty
set up in there.

65
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:12,752
I just wanted to thank you.

66
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,419
You've already thanked me twice,
it's enough.

67
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:19,729
I went to a restaurant
and I had some food left over...

68
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:21,060
and I thought you might be hungry.

69
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,964
Who says I'm hungry?

70
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:26,160
¿Where did you get that?

71
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:30,671
I don't know. I just thought...
Good night.

72
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:46,691
Hey! Hey!

73
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,521
Excuse me.

74
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,431
I'm sorry.
I'm taking it out on you and...

75
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,529
Where did you come from?

76
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,470
Silk handkerchief,
imported cigarettes,

77
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,533
prawn dinners, what accent
is that? Spanish?

78
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,846
- I'm Spanish.
- Yeah, you sound like a Spanish.

79
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:10,504
- I'm Roberto. Alma...
- Alma.

80
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:13,545
Because of your phone,
in the car... I sawit.

81
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,647
Do you think
I can get a taxi somewhere?

82
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,719
I doubt it.

83
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,465
Okay, thank you.

84
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:45,979
What do you think of Buenos Aires?

85
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:53,718
I got here four days ago.

86
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,654
It's nice.

87
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,330
Have you been here before?

88
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:01,725
- I was born here.
- Oh...

89
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,994
But I'm Spanish.

90
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:05,866
So you have family here.

91
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:09,097
No, my family is in Madrid.

92
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,542
I'm here on family business.

93
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:14,102
My family is in Madrid,
but they couldn't come.

94
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,681
Because my wife works there,
plus there's the school.

95
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,777
My daughter's school and...
you knowhowit is.

96
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:40,036
Are you from here,
from Buenos Aires?

97
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:42,606
Yes. No need to treat me formally.

98
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,543
- What do you do?
- I write.

99
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:55,980
What do you write? Books?

100
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:57,281
No.

101
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:01,420
I write "New Slimming recipes",

102
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,419
"Ten tips to be happy",

103
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:05,463
"How to decorate
your Christmas table"...

104
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:09,164
I write for a women's magazine,
a bit of everything.

105
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,635
Actually, I write
whatever they tell me to.

106
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,969
At least you have the recipe
for happiness.

107
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,259
Haven't you got another coat?
Your shirt's soaked.

108
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,430
Yes, but I'm fine in here.

109
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:46,193
Hang on.

110
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,380
Where did I put it?

111
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,779
It was a medium-sized box, brown.

112
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:08,189
- This one?
- No, it was like one for oranges.

113
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,888
Here it is.
It was for apples.

114
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:17,468
It's almost new, I got it in Perú
for my husband, he never wore it.

115
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,238
I wear it at home.
It's warm.

116
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,168
Where are you going?

117
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:03,338
I'm going downtown
but drop me where you can.

118
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,278
- Okay, I'll give you a lift.
- No, I don't want to bother you.

119
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,017
I'll give you a lift.

120
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:29,268
Thanks a lot, again.

121
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:32,201
Keep it. I don't need it.

122
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:35,973
Do you think I'll need it?

123
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:38,742
At least until you get to the hotel.
Afterthat, you can do what you want.

124
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:44,589
- Do you want it?
- No, I got my own.

125
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,486
Anyway, I don't smoke. I did today,
but I don't smoke. I want to quit.

126
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,796
Won't you tell me what happened?

127
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:58,066
No.

128
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:04,132
I'm sorry if I caused you trouble.

129
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:07,235
You didn't cause me
any kind of... nothing.

130
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,750
Anyway, I owe you one.

131
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,823
Okay?

132
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:32,976
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

133
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:35,982
Atea with milk.
No, cafe latte, please.

134
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:39,056
- Croissants, toast?
- Okay, a croissant.

135
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:42,124
- You're better off having three.
- No, but I want one.

136
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,860
- It costs the same, you get three.
- Fine, but I only want one.

137
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:46,955
Okay.

138
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:58,935
<i>¿How has it been?</i>

139
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:01,905
<i>We called you last night but you
weren't in. Nina wanted to talk to you.</i>

140
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:03,564
<i>- Dad, Dad...
- Did you get the message?</i>

141
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:09,413
Yeah, I did.

142
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:10,812
<i>Are you watching TV?</i>

143
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,883
Yeah, but there's
something else on here.

144
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:14,816
<i>- What?
- Nina, please, stop it...</i>

145
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:18,719
- I don't know, an old fílm.
<i>- They want to catch...</i>

146
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,088
- Let's see. Laura, Laura...
<i>- What?</i>

147
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:23,752
My flight arrives at 9 a. m.

148
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:26,058
Can we change the appointment
to another day?

149
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:28,893
<i>No, the doctor is going on holiday,
we'd have to wait another month.</i>

150
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:32,992
<i>- Nina, can you stop?
- Are they going to save her, Dad?</i>

151
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,470
Sure, they always
manage to save her.

152
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,007
<i>Who's going to save her, Dad?</i>

153
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:39,733
<i>Nina, put the phone down and eat
your potatoes like a good girl.</i>

154
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:41,141
<i>- No, I don't want them.
- I'll send you with...</i>

155
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:42,144
<i>- I'm talking with your father!</i>
- Let's see...

156
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:45,614
- Shh... Nina, Nina...
<i>She was reading with me and...</i>

157
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:47,309
- Listen...
<i>I don't want them...</i>

158
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:49,649
Listen.
You eat your potatoes...

159
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:54,088
and then you can watch TV.
Okay?

160
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:56,292
And what does my mother say?

161
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:57,827
<i>As if your father
never existed.</i>

162
00:29:57,862 --> 00:30:00,330
<i>Since you went to Buenos Aires she
doesn't want to talk about anything.</i>

163
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:03,796
<i>If you can and if you have time,
buy something for Nina.</i>

164
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:07,528
Sure, I'd already thought of that.
And do you want something?

165
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:08,934
<i>No, just something for Nina.</i>

166
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:13,103
<i>- Come, Mom, come.
- What is it, Nina? Come to Mommy.</i>

167
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:14,678
Can you meet me at the airport then?

168
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,839
<i>Yes. See you in three days
at Barajas.</i>

169
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:28,111
Roberto?

170
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:31,755
Mister Taborda?
Hello.

171
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,890
I came as soon
as I heard you'd arrived.

172
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,752
Howare you?
Howwas yourflight?

173
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:42,562
Fine, thanks.

174
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:45,393
I was fetching his things for you.

175
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:57,413
We put them here
so as not to loose them.

176
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:01,417
Take a look, it's all the things he
had on him when they brought him in.

177
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,748
And the keys to the apartment.

178
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,320
What's the deal with the apartment?

179
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:11,090
It has to be cleared out.

180
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,088
It has to be free in a few days.

181
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,234
And what do the doctors say?

182
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:26,076
There's nothing more they can do.

183
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:31,314
You were friends...

184
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:34,747
Are you friends?

185
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:38,954
No, not friends.
Acquaintances.

186
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:45,120
Did he ask you to look for me?

187
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:49,932
No, he is so reserved...
He didn't ask me for anything.

188
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:00,370
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

189
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:12,978
<i>This is Alma and Andrés'house.</i>

190
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,541
<i>Please leave your message
after the tone. Thank you.</i>

191
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:01,595
Hi, I'm looking
for a Spanish guest, Roberto.

192
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,094
- Last name?
- I don't know.

193
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:06,235
I can't help you
without the last name.

194
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:10,064
But he's a Spanish guest
who arrived a few days ago...

195
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:11,574
Tall, with a beard.

196
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,408
Hang on, let me see...

197
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,405
- He's expecting you, isn't he?
- Yes.

198
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,424
I get a lot of guests
with that description.

199
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:31,552
If you take a seat, I'll let you know
as soon as I fínd anything.

200
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:32,653
- Okay.
- Thanks.

201
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,092
You're welcome.

202
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:40,334
You know what?
It's not that important.

203
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,804
If you do fínd him,
could you give him a message?

204
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:46,465
- Yes, of course. There you are.
- Thank you.

205
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,817
Oh... No...
This is the last one.

206
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:13,497
- Okay, thanks.
- I'll give it to him.

207
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:16,164
Bye.

208
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:24,110
¿Can someone have left this
message foryou?

209
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,276
It could be, yes.

210
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:31,485
- Can I use this phone?
- Yes, sure.

211
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,127
- Hello?
<i>- Hello. Alma?</i>

212
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:39,894
- Yeah.
<i>- It's Roberto...</i>

213
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:42,865
- Oh, Roberto...
<i>- From the other night.</i>

214
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:45,494
Oh, hello! Howare you?

215
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,565
Fine and you?

216
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,400
<i>Fine. Soaked.</i>

217
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:52,174
Did you come by here?

218
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,243
Yes, yes...
Did you get my message?

219
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:56,675
<i>- Yes, sure, that's why I called you.</i>
- Oh...

220
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,982
I was in the area
and I thought I'd pop in.

221
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:02,177
- Sorry I didn't call before.
- That's okay.

222
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,412
- It's a shame I wasn't in.
- Oh...

223
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,351
<i>Well, maybe some other time.</i>

224
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:12,756
Oh... Okay...

225
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,665
<i>I was surprised that you'd come.</i>

226
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:18,564
Yeah, sure.

227
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,732
<i>We'll bump into each
other some other time.</i>

228
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:27,811
<i>- Are you very far from here?</i>
- No, not very far.

229
00:42:27,846 --> 00:42:29,278
I'm quite close.

230
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:31,280
- I'm close.
<i>- Well, I...</i>

231
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:34,077
<i>I've got not much left to do,
you could come here...</i>

232
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,015
or I could go there.

233
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:41,387
Right here. Here.

234
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,957
- Hello.
- Hello.

235
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,727
- I'll meet you at the door, then?
- Okay.

236
00:42:58,108 --> 00:42:59,973
- Hello.
- Hello.

237
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:02,042
- Howare you?
- Fine, and you?

238
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,539
- Sorry.
- No problem.

239
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:11,387
- What happened here?
- Sorry about the mess.

240
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,562
Can I help you?

241
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,838
Been moving for a few days, right?

242
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:31,269
Okay, you can get in.

243
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:46,485
So?

244
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:58,195
- Do you want to save yourself?
- Like everyone, I suppose.

245
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:04,200
So?

246
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:06,467
- So what?
- What shall we do?

247
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:11,772
Well... You came to me.

248
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:14,009
I guess you'll know
where to take me.

249
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:16,610
Yesterday you said
you owed me one.

250
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:22,024
And what can I do for you?

251
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:27,860
I don't know...
Talk to me for a while.

252
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:32,700
- What about?
- Anything. I don't know...

253
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:36,065
What star sign are you,

254
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:38,504
what's yourfavorite
soccerteam in Madrid,

255
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:41,237
what's your favorite food,
whatever.

256
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:45,205
- You want me to talk right now?
- Yes. What star sign are you?

257
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:48,817
- Scorpio...
- Scorpio...

258
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:52,082
And your soccerteam?

259
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:54,414
Real Madrid...

260
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:56,689
Favorite food: Beef.

261
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:02,655
Have you got any pets in Madrid?
Any little animals in your house?

262
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,425
We've got a hamster.

263
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:10,239
Asmall one, brown.

264
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:13,003
What else?

265
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:14,842
What else...

266
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:18,871
I like rallying, but I doubt
you want to talk about that.

267
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:22,284
I do like it.
I'm interested.

268
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:24,553
Do you like rallying?

269
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,797
What's the matter?

270
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:08,127
Excuse me.

271
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:11,657
I'm sorry.

272
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:18,769
- Do you want to go for lunch?
- Yes.

273
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:22,010
- Shall I take you to eat beef?
- Yes.

274
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,595
What do you do in Madrid?

275
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:43,666
I'm an engineer...

276
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,625
and I work in the quality
control department...

277
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:49,672
of a dairy produce factory.

278
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:53,532
I'm a father...

279
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:56,039
I play tennis. I'm awful.

280
00:46:56,213 --> 00:47:00,206
And if you give me a minute,
I'll make you some great paper boats.

281
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:04,052
- Any othertricks?
- What else?

282
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,187
Look.

283
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:14,292
It's silly,
but when you have a kid...

284
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,724
you start to do these silly things.

285
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:19,234
You don't know where they come from,
but you learn to do them.

286
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:23,899
- And you two, don't you have kids?
- Who's "you two"?

287
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:28,802
Well, you and
the Peruvian pullover's owner.

288
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:32,010
No, the Peruvian pullover's owner
and I...

289
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:34,512
haven't any children.

290
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:38,419
And you two?
Have you been together long?

291
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:41,155
- Twenty years.
- Twenty years?

292
00:47:41,758 --> 00:47:43,988
- How do you do that?
- How do you do it?

293
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:47,927
- By doing it.
- Yes, of course.

294
00:47:48,432 --> 00:47:50,696
Our little girl brought us closer.

295
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:52,496
You have a daughter?

296
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:55,700
- What's her name?
- Her name's Nina.

297
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:01,576
And do you teach her
howto make those paper boats too?

298
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:06,214
No, she's not interested.

299
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,518
Must be things that girls...

300
00:48:09,419 --> 00:48:11,410
Maybe if one day we had a son...

301
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:13,723
- You're lucky.
- Maybe he'd like it.

302
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:16,953
My wife wants to have a boy.

303
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:19,460
She goes on about her body clock
ticking away.

304
00:48:19,663 --> 00:48:21,426
She's already 40.

305
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:24,562
You know those things women start
thinking about at a certain age...

306
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:27,569
And what do men knowabout...

307
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:29,969
"those things women
start thinking about?"

308
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:33,041
I live with my daughter,
aged 6, my wife, 40,

309
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:36,373
and my mother-in-law, 65.
You can ask me what you like.

310
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,278
Right. The whole combo.

311
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,281
The whole package.

312
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:50,085
- And you?
- What?

313
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:53,722
- Tell me about you.
- What do you want me to tell you?

314
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:56,455
Whateveryou want.

315
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:03,766
I don't know.
I can tell you... Let's see...

316
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:07,101
You're the fírst I've been able to
talk to for more than 10 minutes...

317
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,144
in the last three days.

318
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:15,249
- Excuse me...
- No, thanks.

319
00:49:19,022 --> 00:49:21,820
- Aren't you going to eat anything?
- No, I'm not hungry.

320
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:25,922
You're not vegetarian or anything
strange like that, are you?

321
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,495
No, not at all.
I love meat,

322
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:30,965
I eat fried food, sweets,
everything that's fattening.

323
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:33,659
It's just that I've not been hungry
these last few days.

324
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:37,633
My sleep schedule is upside down.

325
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:40,369
It's like I fell asleep anywhere.

326
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:43,980
In taxis, waiting rooms...

327
00:49:44,848 --> 00:49:46,611
In my car.

328
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:49,982
Yes, in your car.

329
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:56,623
How did you get hurt?

330
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,385
I cut myself...

331
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:02,826
moving stuff
out of a relative's house.

332
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:10,740
- Let me help you.
- Oh, yes, because...

333
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:20,573
Has it ever happened to you...

334
00:50:21,618 --> 00:50:25,384
that you did things
that you didn't expect to do?

335
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:33,258
Yeah, sure.

336
00:52:26,209 --> 00:52:28,473
<i>Anyway we can get it out here,
through the window.</i>

337
00:52:28,578 --> 00:52:30,944
It's not wide enough.
Why don't we take it from here?

338
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:32,675
Why don't we measure it from here?

339
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:34,717
If the widest part goes out,
the rest will.

340
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:36,647
But bring me pulleys,
some blankets.

341
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,019
There aren't any pulleys, and
I don't think it'd fít in the van.

342
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:43,019
No one told me there was a piano,
so I didn't bring the pulleys.

343
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,957
I didn't know there was
a piano either.

344
00:52:45,028 --> 00:52:46,655
- That's impossible. I...
- Me neither.

345
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:49,358
- I talked to the manager.
- Candore.

346
00:52:49,432 --> 00:52:52,663
Mr. Candore. I told him perfectly
clearly that there was a piano.

347
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:54,703
Yes, but a little piano,
not this.

348
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:57,567
No, we'll have to prepare this
and move it another day.

349
00:52:57,707 --> 00:52:59,072
Friday, Saturday, not sooner.

350
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,235
Listen, I need this out today.

351
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:03,738
Today? Lmpossible.

352
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:06,008
No, it's a problem.
It would be irresponsible of us.

353
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:07,640
Yes, irresponsible.

354
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,546
Plus, we have another
three moves today.

355
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:13,355
Irresponsible is
turning up for a move...

356
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:17,485
like this! This is bullshit.

357
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:19,494
You haven't got tools,
nothing.

358
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:21,086
It's an evil piece...

359
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:23,826
I'll start taking
the boxes from the landing.

360
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:26,425
Yeah, you do that. Why don't you
give the guy a hand, Félix?

361
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:28,537
Yes, of course.

362
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:30,606
A pleasure meeting you, sir.

363
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:34,735
Call Candore.
Let him sort it out.

364
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,532
- Would you get on?
- Where?

365
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:08,702
- The boat.
- The boat? Yes.

366
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:13,273
Where would you go?

367
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:14,815
Reykjavik.

368
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:19,818
- The capital of Iceland?
- Yes.

369
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:23,254
- What's so special about it?
- There's nothing special about it,

370
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:26,122
but I saw it in a film once and I
thought I'd like to go there.

371
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:28,821
And you?

372
00:54:29,633 --> 00:54:31,464
I...

373
00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:34,996
Anywhere that has palm trees,

374
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:37,329
white sand, sea.

375
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:39,101
Reykjavik has the sea.

376
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:42,474
- Oh, so we could go together.
- Yes, but there are no palm trees.

377
00:54:44,714 --> 00:54:48,081
- Besides, we don't know each other.
- No, we don't.

378
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:54,850
Do you travel a lot?

379
00:54:55,025 --> 00:54:57,425
A lot less than I'd like to.

380
00:54:57,627 --> 00:55:01,085
When I was a kid
I wanted to be a sailor.

381
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:05,126
I liked to imagine
what was overthe horizon.

382
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:09,331
Maybe because I lived in Cuenca,
I was trapped in the mountains.

383
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:13,673
- And you?
- What?

384
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,707
What did you want to be
when you grewup?

385
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,877
A singer and a poet.

386
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:22,007
- Do you sing?
- No, terribly.

387
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:26,845
My little girl says
she wants to be an astronomer.

388
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:30,322
I think she believes astronomers
are these men in white coats...

389
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:32,961
- who float about in space.
- Astronauts.

390
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,354
The other day she called me and said:

391
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:38,825
"Daddy, I saw an astronomer
in the window".

392
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,731
You miss her, don't you?

393
00:55:45,775 --> 00:55:48,403
Loads, but I'll see her
in two days.

394
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:53,015
It's weird since I never have been
out of home for so long.

395
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:57,079
Do you want to see a picture?

396
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:07,690
She looks happy.
She looks like you.

397
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:16,265
Do I look happy too?

398
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:20,338
I don't know...

399
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:35,250
What?

400
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:38,461
I...

401
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:41,256
- What's the matter?
- I have to go.

402
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:44,027
- Did I say something wrong?
- No, no, no, no...

403
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:45,795
Look, maybe you do look happy...

404
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:48,130
No, it's not that.

405
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:49,730
It's not that.
There's something...

406
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:51,797
I still have to sort out.

407
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:55,444
I'll go with you.

408
01:00:50,413 --> 01:00:53,143
What is there to do
in this city on a Saturday night?

409
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,783
The same as in anywhere else.

410
01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:57,109
You can go to the movies,
go dancing, go for a drink,

411
01:00:57,186 --> 01:00:58,983
see a show, I don't know...

412
01:00:59,088 --> 01:01:00,646
Whateveryou want.

413
01:01:00,923 --> 01:01:02,481
What are you going to do?

414
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:05,127
I've got a farewell dinner
with some friends.

415
01:01:05,762 --> 01:01:07,525
I have to go.

416
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:11,660
Okay. Then, I'll go.

417
01:01:14,537 --> 01:01:17,404
- We had a good time, didn't we?
- Did we?

418
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,165
- Yes... Or no?
- I don't know.

419
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:23,005
You get into my car.
You ask me to take you to an apartment.

420
01:01:23,279 --> 01:01:26,476
You keep me waiting for three hours,
you bring down 800 bin bags...

421
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:28,983
You get in and you don't say a word.
You don't explain a thing to me.

422
01:01:29,052 --> 01:01:31,145
- I don't know... Who lives there?
- No one lives there.

423
01:01:31,254 --> 01:01:34,417
- I told you, it's a relative's.
- So many secrets!

424
01:01:34,757 --> 01:01:37,055
- Like everyone!
- Everyone what?

425
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:39,928
You too. You get me into your car,
you start crying...

426
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:42,896
- and you don't say a word.
- So what's the secret?

427
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:46,991
You don't tell me anything either.
You are not married.

428
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:49,231
No, I'm alone.
So what's the secret?

429
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:51,674
You told me you were married.

430
01:02:23,806 --> 01:02:25,535
That apartment...

431
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:30,102
It's Agustín's...

432
01:02:31,147 --> 01:02:32,944
My father's.

433
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:37,548
I mean, it was, because...

434
01:02:37,787 --> 01:02:40,221
the bank seized it.

435
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:44,320
And where's yourfather?

436
01:02:46,195 --> 01:02:48,322
He died two days ago.

437
01:02:53,169 --> 01:02:57,230
We hadn't spoken
in more than 30 years.

438
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:01,140
My parents separated...

439
01:03:01,844 --> 01:03:05,148
and my mother took me to Spain.
And since then...

440
01:03:05,183 --> 01:03:07,116
Didn't he have any family here?

441
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:10,275
No family, nothing.

442
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:13,687
His house was a grand piano...

443
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,951
and a single bed.

444
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:24,330
It was what he chose.

445
01:03:24,867 --> 01:03:26,926
What he chose
or what he was left with...

446
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,131
What did you say?

447
01:03:29,372 --> 01:03:32,307
I'm saying, is it what he chose
or what he was left with?

448
01:03:33,209 --> 01:03:35,643
No, it's what he chose.

449
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:38,209
He chose that.

450
01:03:38,514 --> 01:03:41,779
To cut himself off,
disappear and live the life he led.

451
01:03:42,018 --> 01:03:44,543
Well, maybe he couldn't fínd
the way... I don't know...

452
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:47,054
Sometimes you can't choose,
it'sjust what you're left with.

453
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:49,487
When you have a child...

454
01:03:49,592 --> 01:03:52,288
what you can't do is choose.

455
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,194
You have to be there.

456
01:03:54,397 --> 01:03:57,195
You can't disappear overnight...

457
01:03:57,266 --> 01:03:59,496
as if you didn't
have responsibilities.

458
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:01,796
I don't know...
And did you neverthink...

459
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:03,736
maybe it was you and your mother
who disappeared?

460
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,905
I was only six...

461
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:10,506
Look, you wouldn't understand.
You don't have kids.

462
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:13,014
And from what I've seen,
no one to answerto.

463
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:14,547
You can get up, disappear...

464
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:17,676
and not even answer the phone
if you don't feel like it.

465
01:04:17,753 --> 01:04:19,584
Have a nice evening.

466
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:47,576
<i>Good evening.</i>

467
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:50,975
So we meet again once more.
I see many familiar faces.

468
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:52,742
First, let's have
a big round of applause...

469
01:05:52,815 --> 01:05:55,613
forthe sound and effects people...

470
01:05:57,853 --> 01:06:00,447
without whom
this showwouldn't be possible.

471
01:06:00,656 --> 01:06:03,625
I would have liked to be... My mother
would have wanted me to be as well...

472
01:06:05,027 --> 01:06:07,325
to be a crooner,
but it wasn't meant to be.

473
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:10,489
God hasn't given me
the voice orthe ear.

474
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,333
But he gave me a name:
Carlos Alberto.

475
01:06:15,071 --> 01:06:16,436
I hope you enjoy the show.

476
01:06:16,539 --> 01:06:19,702
I'm sure you'll have
a lot of fun tonight.

477
01:06:20,009 --> 01:06:22,034
Hi!

478
01:06:22,878 --> 01:06:24,971
I'm so glad you came!

479
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:28,283
Oh, it's a party.
I thought it was a dinner party.

480
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:31,445
There are all friends
and people you know. Come in.

481
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:33,553
Come in.

482
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:36,624
- And Andrés?
- He's not coming.

483
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,499
<i>Alma!</i>

484
01:06:50,573 --> 01:06:52,666
- We called you last night.
- Oh...

485
01:07:03,052 --> 01:07:04,417
Are you okay?

486
01:07:05,588 --> 01:07:07,317
Did you knowhe had his hair cut?

487
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:09,919
- Who did?
- Andrés.

488
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:12,190
No, I didn't know.

489
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:14,924
He didn't like it before.

490
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:18,366
- And the girls?
- Upstairs. They must be asleep.

491
01:07:19,101 --> 01:07:21,763
Go up and see them if you want.
Hang on a minute.

492
01:10:36,098 --> 01:10:37,565
To call a room
do I speak from here?

493
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:39,190
Yes, from there.

494
01:10:48,978 --> 01:10:50,445
Hello.

495
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:53,748
<i>Hi, Roberto. It's Alma.</i>

496
01:10:54,283 --> 01:10:55,875
Oh, hi...

497
01:10:57,319 --> 01:10:59,981
- How are you?
<i>- Fine... And you?</i>

498
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:04,491
- I'm fine, too.
<i>- I didn't wake you up, did I?</i>

499
01:11:04,693 --> 01:11:06,661
No, no, of course not.

500
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:10,554
<i>- How was dinner?</i>
- Fine, fíne. I'm downstairs.

501
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:13,964
What do you mean?

502
01:11:14,303 --> 01:11:16,737
<i>Well, I kept calling and
calling and no one answered...</i>

503
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:18,566
<i>and I got worried.</i>

504
01:11:20,542 --> 01:11:23,102
I thought
we'd already said goodbye.

505
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:26,307
<i>Actually,
I came to apologize.</i>

506
01:11:29,151 --> 01:11:30,846
Do you want to come up?

507
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:09,784
Hello! Excuse me.

508
01:12:09,858 --> 01:12:12,827
<i>Come in...
I'll be right with you.</i>

509
01:12:33,749 --> 01:12:35,239
- Hi.
- Hi.

510
01:12:35,617 --> 01:12:38,381
Sorry. Excuse me.
What I did was wrong.

511
01:12:38,887 --> 01:12:40,855
I'm so stunned
by what's happening to me,

512
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:43,218
I don't see anything else.

513
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:45,692
I should've shut up
and listened to what you said,

514
01:12:45,794 --> 01:12:48,024
and not talk about things
I don't know about.

515
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:50,366
No, I'm the one
who doesn't even knowhimself any more.

516
01:12:50,401 --> 01:12:52,391
I shouldn't have spoken
to you like that.

517
01:12:56,238 --> 01:12:58,069
What did you do?
Did you stay here?

518
01:12:59,575 --> 01:13:03,067
No, I went out to see
if I could clear my head a bit...

519
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:08,347
But I'm not very good
with certain things.

520
01:13:09,752 --> 01:13:12,050
So I came back...

521
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:14,286
and I was looking at some pictures...

522
01:13:15,424 --> 01:13:17,392
which were in the apartment.

523
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:21,362
I don't know...

524
01:13:23,132 --> 01:13:25,794
I came to Buenos Aires and suddenly...

525
01:13:26,335 --> 01:13:29,236
I found myself among all his things.

526
01:13:30,005 --> 01:13:32,701
Deciding what to do with all that.

527
01:13:34,343 --> 01:13:37,904
I felt like an intruder,
poking around in someone else's life.

528
01:13:40,783 --> 01:13:42,410
I was trying to find...

529
01:13:44,286 --> 01:13:45,947
a clue, maybe.

530
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:48,416
Didn't you remember
anything about him?

531
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:50,717
Yes... I remembered... his hands.

532
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:52,890
He was a musician.

533
01:13:56,331 --> 01:13:58,094
As soon as I arrived to Buenos Aires...

534
01:13:58,867 --> 01:14:02,769
I went to the hospital.

535
01:14:03,205 --> 01:14:05,173
I wanted to see him.

536
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:07,808
I didn't even know the face...

537
01:14:07,976 --> 01:14:10,410
of the person I was looking for.

538
01:14:44,713 --> 01:14:47,147
<i>I'd never dared come before.</i>

539
01:14:49,885 --> 01:14:53,116
<i>I was afraid of seeing him,
listening to him, asking him...</i>

540
01:14:57,893 --> 01:15:00,384
<i>Until I went back to the apartment
the night of the wake...</i>

541
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:03,522
<i>and I saw the piano,
alone in the dark.</i>

542
01:15:04,867 --> 01:15:06,391
<i>I just couldn't come in terms
with the fact...</i>

543
01:15:06,535 --> 01:15:09,060
<i>that Agustín was really dead,</i>

544
01:15:10,539 --> 01:15:13,372
<i>and that the time
for knowing had passed.</i>

545
01:18:56,598 --> 01:18:59,123
This is the only thing I found...

546
01:18:59,234 --> 01:19:01,099
ofthe two of us together.

547
01:19:18,086 --> 01:19:19,576
Do you still want to go to the sea?

548
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:21,320
The sea?

549
01:19:21,456 --> 01:19:23,583
The sea, Reykjavik,
white sand,

550
01:19:23,658 --> 01:19:26,388
palm trees, físhes, sun.

551
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:32,290
I've never been up here before.

552
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:35,794
- Exactly, exactly the way I like it.
- I know.

553
01:19:36,037 --> 01:19:38,267
We're in time for the sunset,
which is the prettiest time.

554
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:40,340
Yes, it's all worked out.

555
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:43,305
And could we order
one ofthose coconuts...

556
01:19:43,378 --> 01:19:45,676
with a cocktail inside
that come with a little umbrella?

557
01:19:45,847 --> 01:19:48,338
But of course! The coconut
with the umbrella, deck chairs,

558
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:51,283
girls fanning you. You can go
snorkeling, whateveryou want.

559
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:54,187
Have you been here before?

560
01:19:54,322 --> 01:19:56,483
Yes, yes, I come
two or three times a week.

561
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:59,458
My swimsuit's in the car because I do
snorkeling, I have my flippers and...

562
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:01,425
Have you brought yourthings?

563
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:06,032
You know,
with the rush ofthe trip...

564
01:20:06,168 --> 01:20:08,295
and all the paperwork, I forgot.

565
01:20:08,537 --> 01:20:09,503
Oh, my!

566
01:20:09,538 --> 01:20:14,032
Of course,
I never forget my surfboard.

567
01:20:14,409 --> 01:20:17,640
I never travel without it.

568
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:19,944
I love it.

569
01:20:21,249 --> 01:20:22,716
Nice.

570
01:20:23,351 --> 01:20:26,218
- Exactly the way I like it.
- That's great!

571
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:30,314
It's warm.

572
01:20:30,392 --> 01:20:31,984
- You can jump in if you like.
- Really?

573
01:20:32,394 --> 01:20:35,192
Yes. You are my guest,
you can do what you want.

574
01:20:35,363 --> 01:20:36,955
No, thank you.

575
01:20:46,007 --> 01:20:47,804
- What?
- What?

576
01:20:48,076 --> 01:20:50,135
- What?
- It's nothing.

577
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:55,648
- It's nice here.
- Very nice.

578
01:20:59,554 --> 01:21:00,987
What happened with your dinner?

579
01:21:01,056 --> 01:21:03,047
It wasn't a dinner party.
It was a party...

580
01:21:03,191 --> 01:21:05,659
and I ran away terrifíed
before I turned into a pumpkin.

581
01:21:07,095 --> 01:21:09,427
Where was it that someone
turned into a pumpkin?

582
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:11,260
In a fairy tale, Cinderella.

583
01:21:12,033 --> 01:21:14,399
No, but she doesn't turn
into a pumpkin.

584
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:17,069
No, no. Okay,
the carriage, same thing.

585
01:21:17,138 --> 01:21:19,231
The thing is that in the end
everything turns into what it isn't.

586
01:21:19,441 --> 01:21:22,569
What do you mean into what
it isn't? Into what it is.

587
01:21:23,144 --> 01:21:25,738
Okay, into what it is.
Or into what it really isn't.

588
01:21:27,115 --> 01:21:29,447
- It's true.
- I don't get it.

589
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:32,213
You are the writer, you are the one
who knows about these things.

590
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:34,015
Anyway, it was all to say...

591
01:21:34,656 --> 01:21:37,181
I don't believe
in fairy tales anymore.

592
01:21:37,292 --> 01:21:40,022
- That's what I'm telling you.
- Is that what you were saying?

593
01:21:40,128 --> 01:21:41,595
You see, I don't like...

594
01:21:42,297 --> 01:21:44,788
filling up my daughter's head
with these things.

595
01:21:44,933 --> 01:21:47,595
- Don't you read to your daughter?
- Her mother does.

596
01:21:48,336 --> 01:21:51,066
Anyway, when I get home
she is usually asleep already.

597
01:21:51,473 --> 01:21:52,872
Really?

598
01:21:54,142 --> 01:21:55,769
You should.

599
01:21:56,011 --> 01:21:58,241
There's nothing nicerfor a kid...

600
01:21:58,346 --> 01:22:00,712
than having their father sit beside
them to read theirfavorite story.

601
01:22:01,249 --> 01:22:03,149
You should, you should.

602
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:56,028
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

603
01:23:46,755 --> 01:23:48,814
Hi...

604
01:23:56,765 --> 01:24:00,257
- What are you doing?
- Nothing...

605
01:24:00,402 --> 01:24:02,563
What do you mean nothing?
You were sleeping.

606
01:24:04,439 --> 01:24:06,669
No... I was just lying down
for a while.

607
01:24:12,113 --> 01:24:15,742
I'm in the corner here,
having breakfast.

608
01:24:17,652 --> 01:24:20,086
If you want to come,
I'll be there.

609
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:40,738
I'm going to the bathroom.

610
01:24:41,276 --> 01:24:43,107
He called me...
You know... Mati?

611
01:24:43,278 --> 01:24:45,111
Yes. The guy you met the other day?

612
01:24:45,146 --> 01:24:47,273
Yes, my brother's friend
who plays soccer with him.

613
01:24:47,348 --> 01:24:50,215
He said he wanted
to go out with me.

614
01:24:50,318 --> 01:24:51,751
- What do you think? What do I say?
- Say yes!

615
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:54,050
You can't say no! What does it matter
ifhe's your brother's friend?

616
01:24:54,155 --> 01:24:56,146
Well, okay...

617
01:24:58,193 --> 01:25:00,252
<i>- Let's go...
- Yeah, let's go.</i>

618
01:25:30,058 --> 01:25:32,424
- Coffee?
- Yes, cafe latte.

619
01:25:33,995 --> 01:25:35,860
One cafe latte, please.

620
01:25:43,037 --> 01:25:44,470
- No, thanks.
- Have one...

621
01:25:44,539 --> 01:25:46,131
- I'm not hungry.
- Have one...

622
01:25:49,210 --> 01:25:52,839
- Don't smoke now.
- I won't smoke. Yesterday I quit.

623
01:25:57,752 --> 01:26:00,619
What about you, why didn't you tell
me last night you live in a car?

624
01:26:00,688 --> 01:26:02,349
- I don't live in a car.
- Don't you?

625
01:26:02,590 --> 01:26:04,114
Just yesterday...

626
01:26:05,226 --> 01:26:07,023
Well, just for a few days.

627
01:26:07,395 --> 01:26:10,489
You are pretty well equipped
forjust a few days.

628
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:12,560
Aren't you?

629
01:26:13,234 --> 01:26:15,168
You're just missing a toaster.

630
01:26:17,205 --> 01:26:18,672
I don't know...

631
01:26:20,074 --> 01:26:22,565
I thought we were
getting to knoweach other...

632
01:26:23,244 --> 01:26:25,735
You tell me that you are married,
that you are moving and...

633
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:28,974
- No, I'm not moving.
- Right. I fígured.

634
01:26:34,355 --> 01:26:37,153
I didn't know how to tell you.
I've been driving around in the car...

635
01:26:37,225 --> 01:26:39,216
for days, not knowing
what to do or where to go.

636
01:26:40,261 --> 01:26:42,195
<i>Since I left home.</i>

637
01:26:46,801 --> 01:26:48,268
Hello.

638
01:26:50,471 --> 01:26:53,031
<i>I don't know what happened that morning.
I came in like every other day...</i>

639
01:26:54,275 --> 01:26:55,742
<i>And I saw him...</i>

640
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:59,374
<i>and I felt that Andrés
wasn't there anymore.</i>

641
01:27:02,650 --> 01:27:05,380
<i>Suddenly, after nine years,
he was somebody else.</i>

642
01:27:05,453 --> 01:27:06,784
<i>As if time...</i>

643
01:27:07,655 --> 01:27:09,748
<i>had made him fade away.</i>

644
01:27:36,317 --> 01:27:39,286
<i>Hello? Yes...</i>

645
01:27:40,021 --> 01:27:42,285
<i>No, no, I'm late.
I was going out right now.</i>

646
01:27:42,924 --> 01:27:46,382
<i>I'll call you later... Yes.</i>

647
01:27:47,662 --> 01:27:50,256
<i>Just then the janitor buzzed up to
tell me my car had been broken into.</i>

648
01:27:50,698 --> 01:27:51,630
Hello.

649
01:27:51,699 --> 01:27:53,667
He rang the bell and told me,
so I ran downstairs...

650
01:27:54,636 --> 01:27:58,163
And I saw it there in the street
with the windowbroken,

651
01:27:58,873 --> 01:28:01,967
without the stereo,
the spare tire, the lighter...

652
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:04,337
That's why there's no lighter...

653
01:28:04,846 --> 01:28:06,507
Everything turned upside down.

654
01:28:08,116 --> 01:28:11,984
I opened the door
and I just sobbed.

655
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:15,487
It was just a burglary, but...

656
01:28:16,391 --> 01:28:17,688
I didn't know what to do.

657
01:28:17,825 --> 01:28:19,452
At any other time
I would've called Andrés,

658
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:23,291
but the thought
didn't even cross my mind.

659
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:28,201
I couldn't call a single person...

660
01:28:28,303 --> 01:28:31,272
ofthe thousands in my phone.

661
01:28:33,408 --> 01:28:36,377
So I cleaned the glass
out of the car as best as I could,

662
01:28:37,378 --> 01:28:40,211
and I sat there
for I don't know how long.

663
01:28:41,416 --> 01:28:43,213
Then I started to drive around,

664
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:46,378
not thinking,
with my head completely empty...

665
01:28:47,588 --> 01:28:50,557
Without controlling
anything at all.

666
01:28:52,327 --> 01:28:54,852
The car was like a relief.

667
01:28:57,065 --> 01:28:59,226
When I got home...

668
01:28:59,834 --> 01:29:02,200
I felt completely alien.

669
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:08,241
I wrote a note,

670
01:29:08,743 --> 01:29:12,907
made up one of these quick trips
that I always have to go on,

671
01:29:17,051 --> 01:29:18,643
and I left...

672
01:29:23,791 --> 01:29:25,759
So you've split up...

673
01:29:26,527 --> 01:29:28,392
More than that.

674
01:29:28,529 --> 01:29:30,588
And what are you going to do?

675
01:29:33,601 --> 01:29:35,228
Not sure, I can take more
than I thought I could.

676
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:38,737
¿But is this a resistance test?

677
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:43,071
I mean, you surely have a family,
you have friends...

678
01:29:44,612 --> 01:29:47,877
Alma... You can't live in a car.

679
01:29:50,485 --> 01:29:52,112
I don't want to ask
anything of anyone.

680
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:54,245
Yes, that's all well and good but...

681
01:29:54,622 --> 01:29:57,022
What are you gaining
from all this?

682
01:29:57,258 --> 01:29:59,624
If you want to split up,
you've got all the right to,

683
01:29:59,761 --> 01:30:02,252
but you can make
it easier on yourself.

684
01:30:05,099 --> 01:30:07,863
Maybe you can't understand,
but I have the feeling...

685
01:30:10,004 --> 01:30:11,733
that I really don't know
howto work this out.

686
01:30:11,806 --> 01:30:15,037
It's as if I'm going round
in circles.

687
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:06,325
- Come in, welcome.
- We're here about the apartment.

688
01:31:06,461 --> 01:31:08,486
Of course. Just come in
and see hownice it is.

689
01:31:08,629 --> 01:31:09,994
- Hi darling.
- Hi, howare you?

690
01:31:10,531 --> 01:31:12,328
Well. This is the kitchen...

691
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:15,699
The entrance is independant.
Avery safe door.

692
01:31:15,803 --> 01:31:17,703
No thief can get in here.

693
01:31:17,972 --> 01:31:22,136
Spacious. Lots oflight,
good ventilation.

694
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:25,438
And the most important part
is this big window.

695
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:29,539
Which could be a service hatch,
a viewpoint, depends, doesn't it?

696
01:31:30,718 --> 01:31:33,881
Lean through it, please.
Lean through.

697
01:31:35,423 --> 01:31:39,484
This is the long corridor
and the prettiest room.

698
01:31:39,694 --> 01:31:40,991
<i>Small butvery cozy.</i>

699
01:31:41,095 --> 01:31:43,791
<i>Ideal as a study
or children's room.</i>

700
01:31:43,931 --> 01:31:45,159
<i>- Do you have children?
- No, no.</i>

701
01:31:45,266 --> 01:31:46,799
<i>You soon will.</i>

702
01:31:46,834 --> 01:31:50,065
Just married? It's been all
newly-weds today.

703
01:31:50,371 --> 01:31:51,702
This is the toilet.

704
01:31:51,772 --> 01:31:55,731
And this is the bedroom.
Plenty of wardrobe space.

705
01:31:55,943 --> 01:31:57,308
<i>Absolutely...</i>

706
01:31:57,445 --> 01:31:59,811
<i>You could put an armchair there,
couldn't you?</i>

707
01:32:01,115 --> 01:32:03,310
It's better
than sleeping in your car.

708
01:32:06,721 --> 01:32:08,518
<i>Nice?
No, I don't think so.</i>

709
01:32:08,623 --> 01:32:11,148
<i>But there are things
I like about the apartment.</i>

710
01:32:11,726 --> 01:32:13,421
- Which ones?
- Well, there's...

711
01:32:14,629 --> 01:32:17,359
a ventilation system
in every room.

712
01:32:18,232 --> 01:32:20,223
- You don't get that in every apartment.
- No.

713
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:22,233
There's the bathroom.

714
01:32:22,803 --> 01:32:25,670
With the bidet. With the...

715
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:28,440
The "thingy" for washing your hands,
I don't know how you call it...

716
01:32:28,943 --> 01:32:29,910
The... the...

717
01:32:29,977 --> 01:32:32,411
- The washbasin.
- The washbasin.

718
01:32:32,813 --> 01:32:34,337
Well, with its washbasin.

719
01:32:34,882 --> 01:32:37,578
Nice communication
between kitchen and living room.

720
01:32:38,586 --> 01:32:41,885
Imagine if you have guests
and you want to pass...

721
01:32:42,056 --> 01:32:43,853
That's very good.

722
01:32:44,425 --> 01:32:46,256
- Isn't it?
- Yes, it's very good.

723
01:32:46,427 --> 01:32:48,224
- Don't you like that about a house?
- Yes...

724
01:32:48,296 --> 01:32:50,287
That it has a serving hatch?

725
01:32:50,398 --> 01:32:53,094
For me, I swear, it's one
ofthe things...

726
01:32:53,234 --> 01:32:54,633
I like the most.

727
01:32:54,735 --> 01:32:56,202
- Really?
- It's fun.

728
01:32:56,671 --> 01:32:58,806
Because one person's cooking and the
other's with the guests...

729
01:32:58,841 --> 01:33:00,797
And if you want to invite
the Muñiz, suddenly...

730
01:33:01,776 --> 01:33:03,403
Well, there we are...

731
01:33:03,611 --> 01:33:05,977
We're there, living...

732
01:33:06,147 --> 01:33:09,412
Living a good life...

733
01:33:09,951 --> 01:33:11,748
And we invite the Muñiz...

734
01:33:12,853 --> 01:33:15,549
If you like the Muñiz, otherwise
we can invite someone else...

735
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:18,058
- No, no, no...
- You don't like them because ofher.

736
01:33:18,292 --> 01:33:21,989
- I don't care much for her.
- Sure. Each fortheir own.

737
01:33:24,599 --> 01:33:26,794
But she's been through a lot.

738
01:33:27,268 --> 01:33:30,066
She's had a bad time ofit
and you're unfair with her.

739
01:33:30,371 --> 01:33:33,966
Because she's only got one leg,
but she's brave.

740
01:33:36,377 --> 01:33:40,245
How silly...

741
01:33:40,815 --> 01:33:43,017
- You've got some peanut there.
- What is it?

742
01:33:43,052 --> 01:33:44,780
Peanut...

743
01:36:36,357 --> 01:36:38,848
CINDERELLA

744
01:36:58,145 --> 01:37:00,204
- Is it time?
- Nearly.

745
01:37:00,981 --> 01:37:02,380
Do you want to sleep?

746
01:37:05,186 --> 01:37:07,711
But I would like to be asleep
when you leave.

747
01:38:12,119 --> 01:38:14,781
<i>So what happened?
Did she escape?</i>

748
01:38:17,157 --> 01:38:20,024
On her own
or somebody helped her?

749
01:39:39,707 --> 01:39:41,368
Well...

750
01:39:47,111 --> 01:39:53,222
