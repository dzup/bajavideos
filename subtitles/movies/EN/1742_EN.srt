1
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:52,318
Have a good journey!

2
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,169
Open your mouth

3
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:15,957
What's the matter?

4
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:18,970
No, no... nothing.

5
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,966
My girlfriend's left me.

6
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,709
Why have you got a white
streak in your hair?

7
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,337
Is something the matter?

8
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,108
Alfred, it's not that
you don't dance well,

9
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,853
but we need a woman in the team,

10
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:11,457
the rules of the contest say
the team has to be mixed...

11
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:14,221
with three members...
One of us will have to leave.

12
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:20,797
I don't feel well... you have
no idea how bad you make me feel.

13
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:24,234
I've been training for this for months.

14
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:28,975
It was me who told you of the
contest and registered the team,

15
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,872
and I chose the music
we're going to dance to.

16
00:03:30,907 --> 00:03:32,735
Alfred, don't make things
even more difficult.

17
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,474
This isn't happening...

18
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,675
this isn't happening...

19
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:40,441
this isn't happening.

20
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:44,982
So why have you got that white streak
if you know people will ask?

21
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:13,074
PAULA; SORRY. LET'S GET BACK
TOGETHER, NICOLÁS.

22
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:17,718
Julio.

23
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:19,890
Nicolás.

24
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,220
Paula's father...

25
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:32,902
- The shirt I gave you for Christmas.
- Yes.

26
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,837
- It suits you.
- Thank you.

27
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,207
Nice tennis shoes.

28
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:43,215
Thanks, Paula gave them to me.

29
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:49,650
Paula's gone to the country.
She needed time.

30
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,949
Where to? What time?

31
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:59,126
Time. She went to one
of those places to relax...

32
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,629
...where they do yoga...
- Yoga?

33
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,502
When has she ever done yoga?

34
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:09,407
How's the toy shop?
Are there sales?

35
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:11,241
Yeah... so so.

36
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:21,581
- Well, I'm off. Bye.
- Bye.

37
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:42,107
Hurry up. You still have the quince
and the sweet potato jam to do.

38
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,305
Did you hear?

39
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,316
What's your game, misery!
Do you want to get us both fired?

40
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:52,917
- I'm not motivated.
- You're not motivated?

41
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:57,480
You're not Fred Astaire. You're Alfredo
Jiménez... J-i-m-é-n-e-z...

42
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,226
- OK, dad.
- We'll speak about this at home.

43
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:16,038
Alfred.

44
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:19,304
Why don't you stop your dad
hitting you in the store?

45
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:24,783
My dad doesn't hit me.

46
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,702
Can you lend me
your stick deodorant?

47
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:47,169
Why don't you play football?

48
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,038
Because I had an accident.

49
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:53,410
- Car accident?
- No, a sports accident.

50
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,977
Your call took me by surprise.
I never thought you'd decide to do it.

51
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:03,251
The rabbi gave me them
three months ago.

52
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,589
To Miramar, right?

53
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,466
- Don't say a thing.
- I won't say a word.

54
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:18,363
Our religion forbids cremation.
It's not right.

55
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,066
It's not right.

56
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:23,766
But I know it's what
your grandfather wanted.

57
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:28,944
He was a great friend of the rabbi.
I'm a great friend of the rabbi.

58
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,711
I often go to the temple.

59
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:34,549
Are you sad?

60
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:37,184
Yes.

61
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,958
You know you're
blocking your emotions.

62
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:43,528
- Be careful, otherwise you'll explode one day.
- Thanks.

63
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,532
Hello, hello, how are you?

64
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:51,169
A warm welcome to the Creative Show,
a programme in which

65
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:57,074
we like to show the most creative
commercials from around the worid.

66
00:07:57,376 --> 00:08:06,614
We also like to analyse the business
so you know the main trends

67
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,786
in advertising in other countries.

68
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:12,484
Today's programme will be
dedicated to trends.

69
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:15,927
One trend that we've
detected is balloons.

70
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:21,834
Suddenly there are balloons
everywhere... for birthday parties...

71
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:25,497
And there are commercials
such as this one...

72
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,302
Yes? Come in.

73
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,529
Hey, it's the Clio show.

74
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:02,673
It's incredible Gujis's relevance

75
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:06,646
Gujis is happy...
and I'll tell you why in a moment.

76
00:09:06,681 --> 00:09:09,444
He's perfect... he was born to it.

77
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:20,492
Does a juice stain come out with soap?

78
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,361
Use Ariel soap powder. It's very good,

79
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:23,760
it's sold all over the worid.

80
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:28,568
But it should come out
with normal soap, right?

81
00:09:28,603 --> 00:09:31,002
Use Ariel, it's good.

82
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,563
- Hi.
- Hi.

83
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:40,744
- Nicolás, Abril, Abril, Nicolás.
- How are things?

84
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:44,312
- Fine. You?
- Fine... fine

85
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:50,251
I'll be right back...
I'm going to change...

86
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,752
Alfred, can you come
here a moment, please?

87
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:56,655
Who's that girl?

88
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,593
Aren't you going to open the Scalextric?

89
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:09,732
I don't know.

90
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,012
We look forward to seeing
you all next Saturday

91
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:14,673
with a new Creative Advertising Show.

92
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,684
We've come to get
you to do something.

93
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,548
I was planning to stay in.

94
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:27,221
But it's Saturday...
Saturday evening. Everyone goes out.

95
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:30,625
I always feel as if I'm out of it.

96
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:35,090
- Out of what?
- Out of everything.

97
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,135
What was your plan?

98
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:46,935
Why don't you play
with the small bowls?

99
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,748
Don't you see they're
all going down the side?

100
00:10:48,783 --> 00:10:50,773
Let me make my own decisions.

101
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,697
Your shoes are different to mine.

102
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,929
That's because they're mine.

103
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,402
Oh...

104
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:20,545
- Didn't they give you special shoes?
- No... they said I could use these...

105
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,386
They left me out of the dance team.

106
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,924
It's all very strange.

107
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,293
They said the team had to be mixed.

108
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:38,993
A woman with a white
streak in her hair appeared.

109
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,329
I still don't get it.

110
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:43,961
I've got the ashes.

111
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:48,305
We'll go all the same.

112
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,509
My job is to direct operations
at the toll stations,

113
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:55,247
and to collect the toll in force both
quickly and efficiently,

114
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:57,909
interfering as little as
possible with the traffic.

115
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,769
Since the motorway opened
in 1994, the number of drivers

116
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:05,388
choosing this form of payment
has seen constant growth.

117
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:08,227
There are currently
over 110,000 clients

118
00:12:08,262 --> 00:12:09,888
and we're still growing.

119
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,225
- You like your job?
- Very much.

120
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,396
Why take the ashes to Miramar?

121
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:18,600
We used to go there on holiday...
he loved it.

122
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:21,066
- I don't know it.
- I know.

123
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,637
- Is it big?
- No.

124
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,441
When were you last there?

125
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:27,810
Twenty years ago.

126
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,482
Like Michael Fox in
'Back to the Future'.

127
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,875
Well, I was hoping to pick up
speed in a straight line.

128
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,087
- In the film, he...
- Yes... yes.

129
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,022
...he goes really fast
as he's being chased,

130
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,984
but then suddenly a car appears...
and guess what he does?

131
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:42,860
The skateboard
passes under the car

132
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:45,625
and he goes over the top,
at full speed and

133
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:49,356
- comes down the front just in time to fall
onto the skate. - Yes.

134
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,464
I did exactly the same thing
but with a park bench.

135
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,075
I tore the ligaments in my knee,

136
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,203
broke my wrist and split
my head open on the ground.

137
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:04,740
Everybody laughed and
I've never done any sport since.

138
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,178
I was forgetting, Abril's coming with us.
She's visiting her family.

139
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:09,787
But it was our trip...

140
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,586
It's just three days.
She won't be with us the whole time.

141
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:22,227
A breadcrumb...

142
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:26,705
So... we're leaving tomorrow?

143
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

144
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:33,003
- Sleep well.
- You too.

145
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,142
Bye.

146
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,141
Bye.

147
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:46,520
AWKWARD

148
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:46,440
Is everything OK?

149
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:49,382
Fine...

150
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,230
There's Abril.

151
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:14,205
Help her with her stuff.

152
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,120
- Hello.
- Hello.

153
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,153
- Is something up?
- No, no.

154
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:34,097
Shall I help you with your things?

155
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:49,346
Hello.

156
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:11,199
- You have a Ford.
- Yes.

157
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,200
I couldn't have got lost...

158
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:53,367
- Do you know why Father Christmas
wears red and white? - No...

159
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:55,910
Because he was invented by Coca Cola.

160
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,048
He wasn't invented by Coca Cola.

161
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:02,767
They dressed him like that for an ad...
and that's how he stayed.

162
00:17:02,802 --> 00:17:06,718
- Oh, yeah... so how did he dress before?
- No idea... in blue.

163
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,391
Maybe it was in blue...

164
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:15,530
Blue and white like
the Argentine flag.

165
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:18,762
Father Christmas isn't Argentine...
he comes from Alaska.

166
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,909
Have we passed a
sign saying 'Pipinas'?

167
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:29,175
- This isn't the way to Miramar...
- No, I know it's not.

168
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:34,019
It's just a little detour
as I need to see Paula.

169
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:36,385
- Who?
- His ex-girlfriend...

170
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:42,059
She's not my ex-girlfriend.
We've just cooled things a bit.

171
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:44,728
Do you love her?

172
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:11,882
- Let me go with you.
- No, stay here. It'll be OK.

173
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:38,215
What are you doing here?

174
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,886
What do you mean, what am I doing
here? I've come to get you.

175
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:44,686
- You're not well, Nicolás.
- Yeah, I'm not well.

176
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:46,990
I put up a banner in your street;

177
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:48,754
'Paula, forgive me. Let's get back
together, Nicolás.'

178
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,229
We can't split over a Scalextric.

179
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,049
Nicolás, that was our money
to go to Colonia,

180
00:18:54,084 --> 00:18:55,799
and you spent it on a track
for model cars.

181
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:58,502
But why go to Colonia?
Every couple goes to Colonia.

182
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,305
What, do we have to go to Colonia
to be considered a real couple?

183
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:03,475
No, we were never a real couple
because you've got problems.

184
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,177
You need to grow up.
You're very immature.

185
00:19:05,212 --> 00:19:07,577
- Good morning.
- Hello, how are you?

186
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,207
- I haven't opened the Scalextric.
- Go ahead and open it.

187
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,216
- I love you.
- I love you too.

188
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,344
But love is one thing
and being there is another.

189
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:18,312
It'll be the best thing
for us both, you'll see.

190
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,199
You've still not had
that tooth out, have you?

191
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:48,986
What are you doing?

192
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,848
Nothing, I'm just giving you courage.

193
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:56,528
You're working through a failure...
the failure of a relationship.

194
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:59,563
You need to mourn, everyone
does in their own way.

195
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:02,362
- I'm thirsty. Is there nothing
to drink? - Me too, very thirsty.

196
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,534
Don't worry, a bit further on...

197
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,830
there's a place where they hand out
mineral water and yogurt.

198
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,200
That's not there any more...
it was years ago.

199
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,709
Anyway, it was in summer, not winter.

200
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,980
- Hello.
- Hello.

201
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,846
- What's wrong?
- With me?

202
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:37,622
- No, the car. - Uh... well, it suddenly
started making a noise and stopped...

203
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,964
Sorry, are you a nun?

204
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:00,939
What do you think?

205
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:12,420
- Where are you going?
- To Miramar.

206
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:17,588
What are you going
to do there in this cold?

207
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,228
She'going to see her family.

208
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:27,160
- Is she a writer?
- No, she works in a toll booth.

209
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:32,934
- What's she jotting down?
- I don't know... I swear I don't.

210
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:39,211
And the other one?

211
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,186
He's going to a dance contest

212
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:45,519
but he doesn't know
if he'll be able to dance.

213
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:51,126
And you?

214
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,865
I'm going to scatter
my grandfather's ashes.

215
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,302
A lovely journey...

216
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:07,376
- What?
- What?

217
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:12,410
- You were going to say something.
- No, it was nothing...

218
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:19,124
- I'd never spoken to a nun before.
- Really?

219
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:21,820
No, I've never much
to do with religion.

220
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:22,150
- I'll pay.
- One coffee and seven mineral waters...

221
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:23,779
- How many?
- Seven.

222
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:28,317
We can start a kitty later...

223
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:36,160
Thanks. Shall we go?

224
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:26,109
Why are you so overdressed?

225
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:29,286
His father left him in a swimming pool
when he was seven.

226
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:33,815
He stayed there all night, alone and cold.
It left him traumatised.

227
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:36,626
So he's always much more warmly
dressed than the others.

228
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:39,755
Even in summer he doesn't go out very
much because he's embarrassed.

229
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:43,827
Is that true?

230
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:53,535
Well... we're here because of a tree.

231
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:58,014
A tree you reported as stolen, miss.
Is that right?

232
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:12,958
- What have you got in that urn?
- My grandad's ashes.

233
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:18,759
- I've got nothing to do with that...
- That's enough.

234
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:20,936
We've all got our problems.

235
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:23,534
We don't always know what
others are going through.

236
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:30,248
Don't worry. Irma, the village
kleptomaniac, has got your tree.

237
00:27:30,283 --> 00:27:32,614
It happens to most tourists.

238
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:38,715
Bring her in.

239
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:45,153
What does 'kleptomaniac' mean?

240
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:16,387
Irma, do me a favour and give
the tree back to this young lady.

241
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:23,127
Give it back, Irma.
We'll cut you another later.

242
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:32,876
Come on, woman! Give it back!

243
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:19,182
So... room 127 for the young lady,

244
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:23,727
and room 140 for the gentlemen.

245
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:27,866
Breakfast is served between
seven and ten every morning,

246
00:29:27,901 --> 00:29:31,927
and dinner is from 9 to 9.30
in the evening.

247
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:35,888
Would it be possible to have
those necklaces with pearis,

248
00:29:35,923 --> 00:29:39,240
where each pearl has a certain
value so they can be exchanged

249
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:41,843
for things here in the hotel...

250
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:47,083
like those little soaps
or wooden dolls?

251
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:50,048
Would it be possible to have one?

252
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:58,486
To avoid handling money in the hotel.
Would that be possible?

253
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,155
No.

254
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:10,140
The buffet's closed.

255
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:11,836
Shall we go out for a quick bite?

256
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,271
OK, let's meet here in twenty minutes.

257
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,017
There are three possibilities;

258
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:33,330
I sleep in the big bed
and you in the small one,

259
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:36,330
or me in the small one
and you in the big one...

260
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:40,698
or both of us sleep in the big one...

261
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:45,674
No... you take the big one
and I'll sleep in the small bed.

262
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:49,443
Actually, that's the one I wanted

263
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:53,673
because as a dancer I need
to stretch my muscles at night...

264
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:55,009
No problem.

265
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:02,750
Thanks.

266
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,629
Look, Nico, we've got a hairdryer!

267
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:29,951
Everything's closed,
there's nothing open.

268
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:34,924
These places only come alive
in season, they're dead right now.

269
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:40,862
Just as well we said
something quick...

270
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:45,001
I hate bicycles and
those little pedal cars,

271
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:47,834
because you always get your
trouser turn-ups caught in them.

272
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:52,204
- What?
- Nothing.

273
00:31:54,679 --> 00:32:01,676
In Japan, 34,187 people commit
suicide every year.

274
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:05,787
Exactly half that number
of people, that is 17,093,

275
00:32:05,822 --> 00:32:09,554
came together for the inauguration
of Miramar in 1915.

276
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:16,226
Sorry, I couldn't find the
key to lock the room.

277
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,138
Shall we go?

278
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:32,907
Good evening.

279
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:35,782
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

280
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:49,293
- Will you be dining?
- Yes.

281
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:55,128
All we have left is meat pie
and a little alphabet soup.

282
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:57,772
Um, I don't know.

283
00:32:58,843 --> 00:32:59,969
Meat pie.

284
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:02,072
Meat pie.

285
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:04,478
Me too, meat pie.

286
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,406
Fine. And to drink?

287
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:07,912
Still water.

288
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:09,018
Coke.

289
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,844
A coke for me, too.

290
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:13,891
Welcome.

291
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:26,401
Don't bother with dessert.
I'm going to the toilet.

292
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:50,661
Sorry, that was two meat pies
and an alphabet soup, right?

293
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:52,856
No, no... did you order soup?

294
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:56,165
No, three meat pies.

295
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:01,661
- Oh... I thought the young lady had
ordered soup. - No, no...

296
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:07,403
Welcome.

297
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:23,654
It's good to know the
day you're going to die...

298
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,062
because every day before that

299
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:29,225
you can do what you like knowing that
nothing's going to happen to you.

300
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:35,529
But the thing is you know the day
when everything's going to finish.

301
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:46,174
Besides the physical body, the ashes,
feelings are what really matters.

302
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:48,915
You should see how
clean the loos are.

303
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:51,548
- Feelings.
- What feelings?

304
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:53,756
What are you talking about?

305
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:56,282
He killed himself because
he was old and bored.

306
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:58,927
I was only away for a minute.
What did you talk about?

307
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:02,860
- Who said this had to be fun?
- What?

308
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,263
You mean life, metaphorically speaking?

309
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:10,129
- What? What's up?
- Nothing, Alfred, calm down?

310
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:17,412
That's not Coke!

311
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:21,677
- It's just that... that's the brand we sell.
- Water then!

312
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:38,798
Sorry... Miramar's weird,
I'm still not used to it.

313
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:45,368
- I've got no idea where to scatter them.
- What? The ashes?

314
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:50,340
- Didn't he tell you where?
- No, he said Miramar.

315
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:12,899
You've still not had
that tooth out yet, have you?

316
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:25,503
- Do you know who's staying at this hotel?
- No, who?

317
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:30,740
- Gujis.
- The presenter of the Clio Show?

318
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:38,683
That can't be right. What would
Gujis be doing in Miramar?

319
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,166
Do you know who's
staying at this hotel?

320
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:36,742
Horacio is the receptionist's nephew.
He knows Miramar better than anyone?

321
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:39,717
He's a lifeguard,
but he's out of work right now.

322
00:38:39,752 --> 00:38:42,151
As you don't know
where to throw the ashes,

323
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:46,389
I thought we could do
a tour, visit a few places.

324
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:50,087
You can choose where to scatter them,
and we can get to know the place.

325
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:52,388
What do you think?

326
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:59,867
- Well, here we are at...
- Mickey's.

327
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:04,541
...a famous café known
for its delicious waffles.

328
00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:07,760
Well, it's closed right
now as we're off season,

329
00:39:07,795 --> 00:39:10,944
but it's almost impossible
to get a table in summer.

330
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:15,353
If you come in season
I'd recommend their 'Miramar Mickey',

331
00:39:15,388 --> 00:39:17,321
which has lots of caramel and cream,

332
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:21,079
melted chocolate with pieces
of chocolate dessert.

333
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:25,729
Is there a savoury one, too?

334
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:31,834
This is the first breakwater in Miramar,
which was built in 1916.

335
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:35,639
You can always find anglers
here from very early on,

336
00:39:35,674 --> 00:39:37,766
from five or six in the morning.

337
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:41,037
Well, there's nobody here
today as nothing's biting...

338
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,249
but if you like we can
come back another day,

339
00:39:45,284 --> 00:39:47,080
it's no trouble for me.

340
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:53,022
This is the beach.

341
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:12,905
Well, the excursión ends here.

342
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:16,711
- Thank you very much.
- That was very nice.

343
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:17,804
Thank you.

344
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:26,720
- Give him something out of the kitty.
- What kitty?

345
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:02,856
And what do we do with it now?

346
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:06,195
What about over there?

347
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:28,280
Shall we scatter them here?

348
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:31,346
Yeah... yeah.

349
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:34,151
Do you want us to hold hands?

350
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:36,984
No, no, no!

351
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:40,223
Are you going to say a few words?

352
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:46,035
No, no. What could I say?

353
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,937
I don't know, something about Marcos.

354
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:54,035
I'll do it. Let me speak.

355
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:08,789
Marcos, you killed yourself
because you were old and bored.

356
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:19,603
You used to say that
life was good for arseholes

357
00:42:19,638 --> 00:42:21,628
and that you thought
you were intelligent.

358
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:26,635
It's true we may not be
the happiest people in the worid,

359
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:31,181
but happiness is an invention, which is
something you never understood.

360
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:34,517
And now you want us to scatter
your ashes in Miramar,

361
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:38,989
because you used to come here on
holiday. What holidays, I wonder!

362
00:42:39,024 --> 00:42:40,422
You never used to work.

363
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:42,893
Nicolás spent all
day in the shop while

364
00:42:42,928 --> 00:42:45,461
you played the lottery,

365
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:47,431
searching for the sort of luck
you never had in your life,

366
00:42:47,466 --> 00:42:51,663
because your negativism
spoilt everything around you.

367
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:55,389
Like when you're
about to feed a dog

368
00:42:55,424 --> 00:42:58,774
you approach the bowl
and as you do so

369
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:01,903
the dog starts running around,
jumping, wagging its tail...

370
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:07,848
but once you've given him
his food, he stays completely still...

371
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:12,706
I mean that the food gives
him less satisfaction

372
00:43:12,741 --> 00:43:16,693
than the expectation you
create in him just before.

373
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,491
I reckon that's what's
happened to you.

374
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:22,997
While you were full
of excitement and uncertainty,

375
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:26,862
you were alive and reached
a maximum of happiness.

376
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:29,405
But once you had
what you wanted,

377
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,877
your dopamine level dropped
and you were left like the dog,

378
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:35,711
staring at nothing.

379
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:38,747
Do you know what
dopamine is, Marcos?

380
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,783
You haven't got a clue.

381
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:43,343
It's a mediator of nerve impulses.

382
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,121
It's the level of expectation
and excitement

383
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:49,455
that we all have in the blood
and that goes up to the brain.

384
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:56,128
I don't know if I can remember
all I've just said...

385
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,033
It's as if he didn't want to leave.

386
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:18,410
Shall we eat?

387
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:24,093
I'm not hungry, I'm going to bed.

388
00:45:24,955 --> 00:45:27,617
You didn't celebrate your
Bar Mitzvah, did you?

389
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:30,319
You can tell.

390
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:39,863
I'm not cold.

391
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:41,535
Watch out!

392
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:44,366
SORRY, PAULA. LET'S GET BACK
TOGETHER, NICOLÁS.

393
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:58,281
Your mouth's bleeding.

394
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:51,530
What's the time?

395
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:55,237
If it's the same time in Miramar
as in Buenos Aires

396
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:59,208
then it's seven in the evening...
you've been asleep all day.

397
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:01,071
What's up?

398
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:16,654
- Hello, dad.
- What are you doing here?

399
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:23,598
- I've brought the tree.
- That was for Christmas.

400
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:27,033
Well...

401
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:33,334
Today's my birthday.
We can celebrate both things together.

402
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:41,413
These are my sisters...

403
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:43,182
Mabel...

404
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:45,710
Raquel...

405
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:47,948
and this is my father.

406
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:53,022
- Mum?
- Here she is, can't you see her?

407
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,269
Hello, mum.

408
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:33,428
You haven't visited in seven years...

409
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:37,170
you could have warned us.

410
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:42,946
You can't be sad, mum,
it's Abril's birthday.

411
00:49:42,981 --> 00:49:44,947
We must all be happy for her.

412
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:48,543
- Shall we call the doctor, mum?
- It'll pass.

413
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:54,913
Lionel Ritchie's going to do
a concert in Los Ángeles,

414
00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:58,428
but if the plane lands in Mississippi
you can go overland

415
00:49:58,463 --> 00:50:00,396
and see the heartland
of the United States.

416
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:08,131
He has a white daughter.
So either his wife is white,

417
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:13,132
or there's a white
ancester somewhere.

418
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,368
Eat up before it gets cold.

419
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:22,149
Eat it, it's soft.

420
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:25,555
He's got problems
with his teeth, that's why...

421
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:28,025
Teeth are the only things
that survive an accident.

422
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:30,659
The dead are identified by their teeth.

423
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:34,097
They leave us before we die and
remind us we're just passing through.

424
00:50:34,132 --> 00:50:36,450
They're important, very important.

425
00:50:36,485 --> 00:50:38,734
Some diseases start in the teeth,

426
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:41,203
a cousin of ours who's
a dentist once told us.

427
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:43,974
The worst thing that could happen
to you is going to the dentist

428
00:50:44,009 --> 00:50:46,375
on a camp site. I hate camp sites.

429
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:48,844
I hate astrologers even
more than dentists!

430
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:50,975
But we were talking
about something else.

431
00:50:58,588 --> 00:50:59,890
Can I go to the toilet?

432
00:50:59,925 --> 00:51:02,358
Yes, over there.

433
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:09,224
- That boy's got a problem.
- He'll get over it.

434
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:36,153
Your hands are a mess.

435
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:39,288
You're looking beautiful
but your hands are a mess.

436
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:40,823
You don't look after them.

437
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:45,996
I work in a place where
I'm always handling coins.

438
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,229
Coins...

439
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:56,806
You collect coins?

440
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:01,912
No, mum.

441
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:06,214
I work in a place where
I'm always handling coins.

442
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:11,255
In a bank?

443
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:14,754
No.

444
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:20,992
In a casino?

445
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:23,768
No.

446
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:26,500
In a toll booth.

447
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:32,906
- Who are you?
- Nicolás.

448
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:37,081
- Isn't my daughter lovely?
- Mum!

449
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:40,749
Let him tell you you're lovely...

450
00:52:44,594 --> 00:52:47,062
- Tell her...
- Mum...

451
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:55,102
You're lovely... really lovely.

452
00:52:57,073 --> 00:52:58,267
That's it.

453
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:01,138
See? Nothing to it.

454
00:53:11,788 --> 00:53:12,720
Alright?

455
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:16,857
I'm worried about global warming.

456
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:24,563
- Family affairs...
- No... about the glaciers...

457
00:53:24,598 --> 00:53:28,062
No, I mean what's just happened...
family affairs.

458
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:31,967
You choose your family,
but not your friends.

459
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:37,612
I mean, you don't choose your family
but you do choose your friends...

460
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:41,949
I liked the idea of you meeting them,

461
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:45,050
especially you.

462
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:52,394
I don't know... since you've been
abandoned by so many people...

463
00:53:52,629 --> 00:53:55,932
your grandfather's died,
your girlfriend's left you...

464
00:53:55,967 --> 00:53:58,526
so you could see a few people.

465
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:00,425
Well, thanks.

466
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:04,540
All the same it wasn't
because of them I threw up...

467
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:06,636
We all have our problems.

468
00:54:09,379 --> 00:54:12,348
But I still don't know yours.

469
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:21,983
- Are you busy?
- Right now?

470
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:27,096
No... well... I'm driving, but tell me...

471
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:33,627
I know we're not going
out together or anything but...

472
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:38,631
- Won't you give me a kiss?
- What?

473
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:40,701
On the mouth...

474
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:44,140
- A kiss?
- Please...

475
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:48,279
Look, why don't
you pull up over there?

476
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:07,731
Don't get me wrong, I won't...

477
00:55:08,071 --> 00:55:09,265
If I'm asking you for a kiss...

478
00:55:09,606 --> 00:55:13,098
it's because I think it would
do me good and I need it.

479
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:17,706
You may see me rabbiting on but
inside I'm crying, but don't worry.

480
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:21,077
Will you give me a kiss?

481
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:49,238
Thanks... that's it... let's go...

482
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,538
Abril?

483
00:58:49,058 --> 00:58:55,759
Happy birthday, dear Abril...

484
00:58:56,165 --> 00:58:57,223
happy birthday to you.

485
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:07,865
Alfred...

486
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:12,537
You choose your friends,
not your family...

487
01:00:14,344 --> 01:00:16,574
No, you don't choose them.

488
01:01:02,892 --> 01:01:05,727
- Good morning.
- Morning.

489
01:01:05,762 --> 01:01:08,026
I've come to register for
the competition today.

490
01:01:08,531 --> 01:01:09,429
Alone?

491
01:01:09,866 --> 01:01:13,495
You're the hotel receptionist, aren't you?
Do you remember me?

492
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:17,970
- Alone?
- Alone.

493
01:01:18,474 --> 01:01:21,272
- Name?
- Alfred...

494
01:01:22,111 --> 01:01:23,305
Surname?

495
01:01:25,481 --> 01:01:29,383
Elliot... Alfred Elliot...

496
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:32,119
Registration costs fifteen pesos.

497
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:40,760
How did this competition
get onto Internet?

498
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,556
Everything's on Internet.

499
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:14,894
How are you?

500
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:20,231
Well, very well.

501
01:02:21,537 --> 01:02:25,166
- And how are you?
- Fine, fine...

502
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,908
They sang you
Happy Birthday last night...

503
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:36,107
Ah... yes...

504
01:02:38,454 --> 01:02:41,116
- Did you already know him?
- Who?

505
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:45,555
- The guy who plays the piano in the
hotel... - No...

506
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:49,491
And how did he know
it was your birthday?

507
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:54,731
Don't you think that's weird?

508
01:02:57,306 --> 01:02:59,797
He reminds me of the Wizard of Oz.

509
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:02,142
What's a pianist doing in that hotel?

510
01:03:02,812 --> 01:03:04,609
The Wizard controls everything...

511
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:07,275
It's as if he knew things about us.

512
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:09,407
And in the end he helps them...

513
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:11,446
I feel he's following me.

514
01:03:12,822 --> 01:03:14,221
How old are you?

515
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:23,098
Hey, look! Little fish.

516
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:29,732
Alfred...

517
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:40,310
- Hello.
- Hello.

518
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:44,548
Hello.

519
01:03:56,833 --> 01:04:01,969
Hello. I've had this
white streak since I was 12.

520
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:06,737
- You never let me answer you...
- It looks good on you...

521
01:04:08,811 --> 01:04:15,649
- lf I'd known it meant so much for you...
- Don't worry.

522
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:19,588
Good luck.

523
01:04:29,732 --> 01:04:31,393
What are you doing out here?

524
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:40,536
The following contestant is
Alfred Elliot...

525
01:05:40,571 --> 01:05:43,061
from the capital.

526
01:05:53,816 --> 01:05:57,308
- Good evening.
- The microphone's for the presentation...

527
01:06:04,894 --> 01:06:09,297
Well, first of all I'd like to apologise.

528
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:12,898
I'm here to dance supposedly,

529
01:06:13,402 --> 01:06:15,131
to do something that makes me happy,

530
01:06:15,571 --> 01:06:18,335
that distracts me from
the misery around me.

531
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:21,344
And I want you to know
I'm not going to do it,

532
01:06:21,379 --> 01:06:22,572
I'm not going to dance.

533
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:27,378
It's nothing to do with you.
Miramar's lovely... the people too.

534
01:06:28,217 --> 01:06:31,345
Actually, I've not met
many people because...

535
01:06:31,921 --> 01:06:34,991
well, I don't know why but
I've not seen anyone anywhere...

536
01:06:35,026 --> 01:06:36,390
maybe because of the cold,

537
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:41,423
maybe because everyone's warm at
home and doesn't want to go out.

538
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:48,904
I've got a real problem with happiness.
Stable people scare me.

539
01:06:48,939 --> 01:06:51,172
I'm not going to get
all sensitive and say;

540
01:06:51,207 --> 01:06:54,343
'the way things are in this
worid you can't be happy.'

541
01:06:54,378 --> 01:06:55,537
No, no, no...

542
01:06:55,878 --> 01:06:58,212
I knew I knew the way things
would be in the worid.

543
01:06:58,247 --> 01:07:02,377
This has only just begun. The way things
are we deserve much more...

544
01:07:03,819 --> 01:07:06,355
I don't want to generalise...
I don't like to generalise...

545
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:08,687
although I do like surveys.

546
01:07:09,492 --> 01:07:11,756
I'm a caring sort. We have to care.

547
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:15,431
I walk down the street and
if a guy gives me a flyer I take it.

548
01:07:15,466 --> 01:07:18,232
I realise that the guy
'has' to give out flyers,

549
01:07:18,267 --> 01:07:21,337
I also know he's going to give me
two stuck together instead of one.

550
01:07:21,372 --> 01:07:24,407
But I'll take it and I won't drop
it in the street, no, no, no...

551
01:07:24,442 --> 01:07:29,677
I carry on walking until
I find a bin to throw it in.

552
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:34,913
And don't tell me I'm immature
and refuse to grow up.

553
01:07:35,251 --> 01:07:38,186
No... why grow up?

554
01:07:39,922 --> 01:07:41,480
Have you seen this?

555
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:46,060
Have you seen this?

556
01:07:47,763 --> 01:07:50,357
Have you seen this?

557
01:08:46,021 --> 01:08:48,854
I'm dying, I'm dying...

558
01:10:42,004 --> 01:10:43,494
You danced really well last night...

559
01:10:49,278 --> 01:10:52,214
- Were you there?
- Of course I was there.

560
01:10:52,249 --> 01:10:53,909
Did you think I'd miss it?

561
01:10:55,384 --> 01:10:57,978
- I danced well, didn't I?
- Very well.

562
01:11:01,323 --> 01:11:02,950
But it was all for nothing.

563
01:11:04,226 --> 01:11:09,129
Why did they leave?
Why did they leave me alone?

564
01:11:09,498 --> 01:11:12,490
Alfred... Nicolás loves you. Abril too,

565
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:14,869
but they need each other right now.

566
01:11:15,137 --> 01:11:17,628
But that doesn't mean
you are worth any less.

567
01:11:18,574 --> 01:11:21,668
You were great last night, fabulous.

568
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:25,547
You've got a marvellous
future ahead of you.

569
01:11:26,148 --> 01:11:31,211
You don't need me or anyone
to tell you what you're worth, see?

570
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:38,894
Have you tried the cake
they serve at breakfast?

571
01:11:38,929 --> 01:11:41,124
- Delicious.
- Isn't it?

572
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:49,061
I'm off, Alfred, see you around...

573
01:11:52,174 --> 01:11:53,766
See you...

574
01:12:22,971 --> 01:12:23,960
Is something wrong?

575
01:12:25,641 --> 01:12:26,608
What are we doing here?

576
01:12:29,044 --> 01:12:32,138
I don't know. You were the one who
wanted to come.

577
01:12:40,622 --> 01:12:41,611
What's wrong, Nicolás?

578
01:12:43,158 --> 01:12:44,921
Do we have to stay
here much longer?

579
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:48,830
No, for just as long as you want.

580
01:13:19,862 --> 01:13:20,829
Here...

581
01:13:31,006 --> 01:13:33,440
I... I brought you to my room because...

582
01:13:34,009 --> 01:13:38,036
so you wouldn't wake
up alone, because...

583
01:13:38,981 --> 01:13:41,472
well... as... as you
weren't feeling too good...

584
01:13:42,618 --> 01:13:46,281
so that... I mean, if you needed
anything... that's why I brought you.

585
01:13:47,856 --> 01:13:50,620
I also brought you your breakfast,
but the thing is that...

586
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:55,262
...well... there was a chair and I tripped
over it... I dropped the lot...

587
01:13:55,731 --> 01:13:57,494
...I got a bit burnt, nothing serious...

588
01:14:00,235 --> 01:14:03,295
...the croissants are all that's left...

589
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:06,201
...but you can't eat solids anyway...
so it doesn't matter.

590
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:14,183
I don't know why I always end up
explaining everything...

591
01:14:14,218 --> 01:14:16,913
like that... too much... I realise...

592
01:14:17,152 --> 01:14:21,452
that I speak about things
of no importance...

593
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:26,158
well... I do realise...

594
01:14:26,495 --> 01:14:28,326
but it still comes out...

595
01:14:28,997 --> 01:14:33,263
I don't know, at times...
sometimes it seems that...

596
01:14:34,503 --> 01:14:35,993
I speak too much.

597
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:39,707
I want to leave Miramar.

598
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:45,371
Me too.

599
01:15:08,804 --> 01:15:09,498
Hello.

600
01:15:10,138 --> 01:15:10,729
Hello.

601
01:15:11,607 --> 01:15:12,266
Hello.

602
01:15:13,242 --> 01:15:17,338
I danced really well last night.
I know you had to leave.

603
01:15:18,213 --> 01:15:19,441
Don't worry.

604
01:15:23,118 --> 01:15:25,916
- Did it hurt?
- What?

605
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:27,381
Having your tooth out.

606
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:31,686
Ah... I don't remember.

607
01:15:42,004 --> 01:15:43,699
We're going back, Alfred...

608
01:15:46,942 --> 01:15:48,637
Yes, I know.

609
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:51,177
That's fine.

610
01:15:52,748 --> 01:15:54,545
Our last breakfast together...

611
01:15:58,453 --> 01:16:01,581
- I'm staying.
- What?

612
01:16:02,357 --> 01:16:03,289
I'm staying.

613
01:16:04,126 --> 01:16:07,490
- Where are you staying?
- Here.

614
01:16:07,525 --> 01:16:10,855
- But you have to go back.
- Why?

615
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:12,459
What do you mean 'why'?

616
01:16:14,536 --> 01:16:16,231
I have to stay and live here.

617
01:16:18,106 --> 01:16:19,505
The air's different.

618
01:16:21,543 --> 01:16:22,407
Don't worry...

619
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:25,144
I'll be alright.

620
01:16:50,539 --> 01:16:52,268
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

621
01:17:00,482 --> 01:17:01,915
- Alright?
- Yes.

622
01:17:05,387 --> 01:17:08,447
I think the three of us have something
to say to each other...

623
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:17,155
I want to say that there
are three people just like us

624
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:19,195
having breakfast at our table.

625
01:17:25,173 --> 01:17:27,141
That cake...

626
01:17:34,883 --> 01:17:37,252
I want to say thank you
for having come with me...

627
01:17:37,287 --> 01:17:38,719
We've come for each other,

628
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:40,587
each with the problems of the other...

629
01:17:40,856 --> 01:17:42,619
Yes, well... right... thanks.

630
01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:44,114
I wanted to say,

631
01:17:46,061 --> 01:17:52,364
Nicolás, I love you and
you're a good friend.

632
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:03,537
OK, shall we go?

633
01:19:14,616 --> 01:19:15,275
What?

634
01:19:19,387 --> 01:19:20,445
What's wrong?

635
01:19:22,791 --> 01:19:23,519
What?

636
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:25,651
- Nothing...
- What?

637
01:19:26,027 --> 01:19:29,087
- The horoscope...
- The chewing gum horoscope?

638
01:19:31,032 --> 01:19:32,499
What? What does it say?

639
01:19:33,368 --> 01:19:34,858
What does it say?

640
01:19:36,500 --> 01:20:00,000
