1
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:29,094
swimming alone

2
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,026
Wake up, Martín.

3
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:11,996
It's getting late.

4
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:49,100
Do you want a lift?

5
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,104
No... classes start later.

6
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:56,074
The Geography teacher isn't coming.
And I'm supposed to pick Guille up.

7
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,287
Aren't you eating?

8
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,288
No. I'm not hungry.

9
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,188
You must eat,
you are still growing.

10
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,398
Is there any raspberry jam?

11
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:23,435
No. Peach and
plum jam, as usual.

12
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,398
I wanted raspberry jam today.

13
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,979
Do you need a hand?

14
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:39,383
What does "osmosis" mean?

15
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,155
Osmosis... the whole line.

16
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,447
"The osmosis".

17
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:48,726
Your collar, Martín,
or they won't let you in.

18
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,035
- Hi.
- Hi.

19
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,458
This is a message for
Martín Canepa's parents.

20
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:30,995
Please contact the
school principal ASAP.

21
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,503
Hi. This is a message for
Martín from Diego Lindl

22
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,068
I used to be Pablo's room-mate.

23
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:53,218
Could you call me back?
My number is 4774-7649. Bye.

24
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,676
Hi.

25
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:51,641
How are you doing, Fede?

26
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,379
It's 5:25.

27
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,038
I know, I'm late.
My Mom hid my bass.

28
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:04,351
She wouldn't give it back till
I passed my English exam.

29
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,591
How did you find it?

30
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,960
I waited till she was gone.

31
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:13,264
She put it behind
the washing-machine.

32
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:17,401
It was soaked in foam.

33
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:48,899
I'll kill myself,
if that's what you want,

34
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:53,604
but then don't miss me
the way I miss you.

35
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:03,080
if that's what you want

36
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:10,047
but then don't cry for me
as I cry for you.

37
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:24,136
Things are not the
way we wanted them to be.

38
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:57,728
Excuse me. Do you know
where 2500 Arenales St. is?

39
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:01,697
Could you break this bill,
I need change.

40
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,235
No. Arenales St.?

41
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:11,275
Yes. It's 4 blocks away: French,
Juncal, Berutti and Arenales.

42
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,512
Thanks.

43
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:33,730
Hi.

44
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,101
- Anything else?
- No.

45
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:45,571
All right. Thanks.

46
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:50,047
- Could you give me some change
for the payphone? - Sure.

47
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,618
Thanks. Bye.

48
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:58,622
I expected you earlier.

49
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:00,283
I was listening to
the rehearse tape.

50
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,590
- What time are you meeting Eugenia?
- 12:30.

51
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,598
OK.

52
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:12,870
Fede's always late to rehearsals.

53
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:17,708
There's always something, right?.

54
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:23,013
- Is it late?
- Twenty past twelve.

55
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:32,990
Do you remember Diego, Pablo's
room-mate for almost a year?

56
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:38,295
- Yes, a friend of him. - I don't
know if they were friends...

57
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:42,366
- He left a message today.
- So?

58
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:48,339
I don't know. It could
be something important?

59
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,610
Did he leave his phone number?

60
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,613
- Yes. Probably
- Are you coming to the party?

61
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:58,181
Could it be about Pablo?

62
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:01,786
Hey! Do you want
to come to the party?

63
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:04,855
No, I don't feel like going.

64
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:06,448
I have to go.

65
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,525
- Which way are you going?
- Arenales and Laprida St.

66
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:13,897
2500 Arenales St.
I'm going the other way.

67
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,867
Bye.

68
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:59,169
- Hi.
- Hi.

69
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,232
Have you seen a white T-Shirt...

70
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:08,012
- Go to the laundromat.
- ... with a singer's picture on it?

71
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,239
- No. Oh, look at this!
- Can't Julieta go?

72
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:14,619
- She went to a birthday party.
- Does it have to be today?

73
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:20,691
Yes. Hurry up or they'll close.
You might find your T-shirt.

74
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:23,261
Is it the one round the corner?

75
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:26,330
No. On French St.,
four blocks from here.

76
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,926
Why didn't you use
the usual laundry?

77
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:32,229
Because there's a raffle
for a washing machine.

78
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:33,937
But we've already got one.

79
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:35,864
But this one is high tech.

80
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,111
- It's six blocks from here.
- Please.

81
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,982
- I bought you raspberry jam.
- Thanks.

82
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:59,096
- Hi.
- Hi.

83
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,160
I'm here to pick up some laundry.

84
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,928
- Have you got the receipt?
- Yes.

85
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:25,322
- How is it going with the drums?
- What?

86
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:29,259
Your mum told me her son wants
to be a drummer. Is that you?

87
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,130
Yes, that's me.

88
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:33,599
And a daughter who wanted
to be an English teacher.

89
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:38,292
Yes, my sister.

90
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,370
And another one.

91
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,343
Give my regards to your Mom
and tell her next week...

92
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,913
we're moving twenty yards
across the avenue.

93
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:53,116
Two blocks further away.

94
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,687
That's it. It's $5.

95
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,026
Bye.

96
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:07,331
Wait! Don't forget your coupon
for the washing-machine raffle.

97
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,500
And a candy.

98
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:17,407
If you raffle a washing-machine,
the winner won't be coming back.

99
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:21,845
This is a laundromat,
we couldn't raffle a TV set.

100
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,318
- Bye.
- Bye.

101
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,956
Can you drive me to Juan's
tomorrow to pick up a drum?

102
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,228
- At what time?
- About noon.

103
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:18,768
No, I can't. I've got to pick
Julieta up at Agustina's.

104
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,438
She's sleeping over.

105
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:24,207
It's close by.

106
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:32,050
You can walk, then. Last time you
messed up my car upholstery.

107
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,358
Don't do that! Use your plate.

108
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:44,358
There's fish on my plate and I don't
want to mix it with the salad.

109
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,366
Then get up, and
get a clean plate.

110
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,403
Don't smash anything.

111
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,192
The T-shirt wasn't in the bag.

112
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,261
The old one you use
for gym classes?

113
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:22,032
I've done some spring cleaning
and threw all the old stuff.

114
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,168
No, it was Pablo's.
A Morrisey T-Shirt.

115
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,340
The morley polo-neck
you got for Epiphany.

116
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:33,377
- It was for Christmas.
- Epiphany.

117
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:37,647
It's a T-shirt, not a polo-neck,
and I mean Morrisey, a singer.

118
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:43,387
- The one with a drawing?
- With a black and white picture.

119
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,858
It must be among
the ones I threw away.

120
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,660
Why do you want that T-Shirt now?

121
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:09,966
Did you call?

122
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,670
He was out. I left a
message for him to call me.

123
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,008
Leave the keys for your brother
with the superintendent.

124
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,177
I had a fight a row with him.

125
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:23,747
I went to pay the monthly expenses
and woke him up from his nap.

126
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:29,547
I don't want to go out late.
Perhaps Diego goes to sleep early.

127
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:33,423
If you want me to go with you,
we must wait for Mauro.

128
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,927
Otherwise, go alone,
or we go tomorrow.

129
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:43,700
I don't want to go late.
Diego may go out or go to be.

130
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,880
There was a message from school
about our absence today.

131
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:58,915
What did your parents say?

132
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:02,920
They were out, and I erased
the message just like you did.

133
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,357
Fede phoned me today.

134
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:12,495
He asked me to put
Monday's rehearsal off.

135
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:16,766
It's the second time this month
he's put a rehearsal off.

136
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:20,234
I saw him yesterday.
He gave me my skateboard back

137
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:21,329
the wheels are shot.
I have to sell it.

138
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:23,473
I've never seen Fede
on a skateboard.

139
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,734
He skated across his
grandma's yard but...

140
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:29,679
she wouldn't let him skate
because he ruined her flowerbeds.

141
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:36,987
- Call to see if your brother's
back. - I've just phoned.

142
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:44,894
It's... getting late.

143
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:59,476
- You have a dog?
- No.

144
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,447
A cat?
No.

145
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,949
- You must have a pet.
- No. I don't.

146
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:12,722
Do you want to come in?
No, thanks. There's nobody in.

147
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,135
- So what do you do?
- Nothing. We just talk.

148
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:27,733
Everyone in their pajamas?

149
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:32,109
Everyone but Agustina.
She wore a nightgown.

150
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:36,112
- And that's amusing?
- Sort of.

151
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:40,750
No! This is not a toy.
This is for playing tennis.

152
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:45,689
- Give me your bag.
- I'll carry it with me.

153
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:48,625
Let's get going.

154
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:02,105
Are you on your way to school?

155
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:05,001
Yes. But I'm going with Guille.

156
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:06,976
- Alright. Bye.
- Bye.

157
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:26,864
Sit down, everybody.
We'll start the class.

158
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:34,137
Arcuri.
Here.

159
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,208
Bavio.

160
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:41,403
Here.

161
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,378
Speak up, next time.

162
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:47,817
Cánepa

163
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:51,588
Is Cánepa absent again?

164
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,556
He's ill. He's got the flu.

165
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,383
He sprained his ankle last week.

166
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58,726
No, that was me.

167
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,797
Are you getting better?

168
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:02,932
No, but I don't want
to miss any more lessons.

169
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,736
Cánepa's a red-haired boy
who wears glasses?

170
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,141
No. The red-haired boy is Santín
and the one with glasses...

171
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:15,412
the Chinese guy, Chen-Tung.
Oh, yes. Chen-Tung.

172
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:21,518
Yes, Cánepa.

173
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:25,188
Tell him about
Thursday's test. OK?

174
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:32,028
Casenave.
Here.

175
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:54,478
Hi. This is another message
for Martín. It's Diego, again.

176
00:26:54,779 --> 00:27:00,684
I'd like you to come Thursday 6pm
to pick up some of Pablo's stuff

177
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:06,823
My phone is out of order.
My address is 2139 Olleros St

178
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:10,560
4th floor, apartment B. Bye.

179
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:41,124
Fede is in his English class.
Says he'll pay next time.

180
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:46,462
I've already booked it
for next Wednesday.

181
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,057
- Do you know if Fede's free?
- I don't know.

182
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:52,896
- Shall we go?
- Which way are you going?

183
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:55,371
The other way. We'll pick up
her little brother from school.

184
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,242
Bye.

185
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,289
Hi.

186
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:49,258
- Hi, Diego. It's me, Martín.
- Come in.

187
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,975
- The door is locked.
- I'll be right down.

188
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:21,157
I'm leaving next week and I didn't
know what to do with that stuff.

189
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:26,896
Like I was saying, I painted
all this myself.

190
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,833
What stuff are we talking about?

191
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,336
Just stuff belonging to Pablo.

192
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:39,308
The walls were light blue, right?
Yes.

193
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:43,346
Did they look OK?
Yes, I liked it better.

194
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:47,116
No, light-blue draws
all the light in.

195
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:50,620
There's the window.

196
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:54,590
Yeah, but the sun rises from
there and sets here.

197
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,859
It never shines here.

198
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:00,857
Then light green, as arranged.
Light-blue for the bedroom.

199
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,293
The bedroom's white.

200
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:05,468
The bedroom window's on that side;
Plenty of light.

201
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:09,105
You can use any color you like.

202
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,699
White looked great.

203
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,003
Can we see it?
Yes.

204
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,565
This is the box. Take it.

205
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:39,202
I should give it to Pablo, I guess.

206
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,270
I don't know. I can't find him.

207
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:45,842
Do you know where he is?

208
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:49,112
Sort of...
This huge!

209
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:53,816
The previous tenant used
to keep a bicycle in there.

210
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:58,154
We could put a lot
of shelves in here.

211
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:01,057
This is full of holes.

212
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:05,695
Pablo had pinned up
drawings and photos.

213
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:11,134
He ruined the wall.
It needs new plaster.

214
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:23,679
I'll see what I can do
to give this to him.

215
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:25,882
Hang on, we'll all leave together.

216
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:29,152
Do you like white?
Yes.

217
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,090
I think solid light blue
would look nice.

218
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:38,094
I'll wait in the living-room.

219
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,343
- Are we going to take a break?
- Hold on.

220
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:32,414
You should've studied early
in the morning, like I did.

221
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,017
I set the alarm-clock at six
but I overslept...

222
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:38,321
and dreamt I got up and studied.

223
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,860
- Ask me what the capital city is.
- Hang on.

224
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:49,732
Ask me about population.
Ask anything...

225
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:54,504
- Cut it out...
- Shoot.

226
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:58,474
What are you doing, asshole?
It's the only one I've got.

227
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,281
I can lend you another map.

228
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,874
And I'll help you with the test,
but let's go down for a snack

229
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,385
the brake will be over.

230
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:15,925
Ask me a couple of questions.
Please.

231
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:22,431
Then we can go.

232
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:32,475
What's wrong?

233
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:34,944
What is it?

234
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,215
I got Austria mixed
up with Australia.

235
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:46,355
What are those maps of yours of?

236
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:48,624
Austria, everything's Austria.

237
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:16,819
A fjord?

238
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:21,617
No, it's not a fjord, Bavio.
And what's this?

239
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:24,894
- It must be a fjord.
- Not, it's not.

240
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:30,166
Bavio, this will earn you
a three... rather a two

241
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:38,074
Yahut... step forward.

242
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:47,283
Get that shirt tidy.

243
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:54,149
And point at the different
Australian regions.

244
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,496
Excuse me. Can I take Cánepa
and Lucena out for a while?

245
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:07,737
Bring all your stuff.

246
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:29,992
Thanks. Sorry.

247
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,395
Delicious! What flavor is it?

248
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,066
It's new. Raspberry-flavored.

249
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:21,210
Eugenia's got to stay in studying
tonight, shall we do something?

250
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:25,981
Alright, let us.

251
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,439
At least we weren't tested.

252
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:23,637
I played tennis with Ricardo
yesterday and at one point...

253
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:30,780
he lent me his racket.
A graphite racket.

254
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:36,319
Very ligth.

255
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:39,379
You know my backhand is weak.

256
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:44,694
With this racket I got all
the balls in. Amazing.

257
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:50,800
I have an inter-club tournament
next week. I'd like you to come.

258
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:57,206
- We can have lunch together after.
- Ok.

259
00:37:58,776 --> 00:37:59,674
How are you doing?

260
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:02,878
Fine.

261
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,848
What about school?

262
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:08,317
School?

263
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:13,889
Hi. What is it?

264
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:21,698
Look in my desk's third drawer,
it should be there.

265
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:27,336
How's school coming along?

266
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:32,274
School as usual.

267
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:34,843
Try to avoid sitting for
any March exams...

268
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:38,147
so we can all go on
vacations together.

269
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:42,418
I must sit in March for
last year's pending exams.

270
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:45,845
Don't add on any new ones.

271
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:50,025
Does it have a red cover?
That's it.

272
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:54,129
I'll be there in an
hour and a half.

273
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,370
It was Agustín, Ricardo's son.

274
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:09,336
He started working with us two weeks ago.
He's a great guy, your age.

275
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:20,090
He's saving money to jump off
bridges. He likes extreme sports.

276
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:23,659
He wants to buy a bungee cord.

277
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,763
He'll study to be a gym teacher.

278
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:32,034
He's a great guy.

279
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,938
Have you made up your mind
about your studies next year?

280
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:42,012
No, I don't know.
I've still got half a year left.

281
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:47,016
You'd better start
thinking about it.

282
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:08,404
- There you go.
- Thank you.

283
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:15,978
No. I don't know. Isn't he
in touch with your parents?

284
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:18,747
Mum and dad don't talk with him.

285
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:23,252
Since he left two years ago, they
probably talked four times.

286
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:25,387
He did the same to me.

287
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:28,924
After being together two years,
one day he took off...

288
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:31,427
and he never called me again.

289
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:34,390
Why are you looking him for?

290
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:36,197
I don't know.

291
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:40,069
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

292
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:05,627
The last thing I knew
about your brother...

293
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:11,633
is that he was working for an
aquarium in Mar del Plata.

294
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:17,206
- In Mar del Plata?
- A friend of mine ran into him.

295
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:21,276
Is he still there
or has he come back?

296
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:24,480
I don't know.
It was an aquarium in Camet.

297
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,150
I don't know where Camet is.

298
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:33,322
Close to the airport,
by the city entrance.

299
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,728
- Is it important?
- Yes.

300
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,900
No. In fact, it isn't.

301
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,443
- If I hear anything else,
I'll let you know. - OK.

302
00:41:58,215 --> 00:42:00,115
- I'd better be going.
- I'll stay.

303
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:08,390
- OK. Bye.
- Bye.

304
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,948
It's been a year since
I last walked past here.

305
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:39,254
Do you remember when your Dad
used to drive us every morning?

306
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:44,026
And on Tuesday my Mum would
bring me to my swimming lessons.

307
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:46,862
And she'd chat with my Mom in the
bar there until we'd go out.

308
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:55,170
This is where I
learned how to swim.

309
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:58,907
This is a big pool.

310
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:04,447
It used to be. The other day I
walked by, and felt like going in.

311
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,649
They were all strangers.

312
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:11,587
Remember where the pool was?
The kindergarten is there now.

313
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,158
What happened with the
kindergarten classrooms?

314
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,319
- They have computers now.
- Computers?

315
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:25,234
Did you tell your
dad about school?

316
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:29,004
- No, not yet. What about you?
- Me neither.

317
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:33,075
They were coming in
as I was going out.

318
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:04,197
I'll kill myself,
if that's what you want,

319
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:15,349
but then don't miss me
the way I miss you.

320
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:32,434
If that's what you want

321
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:37,106
but then don't cry for me
as I cry for you.

322
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:48,651
Things are not the
way we wanted them to be.

323
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:21,883
Have you got 20 cents?

324
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:24,519
Yes.

325
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:28,957
I had plenty of change last
night, but now... I ran out.

326
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:36,431
Can you take the #67 bus?

327
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:41,403
Yes, but with the #113
I walk two blocks less.

328
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:47,342
- Don't you feel like walking?
- No. I'm tired.

329
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:54,116
Do you want to stay at my place?

330
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:58,086
I haven't said anything
and my folks are sleeping.

331
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:03,058
It's OK. Never mind.

332
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:10,866
Here comes your bus.

333
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:12,901
Bye.

334
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:28,950
Hi.

335
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:31,920
Hi. Don't make any noise,
Mom and Dad are sleeping.

336
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:37,925
Are you leaving?

337
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:39,221
In a while. Is it cold?

338
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:43,999
Yeah.

339
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:45,967
Have you just bought croissants?

340
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:50,972
Yeah. Martín and I
were kicked out of school.

341
00:46:55,045 --> 00:46:56,945
- Want some?
- No.

342
00:46:59,616 --> 00:47:02,517
- When are you telling them?
- When I see them.

343
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:41,514
Hi. It was at the door.

344
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:44,527
Leave it on the table
for your Dad to read.

345
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:46,495
You should have told us
you were coming this late.

346
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:51,500
Yeah, I know, but there
were no phones where I was.

347
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:20,729
There's no hot water.

348
00:48:20,797 --> 00:48:22,697
The water was emptied
for cleaning.

349
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:25,534
You should have told me.

350
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:28,503
Suarez put up a notice in the
elevator. Thought you'd read it.

351
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:32,301
I don't go around reading notices.
And now what?

352
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:36,545
Wash your hair in
the laundry-room.

353
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:41,049
Have you seen the sports section?

354
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,986
No. Martín brought the paper.

355
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:46,044
He's just gone to bed.

356
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:49,391
Is anything wrong with him?

357
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,061
I don't know. Didn't he tell you
anything when you two had lunch?

358
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:56,364
No, we just talked.

359
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:08,310
- Excuse me, got a light?
- I don't smoke.

360
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:11,246
- What time is it?
- I don't wear a watch.

361
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:13,348
Are you Martín Cánepa?

362
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:19,621
Remember me? Tomás Forte.
Elementary school mate.

363
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:23,326
How are you?

364
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,662
I didn't recognize you.
You look different.

365
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:31,800
I lost like twenty pounds.

366
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:37,639
I cut my hair. It used to be brown.
You look just the same.

367
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:42,337
Yeah. Didn't you use
to live near Crámer Ave.?

368
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:45,472
I still do. I came to visit a
friend but he seems to be out.

369
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:48,850
- Here?
- Yes.

370
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:53,822
Anyway, I can visit my brother.
He's rehearsing near here.

371
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:58,660
Weren't your brother and
my brother in the same class?

372
00:49:59,363 --> 00:50:02,264
Maybe.

373
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:07,235
We used to walk back from
school together, remember?

374
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:12,373
Do you know if he stills sees him?

375
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:15,343
No idea. Why?

376
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:20,248
No, it's nothing.

377
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:24,586
Come with me, and we'll ask him.

378
00:50:24,654 --> 00:50:26,246
Ok.

379
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:30,349
- Let's wait another five minutes.
- OK.

380
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:06,728
After school I hardly
ever saw Pablo again.

381
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:09,798
Once on a bus,
but we hardly spoke.

382
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,200
Where did he go?

383
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:17,172
We were not close friends. He was
always on his own or with Lucas.

384
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:22,410
- How much did you spend?
- Lucas Tamborino?

385
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,640
Is it tomorrow noon or evening?

386
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:27,316
Have you got Lucas's phone number?

387
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:30,911
No. He moved to Mar del Plata
before finishing school.

388
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:34,980
Call me later, around 11 pm.
I know who's got it.

389
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:39,427
- Can't you call now? - No,
my friend works till 10.

390
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:44,799
You never answered.
Noon or evening?

391
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:47,003
Tomorrow noon.

392
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:50,396
OK. See you tomorrow.

393
00:51:51,475 --> 00:51:54,376
- Let me out.
- What?

394
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,571
Let me out!

395
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:06,580
- Want some potato chips?
- Alright.

396
00:52:27,444 --> 00:52:31,346
What an asshole!
He forgot his backpack.

397
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:38,553
Let's see what he has in here.

398
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:52,834
- What is it?
- A tuner.

399
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:57,064
For a guitar?

400
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:00,241
Bass, Guitar, whatever.

401
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:06,812
You connect it and play a note,
then it shows if it's tuned.

402
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:12,120
In the middle, it's tuned.
An "A".

403
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:19,761
With the instrument you go... LA.

404
00:53:22,098 --> 00:53:26,000
Well, that wasn't it,
but if you sing a La...

405
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:35,634
No, that was wrong.

406
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:41,349
You try.

407
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,124
There, there it was in the middle.

408
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:56,222
It's more like...

409
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,794
No. It's like...

410
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:02,130
Almost there.

411
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:08,109
Too high.

412
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:45,207
- Tomorrow's my birthday.
- You mean, Friday?

413
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,182
No, today.

414
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,681
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

415
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,859
Do you still see
anyone from school?

416
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:01,262
- Guille.
- Guille?

417
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:04,299
Guillermo Lucena.
Remember him?

418
00:55:05,669 --> 00:55:07,569
Oh, yes. The crazy skater?

419
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:10,505
- Does he still skate?
- Yes.

420
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:22,150
And you? Do you still
go to the same school?

421
00:55:22,252 --> 00:55:25,449
No. I was expelled as a sophomore.

422
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:31,159
I was the best student,
but I was expelled.

423
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:37,057
Do you see anyone?

424
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:40,065
Nicolás Araujo.

425
00:55:41,037 --> 00:55:42,937
Does he still live near here?

426
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:45,940
No. He moved near
the Botanical Gardens.

427
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:53,414
This band... They're playing
on Saturday. We could go.

428
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:56,247
Yeah, sure.

429
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:59,249
They play near my house.

430
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:03,351
If it gets too late, you
can sleep over in my house.

431
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:07,559
Yes, we'll see.

432
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:16,264
- We forgot to call my brother.
- Is it too late?

433
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:19,274
I don't know.

434
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:22,310
I'll call him tomorrow.

435
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:27,449
- Do you want to stay
here tonight? - OK.

436
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:37,492
I'll phone home
to let them know.

437
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:41,796
Sure. Take a look.
The phone is somewhere around.

438
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:57,313
When did you get up?

439
00:56:57,414 --> 00:57:00,577
A while ago. I was woken
by the workers next door.

440
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:04,983
I didn't hear them.
You should have woken me up.

441
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:08,890
I did try, but you
were fast asleep

442
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:12,988
Yeah, I slept like a baby.

443
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:28,970
- The milk's there.
- Thanks.

444
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:34,949
We could go out or something.

445
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:41,449
It's my birthday, I'll do something
with my folks. We go out for lunch.

446
00:57:44,394 --> 00:57:48,524
I can't make it to that
concert on Saturday.

447
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:53,130
I'm traveling with my folks.

448
00:57:53,903 --> 00:57:56,531
Going on a trip?

449
00:57:56,673 --> 00:57:59,972
My Mom won it at the laundromat.
We're going to Europe for a month.

450
00:58:04,714 --> 00:58:08,013
They raffle washing-machines
at the laundromat near home.

451
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:11,719
Washing-machines?

452
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:18,126
- That's ridiculous.
- Why? I think is OK.

453
00:58:21,397 --> 00:58:23,388
Yeah, it's a laundromat.

454
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:27,061
Exactly, a washing-machine.

455
00:58:27,437 --> 00:58:29,564
Have some.

456
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:33,403
Yes, I'll call your brother.

457
00:58:33,476 --> 00:58:35,535
The phone is somewhere.

458
00:58:58,334 --> 00:59:00,234
This one has an
anticipatory subject.

459
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:06,541
That's when the subject
is there and it isn't.

460
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:12,447
Alright. Go ahead.

461
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:15,383
Anticipatory subject.

462
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,787
Now it's your turn.

463
00:59:23,259 --> 00:59:26,160
I swear...
I swear...

464
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:30,165
that what Martin tells me
that what Martin tells me

465
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:35,170
I won't tell anyone...
I won't tell anyone...

466
00:59:36,139 --> 00:59:40,075
particularly Mom or Dad...
particularly Mom or Dad...

467
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:46,147
lest I be ran down by a ship.
lest I be ran down by a ship.

468
00:59:48,952 --> 00:59:51,853
You have to do like this...

469
00:59:53,823 --> 00:59:56,815
Promised.

470
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:01,896
You'll catch a cold.

471
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:05,099
I won't be swimming in the sea.

472
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:07,502
You'll catch a cold.

473
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,340
I must go.

474
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:15,843
Tomorrow Paula
will show me a hole.

475
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:20,248
What hole?

476
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:22,316
A hole in the fence
to skip gym class.

477
01:00:25,388 --> 01:00:28,289
- Tomorrow after school?
- Yeah.

478
01:00:29,425 --> 01:00:31,325
Then I won't see you.

479
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:36,130
Do you want me to bring
you something?

480
01:00:36,566 --> 01:00:39,467
No.

481
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:41,669
Do you want me to give Pablo
any message from you?

482
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:03,724
Would you review these sentences?

483
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:14,736
- Aren't you late?
- Yes, I'm leaving.

484
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:19,407
Tomorrow's Fede's birthday.

485
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:25,577
I was invited to spend the weekend
at his house in the country...

486
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:26,580
Guille is also coming.

487
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:30,819
- Isn't Fede's birthday in August?
- No, it's tomorrow.

488
01:01:33,156 --> 01:01:35,056
I'm staying at Guille's tonight.

489
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:38,859
Fede's parents are picking
us up on Saturday morning.

490
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:44,532
Phone me from Fede's.

491
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:47,568
There's no phone in the country-
house. I'll see what I can do.

492
01:01:52,608 --> 01:01:54,508
Anyway, write down Guille
and Fede's phone numbers.

493
01:01:58,648 --> 01:02:01,549
Take some clothes to change.

494
01:02:01,918 --> 01:02:03,818
I'll pack a bag after school.

495
01:02:05,488 --> 01:02:08,389
I won't be here
when you come back.

496
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:13,127
I'll phone from
Guille's tonight.

497
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:16,831
- Bye
- Bye

498
01:03:26,335 --> 01:03:28,235
Do you think it'll be
cold in Mar del Plata?

499
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:32,873
I don't know.

500
01:03:32,942 --> 01:03:34,842
I guess I should
take a sweatshirt.

501
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:37,378
- When are you coming back?
- Sunday evening.

502
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:42,983
Remember the letter from school
will be arriving on Monday.

503
01:03:43,786 --> 01:03:47,722
Yes, I know. I want to be there
to do some explaining.

504
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:56,130
We should continue rehearsing
whithout Fede.

505
01:03:59,035 --> 01:04:00,935
Until He learns English.

506
01:04:03,306 --> 01:04:05,206
Sure.

507
01:04:05,641 --> 01:04:07,541
His mother hid his bass again.

508
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,747
He's been looking
for it for over a week.

509
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,754
Or shall I take a sweater?

510
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:24,325
Or a jacket...

511
01:06:40,129 --> 01:06:42,029
Yes... may I speak to Lucas?
Martín Cánepa speaking.

512
01:06:45,234 --> 01:06:47,134
He'll be back late?

513
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:50,471
Please tell him I'll
call him back tomorrow?

514
01:06:55,244 --> 01:06:57,144
Thanks, bye.

515
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:11,692
Hi.
Hi.

516
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:18,832
I'm Luciana, Lucas's sister.
He is not in.

517
01:07:20,636 --> 01:07:24,572
When can I find him?

518
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,540
I'm meeting him for lunch later.

519
01:07:27,143 --> 01:07:28,041
Shall I give him a message?

520
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:30,210
No, thanks.

521
01:07:32,982 --> 01:07:35,883
I have to go to the aquarium
near the airport.

522
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:38,218
What bus takes me there?

523
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:42,222
Many buses stop right there.
You can take the 131.

524
01:07:44,794 --> 01:07:46,694
That's the one I'm taking.

525
01:07:57,673 --> 01:08:00,574
- Bye.
- Bye.

526
01:08:37,179 --> 01:08:39,079
Do you like fish?

527
01:08:40,216 --> 01:08:42,116
Yes, I like colored fish.

528
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:47,855
But I'm not going to the aquarium
to buy fish, I'm looking for someone

529
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:52,059
for other reason.

530
01:08:59,268 --> 01:09:01,168
Want some candy?

531
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:14,415
- What flavor are you looking for?
- Raspberry.

532
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:19,720
Take it, there's only one left.

533
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:24,625
- No, it's alright.
- Please.

534
01:09:24,693 --> 01:09:26,593
Thanks.

535
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:01,361
We are having lunch with
Lucas near the aquarium.

536
01:10:02,231 --> 01:10:04,131
I'll give you the address
so you can talk to him.

537
01:10:05,668 --> 01:10:06,100
Alright.

538
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:09,269
- Are you going there now?
- We're meeting later.

539
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,340
I am going to the beach.

540
01:10:19,949 --> 01:10:23,112
- Do you like fish?
- Yes.

541
01:10:24,853 --> 01:10:28,755
You can come with me to the aquarium

542
01:10:29,525 --> 01:10:31,425
and then we could meet your brother.

543
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:35,220
Alright.

544
01:11:08,063 --> 01:11:09,963
He went to Montevideo
15 days ago looking for work.

545
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:14,701
- He almost didn't tell me.
- What do you mean?

546
01:11:15,738 --> 01:11:17,638
- He called me the day before.
- So he did tell you.

547
01:11:20,542 --> 01:11:21,839
Yes.

548
01:11:26,081 --> 01:11:27,981
Did he say where he would stay?

549
01:11:28,484 --> 01:11:30,384
In a hotel across
the bus station.

550
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:38,358
What was Pablo doing here?

551
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:43,197
I don't know.
Nothing, I think.

552
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:46,533
We didn't see each
other much lately.

553
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:56,276
You've got sand in your hair.

554
01:11:56,679 --> 01:11:58,579
I spent the night at the beach.

555
01:12:01,784 --> 01:12:03,684
They put the two orders together.

556
01:12:05,387 --> 01:12:07,287
It doesn't matter.

557
01:12:29,445 --> 01:12:31,345
Hi, can I help you?

558
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:33,914
I want to go to Montevideo.

559
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:36,984
There's a bus leaving tomorrow.

560
01:12:39,521 --> 01:12:41,421
Yes, 5 pm. Two?

561
01:12:43,125 --> 01:12:45,025
- What?
- Two tickets?

562
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:47,094
No, jut one, please.

563
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:49,596
I'm afraid it'll be
a stand-by ticket.

564
01:12:50,299 --> 01:12:52,267
Tomorrow's bus is fully booked.

565
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:54,268
To Montevideo?

566
01:12:54,636 --> 01:12:56,536
There's a whole school
volleyball team travelling.

567
01:12:57,806 --> 01:12:59,706
They're playing a
Brazilian team tonight...

568
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:02,309
and if they win, the final
match is in Montevideo.

569
01:13:02,578 --> 01:13:04,478
My nephew Felipe is playing.

570
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:08,615
Give me your name and phone number

571
01:13:09,017 --> 01:13:10,917
If they don't travel,
I'll book you a seat.

572
01:13:10,986 --> 01:13:12,886
Martín Cánepa.

573
01:13:14,656 --> 01:13:16,556
4-9-1-0-9-2-8.
It's mine. Is it OK?

574
01:13:20,763 --> 01:13:22,663
Call me tomorrow morning, then.

575
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:25,465
OK, thanks. Bye.

576
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:32,506
When we came in winter,
my Mom would get mad...

577
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:36,076
because I wanted to swim,
and I'd get a cold.

578
01:13:37,613 --> 01:13:39,513
I like swimming at night,
When the water is warm.

579
01:13:42,151 --> 01:13:42,151
But it's cold at night.

580
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:48,922
No, the water takes longer to
change temperature than the air.

581
01:13:50,192 --> 01:13:52,092
At day, even when it's warm,

582
01:13:53,562 --> 01:13:55,462
the water's cold 'cause the moon
cooled it the night before.

583
01:13:58,233 --> 01:14:00,133
At night, the water's warm because
it was warmed by the sun.

584
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:07,140
I didn't know that.

585
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,380
I'd like to live by the sea.

586
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:18,685
It bores you in the end.

587
01:14:21,089 --> 01:14:26,994
By year end, I want to go
to live to Buenos Aires.

588
01:14:30,732 --> 01:14:34,293
You'll be going in summer when
everybody there comes over here.

589
01:14:38,006 --> 01:14:40,702
Are you going on holidays?

590
01:14:40,843 --> 01:14:42,743
I don't think so.

591
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:06,566
- It's getting cloudy.
- Yeah, and I only brought this.

592
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:09,569
Take this.

593
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:15,442
Thanks.

594
01:15:20,582 --> 01:15:22,482
When I was a kid, I believed here
could also predict the weather.

595
01:15:25,587 --> 01:15:27,487
Because you have the sea-lions
that change colors.

596
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:30,424
I could nevertell
if that was true.

597
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:34,995
Neither could I.

598
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:38,131
My Mom once bought one,
but the heating is always on

599
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:40,567
and it turned purple.

600
01:15:41,904 --> 01:15:47,809
To avoid that I taped
mine outside the window.

601
01:15:49,811 --> 01:15:51,711
But someone stole it.

602
01:15:57,686 --> 01:15:59,586
Are you still cold?

603
01:15:59,655 --> 01:16:02,556
No, but it's too large for me.

604
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:06,458
It was too large for Pablo as well.
It must be a large sweatshirt.

605
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:20,807
Do you know who won
the volleyball match?

606
01:16:23,378 --> 01:16:25,278
No.

607
01:16:25,547 --> 01:16:30,450
Yes, I saw people celebrating
the victory in the streets.

608
01:16:31,186 --> 01:16:33,086
What was their team?

609
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:37,090
I don't know.

610
01:16:37,693 --> 01:16:39,593
Did they speak Spanish
or Portuguese?

611
01:16:42,831 --> 01:16:44,731
English.

612
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:47,334
They were singing "We are
the champions", Queen.

613
01:16:57,412 --> 01:16:59,312
That bed's got a metal bar.

614
01:17:00,716 --> 01:17:02,616
Pablo was always
complaining about it.

615
01:17:04,453 --> 01:17:06,353
He slept there for
the first three months.

616
01:17:10,025 --> 01:17:13,927
I remember once you stayed
with us, I was about six...

617
01:17:19,034 --> 01:17:20,934
and you and Pablo woke me up

618
01:17:23,605 --> 01:17:27,507
to tell me there was an
alien in the living-room.

619
01:17:27,609 --> 01:17:28,507
Really?

620
01:17:28,577 --> 01:17:31,478
I couldn't go back to sleep.

621
01:17:43,859 --> 01:17:45,759
Do you know if
it's cold in Montevideo?

622
01:17:49,398 --> 01:17:51,298
I don't know. I can lend
you a sweater, if you want.

623
01:17:55,871 --> 01:17:57,771
Alright. I'll let you
know if I need one.

624
01:18:12,954 --> 01:18:14,854
- Hi.
- Hi.

625
01:18:16,925 --> 01:18:18,916
I couldn't sleep.

626
01:18:19,628 --> 01:18:22,529
Must be the bed.

627
01:18:23,398 --> 01:18:25,298
Yeah, I slept better on the beach.

628
01:18:33,742 --> 01:18:35,642
- What are you studying?
- Geographic features.

629
01:18:46,354 --> 01:18:48,254
Will you give me some juice?
There's a glass for you there.

630
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:51,691
Ah... ok.

631
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:01,901
I'm sorry.

632
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:40,040
- It's a...
- It's a...

633
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:42,676
- What were you saying?
- And you?

634
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:48,415
It's a pity we ran out of juice.
What were you saying?

635
01:19:50,118 --> 01:19:52,018
The same thing.

636
01:20:38,066 --> 01:20:39,966
The sun will rise soon.

637
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:43,470
Can we get the paper here?

638
01:20:44,005 --> 01:20:45,905
I don't know. Why don't you ask?

639
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:47,100
They only have
the Economy section.

640
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:54,240
There is Lucas.

641
01:21:56,411 --> 01:21:58,470
He always gets up early.

642
01:22:01,216 --> 01:22:03,116
There's only one shot left,
take any picture you like.

643
01:22:51,466 --> 01:22:53,366
Is Massera still on business?

644
01:22:53,935 --> 01:22:56,529
Yes, but there are
very few branches left.

645
01:22:57,539 --> 01:22:59,439
My Mom took a picture of me
outside one of the branches...

646
01:23:01,743 --> 01:23:03,643
hugging a huge ice-cream cone.

647
01:23:04,713 --> 01:23:06,613
Massera's caramel flavor
had real caramel in it.

648
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:11,718
And they'd give you a
free chocolate coating.

649
01:23:19,461 --> 01:23:21,361
Have you noticed there are
three taps in baths...

650
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:27,601
cold, hot and the
one in the middle?

651
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:30,570
When I was a child, my brother told
me the middle tap was for chocolate.

652
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:35,909
Did you believe him
for a long time?

653
01:23:39,214 --> 01:23:41,114
No... I can't remember.

654
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:43,750
But now I prefer taking
baths to showers.

655
01:23:53,495 --> 01:23:57,397
Near my home in the capital city
there's also an Arenales St.

656
01:23:58,833 --> 01:24:00,733
Really?

657
01:24:03,071 --> 01:24:04,971
The laundromat would move
three blocks that way...

658
01:24:08,543 --> 01:24:10,443
and my home would be
three blocks that way.

659
01:24:16,751 --> 01:24:19,777
- Shall we go that way?
- Yes. Let us.

660
01:24:50,385 --> 01:24:52,285
- Did you call?
- Yes.

661
01:24:54,322 --> 01:24:56,222
I'm not going to Montevideo.

662
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,660
- Did they win?
- No, they lost.

663
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:04,030
First time in over a year.

664
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:10,667
Why aren't you going then?

665
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:20,680
Are you leaving now?

666
01:25:25,019 --> 01:25:26,919
There's a train
leaving in 2 hours.

667
01:25:49,878 --> 01:25:51,778
I think I'll have a swim.

668
01:26:40,562 --> 01:26:42,792
Here's my phone number.

669
01:26:48,937 --> 01:26:51,838
I think I have a cold,
I shouldn't have got into the sea.

670
01:27:04,519 --> 01:27:06,419
What are you going to do now?

671
01:27:08,022 --> 01:27:09,922
I may go to Sacoa.

672
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:14,161
Sacoa used to be only
in Mar del Plata.

673
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:16,129
It was in a basement.

674
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:20,133
You'd go downstairs and everything
was lights and sounds.

675
01:27:26,207 --> 01:27:28,141
I used to play Bubble Bobble.

676
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:31,144
- So did I. With my brother.
- Me too.

677
01:27:33,214 --> 01:27:35,808
I didn't like to play alone.

678
01:27:38,219 --> 01:27:40,153
How did the Bubble
Bobble theme go?

679
01:27:41,222 --> 01:27:42,154
I can't remember

680
01:27:49,664 --> 01:27:51,564
Wait a second...

681
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:41,380
Do you love your brother?

682
01:28:48,756 --> 01:28:50,656
He's my brother.

683
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:56,896
Do I look like him?

684
01:28:59,834 --> 01:29:01,734
He's your brother.

685
01:30:26,754 --> 01:30:28,654
Martín... come here.

686
01:30:34,862 --> 01:30:36,762
Can you plug in the
Christmas tree?

687
01:30:47,408 --> 01:30:50,309
It's lovely.
Do you like it?

688
01:30:59,253 --> 01:31:01,153
One line won't turn on.

689
01:31:22,443 --> 01:31:25,344
Where are you spending Christmas?

690
01:31:25,413 --> 01:31:29,315
- I don't know. What about you?
- At my cousin's.

691
01:31:30,084 --> 01:31:32,279
Have you thought of a new school?

692
01:31:33,454 --> 01:31:36,355
There is a new school near home.

693
01:31:36,424 --> 01:31:39,325
We can go tomorrow
to check it out.

694
01:31:39,393 --> 01:31:41,293
Tomorrow is Christmas day.

695
01:31:42,363 --> 01:31:46,265
I've got a bass-player's
phone number, we should phone him.

696
01:31:46,334 --> 01:31:47,232
Sure.

697
01:31:49,737 --> 01:31:51,637
Let's get together
after Christmas...

698
01:31:54,308 --> 01:31:56,208
and we could rehearse then.

699
01:32:03,117 --> 01:32:06,018
I have to take this to my mom.

700
01:32:09,924 --> 01:32:12,825
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

701
01:33:05,513 --> 01:33:16,412
What is this I'm feeling?

702
01:33:22,597 --> 01:33:33,496
It's me, somebody inside of me

703
01:33:36,944 --> 01:33:42,177
Is asking me

704
01:33:43,551 --> 01:34:10,470
not to be still while I grow up

705
01:34:51,152 --> 01:35:05,055
Who am I? I'm finding out

706
01:35:10,104 --> 01:35:21,003
It's me, somebody inside of me

707
01:35:24,585 --> 01:35:29,488
I'm telling myself

708
01:35:30,758 --> 01:35:40,656
I can have time on my side

709
01:35:47,508 --> 01:35:57,406
I can have time on my side

710
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:49,258
This time I want
to go farther than ever

711
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:29,258
