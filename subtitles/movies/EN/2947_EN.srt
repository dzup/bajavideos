1
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:37,169
Once upon a time,
there was a lonely kind of a guy...

2
00:00:37,211 --> 00:00:40,297
who'd resigned himself
to the fact that love was blind.

3
00:00:40,881 --> 00:00:43,926
"Now, if love is blind, "
he thought to himself...

4
00:00:44,426 --> 00:00:46,345
"How will it find me?

5
00:00:46,595 --> 00:00:49,014
"lt honestly seems such a crime.

6
00:00:49,473 --> 00:00:52,684
"For how many times
has love knocked on the door...

7
00:00:52,726 --> 00:00:55,437
"when it should have been
knocking on mine?"

8
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,942
And so one day, he went off
in search of the aloof creature.

9
00:01:01,526 --> 00:01:04,278
He soon happened upon
the cute and fuzzy bunny gang.

10
00:01:04,362 --> 00:01:06,322
Perhaps they could help him.

11
00:01:08,241 --> 00:01:11,327
"Pardon me, cute and fuzzy bunnies, "
he said.

12
00:01:11,577 --> 00:01:14,914
"l wonder if you could help me find love. "

13
00:01:15,789 --> 00:01:17,666
"Love would have nothing to do...

14
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,712
"with such a stupid-looking creature, "
said the first cute and fuzzy bunny.

15
00:01:22,504 --> 00:01:25,048
"With that nose. And those shoes. "

16
00:01:25,465 --> 00:01:26,717
"And that stomach. "

17
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,093
"And those eyes. "

18
00:01:28,176 --> 00:01:29,803
"And those ears. "

19
00:01:31,513 --> 00:01:34,015
"Roses are red, violets are blue...

20
00:01:34,474 --> 00:01:37,936
"but love will have
nothing to do with you! "

21
00:01:38,436 --> 00:01:41,272
They chanted and danced around him.

22
00:01:41,481 --> 00:01:44,609
Naturally, our hero
was very saddened by this, so...

23
00:01:46,194 --> 00:01:47,195
he....

24
00:01:47,403 --> 00:01:49,989
Actually, he....

25
00:01:50,281 --> 00:01:52,491
He reached into his suitcase...

26
00:01:52,575 --> 00:01:54,952
and pulled out an lsraeli submachine gun...

27
00:01:55,035 --> 00:01:57,871
and he sawed those
cute, fuzzy bastards in half...

28
00:01:57,955 --> 00:01:59,832
with hot lead!

29
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:02,459
lt was beautiful!

30
00:02:02,543 --> 00:02:05,212
Wait, stop! No, no.

31
00:02:05,337 --> 00:02:08,382
It's supposed to be a love story
not a Rambo bloodbath.

32
00:02:09,132 --> 00:02:11,676
Forget it. It's not your fault. It's me.

33
00:02:17,974 --> 00:02:20,935
Morty, how am I going to get this done?

34
00:02:21,144 --> 00:02:23,688
What do you know?
You're not a man. You're a cat.

35
00:02:23,771 --> 00:02:26,524
Go back to your feline world.
Get out of here.

36
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:34,740
You better move it, Hoops.
You'll miss graduation.

37
00:02:34,824 --> 00:02:36,033
Okay, Mom.

38
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,619
Here's your cap and gown. All clean.

39
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:41,914
-What do you mean, "All clean"?
-Hoops, these are rented.

40
00:02:41,955 --> 00:02:44,082
Do you know
how many people wear them?

41
00:02:44,124 --> 00:02:45,459
I washed them.

42
00:02:45,584 --> 00:02:46,460
Rita Segal.

43
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,465
Solomon Shapiro. Frank Stephens.

44
00:02:54,426 --> 00:02:56,428
Shirley Strom.

45
00:02:57,929 --> 00:03:01,140
I got to get out of Generic this summer.
I'm gonna lose my mind.

46
00:03:01,266 --> 00:03:03,935
Come to Nantucket with me.
We'll have a blast.

47
00:03:03,977 --> 00:03:07,063
-We'll scale the mermaids.
-I can't be a party monkey.

48
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:08,397
I got to buckle down.

49
00:03:08,481 --> 00:03:11,233
I've got two weeks to submit
my scholarship assignment.

50
00:03:11,317 --> 00:03:14,403
It's my only chance to get into
Rhode Island School of Design.

51
00:03:14,487 --> 00:03:17,114
It's summer.
We're high school graduates now.

52
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:21,952
It's time to reap the rewards of four years
of hard, grueling, mind-expanding work.

53
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:26,039
-What's this word?
-Your last name.

54
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,876
Georgina Williams.

55
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,505
The assignment is supposed to be
an illustrated love story.

56
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,424
What do I know about love?
I've never been in love.

57
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:40,345
l would like to congratulate
the 1986 graduating class...

58
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,680
of Generic New York High School!

59
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:05,202
I think what you really need
is a break from your mom.

60
00:04:05,744 --> 00:04:08,372
You're gonna end up
being a street cleaner...

61
00:04:08,455 --> 00:04:10,957
because you didn't get
your basketball scholarship?

62
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:13,460
-I guess she's taking it hard.
-Of course she is.

63
00:04:13,543 --> 00:04:16,212
It's like my mom saying
I'm an irresponsible louse.

64
00:04:16,296 --> 00:04:19,007
I know that she knows
I'm not irresponsible.

65
00:04:22,051 --> 00:04:24,637
Your mother still has faith in you, Hoops.

66
00:04:24,804 --> 00:04:27,390
Just because you can't
play basketball worth a shit...

67
00:04:27,515 --> 00:04:29,767
doesn't mean
you got no other option in life.

68
00:04:29,809 --> 00:04:32,019
-I guess you're right.
-There you go.

69
00:04:32,061 --> 00:04:34,563
Nothing proves that more
than being surprised...

70
00:04:34,647 --> 00:04:36,732
with your brand-new graduation wheels.

71
00:04:36,815 --> 00:04:40,736
That final, parental confirmation
that you're going somewhere in life.

72
00:04:41,028 --> 00:04:43,739
And this is just the vehicle
to take you there.

73
00:04:47,534 --> 00:04:51,163
Nantucket. When can we leave?

74
00:04:51,663 --> 00:04:54,124
Just got to pick up my sister.

75
00:04:54,207 --> 00:04:55,875
And, Hoops, remember...

76
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:58,670
never say anything about her dog.

77
00:05:22,526 --> 00:05:25,070
Bye-bye. Have a nice summer.

78
00:05:25,153 --> 00:05:28,156
Squid, you and old Boscoe
going to visit Grandma this summer?

79
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,992
Dog from Mars!

80
00:05:32,369 --> 00:05:35,246
It's so ugly. Someone put it to sleep.

81
00:05:40,084 --> 00:05:44,839
Girls, if you make faces like that
and somebody slaps you on the back...

82
00:05:45,048 --> 00:05:47,758
you'll stay that way forever!

83
00:05:50,386 --> 00:05:53,764
Stop that! Go on! Have a nice summer!

84
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:58,143
Dog from space!

85
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,843
There sure are some ugly-looking kids
running around here.

86
00:06:46,815 --> 00:06:48,483
Where's this place, anyway?

87
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:51,194
First stop's a little place called
Woods Hole.

88
00:08:16,568 --> 00:08:18,236
Okay, Cassandra...

89
00:08:18,403 --> 00:08:20,530
all I want is my money.

90
00:08:20,613 --> 00:08:22,365
It's my money, and you know it!

91
00:08:22,448 --> 00:08:25,910
No! It's definitely mine.

92
00:08:27,411 --> 00:08:28,788
Trust me.

93
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:32,249
Excuse me, guys. Looking for this?

94
00:08:32,249 --> 00:08:33,376
Get him!

95
00:08:33,542 --> 00:08:35,377
George, get us out of here!

96
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,546
So long, sucker.

97
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:40,549
It's my money!

98
00:08:49,266 --> 00:08:52,644
-Who are your friends?
-Maniacs! Get us out of here! Go!

99
00:08:55,689 --> 00:08:57,732
Hurry up! They're gaining on us!

100
00:08:58,066 --> 00:08:59,859
-Hi.
-Hi. Who are you?

101
00:08:59,943 --> 00:09:02,904
-I'm Cassandra.
-George. The pleasure's mine.

102
00:09:02,987 --> 00:09:04,864
We're heading for the docks!

103
00:09:04,947 --> 00:09:06,949
-We got to make the boat.
-What boat?

104
00:09:07,033 --> 00:09:10,453
You think we're driving to Nantucket?
Come on, it's an island!

105
00:09:12,455 --> 00:09:15,583
You never mentioned any boat.
I'm not getting on any boat.

106
00:09:15,624 --> 00:09:17,001
I beg to differ.

107
00:09:21,964 --> 00:09:24,216
What are you doing? It's already left!

108
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:26,635
-We'll make it.
-We'll make it?

109
00:09:26,677 --> 00:09:29,179
You might want
to brace yourselves, though.

110
00:09:57,665 --> 00:10:00,167
Get me out of here!

111
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,002
Now!

112
00:10:09,384 --> 00:10:12,179
This is going to be a great summer.

113
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:16,683
I want you to die.

114
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:20,228
Once upon a time,
there was a lonely guy...

115
00:10:20,311 --> 00:10:22,230
on a quest for love.

116
00:10:22,313 --> 00:10:25,608
The cute, fuzzy bunnies
were quick to cooperate this time.

117
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:29,320
The path they sent him on
landed him on an ocean-going vessel.

118
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:32,782
Our hero hated boats,
but he was desperate on his quest...

119
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:36,869
and once again he fell victim
to the heinous cute and fuzzy bunnies.

120
00:10:36,952 --> 00:10:39,163
And he was sucked
into the cold, dark sea...

121
00:10:39,246 --> 00:10:41,248
and he never found love.

122
00:10:56,096 --> 00:10:58,139
-Are you all right?
-Me?

123
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,267
Yeah, great. Really good. Why?

124
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,520
I don't know,
you look pretty uncomfortable.

125
00:11:05,396 --> 00:11:07,190
Are you afraid of water?

126
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:13,154
No, not really. Yeah.

127
00:11:15,156 --> 00:11:17,366
Actually, I am afraid of the water.

128
00:11:17,449 --> 00:11:20,744
But this is a big boat,
a lot of safety equipment...

129
00:11:20,953 --> 00:11:22,413
I can see the land.

130
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,498
Clean, fresh air....

131
00:11:25,415 --> 00:11:27,167
Chilidog.

132
00:11:29,419 --> 00:11:30,921
Go away.

133
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,343
-You live on the island?
-Just for the summer.

134
00:11:36,426 --> 00:11:39,387
-I'm helping out my grandfather.
-What kind of help?

135
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:42,307
He's got a houseful of friends
he's taking care of.

136
00:11:42,974 --> 00:11:45,643
He's having money problems.
I was working in a dive...

137
00:11:45,727 --> 00:11:47,979
trying to help him out, but I got ripped off.

138
00:11:48,062 --> 00:11:50,815
Is that what that was about,
the big scene back there?

139
00:11:50,898 --> 00:11:54,026
-Wish I could've helped more.
-Come on, you were great.

140
00:11:54,652 --> 00:11:56,362
You sure? Last bite.

141
00:11:57,488 --> 00:11:59,698
Will you get out of here with this?

142
00:12:03,827 --> 00:12:05,162
You kids!

143
00:12:28,142 --> 00:12:31,479
Come on! This is gonna be funny.

144
00:12:34,774 --> 00:12:36,442
All the eggs, they're broken!

145
00:12:38,193 --> 00:12:40,946
Clay, if you don't stand on the right side...

146
00:12:40,988 --> 00:12:43,031
you're defeating the entire purpose...

147
00:12:43,115 --> 00:12:44,992
of buying them, you big mess!

148
00:12:46,994 --> 00:12:48,453
Mess!

149
00:12:50,997 --> 00:12:53,166
There they are. The Stork twins.

150
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:54,960
Those guys? They're twins?

151
00:12:55,085 --> 00:12:57,045
Clay's a couple minutes older.

152
00:12:58,129 --> 00:12:59,506
The Stork twins!

153
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:04,093
-This is Hoops.
-Aloha!

154
00:13:04,886 --> 00:13:05,887
Hi, Hoops!

155
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,889
I'm gonna go get the car.

156
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,473
Hey, Squidly!

157
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:16,981
This is going to be a great shot.

158
00:13:18,816 --> 00:13:21,068
-Maybe we'll see each other.
-Hope so.

159
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,487
-Take it easy.
-Yeah, you, too.

160
00:13:23,987 --> 00:13:25,656
Hey, Stork guys!

161
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:27,658
Hi, Hoops. How do you do?

162
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:29,868
Hi. It's very, it's very....

163
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:32,871
Nice to meet you.

164
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:35,915
Yeah. Me, too. What's with the big fish?

165
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:39,377
They're shooting the sequel
to that movie Foam.

166
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:44,257
About the giant dolphin with rabies
that terrorizes a small New England town.

167
00:13:45,174 --> 00:13:48,427
We're gonna work part-time
as security guards on the set.

168
00:13:48,469 --> 00:13:51,389
Stork twins!

169
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:53,849
Clay!

170
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,269
You guys got the day off from the garage?

171
00:13:57,353 --> 00:13:59,396
No, we're doing a job.

172
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:04,067
-We're picking up a boat.
-Whose boat is it?

173
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:06,570
His.

174
00:14:26,631 --> 00:14:29,884
-You touched my car.
-What?

175
00:14:31,469 --> 00:14:33,346
You touched my car!

176
00:14:33,429 --> 00:14:35,306
Right! Let me get it clean, then!

177
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:36,807
You touched it again!

178
00:14:36,891 --> 00:14:39,351
Don't ever touch my car again, ever!

179
00:14:40,185 --> 00:14:43,147
Don't touch my car ever again!

180
00:14:44,231 --> 00:14:47,192
Teddy, honey,
can we go pick up your boat?

181
00:14:47,276 --> 00:14:48,360
Ever!

182
00:14:48,443 --> 00:14:51,822
Remember? Your new boat?

183
00:15:00,163 --> 00:15:02,457
Ty, bring in the Stork twins!

184
00:15:05,418 --> 00:15:06,711
Come here.

185
00:15:12,717 --> 00:15:14,385
I would've come anyways.

186
00:15:14,718 --> 00:15:17,263
-Now move that tow truck!
-Let's go! Hustle!

187
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:32,152
That is some tuna.

188
00:15:44,914 --> 00:15:47,625
Grammy.
The high school graduates are here.

189
00:15:48,417 --> 00:15:51,003
Look who it is.

190
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:55,549
My pride and joy.

191
00:15:55,633 --> 00:15:58,093
There's my little girl.

192
00:16:00,512 --> 00:16:03,015
Look what Grammy bought for you.

193
00:16:06,518 --> 00:16:09,146
Would you like
some nice milk and cookies?

194
00:16:09,271 --> 00:16:12,315
Come on, Grammy will show you
where we go.

195
00:16:12,732 --> 00:16:14,359
Nice meeting you, too.

196
00:16:15,568 --> 00:16:17,821
-She's nuts about me.
-Yeah.

197
00:16:18,196 --> 00:16:20,448
You got to meet my Uncle Frank.

198
00:16:20,782 --> 00:16:23,326
$1 million!

199
00:16:23,534 --> 00:16:26,370
This is it. We guarantee it.

200
00:16:26,454 --> 00:16:28,706
This is your summer to win!

201
00:16:28,831 --> 00:16:32,043
Keep it here and listen for this jingle:

202
00:16:32,126 --> 00:16:35,463
95.5 FM. Music-money time.

203
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:39,925
lf you, yes, you, are our fiftieth caller...

204
00:16:40,217 --> 00:16:43,262
$1 million is all yours!

205
00:16:43,345 --> 00:16:45,097
That's right. $1 million.

206
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:47,099
Uncle Frank.

207
00:16:47,808 --> 00:16:50,602
Georgie, what the hell
are you doing in here?

208
00:16:50,852 --> 00:16:52,103
Still at it.

209
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:55,482
God, would you get out of here?
You think I'm playing games?

210
00:16:55,523 --> 00:16:57,734
Just leave me alone!

211
00:16:58,151 --> 00:17:01,279
Every summer he sits there
trying to win that radio show.

212
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:04,532
Every summer he loses
a bit more of his mind.

213
00:17:05,116 --> 00:17:07,910
Why don't they just leave me alone
with my dream?

214
00:17:17,378 --> 00:17:18,921
Okay. There.

215
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,507
Billy, take this in the back room.

216
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,092
Field strip it.

217
00:17:26,386 --> 00:17:28,555
Careful with that thing!

218
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:30,932
Boys, tourniquet!

219
00:17:35,979 --> 00:17:38,022
-Calamari.
-Mr. Raymond.

220
00:17:38,106 --> 00:17:40,358
Thought you'd be in prison by now.

221
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,818
What can I do for you?

222
00:17:41,901 --> 00:17:43,695
We're looking for Acky.

223
00:17:43,736 --> 00:17:46,197
This is my friend, Hoops McCann.

224
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,199
Quit monkeying with that thing!

225
00:17:48,241 --> 00:17:49,534
Sorry.

226
00:17:50,409 --> 00:17:52,662
Another wasted summer, boys?

227
00:17:52,745 --> 00:17:55,206
Why don't you go in with Acky?
Just think of it.

228
00:17:55,247 --> 00:17:57,708
Death from above! Airborne!

229
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,879
Excuse me if I'm wrong, sir,
but Acky throws up on the ferris wheel...

230
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,547
at the children's park.

231
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,924
You've got no college acceptance.

232
00:18:06,008 --> 00:18:09,219
You've got no direction with your lives.
No plan.

233
00:18:09,261 --> 00:18:12,806
When there's no plan, there's no attack.
No attack, no victory.

234
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:17,560
This! This is what makes men, men.

235
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:19,729
I'll have to pick one up.

236
00:18:21,481 --> 00:18:22,899
Anyway, where's Acky?

237
00:18:22,941 --> 00:18:25,234
He's out on a mission for his old man.

238
00:18:25,777 --> 00:18:27,069
A mission, sir?

239
00:18:27,278 --> 00:18:29,530
He's on the beach collecting shells.

240
00:18:30,448 --> 00:18:33,159
That's a little more like Acky's speed.

241
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,085
Acky, what are you doing?

242
00:18:43,168 --> 00:18:45,420
George, take cover.

243
00:18:49,758 --> 00:18:52,385
Your dad said you were collecting shells.

244
00:18:52,427 --> 00:18:54,763
Shells. 57 millimeter.

245
00:18:55,513 --> 00:18:58,933
My dad gets $12 apiece for them.
They make great paperweights.

246
00:18:59,476 --> 00:19:00,935
Hi, I'm Ack Ack.

247
00:19:02,645 --> 00:19:05,356
-Let's get out of here.
-Over the top, boys!

248
00:19:06,274 --> 00:19:08,776
Nobody lives forever!

249
00:19:10,486 --> 00:19:12,279
My God!

250
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,875
You could have waited
till they were done bombing the beach.

251
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:28,128
When the man says go, you go.

252
00:19:28,211 --> 00:19:30,130
You could have been killed.

253
00:19:31,131 --> 00:19:32,591
My god!

254
00:19:44,811 --> 00:19:47,814
Do you realize
for every lost, mangled doll...

255
00:19:47,897 --> 00:19:50,524
there's a little girl with a broken heart?

256
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:53,569
Sure you want to be a Marine, Acky?

257
00:19:53,944 --> 00:19:56,655
I just don't see you
having the killer instinct.

258
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:09,584
"He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness for his name's sake.

259
00:20:09,835 --> 00:20:13,171
"Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...."

260
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:14,923
What's going on?

261
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:18,593
"Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies:

262
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:20,637
"thou anointest my head with oil.

263
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,682
"Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me all the days of my life."

264
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,814
For God's sake.

265
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:34,233
Excuse me for just one....

266
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:52,375
Leave me.

267
00:21:06,389 --> 00:21:09,851
Old man Eldridge finally kicked, Ted?

268
00:21:11,352 --> 00:21:12,895
Doing my laps, Dad.

269
00:21:16,607 --> 00:21:18,984
I would like to have a word with you.

270
00:21:19,068 --> 00:21:20,486
In a minute, Dad.

271
00:21:25,657 --> 00:21:28,076
I'll try not to take up
too much of your time.

272
00:21:28,201 --> 00:21:29,619
Okay.

273
00:21:31,663 --> 00:21:33,790
Are you ready for the regatta, Ted?

274
00:21:33,874 --> 00:21:36,793
Sure, I'm ready.
The new sloop's a beauty. I can't lose.

275
00:21:36,835 --> 00:21:39,712
If you screw it up this year,
you and I are out....

276
00:21:40,672 --> 00:21:42,131
Hi, Daddy.

277
00:21:43,174 --> 00:21:45,176
-Hi, Grandpa.
-How are you?

278
00:21:45,885 --> 00:21:46,886
Good.

279
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:52,850
If you screw it up this year,
that decaying old man, your grandfather...

280
00:21:52,933 --> 00:21:54,351
takes everything away.

281
00:21:54,435 --> 00:21:56,061
Do you understand, Ted?

282
00:21:56,145 --> 00:21:59,356
If you don't come home with that trophy,
we lose it all.

283
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:03,485
No more pools, no more Ferrari.

284
00:22:03,652 --> 00:22:06,154
Do you know what happens then?

285
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:09,116
-Don't say it, Dad.
-That's right, Ted.

286
00:22:09,199 --> 00:22:10,992
You'll have to go to....

287
00:22:11,201 --> 00:22:13,078
-No!
-Work, Teddy, work!

288
00:22:13,161 --> 00:22:14,621
Don't say that word!

289
00:22:14,704 --> 00:22:17,332
I'll win! Just don't say that word!

290
00:22:17,415 --> 00:22:19,667
That's why I need this Eldridge land.

291
00:22:20,043 --> 00:22:22,879
With this land, I can finally start building...

292
00:22:22,921 --> 00:22:25,006
Beckerstead Estates.

293
00:22:25,048 --> 00:22:26,340
And that crazy old man....

294
00:22:28,593 --> 00:22:30,553
-Hi, Daddy!
-Hi, Grandpa!

295
00:22:30,636 --> 00:22:32,179
Have a wonderful day.

296
00:22:32,513 --> 00:22:36,684
That crazy old man can't hold
that race over my head every year.

297
00:22:39,728 --> 00:22:42,106
What did you find out about this place?

298
00:22:43,273 --> 00:22:45,734
Chong says he left it to his granddaughter.

299
00:22:45,776 --> 00:22:48,070
She's got one week
to pay the back mortgage.

300
00:22:48,153 --> 00:22:50,655
I've seen this girl. She's a real hippie type.

301
00:22:50,739 --> 00:22:52,657
She wears these braids.

302
00:22:53,074 --> 00:22:55,243
What do they call them, cornhusks?

303
00:22:55,994 --> 00:22:58,621
If she don't get the money,
you get the house.

304
00:22:58,955 --> 00:23:01,457
They're already doing the paperwork.

305
00:23:05,753 --> 00:23:07,213
Wonderful.

306
00:23:11,342 --> 00:23:12,802
This will be...

307
00:23:12,885 --> 00:23:16,222
my most beautiful restaurant yet.

308
00:23:18,515 --> 00:23:21,143
I used to come down here
with him all the time.

309
00:23:24,271 --> 00:23:27,274
Your grandfather sounds
like he was a really nice man.

310
00:23:27,566 --> 00:23:29,067
I'm really sorry.

311
00:23:29,151 --> 00:23:30,986
Old Mr. Peckerhead's been trying--

312
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:32,737
-Who?
-Beckerstead.

313
00:23:32,821 --> 00:23:36,324
He's been trying to drive Grandpa
out of that house since I was a baby.

314
00:23:36,408 --> 00:23:38,201
I guess he finally got him.

315
00:23:39,369 --> 00:23:42,497
So what's gonna happen to the house
and all his friends?

316
00:23:42,705 --> 00:23:44,582
The bank's given me one week...

317
00:23:44,624 --> 00:23:47,126
to come up with
the back mortgage of $3,000.

318
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:49,128
It might as well be $1 million.

319
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:52,131
I can't let those people
be thrown out on the streets.

320
00:23:52,214 --> 00:23:54,467
I just wish I had more time.

321
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,302
I wish I could help.

322
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:58,721
I'm not going to give up.

323
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:01,432
I figure I can sell some of the furniture...

324
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:03,517
and I'm going to do some clubs.

325
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:06,603
-You sing?
-Yeah, I try.

326
00:24:06,853 --> 00:24:09,314
Cool. I bet you're really great.

327
00:24:10,065 --> 00:24:11,233
Thanks.

328
00:24:11,608 --> 00:24:15,737
I guess basketball is your thing,
with a name like Hoops.

329
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:20,116
It's kind of in the family blood.
My dad was really great.

330
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:24,912
But I want to do something
a little more challenging, a little different.

331
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:27,331
I'm trying to get a scholarship
to art school.

332
00:24:27,415 --> 00:24:28,916
What do you draw?

333
00:24:30,418 --> 00:24:33,295
Nothing, lately. I'm in kind of a rut.

334
00:24:34,255 --> 00:24:35,798
Draw me something?

335
00:24:36,882 --> 00:24:37,883
Okay.

336
00:24:39,093 --> 00:24:40,928
What can I get for you?

337
00:24:41,011 --> 00:24:43,222
I don't know.

338
00:24:43,472 --> 00:24:46,767
How about a gorilla? Or me, or....

339
00:24:48,226 --> 00:24:51,188
-How about a gorilla and me?
-You and a gorilla.

340
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,481
Okay.

341
00:24:55,483 --> 00:24:56,985
Okay.

342
00:25:05,993 --> 00:25:09,372
Lose the nose. Fix that, and...

343
00:25:10,665 --> 00:25:12,333
change the feet.

344
00:25:23,051 --> 00:25:24,845
Best I could do with short notice.

345
00:25:26,054 --> 00:25:26,889
It's great.

346
00:25:27,931 --> 00:25:31,435
If this is what you do second best,
I'd love to see you play basketball.

347
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:34,229
It's quite a sight, let me tell you.

348
00:25:35,397 --> 00:25:36,856
Thanks for cheering me up.

349
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,818
My pleasure.

350
00:25:41,694 --> 00:25:42,904
I better go.

351
00:25:43,529 --> 00:25:44,572
Yeah, me, too.

352
00:25:47,325 --> 00:25:48,075
Thanks.

353
00:25:49,785 --> 00:25:50,786
Thanks a lot.

354
00:25:56,459 --> 00:25:58,586
Maybe you can come by later.

355
00:25:58,794 --> 00:25:59,461
Okay.

356
00:26:00,379 --> 00:26:01,255
'Bye.

357
00:26:09,137 --> 00:26:10,055
Cassandra!

358
00:26:10,472 --> 00:26:12,349
Cassandra, can you help me a minute?

359
00:26:12,891 --> 00:26:14,643
Could you help me out? I'm stuck.

360
00:26:20,815 --> 00:26:23,443
$1 million.

361
00:26:23,484 --> 00:26:26,320
lt could happen at any time, any day...

362
00:26:26,404 --> 00:26:29,115
any hour, any minute, any second!

363
00:26:29,323 --> 00:26:32,785
We're giving away $1 million...

364
00:26:32,868 --> 00:26:35,704
and it could happen now, right now!

365
00:26:35,788 --> 00:26:38,916
But it's not going to happen yet...

366
00:26:38,999 --> 00:26:41,335
so keep listening for this jingle:

367
00:26:41,418 --> 00:26:42,920
95.5--

368
00:26:46,757 --> 00:26:50,302
To win $1 million!

369
00:27:09,195 --> 00:27:10,488
Hey, Egg!

370
00:27:11,989 --> 00:27:13,949
Really smart.

371
00:27:14,158 --> 00:27:15,701
What if that went in my eye?

372
00:27:17,495 --> 00:27:18,621
Where's Hoops?

373
00:27:19,913 --> 00:27:22,082
He went over there.

374
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,084
You guys better look after him.

375
00:27:24,168 --> 00:27:27,629
He's got a tendency
to wallow in his artistic miseries.

376
00:27:28,255 --> 00:27:29,673
Yeah.

377
00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:31,800
Egg, cut me some shade, will you?

378
00:27:35,929 --> 00:27:37,097
Okay, thank you.

379
00:27:39,933 --> 00:27:41,351
Excuse me.

380
00:27:41,434 --> 00:27:43,394
Little boy, will you hold this for me?

381
00:27:43,478 --> 00:27:44,729
Thank you very much.

382
00:27:46,105 --> 00:27:48,065
-Mommy!
-Sorry.

383
00:27:48,357 --> 00:27:49,525
Jimmy?

384
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:54,030
-Hi, Hoops.
-Hi.

385
00:27:55,739 --> 00:27:57,199
Hoops, how about a brew?

386
00:27:57,283 --> 00:27:59,326
Thanks, guys. That's good.

387
00:28:00,536 --> 00:28:02,871
Please, Mr. Dog, don't.

388
00:28:04,706 --> 00:28:06,458
What are you doing?

389
00:28:07,834 --> 00:28:09,211
Nothing much, guys.

390
00:28:09,378 --> 00:28:11,546
Hoops, if you run out of things to draw...

391
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,048
you can draw us, you know.

392
00:28:13,256 --> 00:28:15,050
Yeah, you could draw us nude.

393
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,886
Yeah, bare naked with no clothes on!

394
00:28:17,969 --> 00:28:19,220
No, button up!

395
00:28:19,304 --> 00:28:20,930
Thank you. I appreciate that.

396
00:28:21,014 --> 00:28:22,515
I'll come up with something.

397
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:25,059
I offer you my body and...

398
00:28:25,101 --> 00:28:27,437
and now I'm the jerk of the world
or something.

399
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,855
It was a nice gesture.

400
00:28:29,105 --> 00:28:31,315
Hi. I met you at the docks yesterday.

401
00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:33,859
Hello. I'm Hoops.

402
00:28:33,943 --> 00:28:34,693
Cookie.

403
00:28:34,985 --> 00:28:36,445
-How's it going?
-Great.

404
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,739
These are the Stork twins.

405
00:28:38,781 --> 00:28:39,698
Hi, Cookie.

406
00:28:40,115 --> 00:28:41,909
Hi, Cookie. I'm Egg.

407
00:28:42,326 --> 00:28:43,243
Gemini!

408
00:28:44,953 --> 00:28:47,039
I know them. They work for my boyfriend.

409
00:28:47,289 --> 00:28:48,582
What can I do for you?

410
00:28:48,665 --> 00:28:50,125
We're gonna go sailing...

411
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:52,169
and we were wondering if you guys...

412
00:28:52,252 --> 00:28:54,296
could help us get our boat in the water?

413
00:28:54,754 --> 00:28:56,214
What do you say, fellas?

414
00:28:56,298 --> 00:28:59,134
Can we help these lovely ladies
get their boats in the water?

415
00:28:59,426 --> 00:29:02,095
No. It sounds like work.

416
00:29:02,887 --> 00:29:04,806
Boats are heavy. I'll get a hernia.

417
00:29:05,056 --> 00:29:06,891
Come on, let's do it. Just get up!

418
00:29:08,601 --> 00:29:10,436
-Sure. Love to.
-Great.

419
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:14,523
Anything else we can do for you...

420
00:29:14,607 --> 00:29:16,025
like shovel your driveway?

421
00:29:16,901 --> 00:29:18,152
You guys!

422
00:29:28,161 --> 00:29:28,954
You guys!

423
00:29:29,037 --> 00:29:31,123
You have anything heavier we could carry?

424
00:29:31,206 --> 00:29:32,124
Like a car?

425
00:29:35,418 --> 00:29:38,338
Yeah, sure. Forsake me for eight chicks.

426
00:29:38,922 --> 00:29:40,840
Come on, hey!

427
00:29:43,927 --> 00:29:45,887
No! Mister, please!

428
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,013
Please, sir!

429
00:29:48,389 --> 00:29:50,600
You don't understand. I've had a bad day.

430
00:30:02,736 --> 00:30:05,364
Do you want to come sailing?
There's room for one more.

431
00:30:05,447 --> 00:30:08,033
No. Really, I can't.

432
00:30:08,075 --> 00:30:09,284
I don't like boats.

433
00:30:09,868 --> 00:30:11,328
You're not afraid, are you?

434
00:30:11,787 --> 00:30:12,913
No, of course not.

435
00:30:13,914 --> 00:30:15,665
I got a lot to do on the beach.

436
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:17,876
How about a movie, then?

437
00:30:20,545 --> 00:30:21,921
What about your boyfriend?

438
00:30:22,046 --> 00:30:23,464
He's going to a reception.

439
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,008
I'll pick you up at 8:00.

440
00:30:42,649 --> 00:30:44,526
Come on, have a heart, dude.

441
00:30:48,739 --> 00:30:51,116
No, not those. No!

442
00:30:51,158 --> 00:30:53,869
Please, Your Enormousness,
anything but chili!

443
00:30:54,869 --> 00:30:56,204
She really likes you!

444
00:30:56,288 --> 00:30:58,665
Too bad George wasn't here to see that.

445
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,294
George!

446
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:05,838
Far out! Dead man on the beach!

447
00:31:16,265 --> 00:31:17,683
Chili?

448
00:31:20,728 --> 00:31:22,563
Phil, do the CPR.

449
00:31:22,646 --> 00:31:24,565
-You do it.
-No. I have seniority.

450
00:31:24,648 --> 00:31:26,567
I want you to give him CPR.

451
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:28,277
Phil, give him CPR!

452
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,570
George was alive, just barely.

453
00:31:30,862 --> 00:31:32,864
Nobody wanted to perform CPR on him...

454
00:31:32,948 --> 00:31:34,658
so it was a complete nightmare.

455
00:31:36,534 --> 00:31:38,036
But enough about old George.

456
00:31:38,161 --> 00:31:40,288
How's the dollar count?
Get any more money?

457
00:31:40,371 --> 00:31:42,624
So far so good. I sold some furniture...

458
00:31:42,707 --> 00:31:45,585
and I have a gig tonight
at a club called the Dew Drop Inn.

459
00:31:45,668 --> 00:31:46,961
Maybe you can come by.

460
00:31:47,962 --> 00:31:49,046
Yeah, sure.

461
00:31:49,964 --> 00:31:50,965
I'll try.

462
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:53,050
I might have something to do tonight.

463
00:31:53,718 --> 00:31:55,344
If you can.

464
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,097
It'd be nice to have a friend there.

465
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,266
I'll be there, at the first table.

466
00:32:00,349 --> 00:32:01,558
You can count on it.

467
00:32:03,894 --> 00:32:04,853
I got to go.

468
00:32:04,937 --> 00:32:06,897
George's grandma is making us supper.

469
00:32:06,939 --> 00:32:09,524
You know how grandmas are
about that kind of thing.

470
00:32:09,566 --> 00:32:11,068
It means the world to them.

471
00:32:13,945 --> 00:32:16,698
Are you sure you don't want
a little bit more?

472
00:32:16,781 --> 00:32:19,325
No, thank you. I'm stuffed.
It was delicious, though.

473
00:32:19,826 --> 00:32:20,952
All right, then.

474
00:32:30,253 --> 00:32:31,045
I got it.

475
00:32:33,923 --> 00:32:34,673
Keep it.

476
00:32:34,757 --> 00:32:36,050
Thank you very much.

477
00:32:36,425 --> 00:32:38,385
Yeah, it was really good.

478
00:32:38,969 --> 00:32:41,096
So, why aren't you going out with Cookie?

479
00:32:41,764 --> 00:32:44,099
You're here to write a love story, Hoops.

480
00:32:44,141 --> 00:32:45,559
Cookie is a love story.

481
00:32:45,601 --> 00:32:48,520
George, her boyfriend is like
Cro-Magnon teen.

482
00:32:48,603 --> 00:32:50,939
No way. Besides, I said
I was helping Cassandra.

483
00:32:51,022 --> 00:32:52,566
I promised to go to her show.

484
00:32:52,649 --> 00:32:54,859
Yeah, but like, Cookie asked you out first.

485
00:32:56,069 --> 00:32:57,153
We were there.

486
00:32:58,363 --> 00:33:00,615
Teddy's not even gonna be around tonight.

487
00:33:01,199 --> 00:33:03,076
You know where Teddy's going to be?

488
00:33:03,409 --> 00:33:06,245
At a little reception
celebrating the rape of the land...

489
00:33:06,287 --> 00:33:08,289
that Cassandra's house now stands on.

490
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,958
-The Stork brothers told me.
-That's true!

491
00:33:11,292 --> 00:33:13,627
Cookie seems like a real nice person.

492
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:15,671
Maybe she'd like to help Cassandra out.

493
00:33:15,755 --> 00:33:18,299
I don't think she's interested.
You know what I mean?

494
00:33:21,635 --> 00:33:24,972
Come on, Hoops.
Quit thinking about yourself all the time.

495
00:33:26,306 --> 00:33:29,309
Go out with Cookie,
and get her on your side.

496
00:33:29,976 --> 00:33:31,395
Then go see Cassandra.

497
00:33:32,145 --> 00:33:35,065
I'd rather keep the original bone structure
of my face.

498
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:37,901
-Do you want to help Cassandra?
-Of course.

499
00:33:38,443 --> 00:33:41,112
The Stork twins are going
to the reception after work.

500
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,281
If Teddy does anything...

501
00:33:43,656 --> 00:33:45,783
they'll call me at the drive-in and...

502
00:33:45,908 --> 00:33:47,827
the big guy'll be watching your back.

503
00:33:48,327 --> 00:33:49,120
Trust me.

504
00:33:52,999 --> 00:33:54,166
Once upon a time...

505
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:57,086
there was a happening guy,
who'd stumbled onto a girl...

506
00:33:57,169 --> 00:33:59,129
who embodied all that love should be.

507
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,048
All seemed well.

508
00:34:02,591 --> 00:34:04,301
Those cute and fuzzy bunnies...

509
00:34:04,343 --> 00:34:05,844
weren't so bad after all.

510
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,971
Until....

511
00:34:10,223 --> 00:34:11,641
Her boyfriend showed up...

512
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:14,561
and pounded him into something
that resembled a wet prune.

513
00:34:17,897 --> 00:34:18,732
Ouch.

514
00:34:22,652 --> 00:34:24,904
"Never! "

515
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,952
I am going to die.

516
00:34:31,452 --> 00:34:32,703
Forget about it.

517
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:35,081
Where're you going?

518
00:34:35,164 --> 00:34:36,665
I'm going to see Cassandra.

519
00:34:36,916 --> 00:34:37,791
Baby.

520
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:44,298
Are you ready for me, Hoops?

521
00:34:54,849 --> 00:34:56,351
Wait. Pull over. I know her.

522
00:34:56,434 --> 00:34:57,560
You need a ride?

523
00:35:03,399 --> 00:35:04,776
That was a friend of mine.

524
00:35:04,942 --> 00:35:06,402
I don't pick up hitchhikers.

525
00:35:15,327 --> 00:35:16,495
The humanity!

526
00:35:17,621 --> 00:35:19,373
Thank you very much for the ride.

527
00:35:19,456 --> 00:35:22,042
I enjoyed it thoroughly. Clay!

528
00:35:23,752 --> 00:35:25,838
Clay! Hi.

529
00:35:25,921 --> 00:35:27,881
Hi. I didn't hear you come in.

530
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:33,136
I'm relieving you because
Dad needs you pronto at the gas station.

531
00:35:33,678 --> 00:35:36,514
Okay. But don't forget at 9:00...

532
00:35:36,598 --> 00:35:38,433
you have to be at the Beckersteads'.

533
00:35:38,641 --> 00:35:41,186
Watch Teddy.
If anything weird is going on...

534
00:35:41,269 --> 00:35:43,396
call George at the drive-in right away.

535
00:35:43,479 --> 00:35:45,023
We can't let Hoops down.

536
00:35:45,106 --> 00:35:46,733
Okay. No problem.

537
00:35:49,485 --> 00:35:51,988
Egg, don't forget. No matter what...

538
00:35:52,113 --> 00:35:54,782
don't touch anything on this prop truck.

539
00:35:55,741 --> 00:35:57,618
Like I'm really gonna!

540
00:36:19,848 --> 00:36:21,558
Are you nervous about something?

541
00:36:21,641 --> 00:36:22,267
Me?

542
00:36:22,642 --> 00:36:23,726
Yeah.

543
00:36:25,144 --> 00:36:27,230
No, I'm having a great time. Enjoy.

544
00:36:30,816 --> 00:36:31,817
Are you sure?

545
00:36:34,236 --> 00:36:35,654
Can I ask you something?

546
00:36:35,821 --> 00:36:36,530
Yeah.

547
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:39,199
Aren't you going out with Teddy?

548
00:36:39,408 --> 00:36:40,200
Yeah.

549
00:36:40,409 --> 00:36:42,119
Why aren't you with him tonight?

550
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,831
Because he's got
some silly reception to go to...

551
00:36:45,914 --> 00:36:47,749
and he's got his vang shoo classes.

552
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:50,127
What's vang shoo?

553
00:36:50,585 --> 00:36:51,795
The martial art...

554
00:36:52,963 --> 00:36:54,172
of disemboweling...

555
00:36:54,714 --> 00:36:55,966
another human being...

556
00:36:56,091 --> 00:36:57,425
with a popsicle stick.

557
00:36:57,967 --> 00:36:59,594
Are you hungry? I'm hungry.

558
00:36:59,677 --> 00:37:01,095
I'll go get some treats.

559
00:37:01,179 --> 00:37:02,388
Stay right here.

560
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,687
I'll get us some treats.

561
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,522
Could you bring me some popcorn?

562
00:37:11,564 --> 00:37:12,356
Popcorn.

563
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,320
Check it out. It's that McCann guy.

564
00:37:19,029 --> 00:37:20,364
And he's with Cookie.

565
00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:24,493
I like that one. I like that. I want a....

566
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:31,416
Now, that is a....
I could wear that anywhere.

567
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:45,513
I'm going to look nice.

568
00:37:59,401 --> 00:38:00,486
Michael?

569
00:38:04,406 --> 00:38:05,199
Michael?

570
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,410
Michael!

571
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:11,788
Michael!

572
00:38:13,623 --> 00:38:14,833
Michael?

573
00:38:16,584 --> 00:38:17,794
Michael?

574
00:38:21,464 --> 00:38:24,384
Hoops. Good party, eh?

575
00:38:24,801 --> 00:38:26,969
George, where're your friends, the twins?

576
00:38:26,969 --> 00:38:28,721
Are they watching that monster?

577
00:38:28,805 --> 00:38:30,932
Don't worry about it. They're very reliable.

578
00:38:31,224 --> 00:38:31,974
Trust me.

579
00:38:40,774 --> 00:38:41,984
Thank you very much.

580
00:38:42,026 --> 00:38:45,112
It feels good to be back here
at the Club Tokyo.

581
00:38:45,195 --> 00:38:46,446
Hi! How're you doing?

582
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:48,865
Where're you from?
What do you do for a living?

583
00:38:49,741 --> 00:38:51,952
9:00? Shit!

584
00:38:52,035 --> 00:38:52,953
9:00!

585
00:38:54,704 --> 00:38:55,830
Goddamn it!

586
00:39:04,088 --> 00:39:05,381
Shit!

587
00:39:12,722 --> 00:39:13,931
Relax.

588
00:39:14,682 --> 00:39:17,726
Would you get over here,
you two stupid clowns?

589
00:39:19,353 --> 00:39:21,230
I can't wait all night.

590
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,570
Look at this.

591
00:39:36,161 --> 00:39:39,039
Damn. That looks like
one of those medical experiments...

592
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,165
that went astray.

593
00:39:40,248 --> 00:39:42,542
Little girl, I'm gonna have nightmares...

594
00:39:42,584 --> 00:39:44,419
just knowing that dog exists.

595
00:39:45,086 --> 00:39:47,672
Looks like it's been microwaved
or something.

596
00:39:47,755 --> 00:39:49,882
Why, Wilbur, I believe that's a case...

597
00:39:49,966 --> 00:39:51,509
for a mercy killing.

598
00:39:52,718 --> 00:39:54,303
What do you say, little girl?

599
00:39:54,387 --> 00:39:56,263
Want us to put it out of its misery?

600
00:39:56,347 --> 00:39:58,098
I can't wait any longer.

601
00:40:07,107 --> 00:40:09,026
Hi. How you doing?

602
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:14,197
l want to thank everybody for coming.

603
00:40:54,236 --> 00:40:55,487
Mary Ann?

604
00:41:08,541 --> 00:41:09,417
Thank you.

605
00:41:12,586 --> 00:41:15,172
In honor of our very special guest...

606
00:41:15,256 --> 00:41:16,715
Mr. Chong Freen...

607
00:41:16,882 --> 00:41:19,009
of the Charter Bank of Nantucket...

608
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,970
who assures me...

609
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:23,972
that the Beckerstead Estates
are only weeks away...

610
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:25,974
from the start of construction...

611
00:41:26,642 --> 00:41:28,602
I will allow Mr. Freen...

612
00:41:29,686 --> 00:41:30,645
the honors.

613
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:32,063
Thank you.

614
00:41:53,084 --> 00:41:54,668
Did you bring me my popcorn?

615
00:42:07,472 --> 00:42:08,682
Thank you very much.

616
00:42:08,765 --> 00:42:10,434
I think I will have a cookie.

617
00:42:19,943 --> 00:42:20,735
Hello.

618
00:42:26,783 --> 00:42:27,784
Michael?

619
00:42:30,578 --> 00:42:31,537
Hi. Cookie?

620
00:42:31,621 --> 00:42:33,331
Teddy? Yeah, this is Ty.

621
00:42:33,914 --> 00:42:34,915
Ty. What's up?

622
00:42:35,958 --> 00:42:37,418
She's doing what?

623
00:42:38,335 --> 00:42:39,503
Stay right there.

624
00:42:39,587 --> 00:42:42,214
No, Ty, stay right there, you idiot!

625
00:43:42,772 --> 00:43:43,898
Really nice party.

626
00:43:50,446 --> 00:43:51,948
That's a hearty appetite.

627
00:43:54,825 --> 00:43:56,160
Let's get out of here.

628
00:43:57,036 --> 00:43:59,413
Let's go to the point
and watch the moon rise.

629
00:44:00,122 --> 00:44:01,749
I don't know, Cookie, I was...

630
00:44:01,832 --> 00:44:03,500
kind of enjoying this fine film.

631
00:44:03,584 --> 00:44:04,793
l never touched her!

632
00:44:06,712 --> 00:44:08,922
-You touched my girlfriend, didn't you?
-No!

633
00:44:09,006 --> 00:44:10,298
No!

634
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:12,843
l knew l'd find you at the drive-in.

635
00:44:12,884 --> 00:44:15,262
No! No! Please!

636
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:19,391
I guess you don't get
to see the moon rise very often.

637
00:44:22,894 --> 00:44:23,686
Egg.

638
00:44:24,854 --> 00:44:25,938
Egg?

639
00:44:31,027 --> 00:44:32,612
Egg, I'm about to teach you...

640
00:44:32,695 --> 00:44:34,030
a very valuable lesson.

641
00:44:42,204 --> 00:44:43,956
In an emergency situation...

642
00:44:44,039 --> 00:44:46,792
the victims cannot
and must not be allowed...

643
00:44:46,875 --> 00:44:48,293
to think for themselves.

644
00:44:49,044 --> 00:44:52,756
The shock and the horror
of what just happened...

645
00:44:52,839 --> 00:44:54,925
will surely impair their judgment.

646
00:44:55,425 --> 00:44:58,136
You must do the thinking
in order to save them.

647
00:44:58,470 --> 00:44:59,846
In this case...

648
00:44:59,929 --> 00:45:03,349
a plane has just crash-landed on this point.

649
00:45:04,142 --> 00:45:07,103
Now, there are going to be
bodies everywhere...

650
00:45:07,603 --> 00:45:09,730
just gushing blood and...

651
00:45:09,772 --> 00:45:13,901
their faces will be
pulled off of their heads and...

652
00:45:14,235 --> 00:45:17,071
armpits will be hanging from trees.

653
00:45:17,154 --> 00:45:19,907
Their eyeballs will be
sticking out of their heads.

654
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:23,744
You'll have to push them back in
with a stick or something.

655
00:45:24,328 --> 00:45:25,496
Now, remember...

656
00:45:25,913 --> 00:45:27,998
you are the only thing...

657
00:45:28,081 --> 00:45:30,083
that will stand between life and death.

658
00:45:32,043 --> 00:45:33,211
Let's do it!

659
00:45:33,295 --> 00:45:35,088
Come on, let's go! Hurry up!

660
00:45:37,382 --> 00:45:39,467
Dad, I really wish we could discuss this.

661
00:45:40,635 --> 00:45:42,595
There's nothing to discuss, Ack Ack.

662
00:45:42,637 --> 00:45:45,723
I want you out of the house by 0800 hours.

663
00:45:46,307 --> 00:45:48,392
My home is not a den for cowards...

664
00:45:48,476 --> 00:45:50,520
who will not serve in the armed forces.

665
00:45:52,313 --> 00:45:53,105
Yes, sir.

666
00:46:06,243 --> 00:46:08,453
There's a beautiful clearing just up ahead.

667
00:46:08,537 --> 00:46:11,039
Listen, Cookie,
I want to know if you can help me--

668
00:46:15,794 --> 00:46:17,128
Save him!

669
00:46:19,005 --> 00:46:20,548
Hoops, what are you doing?

670
00:46:20,632 --> 00:46:22,926
Cookie, for God's sake, help me.

671
00:46:23,009 --> 00:46:24,052
Save her!

672
00:46:29,515 --> 00:46:30,808
I don't know, Teddy.

673
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:33,269
We followed them up this far.

674
00:46:33,936 --> 00:46:36,355
Goodness knows
what they came up here to do.

675
00:46:45,697 --> 00:46:48,325
-Cookie, what are you doing here?
-They're chasing me!

676
00:46:48,367 --> 00:46:48,992
Who?

677
00:46:49,076 --> 00:46:50,660
McCann and his weird friends.

678
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:01,629
George! Stop!

679
00:47:01,671 --> 00:47:02,672
Jesus!

680
00:47:02,755 --> 00:47:05,216
Go, George, get out of here!

681
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,427
Save him!

682
00:47:13,891 --> 00:47:16,894
It's just a costume! You little jerks!

683
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:19,104
Get out of the way!

684
00:47:27,571 --> 00:47:28,864
Great, we missed her.

685
00:47:28,947 --> 00:47:30,574
-Hi, guys.
-Hi, Ack.

686
00:47:36,121 --> 00:47:37,872
Get me out of this!

687
00:47:39,791 --> 00:47:41,126
Get me out!

688
00:47:41,793 --> 00:47:45,421
We got to call Hoops. Teddy left the party.

689
00:47:46,422 --> 00:47:47,799
Good work, buddy.

690
00:47:50,051 --> 00:47:53,387
I'm going to kill you, after I kill this guy.

691
00:47:54,013 --> 00:47:55,473
$100 says you don't.

692
00:48:00,269 --> 00:48:01,270
What?

693
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,480
"$100 says you don't."

694
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:06,233
What are you talking about?

695
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:09,695
I'm sure that you can beat him up.
He's smaller than you.

696
00:48:10,028 --> 00:48:11,822
That never stood in my way before.

697
00:48:11,905 --> 00:48:15,242
I'll bet you $100 that even though
he's smaller, he's a better athlete.

698
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:18,661
-Say at a sport like basketball?
-What are you doing?

699
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:21,247
This wimp? Give me a break.

700
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:24,626
-Are you in or out?
-Please don't do this. I'm begging you.

701
00:48:24,751 --> 00:48:26,878
-You must be high. Is she high?
-High.

702
00:48:27,253 --> 00:48:28,629
In or out?

703
00:48:31,048 --> 00:48:32,508
All right, let's go.

704
00:48:35,136 --> 00:48:37,513
Darn, no net. Can't play.

705
00:48:38,097 --> 00:48:41,642
Maybe we can play water polo.
I could get some horses.

706
00:48:51,735 --> 00:48:53,153
Make a hoop.

707
00:49:05,957 --> 00:49:08,543
-All right.
-Lucky shot!

708
00:49:25,517 --> 00:49:27,185
Okay. Here you go.

709
00:49:29,438 --> 00:49:30,897
Okay, Hoops, come on.

710
00:49:38,363 --> 00:49:39,572
Come on.

711
00:49:59,967 --> 00:50:04,263
If you don't mind, I'd like to get back
to beating the shit out of these guys.

712
00:50:04,304 --> 00:50:07,307
-I wouldn't do that if I were you.
-Why? You know Karate?

713
00:50:07,391 --> 00:50:08,725
No. I know Dow.

714
00:50:09,851 --> 00:50:11,353
What is Dow?

715
00:50:11,812 --> 00:50:14,397
Dow is the chemical company
that makes Mace.

716
00:50:24,115 --> 00:50:27,076
Cassandra, wait up a minute. Come on!

717
00:50:28,661 --> 00:50:30,746
I'm really sorry about that.

718
00:50:31,706 --> 00:50:33,416
Thanks for saving us.

719
00:50:33,749 --> 00:50:36,460
It's no big deal, McCann.
I guess we're even.

720
00:50:46,428 --> 00:50:48,347
-Now?
-No, not yet. Be patient.

721
00:50:49,056 --> 00:50:50,057
Now?

722
00:50:51,391 --> 00:50:52,392
Okay.

723
00:50:53,643 --> 00:50:56,855
Hello, ladies. l am here for your daughters.

724
00:51:02,318 --> 00:51:04,821
So, you finally told the Fhrer no?

725
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:07,156
How'd it go?

726
00:51:07,532 --> 00:51:09,158
He threw me out.

727
00:51:10,493 --> 00:51:13,746
Don't worry about it, man.
You can stay at my grandmother's house.

728
00:51:13,829 --> 00:51:16,248
She's got room and reasonable rates...

729
00:51:16,874 --> 00:51:20,044
-if you're not in the family.
-Thanks, George.

730
00:51:20,711 --> 00:51:24,256
You can throw your stuff
in Uncle Frank's room. He'll never know.

731
00:51:27,676 --> 00:51:30,679
Did you ever notice
people die in alphabetical order?

732
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:34,766
Cheer up, McCann.

733
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:37,435
She's not the only girl on the island.

734
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:39,896
There's plenty of them to be found.

735
00:51:42,857 --> 00:51:45,485
-Like that one.
-Go for it, dude.

736
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:54,201
Excuse me, fellas.

737
00:52:00,249 --> 00:52:02,251
How you doing? Here you go.

738
00:52:02,584 --> 00:52:04,211
-Hi.
-Hi, Hoops.

739
00:52:04,253 --> 00:52:05,963
-How're you doing?
-Fine.

740
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:09,049
-Look, Cassandra...
-Hi. Here you go.

741
00:52:09,132 --> 00:52:12,844
...I want to apologize. I shouldn't have said
I was a basketball player.

742
00:52:12,928 --> 00:52:14,596
I shouldn't have lied. I'm sorry.

743
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:19,601
I really am a decent artist. If I could
help you, I'd like to make it up to you.

744
00:52:19,893 --> 00:52:21,311
You really want to help?

745
00:52:21,394 --> 00:52:23,438
-Yeah.
-Buy a ticket.

746
00:52:24,105 --> 00:52:25,398
Hi. How you doing?

747
00:52:41,288 --> 00:52:44,917
We are from the planet of the toes.
We bring you....

748
00:52:45,793 --> 00:52:47,586
And we bring you produce.

749
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:50,213
-Hi, fellas.
-Hi, Hoops.

750
00:52:50,213 --> 00:52:51,631
-Hi, Hoops.
-Hi, Hoops.

751
00:52:53,467 --> 00:52:55,427
A giant dolphin with rabies.

752
00:52:55,969 --> 00:52:58,221
Turn it around. Open it up.

753
00:52:58,513 --> 00:53:00,765
About as believable as Superman.

754
00:53:09,857 --> 00:53:13,319
They sure can do incredible things
in movies nowadays.

755
00:53:13,819 --> 00:53:14,945
Yeah.

756
00:53:19,283 --> 00:53:23,162
Good idea. I've got it. Up.
Stork twins, bring that camera.

757
00:53:27,207 --> 00:53:29,251
No! No, please!

758
00:53:31,294 --> 00:53:33,421
Guys, what about George?

759
00:53:35,799 --> 00:53:37,175
George!

760
00:53:38,385 --> 00:53:40,595
I refuse to do this!

761
00:53:40,678 --> 00:53:43,097
-Give him CPR.
-I am your superior!

762
00:54:23,386 --> 00:54:27,390
These are satanic hemorrhoids from hell.
We must stop them before they kill again!

763
00:54:29,892 --> 00:54:30,893
Doctor, no!

764
00:54:30,977 --> 00:54:33,187
l must save the free world.

765
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:07,303
Thank you very much.
I hope to see you at the show.

766
00:55:51,387 --> 00:55:53,055
Weather for the Cape and the islands...

767
00:55:53,139 --> 00:55:56,183
looks like we can expect some rain,
but nothing to worry about.

768
00:55:56,308 --> 00:56:00,396
Nantucket's big news tonight
is Cassandra live at the Dew Drop lnn.

769
00:56:00,479 --> 00:56:01,897
Come on, come on.

770
00:56:01,981 --> 00:56:03,440
Good luck to her...

771
00:56:03,524 --> 00:56:06,610
and good luck to you
in our $1 million summer.

772
00:56:06,693 --> 00:56:08,445
lt could happen at any minute.

773
00:56:08,528 --> 00:56:12,074
-You could win $1 million.
-Come on, come on.

774
00:56:12,491 --> 00:56:14,534
Stand still, Teddy.

775
00:56:15,076 --> 00:56:17,203
Dad, I got to do my laps.

776
00:56:17,329 --> 00:56:19,873
I have not yet mastered this contraption.

777
00:56:19,956 --> 00:56:22,792
When I have,
then you may continue your laps.

778
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:25,628
Damn it.

779
00:56:27,088 --> 00:56:29,006
Do you know who this is?

780
00:56:38,098 --> 00:56:41,185
-No.
-That is trouble.

781
00:56:41,769 --> 00:56:45,772
That is the girl that just might ruin
my restaurant on the bluff.

782
00:56:46,273 --> 00:56:50,152
She's singing or something
tomorrow night.

783
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:54,698
If people do actually show up to hear her...

784
00:56:54,865 --> 00:56:56,575
she might make some money.

785
00:56:57,033 --> 00:56:59,869
She might make enough
to pay back the bank.

786
00:57:00,078 --> 00:57:02,330
What are we going to do about it?

787
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:05,917
Stop her from singing?

788
00:57:05,959 --> 00:57:07,960
Good, Teddy. Good.

789
00:57:11,756 --> 00:57:12,924
Get it.

790
00:57:13,799 --> 00:57:16,552
We're here to pick up your father's Jag.

791
00:57:17,303 --> 00:57:19,972
He called us. We will need the keys.

792
00:57:27,896 --> 00:57:30,065
-Get rid of this.
-Okay.

793
00:57:33,902 --> 00:57:35,111
Come on.

794
00:57:42,994 --> 00:57:46,331
ln sports, we've got the Nantucket Regatta
coming up...

795
00:57:46,372 --> 00:57:49,834
and Cape Cod's own Mr. Congeniality....

796
00:57:49,917 --> 00:57:50,960
Hi, guys.

797
00:57:51,002 --> 00:57:52,587
-Hi, Ack Ack.
-Hi, Ack.

798
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:54,213
How you doing?

799
00:57:55,881 --> 00:57:57,925
That's the last of it.

800
00:57:58,759 --> 00:58:00,427
I'm history.

801
00:58:01,428 --> 00:58:04,223
I wish I could make my father understand.

802
00:58:06,433 --> 00:58:07,768
Hey, Ack...

803
00:58:09,936 --> 00:58:11,438
I understand.

804
00:58:11,813 --> 00:58:12,773
You do?

805
00:58:17,652 --> 00:58:19,404
Let me tell you a story...

806
00:58:20,321 --> 00:58:24,200
about a little fat boy that nobody loved...

807
00:58:24,450 --> 00:58:27,787
and all the other kids,
they used to make fun of him...

808
00:58:29,497 --> 00:58:31,332
and they would pick on him...

809
00:58:31,457 --> 00:58:35,503
and they used to say
that he talked funny and stuff...

810
00:58:35,961 --> 00:58:38,214
and he had a twin brother...

811
00:58:38,255 --> 00:58:39,757
and everybody said...

812
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:43,302
that he didn't look
anything like his twin brother...

813
00:58:44,094 --> 00:58:45,721
but he wanted to.

814
00:58:45,804 --> 00:58:47,097
Egg....

815
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,767
Were you the little fat boy?

816
00:58:52,102 --> 00:58:55,146
No. But I used to like to beat him up.

817
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:57,565
I'd go, "Why are you so fat?"

818
00:58:57,649 --> 00:59:00,110
And I'd beat the shit out of him.

819
00:59:01,402 --> 00:59:03,530
Isn't that a great story?

820
00:59:05,239 --> 00:59:07,784
Yeah, thanks.

821
00:59:10,328 --> 00:59:12,663
Are you a little nervous? No?

822
00:59:13,331 --> 00:59:14,999
Nobody's going to show up.

823
00:59:15,499 --> 00:59:19,295
Everybody's going to show up. It's been
the greatest media blitz in Nantucket.

824
00:59:19,378 --> 00:59:22,381
-I don't want to hear another word.
-What about Beckerstead?

825
00:59:22,464 --> 00:59:25,884
-Will he pull something?
-It's covered, I promise you.

826
00:59:25,968 --> 00:59:29,513
You just relax and have a good time,
because you're going to be great.

827
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,223
Okay? Trust me.

828
00:59:32,724 --> 00:59:33,809
Hoops...

829
00:59:35,227 --> 00:59:37,646
I just want to tell you....

830
00:59:38,563 --> 00:59:40,482
I guess I know what you mean.

831
00:59:48,573 --> 00:59:49,699
Hoops?

832
00:59:49,782 --> 00:59:51,784
Yeah. Got to run. See you at the club.

833
01:00:01,835 --> 01:00:03,962
This one's for Cassandra.

834
01:00:35,493 --> 01:00:36,660
Come on!

835
01:00:57,931 --> 01:01:01,017
Teddy? Don't forget about tonight.

836
01:01:01,351 --> 01:01:02,769
Dad, I'll go.

837
01:01:03,019 --> 01:01:05,146
I'll go after I do my laps!

838
01:01:06,105 --> 01:01:07,899
Thank you, Teddy.

839
01:01:29,711 --> 01:01:31,171
Have a nice swim.

840
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,011
Come on in.

841
01:01:39,304 --> 01:01:41,723
Come on in, Cookie wookie wookie.

842
01:01:49,814 --> 01:01:52,650
-Cookie, help me!
-What's wrong?

843
01:01:52,733 --> 01:01:53,651
Come here!

844
01:04:21,626 --> 01:04:23,169
Two. Enjoy it.

845
01:05:13,175 --> 01:05:14,427
What?

846
01:05:15,136 --> 01:05:16,303
I'm sorry, Miss...

847
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:20,057
but all the money in the world
won't get you that house.

848
01:05:20,599 --> 01:05:23,143
But it's my house,
and that's the money I owe you.

849
01:05:23,227 --> 01:05:24,686
I understand.

850
01:05:24,728 --> 01:05:27,940
Mr. Beckerstead bought the mortgage
from the bank.

851
01:05:28,815 --> 01:05:31,109
He can foreclose when he wants.

852
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:33,320
You gave me until today.

853
01:05:33,528 --> 01:05:34,863
I'm sorry.

854
01:05:35,030 --> 01:05:38,158
The bank was lenient
for as long as it could be.

855
01:05:38,783 --> 01:05:43,079
What about those people? It's their home.
How could you sell it to him?

856
01:05:43,496 --> 01:05:46,416
Mr. Beckerstead is a lot wealthier
than you.

857
01:05:57,551 --> 01:05:59,762
What's going on? What happened?

858
01:06:03,849 --> 01:06:06,226
What does it matter? The house is theirs.

859
01:06:06,268 --> 01:06:07,769
That's right.

860
01:06:07,853 --> 01:06:10,147
And get this ugly mutt...

861
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:11,857
off my property.

862
01:06:15,902 --> 01:06:17,070
Boscoe!

863
01:06:19,656 --> 01:06:21,699
Dr. Balson to ER.

864
01:06:27,997 --> 01:06:31,209
Squid, it's okay.
Boscoe's going to be just fine.

865
01:06:31,375 --> 01:06:34,295
I don't know. They've been in there awhile.

866
01:06:34,337 --> 01:06:36,338
I think I smell gas, too.

867
01:06:38,382 --> 01:06:40,801
Cassandra, will you really leave?

868
01:06:40,968 --> 01:06:44,304
Why should I stay?
There's nothing left here for me.

869
01:06:46,014 --> 01:06:47,850
How can you say that?

870
01:06:49,518 --> 01:06:52,354
What about the house
and all those people?

871
01:06:52,437 --> 01:06:54,981
Will we just give in to the Beckersteads?

872
01:06:55,065 --> 01:06:57,984
We can't let them walk away
with everything.

873
01:06:58,068 --> 01:07:02,655
If we give in, we're giving in
to all the cute, fuzzy bunnies in the world.

874
01:07:04,574 --> 01:07:07,285
Yeah, that's just what I was thinking.

875
01:07:07,785 --> 01:07:11,539
What I mean is, we can't give up.
We got to think of a plan.

876
01:07:11,831 --> 01:07:13,040
A plan.

877
01:07:15,167 --> 01:07:17,628
"Without a plan, there's no attack.

878
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:19,964
"Without attack, no victory."

879
01:07:20,089 --> 01:07:22,132
Where have I heard that before?

880
01:07:22,174 --> 01:07:25,385
A plan. Oh, boy, I've got a plan.

881
01:07:25,469 --> 01:07:28,388
-Acky's got a plan! What is it?
-The regatta.

882
01:07:28,472 --> 01:07:29,890
The regatta?

883
01:07:30,557 --> 01:07:33,101
The regatta. The sailing boat race.

884
01:07:33,351 --> 01:07:37,272
The one-boat rowing, sailing,
motoring regatta around Nantucket.

885
01:07:37,355 --> 01:07:39,315
Your plan involves a boat?

886
01:07:39,357 --> 01:07:40,942
But Teddy will win it.

887
01:07:41,025 --> 01:07:43,153
He wins every year.
Everybody knows that.

888
01:07:43,194 --> 01:07:45,446
But what happens if he doesn't?

889
01:07:45,530 --> 01:07:49,325
His grandfather takes away everything
he and his father own...

890
01:07:49,367 --> 01:07:51,869
making his life as dreary as ours.

891
01:07:52,203 --> 01:07:53,537
Poor guys.

892
01:07:53,871 --> 01:07:54,914
And?

893
01:07:54,997 --> 01:07:56,749
So we win the race.

894
01:07:57,666 --> 01:08:01,712
He can't live without the trophy.
We can't live without the house.

895
01:08:02,212 --> 01:08:03,839
We make a trade.

896
01:08:04,757 --> 01:08:07,801
Great, Ack Ack.
There's just one thing missing.

897
01:08:07,926 --> 01:08:09,219
The boat.

898
01:08:29,197 --> 01:08:30,448
The boat.

899
01:08:33,075 --> 01:08:35,161
She's really in good shape.

900
01:08:37,455 --> 01:08:40,124
Mind you, she could use a little help.

901
01:10:14,172 --> 01:10:15,382
George?

902
01:10:18,718 --> 01:10:21,429
Welcome, all,
to the christening of the boat.

903
01:10:21,513 --> 01:10:23,681
For this gala occasion, I got something...

904
01:10:23,765 --> 01:10:26,476
my parents brought me back from France.

905
01:10:27,852 --> 01:10:31,731
I've been saving it for a special occasion.
I think this is it.

906
01:10:35,026 --> 01:10:36,777
That's really nice.

907
01:10:36,861 --> 01:10:39,363
Cassandra, would you do the honors?

908
01:10:48,539 --> 01:10:49,873
To the boat.

909
01:10:49,957 --> 01:10:51,375
To the boat!

910
01:10:55,545 --> 01:10:58,506
-We'll patch that up.
-We'll fix that later.

911
01:10:58,590 --> 01:11:02,135
Listen, Hoops, here's a little something...

912
01:11:02,594 --> 01:11:04,888
from all of us to all of you.

913
01:11:05,054 --> 01:11:07,890
What, for me? What is it?

914
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:13,229
Thank you. What is this for?

915
01:11:14,563 --> 01:11:17,358
The captain has to have his captain hat.

916
01:11:20,569 --> 01:11:24,365
I can't accept this.
Acky, you be captain. It was your idea.

917
01:11:24,406 --> 01:11:27,534
It's decided, Hoops.
You're the man for the job.

918
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:30,829
I can't be captain.
I won't even be on the boat.

919
01:11:30,912 --> 01:11:32,789
I'll be on land. Sorry, fellows.

920
01:11:34,541 --> 01:11:35,709
Hoops?

921
01:11:37,794 --> 01:11:40,255
Let's have a look at that engine.

922
01:11:40,922 --> 01:11:42,841
-Yeah.
-Sure, that'll be great.

923
01:12:07,281 --> 01:12:08,740
What's wrong?

924
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:10,284
Nothing.

925
01:12:11,284 --> 01:12:13,954
I just don't like boats. I hate boats.

926
01:12:14,162 --> 01:12:16,831
Since I was a kid, I don't like boats.

927
01:12:17,290 --> 01:12:21,377
Maybe you just haven't had
the right kind of experience on a boat.

928
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:25,298
Maybe you're right.

929
01:12:37,643 --> 01:12:39,228
That's it, boys.

930
01:12:40,854 --> 01:12:44,066
We got to have an engine
for part of this race.

931
01:12:44,733 --> 01:12:46,193
I'll get it.

932
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:50,197
Most of those guys
will have Evinrudes and Mercuries...

933
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:51,698
heavy stuff.

934
01:12:52,407 --> 01:12:55,785
I don't think this puppy
is going to cut the mustard.

935
01:12:56,161 --> 01:12:58,580
Well, that's the best my dad had.

936
01:13:06,045 --> 01:13:07,338
Clay!

937
01:13:07,714 --> 01:13:09,173
What happened?

938
01:13:10,258 --> 01:13:13,010
Teddy brought his car in for a tune-up.

939
01:13:13,844 --> 01:13:15,388
Did he hit you?

940
01:13:54,467 --> 01:13:56,844
One, two, three, four.

941
01:14:16,655 --> 01:14:18,531
What the hell is that?

942
01:14:42,763 --> 01:14:44,139
Hi, Ted.

943
01:14:45,015 --> 01:14:46,725
How you doing?

944
01:14:46,809 --> 01:14:48,018
McCann.

945
01:14:50,812 --> 01:14:53,940
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

946
01:14:55,108 --> 01:14:58,528
Welcome to the Nantucket Regatta.

947
01:14:59,696 --> 01:15:02,073
The first part of the regatta...

948
01:15:02,907 --> 01:15:06,035
will test your strength and stamina.

949
01:15:06,452 --> 01:15:08,830
From this line, you will row....

950
01:15:09,205 --> 01:15:10,248
You!

951
01:15:10,248 --> 01:15:12,208
You will not....

952
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:14,043
Get down! Come here.

953
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:15,586
Go! Go! Go!

954
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:20,174
Come on, save it for the race.

955
01:15:21,342 --> 01:15:24,428
There, you will drop your sails...

956
01:15:24,845 --> 01:15:26,847
and start your engines...

957
01:15:27,139 --> 01:15:29,141
for the final stretch...

958
01:15:29,558 --> 01:15:32,060
back into Nantucket Harbor.

959
01:15:32,936 --> 01:15:34,104
Now....

960
01:15:34,604 --> 01:15:36,773
lf everyone is ready....

961
01:15:55,958 --> 01:15:57,251
Go! Go!

962
01:15:57,543 --> 01:15:59,170
-Hey, Egg.
-What?

963
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:02,881
Tito Ramirez is wrestling
Mr. Congeniality...

964
01:16:03,173 --> 01:16:05,092
in a half-hour.

965
01:16:06,301 --> 01:16:09,513
Teddy says Mr. Congeniality
doesn't have a chance.

966
01:16:18,647 --> 01:16:20,065
Go! Come on!

967
01:16:22,025 --> 01:16:23,109
Go!

968
01:17:07,485 --> 01:17:10,113
Come on, guys. They're gaining on us!

969
01:17:18,496 --> 01:17:20,915
We'll take care of this right now.

970
01:17:21,498 --> 01:17:22,916
Dad? Shit.

971
01:17:23,042 --> 01:17:27,045
You just steer the boat,
you stupid, imbecilic retard.

972
01:17:27,129 --> 01:17:30,799
You're not my son. I knew I couldn't
trust you to do this without me.

973
01:17:31,049 --> 01:17:34,761
-What are you doing?
-First, we just take out that halyard.

974
01:17:34,845 --> 01:17:36,471
This race is yours.

975
01:17:36,513 --> 01:17:39,391
-Come on, Dad, I can win--
-Shut your mouth, Teddy!

976
01:17:39,474 --> 01:17:41,101
That's an order.

977
01:17:49,358 --> 01:17:51,194
Shit! What happened?

978
01:17:51,736 --> 01:17:53,946
Now, you may proceed.

979
01:17:55,531 --> 01:17:58,951
-The halyard snapped.
-It couldn't have just snapped.

980
01:18:01,245 --> 01:18:02,371
Look.

981
01:18:04,248 --> 01:18:05,749
You bastards!

982
01:18:08,835 --> 01:18:10,837
Fix that Australian boat.

983
01:18:11,046 --> 01:18:13,590
Well, there goes Cassandra's house.

984
01:18:13,715 --> 01:18:15,133
That's that.

985
01:18:16,092 --> 01:18:19,012
We can't quit!
We got to do something. Think!

986
01:18:19,054 --> 01:18:22,182
We got to get the halyard
back through its holder.

987
01:18:22,265 --> 01:18:23,433
We can't do that out here.

988
01:18:25,685 --> 01:18:27,437
We're not dead yet.

989
01:18:30,731 --> 01:18:32,775
Man, we're getting smoked.

990
01:18:33,109 --> 01:18:35,152
What are you doing, Hoops?

991
01:18:35,236 --> 01:18:36,862
Desperation move.

992
01:19:00,468 --> 01:19:01,845
Two points!

993
01:19:27,161 --> 01:19:29,288
Ty, take out the main sheet!

994
01:19:31,707 --> 01:19:32,958
Come on!

995
01:19:42,509 --> 01:19:44,302
-Man overboard!
-Jesus!

996
01:19:44,969 --> 01:19:46,888
Drop the sails, fellows.

997
01:19:48,681 --> 01:19:50,558
Acky. God.

998
01:19:52,643 --> 01:19:55,271
Hold on, buddy. We'll be there in a minute.

999
01:19:55,354 --> 01:19:56,689
All right!

1000
01:20:02,820 --> 01:20:03,946
Acky!

1001
01:20:04,279 --> 01:20:05,489
Go on!

1002
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:07,449
I got him!

1003
01:20:07,533 --> 01:20:08,825
Are you sure?

1004
01:20:08,909 --> 01:20:10,702
I got him. Beat it!

1005
01:20:12,537 --> 01:20:13,955
Let's do it!

1006
01:20:14,664 --> 01:20:16,666
Go get those scum, mates!

1007
01:20:18,793 --> 01:20:20,837
Come to me. Help me, boys!

1008
01:20:31,055 --> 01:20:32,640
Check this out.

1009
01:20:32,723 --> 01:20:34,392
I don't believe it.

1010
01:20:34,475 --> 01:20:36,811
Aloha! We're back! How are you?

1011
01:20:37,978 --> 01:20:39,897
Teddy, go faster.

1012
01:20:40,105 --> 01:20:43,442
The wind's dying down.
We're almost to the engine buoy.

1013
01:20:43,442 --> 01:20:45,569
I'm not taking any chances.

1014
01:20:46,528 --> 01:20:49,448
Dad, damn it. Why don't you listen to me?
I can win!

1015
01:20:49,656 --> 01:20:52,034
The only way to win, Theodore...

1016
01:20:52,284 --> 01:20:54,286
is to cheat. Remember.

1017
01:20:55,245 --> 01:20:58,999
A little hole in their hull
will slow them down just enough.

1018
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,168
He's lost his mind! Get down!

1019
01:21:07,632 --> 01:21:09,092
What the hell is that?

1020
01:21:09,175 --> 01:21:11,093
Teddy, come back here!

1021
01:21:11,552 --> 01:21:13,804
Come back here right now, boy!

1022
01:21:13,971 --> 01:21:15,139
Teddy!

1023
01:21:15,222 --> 01:21:17,767
My god. A giant dolphin with rabies.

1024
01:21:17,975 --> 01:21:19,560
Come back here!

1025
01:21:21,395 --> 01:21:22,688
Theodore!

1026
01:21:25,149 --> 01:21:27,109
Come back here. Help me!

1027
01:21:37,077 --> 01:21:40,830
The wind's coming up.
Let's set sail! Let's get out of here!

1028
01:21:40,997 --> 01:21:43,208
Boy, if I ever get out of this...

1029
01:21:43,291 --> 01:21:45,919
I'm going to make you into a stew!

1030
01:21:46,294 --> 01:21:47,545
Help me!

1031
01:21:51,632 --> 01:21:53,301
Somebody help me!

1032
01:22:06,522 --> 01:22:09,024
All right! There's the engine buoy!

1033
01:22:11,485 --> 01:22:13,153
There's the buoy!

1034
01:22:17,324 --> 01:22:19,617
Come on, let's get out of here.

1035
01:22:19,868 --> 01:22:22,370
Hustle! Come on, move it, move it!

1036
01:22:23,538 --> 01:22:25,540
Come on, ladies! Let's go!

1037
01:22:29,836 --> 01:22:31,629
Start up the engine.

1038
01:22:32,129 --> 01:22:35,716
Good luck trying to beat a Merc
with a lawnmower engine!

1039
01:22:49,521 --> 01:22:52,149
Gentlemen, prepare to blow the hatch!

1040
01:23:00,740 --> 01:23:03,159
Gentlemen, I am blowing the hatch!

1041
01:23:29,184 --> 01:23:30,894
Teddy, step on it.

1042
01:23:31,019 --> 01:23:34,481
I've got her full throttle.
She doesn't have any more.

1043
01:23:38,443 --> 01:23:41,029
What the hell they got in that thing?

1044
01:23:44,991 --> 01:23:46,200
My car.

1045
01:23:50,496 --> 01:23:52,081
Thank you very much.

1046
01:23:52,164 --> 01:23:54,041
Bye-bye. See you later!

1047
01:24:19,274 --> 01:24:22,569
I'd like to thank everyone
that made this possible.

1048
01:24:31,035 --> 01:24:32,495
Hey, Cookie.

1049
01:24:32,912 --> 01:24:35,706
Why don't we quit
playing all these games?

1050
01:24:44,465 --> 01:24:46,216
Look what I caught!

1051
01:24:46,925 --> 01:24:48,635
How you doing? Are you hurt?

1052
01:24:49,761 --> 01:24:51,555
Squid! Look at that.

1053
01:24:53,056 --> 01:24:54,266
Boscoe!

1054
01:25:09,906 --> 01:25:12,408
-Thanks again, mate.
-You're welcome.

1055
01:25:19,915 --> 01:25:23,502
I heard what you did, Ack Ack.
It's all over the island.

1056
01:25:24,044 --> 01:25:25,504
You're a hero.

1057
01:25:25,879 --> 01:25:27,756
I'm proud of you, Son.

1058
01:25:28,006 --> 01:25:29,383
Damn proud.

1059
01:25:32,677 --> 01:25:34,638
I want you to come home.

1060
01:25:36,723 --> 01:25:39,809
Does this mean
I have to give back the bazooka?

1061
01:25:41,895 --> 01:25:44,689
Let's talk about it over a hot chocolate.

1062
01:25:52,530 --> 01:25:53,739
Hey, Teddy.

1063
01:25:55,700 --> 01:25:57,576
What if we make a deal?

1064
01:25:57,618 --> 01:25:59,745
You need the trophy, we need the house.

1065
01:25:59,829 --> 01:26:02,373
And everybody's happy. Come on, Ted.

1066
01:26:04,333 --> 01:26:05,417
Okay.

1067
01:26:06,335 --> 01:26:08,629
You're only half right, McCann.

1068
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:12,841
That house won't do you
or your father any good.

1069
01:26:12,924 --> 01:26:16,094
I'm not putting a dime
in the Beckerstead Estates.

1070
01:26:16,386 --> 01:26:19,472
This is the real investment, Teddy:
Friendship!

1071
01:26:20,140 --> 01:26:22,016
Here's your house back.

1072
01:26:22,142 --> 01:26:23,810
Thank you so much.

1073
01:26:23,977 --> 01:26:26,396
The little lady has quite a voice.

1074
01:26:27,146 --> 01:26:28,648
Come on, Teddy.

1075
01:26:50,711 --> 01:26:52,170
Once upon a time...

1076
01:26:52,212 --> 01:26:55,340
there was a happy guy
that love finally found...

1077
01:26:55,715 --> 01:26:58,426
and this time, love didn't pass him by.

1078
01:26:58,510 --> 01:27:00,804
Old boy finally caught a break.

1079
01:27:01,137 --> 01:27:03,806
This love story lasted all summer long.

1080
01:27:04,182 --> 01:27:07,393
There was nothing
even the cute and fuzzy bunnies...

1081
01:27:07,477 --> 01:27:09,645
could do about it, thank you.

1082
01:27:36,463 --> 01:27:38,340
95.5 F.M...

1083
01:27:38,381 --> 01:27:40,175
music-money time.

1084
01:27:40,717 --> 01:27:43,845
This is it. We're looking
for caller number 50!

1085
01:27:44,012 --> 01:27:45,346
Good luck.

1086
01:27:46,556 --> 01:27:48,182
You're on the air!

1087
01:27:48,266 --> 01:27:49,767
-Hello?
-Hello!

1088
01:27:49,851 --> 01:27:51,936
This the contest at the radio station?

1089
01:27:52,019 --> 01:27:55,398
l hope you're sitting,
'cause you've won $1 million!

1090
01:27:55,606 --> 01:27:58,192
-Jesus Christ, I won!
-lt's all yours!

1091
01:27:58,359 --> 01:28:00,736
This changes everything for me.

1092
01:28:00,819 --> 01:28:03,864
I deserve this. I've been sitting, waiting,
day after day...

1093
01:28:03,906 --> 01:28:06,158
in this room waiting for your lousy song...

1094
01:28:06,241 --> 01:28:09,203
and I've gotten through!
I feel so lucky, so blessed...

1095
01:28:09,286 --> 01:28:10,704
so powerful!

1096
01:28:12,205 --> 01:28:14,166
-Congratulations!
-Hello?

1097
01:28:14,332 --> 01:28:15,500
Hello?

1098
01:28:15,625 --> 01:28:18,795
We seem to be cut off.
Let's take another caller.

1099
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:20,547
You're on the air.

1100
01:28:20,922 --> 01:28:22,882
-Did l win?
-You sure did.

1101
01:28:23,383 --> 01:28:26,719
You better believe it, lady.
$1 million is all yours!

1102
01:28:26,844 --> 01:28:28,596
l can't believe it!

1103
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:31,599
It's certainly been a great summer for you.

1104
01:28:31,641 --> 01:28:34,727
Just a second.
There's a rocket coming in here.

1105
01:28:35,061 --> 01:28:36,312
A rocket?

1106
01:28:36,771 --> 01:28:38,773
Wait, what about my money?

1107
01:28:40,274 --> 01:28:41,734
Hello? Hello?

1108
01:28:42,443 --> 01:28:44,069
ls anyone there?

1109
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:52,077
Clay, look! A bonfire!

1110
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:56,289
Get the marshmallows!

1111
01:28:58,083 --> 01:29:00,001
Thank you very much.

1112
01:33:27,216 --> 01:33:29,259
English
