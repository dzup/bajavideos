1
00:01:29,044 --> 00:01:30,379
Turn him over.

2
00:01:32,298 --> 00:01:33,549
Oh, no!

3
00:02:23,432 --> 00:02:26,185
<i>"Do not drink wine
nor strong drink...</i>

4
00:02:26,852 --> 00:02:29,021
<i>"thou, nor thy sons with thee...</i>

5
00:02:29,438 --> 00:02:31,273
"lest ye shall die.

6
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,568
"Look not thou upon the wine
when it is red...

7
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,281
"and when it bringeth his color in the
cup, when it moveth itself aright.

8
00:02:39,448 --> 00:02:42,201
"At the last it biteth
like a serpent...

9
00:02:42,368 --> 00:02:44,453
"and stingeth like an adder."

10
00:02:44,703 --> 00:02:45,955
Now, folks...

11
00:02:53,796 --> 00:02:55,798
that's from the Good Book...

12
00:02:55,881 --> 00:02:57,466
but in this here town...

13
00:02:57,633 --> 00:02:59,802
it's five cents a glass.

14
00:03:00,636 --> 00:03:02,429
Five cents a glass.

15
00:03:03,055 --> 00:03:06,642
Does anyone really think
that that is the price of a drink?

16
00:03:08,143 --> 00:03:10,896
The price of a drink?
Let him decide...

17
00:03:11,564 --> 00:03:13,983
who has lost his courage and his pride...

18
00:03:14,066 --> 00:03:17,653
who lies a groveling
heap of clay not far removed...

19
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:17,129
All's quiet, sir.

20
00:04:17,963 --> 00:04:19,298
Let's fall in.

21
00:04:31,769 --> 00:04:32,937
Follow me.

22
00:04:49,495 --> 00:04:51,247
I beg your pardon, ma'am.

23
00:04:52,164 --> 00:04:54,500
-I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
-Allow me, ma'am.

24
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:55,793
Thank you.

25
00:04:56,001 --> 00:04:57,127
May I?

26
00:04:57,503 --> 00:04:58,629
Thank you.

27
00:05:07,513 --> 00:05:09,807
Thornton, wake up! Soldiers!

28
00:05:09,932 --> 00:05:11,058
Take a look.

29
00:05:20,693 --> 00:05:23,153
I don't care what you meant to do...

30
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,531
it's what you did I don't like.

31
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:34,081
You inconvenienced this lady,
and made a fool of yourself...

32
00:05:34,165 --> 00:05:36,041
and this railroad in the bargain.

33
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:39,128
Now, I want you to apologize to this...

34
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,338
Yes, sir, can I help you?

35
00:05:50,514 --> 00:05:52,391
If they move, kill them.

36
00:05:57,396 --> 00:05:58,772
Is he with them?

37
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:00,858
He's there.

38
00:06:01,734 --> 00:06:03,444
Hold your fire! Get down!

39
00:06:03,527 --> 00:06:05,237
Wait till they come out.

40
00:06:06,906 --> 00:06:08,490
I can nail him.

41
00:06:11,702 --> 00:06:13,204
I said, wait!

42
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,789
What if they slip out the back way?

43
00:06:15,873 --> 00:06:18,959
It's covered.
You two-bit redneck peckerwood.

44
00:06:22,755 --> 00:06:23,881
Abe?

45
00:06:37,228 --> 00:06:38,812
I solemnly promise...

46
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,982
God helping me...

47
00:06:42,066 --> 00:06:44,777
"I solemnly promise, God helping me."

48
00:06:45,903 --> 00:06:49,281
...to abstain from all distilled,
fermented malt liquors...

49
00:06:49,615 --> 00:06:52,243
including wine, beer and cider.

50
00:06:52,576 --> 00:06:55,829
"To abstain from liquor,
wine, cider and beer."

51
00:07:24,483 --> 00:07:26,777
People marching and singing,
coming down the street.

52
00:07:26,861 --> 00:07:28,195
They're gonna pass by the horses.

53
00:07:28,445 --> 00:07:29,822
We'll join them.

54
00:07:30,155 --> 00:07:32,032
The Temperance Union?

55
00:07:37,955 --> 00:07:39,373
They should have been told.

56
00:07:39,456 --> 00:07:40,583
Told what?

57
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,668
How long do you think
anybody in this manure pile...

58
00:07:42,751 --> 00:07:44,295
could keep his mouth shut?

59
00:07:53,137 --> 00:07:55,389
<i>Yes, we'll gather at the river</i>

60
00:07:57,141 --> 00:07:59,518
<i>The beautiful, beautiful river</i>

61
00:08:01,645 --> 00:08:04,315
<i>Gather with the saints at the river</i>

62
00:08:05,524 --> 00:08:06,609
Rifles.

63
00:08:09,987 --> 00:08:11,113
One?

64
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,282
No, three!

65
00:08:19,205 --> 00:08:21,248
Maybe more, there, on the roof.

66
00:08:23,667 --> 00:08:24,752
Get down.

67
00:08:25,002 --> 00:08:26,378
Son of a bitch!

68
00:08:27,338 --> 00:08:29,965
-Lyle, Dutch.
-What are they, bounty hunters?

69
00:08:30,049 --> 00:08:31,717
Hell, I wouldn't know.

70
00:08:31,884 --> 00:08:33,344
Buck, with Abe.

71
00:08:34,512 --> 00:08:36,013
-I kill them now?
-No.

72
00:08:36,096 --> 00:08:38,933
Hold them here as long as you can
until after the shooting starts.

73
00:08:39,016 --> 00:08:42,394
I'll hold them till hell freezes over
or you say different.

74
00:08:58,035 --> 00:09:00,204
When I kick him out, blast them.

75
00:09:00,371 --> 00:09:01,747
We'll make a run for it.

76
00:09:01,914 --> 00:09:03,499
C.L., give me that shotgun.

77
00:09:06,043 --> 00:09:08,045
<i>The beautiful, beautiful river</i>

78
00:09:09,588 --> 00:09:11,882
<i>Gather with the saints at the river</i>

79
00:09:13,384 --> 00:09:15,886
<i>That flows by the throne of God</i>

80
00:10:15,988 --> 00:10:17,114
Set?

81
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,394
Let's go!

82
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,957
Good luck, boys!

83
00:11:31,021 --> 00:11:33,190
They're blowing this town all to hell!

84
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:51,542
You're trash!

85
00:12:17,985 --> 00:12:19,904
Now, you just hush now.

86
00:12:28,662 --> 00:12:31,373
They was playing <i>Gather at the River.</i>

87
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,751
You know that one?

88
00:12:35,336 --> 00:12:36,378
Sing it!

89
00:12:37,171 --> 00:12:39,465
<i>Shall we gather at the river</i>

90
00:12:40,841 --> 00:12:43,427
<i>Where bright angel feet have trod</i>

91
00:13:08,452 --> 00:13:09,537
Hurry!

92
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,414
<i>River that flows by the throne of God</i>

93
00:14:14,518 --> 00:14:16,437
Come on, you lazy bastard!

94
00:14:16,604 --> 00:14:17,771
I'm coming, damn it!

95
00:14:22,943 --> 00:14:25,362
They've cleared out, for Christ's sake!

96
00:14:26,113 --> 00:14:27,698
Let's go, T. C!

97
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,043
Put some more on!

98
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,974
Let's go!

99
00:15:28,008 --> 00:15:29,093
Take him!

100
00:15:30,594 --> 00:15:31,720
He's mine!

101
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,102
-He's mine!
-Mr. Harrigan.

102
00:15:38,644 --> 00:15:39,854
He's mine!

103
00:15:40,187 --> 00:15:43,190
I shot this one!
Look at the size of that hole!

104
00:15:43,357 --> 00:15:46,360
You just dig out that bullet
and see if it ain't my.06!

105
00:15:46,443 --> 00:15:47,862
You know I shot him.

106
00:15:47,945 --> 00:15:50,865
You'd claim the whole thing,
wouldn't you?

107
00:15:52,116 --> 00:15:54,493
-Daddy! Daddy!
-Did he have any money?

108
00:15:56,745 --> 00:15:59,081
Damn, I can't get his belt off!

109
00:16:02,793 --> 00:16:04,545
You stupid, damn fools!

110
00:16:05,045 --> 00:16:08,007
Why did you shoot this employee
and let the others get away?

111
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,968
I didn't shoot that employee!
My first shot killed this man right here!

112
00:16:11,051 --> 00:16:12,219
Liar!

113
00:16:12,553 --> 00:16:17,683
He shot that employee while I was
dropping this bandit and them others, too.

114
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,894
I must've killed all three of them.

115
00:16:19,977 --> 00:16:22,479
Killed all three of them?
What were we doing up on that roof?

116
00:16:23,772 --> 00:16:25,816
Liar! Black liar!

117
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,902
You shouldn't talk like that to me.

118
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,197
I'm sorry.

119
00:16:32,907 --> 00:16:35,618
Come on, T.C., help me get his boots.

120
00:16:39,663 --> 00:16:41,832
I think this will do pretty good.

121
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:42,958
Harrigan!

122
00:16:43,584 --> 00:16:47,838
Next time, you better plan the massacre
more carefully, or I'll start with you.

123
00:16:47,922 --> 00:16:50,758
Why didn't you kill Pike
when you had the chance?

124
00:17:00,851 --> 00:17:02,019
Stop!

125
00:17:06,273 --> 00:17:08,359
Feathers flew like a turkey!

126
00:17:08,943 --> 00:17:10,986
They shouldn't have run.

127
00:17:12,821 --> 00:17:13,906
Say!

128
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:24,291
How'd you like to kiss
my sister's black cat's ass?

129
00:17:40,975 --> 00:17:43,143
This is better than a hog-killing!

130
00:17:45,062 --> 00:17:46,647
Get them out of here!

131
00:17:51,318 --> 00:17:55,406
We're holding you and your whole damn
railroad responsible for this carnage!

132
00:17:55,489 --> 00:17:57,616
-Mr. Benson...
-Innocent people are dead!

133
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:01,412
Women dying and mangled because
you used our town as a battlefield!

134
00:18:01,495 --> 00:18:04,915
You're going to pay! The railroad
is going to pay for our loss of blood!

135
00:18:05,082 --> 00:18:07,418
We were trying to catch
a band of outlaws!

136
00:18:07,585 --> 00:18:09,253
You lured that gang in here!

137
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:13,174
The railroad has been blabbing their
mouth about a big payload for weeks!

138
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,050
We represent the law!

139
00:18:43,954 --> 00:18:45,623
Pike, is that you?

140
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:47,291
I can ride, Pike.

141
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:48,709
I can ride.

142
00:18:49,627 --> 00:18:51,879
I can't see, but I can ride.

143
00:18:53,714 --> 00:18:54,757
God!

144
00:18:55,132 --> 00:18:56,217
No!

145
00:18:57,051 --> 00:18:58,552
I can't ride.

146
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,304
Finish it.

147
00:19:31,418 --> 00:19:34,421
You boys want to move on,
or stay and give him...

148
00:19:35,214 --> 00:19:36,507
a decent burial?

149
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,842
He was a good man.

150
00:19:37,925 --> 00:19:39,510
I think we ought to bury him.

151
00:19:39,677 --> 00:19:41,011
He's dead!

152
00:19:41,428 --> 00:19:43,764
He's got a lot of good men back there
to keep him company!

153
00:19:43,848 --> 00:19:45,266
Too damn many!

154
00:19:47,518 --> 00:19:49,436
I think the boys are right.

155
00:19:49,937 --> 00:19:53,566
I'd like to say a few words for the dear,
dead departed.

156
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:57,278
Maybe a few hymns'd be in order!

157
00:19:58,028 --> 00:19:59,864
Followed by a church supper...

158
00:19:59,947 --> 00:20:01,282
with a choir!

159
00:20:01,782 --> 00:20:04,201
You crazy bastards, both of you!

160
00:20:16,213 --> 00:20:19,133
Bishop, Engstrom, the Gorch brothers!

161
00:20:19,425 --> 00:20:24,471
Amounts to a total of $4,500
and you let them ride out on you!

162
00:20:24,972 --> 00:20:27,683
When the hard-money value
of the men you killed...

163
00:20:27,766 --> 00:20:31,187
less my commission, adds up to $500!

164
00:20:31,979 --> 00:20:35,608
Any one of those pelts would've
not only cleared you with the company...

165
00:20:35,691 --> 00:20:37,985
but given you a bundle of money
to raise hell with!

166
00:20:38,068 --> 00:20:40,154
We'll do better next time!

167
00:20:41,488 --> 00:20:45,075
We'll do anything you say, but we sure
would appreciate liquor money for tonight.

168
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:48,829
There won't be any tonight!
You go after them in ten minutes!

169
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,999
Get them! Get Pike and you'll be rich!

170
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,585
If one of you tries to quit on me...

171
00:20:54,668 --> 00:20:57,087
I'll pay a bonus of $1,000...

172
00:20:57,671 --> 00:20:59,632
to the man that kills him!

173
00:21:14,021 --> 00:21:15,940
Let's pack it up then!

174
00:21:21,111 --> 00:21:23,030
-Mr. Harrigan.
-Why should I let you go with them?

175
00:21:23,113 --> 00:21:24,448
We've been over that.

176
00:21:24,532 --> 00:21:25,616
You might run off with them.

177
00:21:25,699 --> 00:21:27,827
Might even join them again.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

178
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:30,538
What I like and what I need
are two different things.

179
00:21:30,621 --> 00:21:31,914
Listen, Mr. Harrigan.

180
00:21:32,998 --> 00:21:36,043
I don't want to go back to prison,
never again.

181
00:21:36,126 --> 00:21:38,212
But it's got to be my way!
I need some good men!

182
00:21:38,295 --> 00:21:39,880
You saw what happened
out there this morning!

183
00:21:39,964 --> 00:21:43,175
You'll use what you have and you'll see
to it that it doesn't happen again...

184
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:45,678
or I'll see you spend the rest of your life
behind bars.

185
00:21:45,761 --> 00:21:47,429
Try to run,
I'll be after you and so will they.

186
00:21:47,513 --> 00:21:48,806
I gave you my word.

187
00:21:48,889 --> 00:21:50,724
Well, we'll see what it's worth!

188
00:21:51,183 --> 00:21:52,643
Six minutes.

189
00:21:53,811 --> 00:21:56,814
Tell me, Mr. Harrigan, how does it feel...

190
00:21:57,022 --> 00:21:58,691
getting paid for it?

191
00:21:59,692 --> 00:22:04,572
Getting paid to sit back and hire your
killings with the law's arms around you?

192
00:22:04,822 --> 00:22:07,533
How's it feel to be so goddamn right?

193
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,909
Good.

194
00:22:08,993 --> 00:22:11,078
You dirty son of a bitch!

195
00:22:11,412 --> 00:22:15,040
You've got 30 days to get Pike
or 30 days back to Yuma.

196
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:18,002
You're my Judas goat, Mr. Thornton.

197
00:22:19,545 --> 00:22:22,840
I want all of them back here,
head down over a saddle.

198
00:22:23,048 --> 00:22:26,302
Thirty days to get Pike
or 30 days back to Yuma.

199
00:22:49,575 --> 00:22:51,952
I don't see nothing so <i>lindo</i> about it.

200
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:54,747
Just looks like more of Texas
as far as I'm concerned.

201
00:22:54,955 --> 00:22:56,457
You have no eyes.

202
00:23:27,321 --> 00:23:30,199
Got a half-hour of light. Let's go.

203
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:46,340
Hello, little fella.

204
00:24:29,884 --> 00:24:32,136
-Them other fellas...
-They're not coming!

205
00:24:32,219 --> 00:24:33,637
-None of them?
-No.

206
00:24:33,721 --> 00:24:37,725
-But I got horses and saddles for them.
-We'll need them, they won't.

207
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,054
Now, about the sharing up.

208
00:25:15,846 --> 00:25:17,848
The sharing up will be the same as always.

209
00:25:18,766 --> 00:25:22,686
Well, me and Tector don't think that
he ought to get the same amount.

210
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:27,149
He's just starting out, and this is mine
and Tector's opening for a new territory.

211
00:25:27,274 --> 00:25:28,442
That's right.

212
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:31,445
And I figure a share to that old goat
for watching them horses...

213
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:33,447
is damn sure a share too much.

214
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:39,245
So, we decided...

215
00:25:40,162 --> 00:25:41,580
it ain't fair.

216
00:25:42,706 --> 00:25:47,503
If you two boys don't like equal shares,
why in the hell don't you just take all of it?

217
00:25:51,507 --> 00:25:54,635
Well, why don't you answer me,
you damned, yellow-livered trash?

218
00:25:54,718 --> 00:25:56,303
Now, Pike, you know damn well...

219
00:25:56,387 --> 00:26:00,891
I don't know a damned thing except that
I either lead this bunch or end it right now.

220
00:26:07,731 --> 00:26:08,774
All right.

221
00:26:10,025 --> 00:26:12,570
We divide it up just like you say.

222
00:26:14,029 --> 00:26:16,198
Chick, chick, chick, chick.

223
00:26:31,755 --> 00:26:33,090
Silver rings.

224
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,510
Silver rings, your butt!
Them's washers! Damn!

225
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,555
Bastards!

226
00:26:41,098 --> 00:26:42,224
Washers!

227
00:26:45,436 --> 00:26:46,478
Washers!

228
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:53,819
We shot our way out of that town
for a dollar's worth of steel holes!

229
00:26:54,737 --> 00:26:56,030
They set it up!

230
00:26:56,113 --> 00:26:58,616
They? Who in the hell is "they"?

231
00:27:04,788 --> 00:27:05,956
"They?"

232
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:10,753
Why, "they" is just plain and fancy "they."

233
00:27:10,878 --> 00:27:12,463
That's who "they" is.

234
00:27:13,297 --> 00:27:16,467
Caught you, didn't they?
Tied a tin can to your tail!

235
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,470
Led you in and waltzed you out again!

236
00:27:21,305 --> 00:27:23,182
Oh, my, what a bunch!

237
00:27:24,266 --> 00:27:25,559
Big tough one!

238
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:31,232
Here you are with a handful of holes,
a thumb up your ass...

239
00:27:31,398 --> 00:27:34,568
and a big grin to pass
the time of day with.

240
00:27:35,611 --> 00:27:36,820
"They!"

241
00:27:36,987 --> 00:27:38,989
Who the hell is "they"?

242
00:27:44,787 --> 00:27:46,288
Railroad men.

243
00:27:47,289 --> 00:27:48,791
Bounty hunters.

244
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:51,502
Deke Thornton.

245
00:27:52,336 --> 00:27:53,796
Deke Thornton?

246
00:27:54,922 --> 00:27:56,423
He was one of them?

247
00:27:59,176 --> 00:28:01,178
How the hell come you didn't know that?

248
00:28:01,428 --> 00:28:02,888
Hey, <i>gringo.</i>

249
00:28:07,351 --> 00:28:09,061
You can have my silver.

250
00:28:10,312 --> 00:28:13,232
Come on, <i>gringo,</i> don't kill me.

251
00:28:17,903 --> 00:28:19,822
You can have the silver.

252
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,033
But don't kill me.

253
00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:24,660
Please?

254
00:28:29,665 --> 00:28:30,958
Go on...

255
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:33,210
go for it.

256
00:28:33,961 --> 00:28:35,379
Fall apart.

257
00:28:38,257 --> 00:28:40,009
Walk softly, boys.

258
00:29:09,705 --> 00:29:11,290
What's our next move?

259
00:29:11,707 --> 00:29:14,293
I figure Agua Verde is the closest.

260
00:29:15,127 --> 00:29:16,587
Three days, maybe.

261
00:29:17,004 --> 00:29:19,507
We'll get the news and drift to the border.

262
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,551
Maybe a payroll, maybe a bank.

263
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:24,720
Maybe that damn railroad!

264
00:29:24,887 --> 00:29:28,807
That damn railroad you're talking
about sure as hell ain't getting no easier.

265
00:29:28,974 --> 00:29:31,519
And you boys ain't getting
any younger, either.

266
00:29:32,478 --> 00:29:35,022
We gotta start thinking beyond our guns.

267
00:29:35,731 --> 00:29:37,650
Those days are closing fast.

268
00:29:45,699 --> 00:29:49,829
All your fancy planning and talking
damn near got us shot to pieces...

269
00:29:49,912 --> 00:29:52,540
over a few lousy bags of washers.

270
00:29:52,915 --> 00:29:56,836
Well, this was going to be me and Tector's
last job before we quit and headed south!

271
00:29:56,919 --> 00:29:59,922
We spent all our time and money
getting ready for this!

272
00:30:00,005 --> 00:30:02,967
You spent all your time and money
running whores in Hondo...

273
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:04,885
while I spent my stake setting it up!

274
00:30:13,936 --> 00:30:18,190
Hell, I should have been running whores
instead of stealing army horses!

275
00:30:19,191 --> 00:30:21,110
While you was doing all that planning...

276
00:30:21,193 --> 00:30:24,446
me and Tector was getting
our bell rope pulled by two...

277
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:26,866
two, mind you, Hondo whores!

278
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,873
And Pike was dreaming of washers!

279
00:30:34,456 --> 00:30:35,708
He was.

280
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:43,382
You were matching whores...

281
00:30:44,466 --> 00:30:45,885
in tandem!

282
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:48,804
What's that?

283
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,890
That's one behind the other.

284
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,062
That's right! That's what we was doing!

285
00:31:17,416 --> 00:31:18,667
Mr. Thornton?

286
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:25,049
You rode with Pike.

287
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:29,136
What kind of man are we up against?

288
00:31:29,261 --> 00:31:30,346
The best.

289
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:34,892
He never got caught.

290
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:03,796
This was going to be my last.

291
00:32:07,633 --> 00:32:09,718
Ain't getting around any better.

292
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,645
I'd like to make one good score
and back off.

293
00:32:21,063 --> 00:32:22,481
Back off to what?

294
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:38,455
Have you got anything lined up?

295
00:32:42,334 --> 00:32:45,921
Pershing's got troops spread out
all along the border.

296
00:32:46,922 --> 00:32:50,176
Every one of those garrisons
are gonna be getting a payroll.

297
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:55,181
That kind of information is kind of hard
to come by.

298
00:32:55,347 --> 00:32:58,517
I didn't say it's going to be easy,
but it can be done.

299
00:33:01,103 --> 00:33:02,813
He'll be waiting for us.

300
00:33:05,357 --> 00:33:07,526
I wouldn't have it any other way.

301
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:22,541
Come on, Pike, let's go.

302
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:25,711
You sound like you're all caught up.

303
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:28,547
Caught up enough to know
we've overstayed our welcome.

304
00:33:28,714 --> 00:33:30,549
What the hell's the matter with you?

305
00:33:30,716 --> 00:33:34,136
We've got plenty of money to spend,
and not a worry in the world.

306
00:33:34,386 --> 00:33:37,306
They're not going to look for us
in their own backyard.

307
00:33:37,389 --> 00:33:39,308
How can you be so damn sure?

308
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:42,019
Being sure is my business.

309
00:33:42,394 --> 00:33:44,522
<i>Being sure is my business.</i>

310
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:50,402
-Hold it!
-Relax.

311
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:52,738
It's just some champagne we ordered.

312
00:33:53,989 --> 00:33:56,575
<i>Relax. It's just some champagne</i>
<i>we ordered.</i>

313
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:00,037
<i>Being sure is my business.</i>

314
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,299
Did you get him?

315
00:34:12,424 --> 00:34:14,009
<i>No, the bastard got away.</i>

316
00:34:16,595 --> 00:34:19,014
Damn, you sure must have hurt
that railroad.

317
00:34:20,432 --> 00:34:23,102
They spent a lot of money
setting up that ambush.

318
00:34:23,185 --> 00:34:24,812
I caught up with them.

319
00:34:25,604 --> 00:34:27,273
Two or three times.

320
00:34:27,606 --> 00:34:29,358
There was a man named Harrigan.

321
00:34:29,441 --> 00:34:31,819
He used to have a way of doing things.

322
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,697
I made him change his ways.

323
00:34:35,781 --> 00:34:37,616
And a hell of a lot of people...

324
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,119
that just can't stand to be wrong.

325
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:42,705
Pride.

326
00:34:43,038 --> 00:34:44,790
And they can't forget it.

327
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:47,835
That pride, being wrong, or learn by it.

328
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:57,553
How about us, Pike?

329
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,389
You reckon we learned...

330
00:35:00,472 --> 00:35:02,057
being wrong today?

331
00:35:04,476 --> 00:35:06,604
I sure hope to God we did.

332
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:26,749
Them's hot.

333
00:35:31,545 --> 00:35:32,713
Damn!

334
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:39,094
Where in the hell did you ever find him?

335
00:35:39,261 --> 00:35:41,263
He used to run with Thornton and me.

336
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,266
Did his share of killing, and more.

337
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,768
Around Langtry.

338
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:51,148
Yeah, only now he does his killing
with a coffee cup.

339
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,803
Pike...

340
00:36:23,722 --> 00:36:26,225
I wouldn't have it any other way either.

341
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,586
Watch out, boys!

342
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,671
Go on, easy.

343
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,055
Watch it, Tector!

344
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:16,942
That goddamned son of a bitch!

345
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,197
Get those horses up!

346
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,199
What the hell is going...

347
00:37:24,783 --> 00:37:26,911
Damned old punk! Bastard!

348
00:37:27,786 --> 00:37:30,539
Get up now! Get up there, goddamn it!

349
00:37:36,795 --> 00:37:38,672
Get over here!

350
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:43,260
What in the hell's the matter with you,
old man?

351
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,137
Leave him alone!

352
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:49,767
He's going to get us all killed!
I'm going to get rid of him.

353
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:53,896
You're not getting rid of anybody! We're
gonna stick together, like it used to be.

354
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,106
When you side with a man,
you stay with him.

355
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,484
And if you can't do that,
you're like some animal!

356
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,236
You're finished!

357
00:38:00,402 --> 00:38:02,571
We're finished! All of us!

358
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:10,746
Mount up.

359
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:33,686
Appears Brother Pike needs help,
Brother Lyle.

360
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,980
That Brother Pike and the old man Sykes...

361
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:37,982
makes a man wonder if it ain't time...

362
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:40,734
to pick up his chips
and find another game.

363
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,121
How in the hell are you going
to side anybody...

364
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:54,123
when you can't even get on your horse?

365
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:29,927
That was a mighty fine talk you gave the
boys back there about sticking together.

366
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,599
That Gorch came near killing me.

367
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:36,851
Or me him.

368
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:41,188
Damned old fool like me's
not worth taking along!

369
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:44,942
-We started together, we'll end it together.
-By God, that's the way I see it.

370
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:47,611
That's the way it's always been with me.

371
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,948
Sorry about Deke.

372
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,075
I never figured him that way.

373
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,121
Say, back there in Starbuck...

374
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:58,873
how did my boy do?

375
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:01,876
Your boy?

376
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,377
Crazy Lee?

377
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,504
Yes, C.L., Clarence Lee.

378
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,883
My daughter's boy.
Not too bright, but a good boy.

379
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:11,385
I kill them now? I kill them now?

380
00:41:12,469 --> 00:41:14,388
No, you just hold them here.

381
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,348
<i>Hold them here.</i>

382
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,727
Why didn't you tell me
he was your grandson?

383
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,897
You had enough things on your mind.

384
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:27,693
Besides, he had to pull his own weight
just like the rest of us.

385
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:32,781
I just wanted to make sure he didn't
let you down, run, when things got hot.

386
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,952
No, he did fine.

387
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,163
Just fine.

388
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:11,946
All clear!

389
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,583
From here on it's Mexico, Mr. Thornton.

390
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:28,337
What's the closest town of any size?

391
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:30,965
Agua Verde.

392
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,051
What's in Agua Verde?

393
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,053
Mexicans, what else?

394
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:43,394
A headquarters for regulars
fighting against Villa.

395
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:45,229
Mapache territory.

396
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,067
Don't we follow?

397
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,944
No, we go back and wait.

398
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,782
-Damn it! Go find...
-Shut up!

399
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:01,078
Why in the hell won't you tell your folks
to feed them dogs?

400
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:05,583
Won't find very much around here.
That damn Huerta's scraped it clean.

401
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:08,836
I have invited you to my village,
to my home.

402
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:11,922
Any disrespect to my family
or to my people...

403
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,507
I will kill you.

404
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:16,051
Ashamed of having us meet your people?

405
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:19,847
Yes. They don't know about
my life when I leave the village.

406
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,682
-You got a sister?
-Yes.

407
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:24,268
I'd be proud to make her acquaintance.

408
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,353
And that of your mama too.

409
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,898
That goes for your grandma too, sonny.

410
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:51,837
How bad did they hit you?

411
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:55,007
Seven of the villagers were killed.
Two of them hung.

412
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,760
Our horses, cattle and corn, stolen.

413
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:01,472
What about the federal troops?
Didn't they give you any protection?

414
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:03,724
They were federal troops...

415
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,477
commissioned by the traitor, Huerta.

416
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:09,146
And the soldier who shot my father?

417
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,689
What was his name?

418
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:14,401
-What the hell difference does it make?
-Your father died like a man.

419
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:17,613
Names in this matter
do not have any importance.

420
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:19,281
How was he called?

421
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:21,951
Mapache.

422
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:23,994
That is name enough.

423
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:27,665
In Mexico, <i>señor...</i>

424
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:30,751
these are the years of sadness.

425
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,336
But if we had...

426
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,630
rifles like these...

427
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:38,259
And Teresa? Did they molest her?

428
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:44,515
She went with them
because she wished to.

429
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:47,434
She became the woman of Mapache...

430
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:50,604
and the others.
She went with them, laughing.

431
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,357
Drunk with wine and love.

432
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:59,530
To him, Teresa was like a goddess,
to be worshipped from afar.

433
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,533
I tell you, she was a mango...

434
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,285
ripe and waiting.

435
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:07,705
Angel dreams of love
and Mapache eats the mango.

436
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,209
That's a good trick.

437
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,641
Now that I find hard to believe.

438
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:31,228
Not so hard.

439
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:34,732
We all dream of being a child again.

440
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,067
Even the worst of us.

441
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:43,324
Perhaps the worst most of all.

442
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:47,161
You know what we are, then?

443
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:50,206
Yes, just so, the both of you!

444
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:52,166
And you!

445
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:00,382
Where is Mapache?

446
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:11,352
All right, Pike? All right?

447
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:17,525
Tector, let's swap!

448
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:19,527
Come on, let's swap!

449
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,962
You must tell me. Where is Mapache?

450
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,090
Why do you wish to know?

451
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:42,925
For your father?

452
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,802
Or the whore?

453
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:54,144
Either you learn to live with it
or we'll leave you here.

454
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:02,653
I go with you, <i>Jefe.</i>

455
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,686
You know what I'm going to do?
I'm gonna steal his girl.

456
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,313
You are?

457
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:39,607
Here I go.

458
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:44,361
Dutch, I'm cutting in.

459
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:46,155
Come on, lady!

460
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,317
No <i>gringos?</i>

461
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,945
Only <i>federales.</i>

462
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,585
All soldiers.

463
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,587
Not a bounty hunter in sight.

464
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:48,731
Now, what in the hell is that?

465
00:52:18,928 --> 00:52:21,305
I saw one just like it in Waco.

466
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,474
Run on steam?

467
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:25,434
No, on alcohol or gasoline.

468
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:27,186
Hey, Pike, you know what I hear?

469
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:30,981
I hear they got one of those things
up north that can fly.

470
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:33,609
That was a balloon, you damned old fool.

471
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:35,402
No, the old man's right.

472
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:39,073
They've got motors and wings
and go 60 miles in less than an hour.

473
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:41,325
Going to use them in the war they say.

474
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:44,203
Well, let's go and talk to the General...

475
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:47,498
about his automobile
and our extra horses.

476
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,250
Nice and easy.

477
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:58,194
Probably talking about us
behind our backs.

478
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:03,699
I'm down to about twenty in silver.

479
00:54:03,908 --> 00:54:06,785
With the way the <i>Generalísimo's</i>
cleaned out this part of the country...

480
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:08,287
he ought to have a lot to spare.

481
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,164
<i>Generalísimo,</i> hell.

482
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:13,792
He's just another bandit
grabbing all he can for himself.

483
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:16,045
Like some others I could mention.

484
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:20,633
Not so as you'd know it, Mr. Bishop.

485
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:24,845
We ain't nothing like him.
We don't hang nobody.

486
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:30,059
I hope someday
these people here kick him...

487
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:32,978
and the rest of the scum like him
right into their graves.

488
00:54:33,062 --> 00:54:34,146
We will.

489
00:54:36,232 --> 00:54:37,900
If it takes forever!

490
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:18,816
Look here.

491
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:27,825
Pretty good-looking old pony, ain't he?

492
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:38,085
Boy, do you know them beauties?

493
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:22,546
Come on.

494
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:26,717
-She was my woman.
-I know.

495
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:50,074
Sure ain't your woman no more.

496
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:56,956
Just look at her licking
inside that general's ear.

497
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:32,324
Why did he try to kill His Excellency?

498
00:57:33,284 --> 00:57:36,912
He didn't try to kill His Excellency.
He was after the girl.

499
00:57:41,834 --> 00:57:44,879
He went a little crazy
when he saw her with you.

500
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:01,937
Are you men associated
with the American Army?

501
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:08,152
No, we're not associated with anybody.

502
00:58:10,196 --> 00:58:11,405
I see.

503
00:58:11,864 --> 00:58:16,035
I was curious about the equipment
which you are carrying. That pistol...

504
00:58:16,202 --> 00:58:19,330
is restricted for the use
of army personnel.

505
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:22,750
It can't be purchased or even owned...

506
00:58:22,917 --> 00:58:24,084
legally.

507
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:27,379
-Is that so?
-Weapons are a specialty of mine.

508
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:31,634
I am Commander Frederick Mohr
of the Imperial German Army.

509
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:36,972
It would be very useful for us
if we knew of some Americans...

510
00:58:37,097 --> 00:58:40,851
who did not share their
government's naive sentiments.

511
00:58:42,061 --> 00:58:44,939
Well, we share very few sentiments
with our government.

512
00:58:50,611 --> 00:58:52,571
He's asking us to have a drink with him.

513
00:58:56,784 --> 00:58:57,868
Good.

514
00:59:18,097 --> 00:59:19,223
Shoot him.

515
00:59:31,652 --> 00:59:33,571
I gave it to him, T.C.

516
01:00:08,314 --> 01:00:11,275
-You mean here?
-No, no, not there!

517
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:21,452
Wait a minute, now,
what you going to do?

518
01:00:23,329 --> 01:00:25,831
We got to show a little class here.

519
01:00:46,644 --> 01:00:48,062
Right here!

520
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:50,773
It must be that garrison rail spur.

521
01:00:51,232 --> 01:00:55,194
I know it's the easiest to hit, but I gotta
figure some way to get it out of there.

522
01:00:56,904 --> 01:00:58,405
What do you think, Dutch?

523
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:00,741
Getting pretty close to home, ain't it?

524
01:01:01,242 --> 01:01:03,661
Look at them gathered around
that big table.

525
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:08,666
Here we sit like kitchen help.

526
01:01:08,749 --> 01:01:11,836
Why do you want us to hit a train
like that at the border?

527
01:01:11,919 --> 01:01:14,880
Can't the General just go up there
and take over the whole thing?

528
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:18,926
General Huerta is anxious to better
relations with the United States...

529
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:22,429
not to cross the border and destroy them.

530
01:01:23,264 --> 01:01:26,350
Usually these arms shipments
are kept pretty secret.

531
01:01:26,517 --> 01:01:28,185
How'd you find out about this one?

532
01:01:28,269 --> 01:01:30,396
Mapache has a superb intelligence force...

533
01:01:30,479 --> 01:01:33,023
organized under supervision
of my commanding officer.

534
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:36,861
Now, gentlemen,
we are quite well organized...

535
01:01:37,361 --> 01:01:39,655
and able to pay $10,000...

536
01:01:40,281 --> 01:01:41,699
in gold.

537
01:01:42,867 --> 01:01:46,453
Of course, if you're not able
to do the work, we'll find someone else.

538
01:01:46,537 --> 01:01:49,456
We can do it. It's just that we're
going to need special equipment.

539
01:01:49,874 --> 01:01:51,375
Do not worry.

540
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:54,879
Our accountant will
take care of everything.

541
01:01:58,048 --> 01:01:59,425
General...

542
01:01:59,967 --> 01:02:03,554
soon you will be the best-equipped
general in Mexico.

543
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:06,640
Well, look here...

544
01:02:07,808 --> 01:02:09,351
ain't he the one?

545
01:02:11,645 --> 01:02:12,855
To the host!

546
01:02:24,158 --> 01:02:27,077
With your permission, I need a bath.

547
01:02:27,161 --> 01:02:30,414
With my permission,
I think you all need a bath.

548
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:34,168
I don't need no bath!

549
01:02:35,252 --> 01:02:38,339
What me and Tector need is a couple
of them women you're hogging.

550
01:02:38,506 --> 01:02:40,799
You think you can fix that up for us?

551
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:48,766
Gentlemen, you will excuse me, I'm sure.

552
01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:50,518
I'm sure.

553
01:02:55,815 --> 01:02:58,025
-Herrera.
-Let's get Angel.

554
01:03:11,455 --> 01:03:13,457
<i>Por favor,</i> General, I need him.

555
01:03:13,541 --> 01:03:16,210
I'll give you someone
much better than that.

556
01:03:16,377 --> 01:03:19,380
If you don't mind, I'll make my own choice.

557
01:03:35,479 --> 01:03:36,856
All right.

558
01:03:37,231 --> 01:03:40,317
He is not important to me. Take him.

559
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,784
I think we're gonna get on the wagon now.

560
01:03:54,999 --> 01:03:57,251
Hey, here come our sweeties.

561
01:04:04,091 --> 01:04:05,843
Ain't them pretty?

562
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:08,554
I don't know about yours, Lyle, but...

563
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:11,098
I think I got more than I can handle.

564
01:04:21,692 --> 01:04:23,736
Hey, get out of there.

565
01:04:24,278 --> 01:04:26,447
You know what they told me?

566
01:04:27,281 --> 01:04:30,534
The dons of Spain built this
over 300 years ago.

567
01:04:31,702 --> 01:04:34,330
-Is that right?
-That's right.

568
01:04:34,955 --> 01:04:37,750
I tell you, Lyle, I'm all for them dons.

569
01:04:40,794 --> 01:04:42,630
Let's have a little target.

570
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:45,466
She ain't going to get away.
Turn her loose.

571
01:04:54,725 --> 01:04:56,018
Why not!

572
01:05:22,086 --> 01:05:24,421
Tector, look at them beauties!

573
01:05:52,283 --> 01:05:54,869
How in the hell can you stand it that hot?

574
01:05:55,536 --> 01:05:58,956
I'm going to build me one of these
some day and live in it.

575
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:06,380
Hell, Lyle, look here.

576
01:06:11,969 --> 01:06:15,097
Come on, sweetheart,
let me see your teatsies.

577
01:06:18,642 --> 01:06:21,729
I don't know why the hell
I didn't let them kill you.

578
01:06:21,812 --> 01:06:26,567
Listen, I'm not going to steal guns for
that devil to rob and kill my people again.

579
01:06:26,984 --> 01:06:29,111
Noble, noble. Very noble.

580
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:33,574
I didn't see no tears rolling down your
cheeks when you rode in from Starbuck.

581
01:06:33,741 --> 01:06:35,784
They were not my people.

582
01:06:36,577 --> 01:06:39,079
I care about my people, my village.

583
01:06:40,581 --> 01:06:44,251
Listen, boy, you ride with us,
your village don't count.

584
01:06:44,585 --> 01:06:46,670
If it does, you just don't go along.

585
01:06:47,171 --> 01:06:49,089
Then I don't go along.

586
01:06:49,423 --> 01:06:53,427
Angel, one load of guns ain't going
to stop them raiding villages.

587
01:06:54,303 --> 01:06:57,264
Why, you ought to be thinking about
all the money you're gonna have.

588
01:06:57,348 --> 01:06:59,934
Buy them a ranch. Move them 1,000 miles.

589
01:07:00,267 --> 01:07:02,853
-Buy them two or three ranches.
-One.

590
01:07:03,687 --> 01:07:05,356
A very small one.

591
01:07:05,606 --> 01:07:08,192
Don't you see? This is their land.

592
01:07:08,692 --> 01:07:10,945
No one is going to drive them away.

593
01:07:11,278 --> 01:07:13,364
I'll drink to that sentiment.

594
01:07:13,531 --> 01:07:14,990
And to love.

595
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:18,619
But most of all, I'll drink to gold!

596
01:07:35,135 --> 01:07:36,178
Angel.

597
01:07:37,054 --> 01:07:38,889
You're a pain in the ass.

598
01:07:39,306 --> 01:07:42,810
Would you give guns to someone
to kill your father...

599
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:45,229
or your mother, or your brother?

600
01:07:45,312 --> 01:07:48,774
Ten thousand cuts an awful lot
of family ties.

601
01:07:49,483 --> 01:07:51,485
My people have no guns.

602
01:07:53,154 --> 01:07:54,822
But with guns...

603
01:07:55,990 --> 01:07:57,741
my people could fight.

604
01:07:59,577 --> 01:08:01,287
If I could take guns...

605
01:08:01,912 --> 01:08:03,664
I would come with you.

606
01:08:03,831 --> 01:08:08,586
Say, how many cases of rifles
did Zamorra say was in that shipment?

607
01:08:08,669 --> 01:08:09,962
Sixteen.

608
01:08:10,254 --> 01:08:11,297
Well...

609
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:14,592
give him one.

610
01:08:26,604 --> 01:08:27,855
All right.

611
01:08:28,522 --> 01:08:33,152
One case and one case of ammo.
But you give up your share of the gold.

612
01:08:34,111 --> 01:08:35,196
I will.

613
01:08:35,529 --> 01:08:39,033
-We know you will.
-Sure glad we got that settled.

614
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:42,286
Why, you reprobate!

615
01:08:58,886 --> 01:09:00,137
Boys...

616
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,809
I want you to meet my fiancée.

617
01:09:07,728 --> 01:09:09,647
They just got engaged.

618
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:11,565
I'm a son of a bitch!

619
01:09:12,233 --> 01:09:14,068
Trot them on in, fellas.

620
01:09:14,985 --> 01:09:18,823
I'm hell on packing mules,
but I'm a delight with a pretty girl.

621
01:09:25,371 --> 01:09:28,833
You want to gamble everything
that this one shipment will be attacked?

622
01:09:28,916 --> 01:09:31,585
If they're in Agua Verde, they'll try for it.

623
01:09:31,669 --> 01:09:35,089
-If? What about Juarez?
-If he was, we would've heard about it.

624
01:09:35,172 --> 01:09:38,092
If they are in Agua Verde,
they will have seen Mapache.

625
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:39,927
And who in the hell is Mapache?

626
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:42,847
A killer for Huerta who
calls himself a general.

627
01:09:42,930 --> 01:09:44,849
He's been fighting Villa and losing.

628
01:09:44,932 --> 01:09:48,435
But with enough guns, he could become
a power in northern Mexico.

629
01:09:48,519 --> 01:09:50,688
My guess is,
Pike will try to get them for him.

630
01:09:50,771 --> 01:09:53,274
How can he? The train will be guarded
by regular troops.

631
01:09:53,357 --> 01:09:56,819
Not regular troops,
green recruits not worth a damn.

632
01:09:57,194 --> 01:09:59,822
I need 20 trained men, not recruits.

633
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:03,367
And not this
gutter trash you've given me.

634
01:10:04,952 --> 01:10:07,872
What you've got is 24 more days.

635
01:10:21,177 --> 01:10:24,221
Never told me how you got
all torn up like that.

636
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:26,891
I met a woman I wanted to marry.

637
01:10:44,033 --> 01:10:46,994
-Is your husband coming back?
-No.

638
01:10:47,369 --> 01:10:49,246
He's never coming back.

639
01:10:53,918 --> 01:10:55,544
But you are late.

640
01:10:56,212 --> 01:10:57,546
Two days late.

641
01:10:57,713 --> 01:10:59,173
<i>She had a husband.</i>

642
01:10:59,423 --> 01:11:01,884
If I'd had any sense, I'd have killed him.

643
01:11:04,553 --> 01:11:06,222
<i>He wasn't around.</i>

644
01:11:06,597 --> 01:11:08,182
<i>I got careless.</i>

645
01:11:09,225 --> 01:11:10,976
<i>One night, he walked in on us.</i>

646
01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:15,064
<i>Got her with the first shot,</i>
<i>and got me here with the second.</i>

647
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:17,441
<i>Then the damn coward turned and ran.</i>

648
01:11:38,587 --> 01:11:40,297
Ever catch up with him?

649
01:11:41,090 --> 01:11:44,969
No, but there isn't a day or an hour
that passes that I don't think about it.

650
01:11:46,136 --> 01:11:48,514
Come on, pretty! We've got a long way!

651
01:11:49,807 --> 01:11:52,143
This is our last go around, Dutch.

652
01:11:52,601 --> 01:11:54,728
This time, we do it right.

653
01:13:45,256 --> 01:13:46,715
Just do your work.

654
01:17:41,909 --> 01:17:43,077
Let's go!

655
01:18:14,775 --> 01:18:16,360
They're coming!

656
01:18:30,374 --> 01:18:31,792
They're coming!

657
01:18:32,793 --> 01:18:34,003
Faster!

658
01:18:50,144 --> 01:18:51,228
Get over!

659
01:20:16,355 --> 01:20:20,067
Get that ramp up!
Get that horse out of here!

660
01:20:20,359 --> 01:20:22,695
Bring them all out! Get them out!

661
01:20:23,028 --> 01:20:24,572
Get over here!

662
01:20:24,738 --> 01:20:28,284
Get them over here! Get those horses!

663
01:21:03,611 --> 01:21:04,695
Hurry up!

664
01:21:04,778 --> 01:21:06,322
Your horse kicked me.

665
01:21:06,405 --> 01:21:08,115
Run them up along here!

666
01:21:08,574 --> 01:21:10,409
Where the hell is my horse?

667
01:21:17,583 --> 01:21:19,293
Hey, we got grenades!

668
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:22,213
-Hurry up! We gotta get out of here!
-Be careful with this, boys!

669
01:21:22,421 --> 01:21:24,131
Let's go on this.

670
01:21:29,762 --> 01:21:30,971
Here we go.

671
01:21:33,641 --> 01:21:36,060
All right, line up in a column of twos!

672
01:21:37,311 --> 01:21:39,647
Corporal, give us a hand here!

673
01:21:41,357 --> 01:21:44,276
Hey, Pike, we're all ready!

674
01:22:32,324 --> 01:22:33,659
Let's go!

675
01:22:36,829 --> 01:22:37,955
Come on!

676
01:23:42,770 --> 01:23:44,313
Get after that horse!

677
01:23:44,396 --> 01:23:46,148
That was my horse!

678
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:48,067
Get after him!

679
01:23:49,693 --> 01:23:50,903
You men get out!

680
01:23:52,738 --> 01:23:55,157
Get that damn horse off my butt!

681
01:23:55,574 --> 01:23:57,993
Get those horses out of here!
The train's coming back!

682
01:23:58,077 --> 01:23:59,286
Train?

683
01:23:59,662 --> 01:24:01,664
-Where?
-What train?

684
01:24:01,747 --> 01:24:03,249
I don't see any train.

685
01:24:08,254 --> 01:24:10,756
Get the goddamn horse off my foot!

686
01:24:39,785 --> 01:24:43,038
Corporal, ride back to the telegraph
at Todos Malos...

687
01:24:43,205 --> 01:24:46,041
and tell the railroad deputies
they robbed the train...

688
01:24:46,125 --> 01:24:47,710
and we're in pursuit!

689
01:24:47,793 --> 01:24:49,044
Yes, sir!

690
01:24:54,550 --> 01:24:55,801
Come on!

691
01:25:52,691 --> 01:25:53,734
Dutch!

692
01:26:15,798 --> 01:26:17,383
Damn son of a...

693
01:26:18,717 --> 01:26:20,469
Come on! It's lit!

694
01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:32,648
Get them horses going!

695
01:26:52,418 --> 01:26:54,503
Don't shoot at the army, you idiots!

696
01:27:04,180 --> 01:27:05,473
Come on, Pike!

697
01:28:08,994 --> 01:28:10,329
Let's go!

698
01:28:15,167 --> 01:28:17,002
Come on, you lazy bastard!

699
01:28:17,169 --> 01:28:19,004
I'm coming, damn it!

700
01:28:36,355 --> 01:28:38,440
-Is it all right?
-Yep.

701
01:28:39,191 --> 01:28:41,193
Where are they supposed to meet us?

702
01:28:41,277 --> 01:28:43,112
Agua Verde or before.

703
01:28:43,279 --> 01:28:47,032
But when we do meet them,
don't expect any open arms.

704
01:28:47,366 --> 01:28:49,869
Least we won't have to worry
about Deke Thornton.

705
01:28:50,452 --> 01:28:54,498
Hell, no. Not after riding a half a case
of dynamite into the river.

706
01:28:54,707 --> 01:28:58,794
Don't expect him to stay there.
He'll be along and you know it.

707
01:31:15,598 --> 01:31:18,684
I sure would like to get hold
of that fool horse of mine.

708
01:31:18,851 --> 01:31:21,770
Some Mex kid's probably riding him home
right now.

709
01:31:21,937 --> 01:31:24,857
I don't see how I could've lost
both my boots.

710
01:31:25,524 --> 01:31:27,526
They always were hard as hell to get on.

711
01:31:27,610 --> 01:31:29,278
That damn river sucked them right off.

712
01:31:29,361 --> 01:31:31,447
That damn dynamite helped some.

713
01:31:31,614 --> 01:31:35,534
Maybe the same kid that's riding T.C.'s
horse is wearing your boots right now.

714
01:31:36,952 --> 01:31:38,704
You stupid bastards!

715
01:31:38,871 --> 01:31:41,040
Why did you fire at those soldiers?

716
01:31:41,624 --> 01:31:45,044
Huey started firing at them.
I even tried to stop him.

717
01:31:45,127 --> 01:31:47,838
-One of the bandits...
-Don't blame it on me!

718
01:31:47,922 --> 01:31:49,131
Liar!

719
01:31:49,298 --> 01:31:50,883
Shut your mouths!

720
01:31:51,592 --> 01:31:53,052
Are we going after them?

721
01:31:53,135 --> 01:31:55,805
We are,
unless you want to face a firing squad.

722
01:31:58,474 --> 01:32:00,017
Come on, T. C!

723
01:32:00,601 --> 01:32:02,394
Why the hell do we have to leave now?

724
01:32:02,812 --> 01:32:04,146
Besides, my hair's wet!

725
01:32:40,933 --> 01:32:43,853
Impossible! We have no arms
or ammunition.

726
01:33:49,418 --> 01:33:52,922
The <i>gringos</i> assaulted the train!
They got the guns.

727
01:33:56,425 --> 01:33:57,843
We must go!

728
01:33:59,345 --> 01:34:02,598
Take the necessary people
and take the road to Agua Verde.

729
01:34:02,681 --> 01:34:06,018
Convince the <i>gringos</i> to give you the guns.
I'll wait for you in the village.

730
01:34:06,101 --> 01:34:07,561
If the <i>gringos</i> refuse?

731
01:35:33,105 --> 01:35:34,940
He's still heading east.

732
01:35:37,485 --> 01:35:40,237
Are they bluffing,
or did they really miss it?

733
01:35:44,867 --> 01:35:48,245
I'd say they missed it. Here, take a look.

734
01:35:51,373 --> 01:35:53,042
There's only five left.

735
01:36:01,383 --> 01:36:04,303
-Hell, we lost them.
-I don't see how we lost them.

736
01:36:04,386 --> 01:36:07,515
Unless it was in the big valley
where the ground was hard.

737
01:36:07,598 --> 01:36:12,102
Wasn't but one way they could take
a wagon out of there, and this here is it.

738
01:36:12,269 --> 01:36:13,979
They didn't take it out.

739
01:36:14,271 --> 01:36:17,399
And we haven't lost them.
I could point to them right now.

740
01:36:17,566 --> 01:36:19,235
Sit still, damn it!

741
01:36:19,568 --> 01:36:22,321
You think Pike and old Sykes
haven't been watching us?

742
01:36:22,404 --> 01:36:25,074
They know what this is all about.
And what do I have?

743
01:36:25,407 --> 01:36:28,410
Nothing but you egg-sucking,
chicken-stealing gutter trash...

744
01:36:28,577 --> 01:36:30,871
with not even 60 rounds between you.

745
01:36:30,955 --> 01:36:32,623
We're after men.

746
01:36:33,123 --> 01:36:35,417
And I wish to God I was with them.

747
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:39,755
The next time you make a mistake,
I'm gonna ride off and let you die.

748
01:36:41,799 --> 01:36:42,883
Come on.

749
01:36:51,183 --> 01:36:54,186
I never figured they'd come down here
after us.

750
01:36:54,812 --> 01:36:56,605
How much you reckon we could be worth?

751
01:36:56,689 --> 01:36:58,691
Depends on how hungry they are.

752
01:37:02,987 --> 01:37:05,823
You better stay here
and look out for big hats.

753
01:37:05,990 --> 01:37:08,492
I'll go down and
start rigging the fireworks.

754
01:37:08,659 --> 01:37:09,827
All right.

755
01:37:12,913 --> 01:37:13,956
Angel...

756
01:37:14,790 --> 01:37:17,793
get that case of explosives
off the back there!

757
01:37:18,169 --> 01:37:19,211
Lyle...

758
01:37:20,004 --> 01:37:22,298
hand me down those blasting caps.

759
01:37:29,805 --> 01:37:32,224
What're you gonna do with the dynamite?

760
01:37:33,517 --> 01:37:37,438
I figure that damn general will try
to take this load without paying for it...

761
01:37:37,521 --> 01:37:39,565
and shoot us in the bargain.

762
01:37:40,566 --> 01:37:44,570
The only thing to change his mind
is if something happened to these guns.

763
01:37:44,653 --> 01:37:46,989
I'm gonna make sure
something could happen.

764
01:37:47,072 --> 01:37:49,200
Pike, take a look at this.

765
01:37:50,659 --> 01:37:52,203
Think you can handle that?

766
01:37:54,163 --> 01:37:57,249
What I don't know about,
I sure as hell am going to learn.

767
01:39:06,986 --> 01:39:09,155
My people are here for their guns.

768
01:39:14,577 --> 01:39:16,996
Where the hell were you when you were
supposed to be guarding us.

769
01:39:17,079 --> 01:39:19,623
I never heard them, didn't even see them.

770
01:39:33,429 --> 01:39:37,600
They apologize and ask you
to forgive them for their lack of trust.

771
01:39:38,184 --> 01:39:40,853
But only by caution do they remain alive.

772
01:39:46,275 --> 01:39:48,527
Tell them not to break that fuse.

773
01:39:51,113 --> 01:39:53,115
These people from your village?

774
01:39:53,199 --> 01:39:55,951
They are part of the village,
but not from it.

775
01:39:56,368 --> 01:40:00,456
They are <i>puro Indio</i> and these mountains
belong to them.

776
01:40:23,312 --> 01:40:26,398
I'd say those fellows know
how to handle themselves.

777
01:40:26,565 --> 01:40:30,402
They've been fighting Apaches
for 1,000 years. That's a sure way to learn.

778
01:40:30,569 --> 01:40:34,573
If they ever get armed, with good leaders,
this whole country will go up in smoke.

779
01:40:34,657 --> 01:40:37,159
That it will, son. That it will.

780
01:40:38,077 --> 01:40:40,913
They made damn fools out of us,
Mr. Bishop.

781
01:40:42,414 --> 01:40:45,584
Getting so a fella can't sleep
with both eyes closed...

782
01:40:45,668 --> 01:40:47,419
for fear of getting his throat cut.

783
01:40:47,503 --> 01:40:48,796
Where in the hell were you?

784
01:40:48,921 --> 01:40:50,589
Now, you listen to me, Lyle.

785
01:40:50,756 --> 01:40:53,175
If you got up off your ass and helped
once in a while...

786
01:40:53,259 --> 01:40:55,219
I wouldn't have got caught near so easy.

787
01:41:11,193 --> 01:41:14,738
With the new guns and ammunition,
this could never have happened.

788
01:41:40,890 --> 01:41:43,142
Swing your leaders wide, old man!

789
01:41:43,309 --> 01:41:44,852
Bring them on!

790
01:41:59,742 --> 01:42:01,243
Come on, horse!

791
01:42:15,090 --> 01:42:17,593
-Hold up!
-Whoa there!

792
01:42:20,095 --> 01:42:21,222
Mapache's?

793
01:42:21,764 --> 01:42:23,808
Let's just hope they don't belong to Villa.

794
01:42:37,363 --> 01:42:38,948
We are friends.

795
01:42:39,281 --> 01:42:41,367
We are from <i>el General Mapache.</i>

796
01:42:41,951 --> 01:42:43,786
Tell the one out in front
to come over here.

797
01:42:43,869 --> 01:42:45,079
Alone.

798
01:42:50,876 --> 01:42:52,336
I am coming.

799
01:42:52,711 --> 01:42:54,547
I am your friend, remember?

800
01:42:57,883 --> 01:43:00,344
We are friends. All of us.

801
01:43:01,637 --> 01:43:04,723
I bring you love and affection
from <i>el General.</i>

802
01:43:08,727 --> 01:43:10,980
You bring the guns with you?

803
01:43:13,983 --> 01:43:16,068
What bravery you have done!

804
01:43:17,069 --> 01:43:19,572
I am to escort you to the <i>General.</i>

805
01:43:21,407 --> 01:43:24,285
-Tell him to come closer.
-I hear.

806
01:43:25,244 --> 01:43:27,246
I am coming, my friend.

807
01:43:31,167 --> 01:43:32,460
You know what this is?

808
01:43:41,427 --> 01:43:44,722
Any trouble, no guns for the General.

809
01:43:51,270 --> 01:43:52,688
Very smart!

810
01:43:52,938 --> 01:43:55,733
That's very smart for you damn
<i>gringos.</i>

811
01:43:56,358 --> 01:43:58,194
So nobody can rob the guns.

812
01:43:58,944 --> 01:44:00,112
Nobody.

813
01:44:00,362 --> 01:44:03,866
I am not afraid. They are not afraid.

814
01:44:04,033 --> 01:44:08,120
You blow up the wagon, you die.
Or we kill you pretty soon.

815
01:44:08,871 --> 01:44:11,916
-But we are <i>amigos.</i>
-Show them, boys.

816
01:44:24,970 --> 01:44:26,722
Start the ball, Tector.

817
01:44:36,148 --> 01:44:38,275
Please, cut the fuse.

818
01:44:43,989 --> 01:44:45,115
Please.

819
01:45:19,942 --> 01:45:23,112
<i>El General</i> waits in Agua Verde
to meet with you.

820
01:45:23,279 --> 01:45:26,782
Tell the General one of us
will be there to trade tomorrow.

821
01:45:27,533 --> 01:45:30,244
Any trouble, no guns.

822
01:45:44,842 --> 01:45:46,760
Damn <i>gringos!</i>

823
01:46:22,338 --> 01:46:24,882
Get them up there, Freddie!
Pull them over!

824
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:02,670
You bring the guns?

825
01:47:02,962 --> 01:47:04,964
Don't worry, we've got them.

826
01:47:05,714 --> 01:47:06,799
Hidden.

827
01:47:08,968 --> 01:47:12,304
When I get my share of the gold,
$2,500 worth...

828
01:47:12,471 --> 01:47:14,807
I'll tell you where four cases are.

829
01:47:16,142 --> 01:47:18,811
The others are waiting for me
back at the wagon.

830
01:47:19,145 --> 01:47:22,022
If I don't show up pretty quick,
they'll blow it.

831
01:47:22,398 --> 01:47:26,026
You fix it goddamn good, no?
You fooled me.

832
01:47:27,653 --> 01:47:30,531
Our accountant will pay you immediately.

833
01:47:31,907 --> 01:47:33,576
When do we get our guns?

834
01:47:33,742 --> 01:47:37,079
The quicker I get back,
the quicker you get the next load.

835
01:47:41,250 --> 01:47:42,501
Open it up.

836
01:47:54,597 --> 01:47:57,016
Up the arroyo, about two miles...

837
01:47:57,183 --> 01:47:59,602
you'll find three cases of rifles...

838
01:47:59,852 --> 01:48:02,730
and one case of ammunition
hidden in the bush behind them.

839
01:48:10,529 --> 01:48:12,823
I understand you have a machine gun.

840
01:48:15,367 --> 01:48:18,370
Our contract called for 16 cases of rifles...

841
01:48:18,537 --> 01:48:20,873
and ammunition for $10,000.

842
01:48:21,165 --> 01:48:22,833
Not a machine gun.

843
01:48:26,337 --> 01:48:28,547
That's our present to the General.

844
01:48:31,175 --> 01:48:33,552
<i>Gringo,</i> you fight with Mapache...

845
01:48:38,057 --> 01:48:39,600
I'll think about it.

846
01:48:41,393 --> 01:48:43,729
In case he don't find them...

847
01:48:44,146 --> 01:48:47,024
Go. I trust him.

848
01:49:12,716 --> 01:49:16,345
-Why the hell don't you stir up some grub?
-Why don't you go to hell?

849
01:49:29,942 --> 01:49:31,110
Shit!

850
01:49:33,445 --> 01:49:34,613
Damn it!

851
01:49:36,115 --> 01:49:39,201
Damn it, Pike must've found you
under a rock.

852
01:49:39,952 --> 01:49:41,412
You gonna whip me?

853
01:49:41,912 --> 01:49:42,955
Nope.

854
01:49:43,122 --> 01:49:45,958
But you better just hope
I don't get riled enough...

855
01:49:46,125 --> 01:49:48,544
to start dogging you when this is over.

856
01:49:48,919 --> 01:49:52,256
You're not going to get a chance
to dry gulch me, old man.

857
01:49:52,590 --> 01:49:53,966
We'll see.

858
01:49:55,092 --> 01:49:56,302
We'll see.

859
01:49:57,761 --> 01:49:59,305
Pike's coming!

860
01:50:05,102 --> 01:50:07,354
He's got it. Carrying gold.

861
01:50:09,482 --> 01:50:10,941
Any trouble?

862
01:50:11,108 --> 01:50:13,110
Just from carrying this weight.

863
01:50:15,154 --> 01:50:17,531
-Pike, I want to go next.
-All right.

864
01:50:17,615 --> 01:50:20,743
You and your brother take the next load,
along with the machine gun.

865
01:50:20,826 --> 01:50:25,122
Then Angel and Dutch. Freddie,
you follow and pick up the pack horses.

866
01:50:32,463 --> 01:50:35,549
It must be mounted on a tripod!

867
01:50:36,967 --> 01:50:40,638
It must be mounted on a tripod!

868
01:51:04,203 --> 01:51:05,788
Crazy bastards!

869
01:52:23,949 --> 01:52:25,826
Put it on the tripod!

870
01:52:48,599 --> 01:52:51,185
We brought the last of it, General.

871
01:53:11,205 --> 01:53:13,707
At the head of the arroyo,
in the wagon.

872
01:53:22,174 --> 01:53:24,552
You can have the wagon,
we'll take the horses.

873
01:53:27,179 --> 01:53:29,849
How many cases did you take
from the train?

874
01:53:30,641 --> 01:53:33,978
Sixteen cases of rifles.
We lost one on the trail.

875
01:53:34,687 --> 01:53:36,063
He stole it.

876
01:53:36,856 --> 01:53:39,525
The mother of the girl
he killed told me so.

877
01:54:39,126 --> 01:54:41,045
Well, I'm wasting time here.

878
01:54:50,971 --> 01:54:53,224
He's a thief. You take care of him.

879
01:55:50,322 --> 01:55:52,074
Well, he had guts.

880
01:55:52,867 --> 01:55:54,702
We're just lucky he didn't talk.

881
01:55:55,161 --> 01:55:57,830
He played his string right out to the end.

882
01:56:05,671 --> 01:56:09,592
Her own mama turned him in
like some kind of a Judas.

883
01:56:09,675 --> 01:56:11,635
Sykes says we ought to go after him.

884
01:56:11,719 --> 01:56:15,055
How in the hell are we gonna do that?
They got guns and 200 men.

885
01:56:16,182 --> 01:56:17,433
No way.

886
01:56:18,184 --> 01:56:19,727
No way at all.

887
01:56:20,853 --> 01:56:22,354
Is that Sykes?

888
01:56:48,589 --> 01:56:49,882
Mapache!

889
01:56:53,427 --> 01:56:54,512
Thornton.

890
01:56:59,099 --> 01:57:00,434
I got him.

891
01:57:04,271 --> 01:57:05,689
They got Freddie.

892
01:57:07,441 --> 01:57:09,151
Looks like he's hit pretty bad.

893
01:57:09,235 --> 01:57:11,403
Damn that Deke Thornton to hell!

894
01:57:11,946 --> 01:57:14,824
What would you do in his place?
He gave his word.

895
01:57:14,907 --> 01:57:17,034
Gave his word to a railroad.

896
01:57:17,118 --> 01:57:18,285
It's his word!

897
01:57:18,369 --> 01:57:21,622
That ain't what counts!
It's who you give it to!

898
01:57:28,462 --> 01:57:30,923
We can stay up here
and kick hell out of them!

899
01:57:31,006 --> 01:57:32,508
That's what we can do.

900
01:57:36,137 --> 01:57:38,180
No, we're running short of water.

901
01:57:39,140 --> 01:57:40,933
Make a run for the border?

902
01:57:42,810 --> 01:57:46,021
They'd follow us every step of the way.
I know Thornton.

903
01:57:46,605 --> 01:57:48,607
I'm tired of being hunted.

904
01:57:49,817 --> 01:57:53,445
Let's go back to Agua Verde.
Let the General take care of those boys.

905
01:57:54,780 --> 01:57:56,031
You're crazy.

906
01:57:57,950 --> 01:58:00,578
That general would just as soon kill us
as break wind.

907
01:58:00,786 --> 01:58:02,580
He's so tickled with those guns...

908
01:58:02,663 --> 01:58:05,499
he'll be celebrating for a week
and happy to do us a favor.

909
01:58:05,833 --> 01:58:08,169
Thornton's not gonna follow us in there.

910
01:58:09,336 --> 01:58:11,589
While they're busy picking over Freddie...

911
01:58:11,672 --> 01:58:14,675
we'll find a back trail off this mountain
and head for town.

912
01:58:18,179 --> 01:58:19,847
What about our gold?

913
01:58:27,313 --> 01:58:29,815
We'll take one sack to pay our way.

914
01:58:30,649 --> 01:58:31,901
Bury the rest.

915
01:58:35,488 --> 01:58:36,655
Together.

916
01:58:56,008 --> 01:58:57,259
Look out!

917
01:59:04,767 --> 01:59:07,686
Lots of blood, then it stops. No track.

918
01:59:08,103 --> 01:59:12,066
-$10 says he's dead by now.
-Take us a day to find him if he is.

919
01:59:12,775 --> 01:59:15,110
If he isn't, he has a gun on us right now.

920
01:59:20,115 --> 01:59:21,617
Let's go after the others.

921
01:59:21,700 --> 01:59:24,370
Just leave him here? He's worth money.

922
01:59:25,121 --> 01:59:28,290
Yes, you ride out tomorrow,
that is if you can stay on your horse...

923
01:59:28,374 --> 01:59:31,043
and watch the buzzards.
They'll show you where he is.

924
01:59:31,127 --> 01:59:32,753
What if he ain't dead, Mr. Thornton?

925
01:59:33,462 --> 01:59:35,965
That's your problem. Let's go!

926
02:01:08,224 --> 02:01:11,644
-God, I hate to see that.
-No more than I do.

927
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,837
Welcome, <i>amigos!</i>
You come for your friend, no?

928
02:01:48,180 --> 02:01:49,849
I want to buy him back.

929
02:01:54,937 --> 02:01:57,523
I don't think he looks worth too much.

930
02:02:04,446 --> 02:02:06,448
I don't think he's going to live too long.

931
02:02:06,699 --> 02:02:08,701
I'll give you half of my share for him.

932
02:02:08,784 --> 02:02:12,288
I need no gold and I don't sell this one.

933
02:02:12,371 --> 02:02:14,206
Why not? You've had your fun with him.

934
02:02:14,290 --> 02:02:16,876
<i>El Generalísimo's</i>
happy with the guns.

935
02:02:17,460 --> 02:02:19,378
Why don't you go and get a drink?

936
02:02:19,545 --> 02:02:22,298
Enjoy yourself.
There are women everywhere.

937
02:02:26,886 --> 02:02:29,221
Don't be foolish and change his mood.

938
02:03:11,764 --> 02:03:13,349
Son of a bitch!

939
02:03:25,945 --> 02:03:27,238
Why not?

940
02:03:42,128 --> 02:03:43,796
There ain't nobody here!

941
02:03:43,879 --> 02:03:47,258
There's wagon tracks
and somebody was here!

942
02:03:47,341 --> 02:03:49,093
They sure as hell ain't here now!

943
02:03:55,391 --> 02:03:56,851
Army patrol!

944
02:03:57,726 --> 02:03:59,061
Coming this way!

945
02:06:33,966 --> 02:06:35,885
You said <i>dos</i> for two!

946
02:06:35,968 --> 02:06:38,220
Here's your <i>dos</i> and one to grow on.

947
02:06:38,387 --> 02:06:40,806
That's all you're gonna get out of me.

948
02:07:13,005 --> 02:07:14,340
Let's go.

949
02:07:25,768 --> 02:07:27,061
Why not?

950
02:11:11,952 --> 02:11:13,370
What do you want?

951
02:11:18,459 --> 02:11:19,794
We want Angel.

952
02:11:21,670 --> 02:11:26,509
You want Angel, no? All right.
I'm going to give him to you.

953
02:15:29,293 --> 02:15:30,419
Bitch!

954
02:15:54,860 --> 02:15:56,529
Come on, you lazy bastard!

955
02:16:32,648 --> 02:16:34,525
Give them hell, Pike!

956
02:16:41,157 --> 02:16:42,491
No, Pike!

957
02:16:46,787 --> 02:16:47,830
Pike.

958
02:16:54,170 --> 02:16:55,212
Pike.

959
02:17:37,797 --> 02:17:39,215
Look at them.

960
02:17:39,965 --> 02:17:41,842
-Come on.
-I'm coming.

961
02:17:43,677 --> 02:17:44,720
Wait for me!

962
02:17:44,804 --> 02:17:47,640
-Come on, let's get all the guns.
-This is fine!

963
02:17:48,057 --> 02:17:50,559
This is just like a big old picnic!

964
02:17:50,810 --> 02:17:52,728
Here's a rifle for you.

965
02:18:21,924 --> 02:18:23,425
He's got a gun.

966
02:18:25,928 --> 02:18:28,764
T.C., it's them!

967
02:18:30,516 --> 02:18:32,351
It's the Gorches!

968
02:18:33,102 --> 02:18:34,937
Get up there, Coffer. Come on.

969
02:18:35,020 --> 02:18:37,648
Mr. Thornton, it's them.

970
02:18:38,357 --> 02:18:39,775
It is them.

971
02:18:43,362 --> 02:18:46,532
Here's a boy's got some gold in his teeth.
Let me see your knife.

972
02:18:46,699 --> 02:18:48,784
-Here.
-Let me see your knife!

973
02:18:48,868 --> 02:18:49,910
Mr. Thornton.

974
02:18:52,788 --> 02:18:54,248
Should we load up?

975
02:18:55,207 --> 02:18:57,376
Are we going to wait for Jess
or meet him on the way?

976
02:18:57,543 --> 02:19:01,797
If he's waiting for them buzzards to lead
him to old Sykes, he's got a long wait.

977
02:19:01,881 --> 02:19:03,591
Look! We got them all.

978
02:19:03,799 --> 02:19:06,635
T.C., there he is.

979
02:19:06,719 --> 02:19:08,137
There's Pike.

980
02:19:08,471 --> 02:19:11,724
There, you ain't so damned much now,
are you, Mr. Pike?

981
02:19:19,315 --> 02:19:20,816
You ain't coming?

982
02:19:23,360 --> 02:19:24,403
No.

983
02:19:27,490 --> 02:19:29,492
Maybe we ought to wait here for Jess.

984
02:19:31,076 --> 02:19:33,329
No, we pick him up on the way.

985
02:19:33,496 --> 02:19:35,414
I want to get out of this damn place.

986
02:19:35,498 --> 02:19:38,584
Anyway, these boys'll start
going ripe on us by tomorrow.

987
02:19:38,667 --> 02:19:40,169
We got to move.

988
02:19:43,422 --> 02:19:46,425
<i>I went to the river</i>
<i>and I couldn't get across</i>

989
02:19:46,592 --> 02:19:49,386
<i>Singing 'polly wolly
doodle'all the day</i>

990
02:19:49,678 --> 02:19:52,765
<i>I jumped on a buzzard 'cause</i>
<i>I thought he was a horse</i>

991
02:19:52,932 --> 02:19:55,601
<i>Singing 'polly wolly
doodle'all the day</i>

992
02:19:55,768 --> 02:19:57,353
<i>Fare thee well</i>

993
02:21:29,278 --> 02:21:32,198
-Didn't expect to find you here.
-Why not?

994
02:21:32,865 --> 02:21:34,450
I sent them back.

995
02:21:35,117 --> 02:21:38,954
-That's all I said I'd do.
-They didn't get very far.

996
02:21:39,288 --> 02:21:40,414
I figured.

997
02:21:44,126 --> 02:21:45,961
What are your plans?

998
02:21:47,046 --> 02:21:50,424
Drift around down here.
Try to stay out of jail.

999
02:21:51,801 --> 02:21:54,220
Well, me and the boys here...

1000
02:21:55,387 --> 02:21:56,847
we got some work to do.

1001
02:22:01,310 --> 02:22:02,561
You want to come along?

1002
02:22:04,730 --> 02:22:08,400
Ain't like it used to be, but it'll do.

1003
02:24:46,851 --> 02:24:48,185
English
