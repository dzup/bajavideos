1
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,800
-How fast?
-4:32. Incredible!

2
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,800
Another record
before I leave!

3
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,040
Keep the stopwatch
I don't need it.

4
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:07,000
Speech ! Speech !

5
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,000
Where is my little Daniel?

6
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,040
As you all know
Daniel resigned last night

7
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,040
He quits the 2 wheelers
for the 4 wheelers

8
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,840
He follows the reverse human evolution
that starts on all fours,...

9
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,840
...and finishes on its 2 wheels !

10
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,040
I want him to know
he was the best of all of us,...

11
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,040
...and most of all,
a very good friend.

12
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,560
You going be missed by all of us you know.

13
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,040
Excuse me lily, was that a kiss?
Or did your lips just slip?

14
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,080
It's not that I didn't like it
but I don't know what to think anymore.

15
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,960
Is it clearer now?

16
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,960
Yep.

17
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,120
Because if it slipped again,
you must be really clumsy.

18
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,120
And now to celebrate
Daniel's departure...

19
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,960
...I announce the big parade!

20
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,160
Open your eyes wide , Lily,
because you won't see this again in your life.

21
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
-How many are there?
-A lot.

22
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,160
These are the best.

23
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,120
Go for it!

24
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Holy shit!

25
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,200
Excellent!

26
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,160
-So having a little party?
-Are they from the pizzeria?

27
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,200
-Pizza cops. -Sorry but
we would like to see your papers.

28
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,200
I'm sorry we left them inside
if you want we can go get them now.

29
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,200
-Ok but make it fast.
-No problem, thanks. Let's run!.

30
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,240
It must have been 5 minutes now.

31
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,280
-Watch out there could be some oil.
-Oil?

32
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,280
Yeah, it's my apartment
but it's also kind of a garage.

33
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,280
I hope that...

34
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,240
Hmm, it's ...different.

35
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,960
-Daniel.
-Yes?

36
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,120
We've known each other
for two years now.

37
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,240
why did you wait until the day you quit
to show me your apartment?

38
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,280
-I take a long time
to decide. -And what made you decide?

39
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,280
Your cleavage.

40
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,280
It's nice, eh?

41
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,280
The dress is brand new.

42
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,280
Ok then
we'll try not to damage it.

43
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,280
Are you sure it's okay
after all these years of friendship?

44
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,280
We prepared the ground well,
it's time to build on it.

45
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,280
-Maybe we could wait a little bit more.
-No, If I wait more,...

46
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,120
...I'm worried that you'll take it badly
and I don't want to be rude.

47
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,280
-Oh, no.
-What?

48
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,320
-It's 6 o'clock.
-But it's Saturday.

49
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,320
-Yes, but I have to go to work.
-What?

50
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,080
You just stopped working last night,
you didn't find a job during the night, did you?

51
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,320
No, it's for my future job...

52
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,320
...a kind of meeting I booked
a long time ago.

53
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,120
I thought you were waiting for our meeting
for a long time.

54
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,320
Yes, a long time plus an hour.
And when I say 1 hour, that's the maximum.

55
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,320
Hey blue, you take a number over there.

56
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,320
Don't forget
your photos next time. 77!

57
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,360
247. It's not even close to my number.

58
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,320
-How long have you been a driver?
-25 years yesterday.

59
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,360
I'm retired since this morning.

60
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,360
It's the first morning I can my newspaper
calmly in the last 25 years.

61
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,200
Ah I see.

62
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,360
wake up number 247!

63
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,360
I'm here!

64
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,400
Your paper, 2 pictures...
sign here... and here.

65
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,400
Professional Licence,
traffic certificate,...

66
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:20,320
...acquisition autorisation ,
the notebook, the plates and the sign.

67
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,400
-That's all?
-Yes.

68
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,400
-Nothing more after 6 years?
-You want me to sing the national anthem?

69
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,400
No, not really but
a smile would have been nice.

70
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,440
248!

71
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,280
Lily!

72
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,480
It's 12:00, I went
to buy some croissants...

73
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,480
...and in the meantime I married
the baker.

74
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,480
Goodbye and so long.

75
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,440
Congratulations, Mr. Daniel.
You're welcome.

76
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,480
No, we insist.
Ok then...

77
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,520
-Hi, Daniel!
-Hey, Paulo!

78
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,480
-You're in the tourism business now?
-Yes.

79
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,520
Your party was great
we drank like crazy.

80
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,560
-Yep, was great. But your bike sounds weird, is it ok?
-What's wrong?

81
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,520
It’s making a weird noise?
Is it working ok?

82
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,520
Huh?
I use super-unleaded.

83
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,520
I just outran 2 cops, you should have seen it.

84
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,480
Ok I'll tell you, 2 police
on bikes on the street.

85
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,480
When they shifted into first,
I was already on the beach.

86
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,520
They were furious.

87
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:34,520
Los dejé atrás a toda velocidad,
no podían creerlo.

88
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,520
Those 2 won't forget
Paulo that easily.

89
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,520
I assure you
they did not forget you, Paulo.

90
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,560
Hey Girls.
Still wearing the moustache!?

91
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,560
Go, Paulo.

92
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,560
Hey girls, going to the beach?
Today it's free.

93
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,560
It will be a pleasure.
Coming?

94
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,560
Hey are you a "taxi",
or a nice taxi?

95
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,560
The driver
is really nice.

96
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,560
He opens the door, doesn't make you car sick,
and doesn't speak if not asked to.

97
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,560
-And he carries the bags if asked nicely.
-Thank you, perfect.

98
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,600
And where are we going, miss?

99
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,600
You see the pink house over there,
with a big door?

100
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,600
-Yes, I see it.
-That's where we're going.

101
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,640
Do you prefer a route
in particular?

102
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,640
Put all that in the kitchen,
I'll organise it later.

103
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,600
-You have enough food for a week there.
-Oh no, my son is coming for lunch.

104
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,640
-He eats all that in one meal ?
-No. Sunday he prepares...

105
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,640
...all his meals
for the week,

106
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,640
His apartment is so small
there's no kitchen.

107
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,640
And he can't even
cook an egg.

108
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,640
Look.
That's him in the picture.

109
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,640
He's a computer geek.
He works at IBM.

110
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,680
-Everybody has their thing.
-And you? What is your "thing"?

111
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,640
I love driving, but
you probably didn't have time to see it!

112
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,640
My son is taking his driving
exam for the 8th time.

113
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,480
8 times !
8 is my lucky number it will be good for him.

114
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,640
At the end of the street,
we're going to turn to the...

115
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,680
to the...to the ...to the

116
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,680
To the left,
Mr. Carbadec.

117
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,640
To the left, to the left!

118
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,680
To the left! Are you nuts? We're going to crash!

119
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,680
Jesus Christ!
I've never seen such an
idiot in the 10 years I've worked here!

120
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,720
Can't you tell right from left ?

121
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,720
-Yes but you should have told me sooner.
-Should I have sent a sax?

122
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,680
LEFT LEFT! It's no so difficult
to turn a steering wheel and press a pedal!

123
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,680
-Everyone has their strengths.
-And you what is your job?

124
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,680
Where they hell do they hire idiots like that?

125
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,720
-In a circus, in a zoo, the government or what?
A little bit of all three.

126
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,720
-Ah you should have said it earlier.
-Should I have sent a Fax?

127
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,680
Excuse me.

128
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,680
Can I offer you something, inspector?

129
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,520
Thank you, that's great.

130
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,720
Thanks you. You're so nice,
I'm going to keep your card.

131
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,720
I don't want to be rude
but I need to go work,
Is it ok if I eat in the Taxi?

132
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,720
Of course, go ahead.
Go Work !

133
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,720
-Can you save my life?
-In theory, no.

134
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,480
It depends on your symptoms.

135
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,720
I have a flight in 25 minutes.
If I miss it I'm a dead man.

136
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,560
If I catch it,
you're a rich man.

137
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,560
Hmm... the gentleman is lucky.

138
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,560
I'm no doctor,...

139
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,760
...but I really like emergencies.
Buckle up please!.

140
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,560
Maybe we should go now.

141
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,800
Here we go.

142
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,560
A white taxi
moving really fast!

143
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,800
-He knocked down my radar!
-We'll care of it - got his plate number?

144
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,800
-I didn't have the time it was too fast.
-Open your eyes, it's your job.

145
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,600
Do you think we're going to make it
on time?

146
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,840
Because if we're going to miss it maybe
we should take our time.

147
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,840
It'll be ok, we're going slow now,
but on the highway we'll speed up.

148
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,840
Ah I see, I see.

149
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,840
Don't take all these risks for me!
I don't want you to lose your license.

150
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,840
No problem,
I don't have a license.

151
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,840
Fantastic.

152
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,840
14 minutes and 30 seconds.

153
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,680
Leaves you time to read the paper
and maybe a cup of coffee. Have a good trip, sir.

154
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,680
Thank you.

155
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,760
I don't understand.

156
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,960
On the computer I'm unbeatable.

157
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,920
First in Monaco,
8 pole positions.

158
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,760
But on the streets I'm a disaster.

159
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,920
-So? How did you do?
-I didn't make it.

160
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:28,960
That's impossible. I know champagne
is better with time...

161
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,960
...but now it's almost
past the due date. What happened?

162
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,920
Nothing, I just crashed into
a butcher shop.

163
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,920
You know what?

164
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,920
You should put a mouse in your car,
instead of your steering wheel.

165
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,920
Like the disabled.
What?

166
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,960
Come on...

167
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,920
Emilien, someone just set
a new record.

168
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,920
A taxi, near the harbour.
You know how fast?

169
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,960
-140?
-Yeah, in first gear.

170
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,960
Then he switched into 2nd... 217 Km/h!

171
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,960
-Did they get him?
-Yeah of course, they called in the air force.

172
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,000
Imagine at that speed.

173
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Hey, have you heard this one?
Listen, it's funny.

174
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,000
What's the difference between
a comb and a moron?

175
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,960
-Ok you're not listening.
I'll come back later. -Yes.

176
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,000
Much later, and if it's at night,
that's even better.

177
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,840
Next time, knock before you enter!

178
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,840
Petra...

179
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,960
I don't mean that for you.

180
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,960
Thanks, Emilien. So how did it
go with your test, was it bad?

181
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,000
Ah, news travels fast.

182
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I have news for you, the Chief is having a meeting now, and only you are missing.

183
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,760
Well, nobody told us you  know!
-All you have to do is push this button...

184
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,000
You see there, it's written "power".

185
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,960
You hear me? I said in my office right now, are you deaf Emilien?

186
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,800
Not anymore, boss.

187
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,800
After hitting banks in Holland, Italy and Belgium

188
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,800
...the Mercedes gang
has  arrived in France

189
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,040
And the Germans must absolutely not invade our territory again.

190
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,040
My grandfather died in their hands, so it's a personnal matter.

191
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,000
So the Paris-Bonn liaison, German-French friendship, can kiss my ass.

192
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,040
Alright? That doesn't apply to you Petra.

193
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,040
You're German... fine, but you're a cop so it's ok.

194
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,040
And they have the gall to announce
the cities before hitting the banks!

195
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,040
It's unbelievable!

196
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,040
Within 3 days,
they will hit a bank in Marseille.

197
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,080
Red Alert,
24 hours a day!

198
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,040
We will have some support in the form
of one trained driver per team.

199
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,840
As soon as the Germans leave the bank, our teams will follow them.

200
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,080
...not losing them, acting like a venom....

201
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,080
That's why
this operation will be called

202
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,080
...Cobra.

203
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,840
Petra, can you assemble the teams please?

204
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:01,080
3 per car. One driver, one coordinator and one sniper.

205
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,880
Each team has a code name and a position
written on the map behind you.

206
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,120
The team members are listed next to the map.

207
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,120
You have 50 minutes to get into position.

208
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,120
Excuse me Petra, it's that dinner we talked about...

209
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,120
...this week would be nice, because...

210
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,120
...the computer software I developed, that we've talked about...

211
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:24,120
it would be better not to wait too long,
somebody could steal the idea.

212
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,120
-No. Just who can't wait,
you or the software ? -Me

213
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,120
No, him...it, the software...
the computer.

214
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,120
You see, it's complicated
That's why I thought...

215
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,120
...a dinner...

216
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,120
As soon as the Germans are arrested,
I promise, I'll take care of you...

217
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,120
...of the software I mean.
-Ah perfect.

218
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,120
-By the way, which team are you in ?
-I'm with the Cobra.

219
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,120
Don't worry, you got lucky.
I put you in the best team.

220
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,160
Hey, I think we're out of coffee.

221
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,160
Have you seen my steering wheel?
It's great, it's personalized...

222
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,160
...I bought it from Alain Prost.

223
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,160
With a new grip, special Dakar.

224
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,200
With even a ton of sand in the car...

225
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,160
Oh yeah?
Too bad we aren't at the beach then.

226
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,160
Hey hey, don't smoke,
it irritates my eyes.

227
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,160
-No coffee, no smoking...
-No chicks !!

228
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,160
Boa calling Tiny Snake.
I repeat: Boa calling Tiny Snake.

229
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,920
-This is TinySnake, I hear you.
-Yeah, it's Alan. Is your team any good?

230
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,160
Amazing.
We're all exchanging addresses.

231
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,120
-And you ? -Me? Somebody is pissing on us
but apart from that everything's fine.

232
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:09,160
Rachid, check out the small black Peugot behind us.

233
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,160
Man, you're crazy Marco!
We're not going to steal a car during the day!

234
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,200
Oh yeah, why not?

235
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,000
Fuck Marco! There could be cops around here!

236
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,240
We don't know this neighbourhood,
we should stick to what we know.

237
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,200
Don't worry, all the cops are at the airport!

238
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,200
-There aren't any around here for 20 Km.
-Man.

239
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,200
-This is crazy. -Calm down man!
All the cops are at the airport I told you!

240
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,240
I saw it on TV, there's Clinton and this girl.

241
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,240
Hey, cops! Check it out, Marco is here,
he's gonna screw you!

242
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,240
-Let's arrest him.
-No, let him take the car,...

243
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,200
...let him finish his show,
we need the space.

244
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,000
I need to take a leak.

245
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,040
No we can't leave the car, it's orders.

246
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,240
You see? All at the airport like I said.

247
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,240
Smile guys, you're on camera.

248
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,200
I tell you guys if they don't show up in one minute
with their Mercedes...

249
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,200
...it's going to be coffee, a smoke and a shit.

250
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,240
We're going to do all that later man!

251
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,280
To all snakes... no venom
until the mouse leaves its hole.

252
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,040
I repeat no venom until the exit.

253
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,000
-Lieutenant?
-Petra, you're disturbing me, I was into it.

254
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,240
I know, but it's the minister.

255
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,280
-Minister, you aren't at the airport?
-We just finished. Tell me Gibert…

256
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,320
what about that Mercedes gang you told me about?

257
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:40,280
Yes, you couldn't have called at a better time, we just located them.
We're going to act soon.

258
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,280
Good, wait a second...

259
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,040
-I just talked to the German minister
-Stop there

260
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,240
They won't have time to visit Marseille

261
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,280
Tonight they'll be in jail, and tomorrow I'll send the Nazis back home

262
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,280
...special delivery.

263
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,760
Exactly my point. I don't want to see this end in
a shootout between Germans and French.

264
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,760
-The war is over, Gibert.
-Of course it is, Mister.

265
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:03,040
They are criminals
just like any others, they won't be treated any differently.

266
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,280
Maybe you should start by not calling them Nazis.

267
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,280
-Ah, I called them Nazis?
-Yes.

268
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,280
-Ah, I called them Nazis?
-Yes.

269
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,320
-I can count on you?
-Yes, don't worry, remember the chinks...

270
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,320
Um, I mean the Asians.
Everything went smoothly.

271
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,320
Almost no deaths,
at least not on our side.

272
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,120
Hello? Hello?
He hung up!

273
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,160
You see, it's easy.

274
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,080
-Where are the wires?
-Shit, Marco! hurry up!

275
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,320
Are you going to steal the car
or do I have to give you the keys?

276
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,360
We are the Tiny Snakes
and that means we stay "cool".

277
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,360
We're going to take it "cool", and not get venomous.

278
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,160
To all snakes, don't mess up,
we want them alive.

279
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,240
At least for an hour.

280
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,400
I don't really feel in the mood,
I guess I'd better leave you guys.

281
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,400
and...
I really have to take a leak.

282
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,400
Let's go!!

283
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,240
-What's going on?
-It doesn't look good, Minister.

284
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,440
Don't move, Minister.

285
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,240
Shit !

286
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,440
We fell into a trap, send us backup.

287
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,440
I identified the car...

288
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,440
I repeat, I identified the accomplice car.

289
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,400
-4 well trained men.
-Backup are coming, Minister!

290
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,480
Shit, shit!

291
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,480
Sir... I think we are shooting at cops.

292
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,480
They're giving up... aren't they?

293
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:11,320
Hello, this is Tiny Snake,
we've had a small problem with the door.

294
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,480
Good morning Sir. Don't worry, we'll have you
free you in 5 minutes.

295
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,480
No problem, no problem.
Thank you, Sir.

296
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,360
Ok, they're giving up.

297
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,520
Funny... he looks just like...

298
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,560
like the Minister.

299
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:39,480
-Oh, you didn't eat anything.
-I'm not really hungry today.

300
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:43,520
-Mom, no.
-Don't worry about your license.

301
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,560
-Remember your father, he never got one either. -How is that possible?

302
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,600
-I remember him driving when I was young
-Yes, it's true.

303
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,600
He took the exam 20 times and
in the end they just gave it to him!

304
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,560
-Ah Thanks, I feel a lot better now.
-You're welcome.

305
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,560
Here, David, the landlord's son
asked me if you could fix this.

306
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,320
Yeah, tell him my name isn't Super Mario.

307
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,560
No, I know your name is Super Cop,
the one who upholds the law

308
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,600
...and protects citizens against evil.

309
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,560
Oh dear, you have a good profession,
I'm proud you.

310
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,560
Oh really!
That's why you tell everyone I work at IBM?

311
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,600
Do you want me to bring you all
the neighborhood parking tickets?

312
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,600
-No.
-So fine, you work at IBM. You're quiet and so am I.

313
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,640
I get to fix all the neighborhood electronic toys.

314
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,640
-Never happy.
-Mom, I'm kidding !

315
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,360
-can you call me a taxi? I'm going to be late.
-I just met the perfect one !

316
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,600
Friendly, pleasant, the cream of the crop.
You'll like him very much.

317
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,360
Hello?

318
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,640
-Am I on the wrong floor?
-That depends, who you are looking for?

319
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,360
-I'm looking for Camille. -That's me.
I mean, that's here.

320
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,600
-Oh you're her son the one who works at Apple.
-No, IBM. IBM. Mom!

321
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,600
I don't know anything about computers.
But I saw your picture the other day.

322
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,600
Ah Daniel, this is my son Emilien.

323
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,360
I put labels on them - Monday is veal, Tuesday...

324
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,600
Ok mom, I promise, I'll be ok.

325
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,640
Maybe we should go now.
I left the car alone, I'm worried. Good bye !

326
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,480
-Ah kiss.
-Kiss, kiss mom !

327
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,480
-Where are we going ?
-Voltaire boulevard.

328
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,600
-I remember the police station but not IBM.
-We are going to the police station.

329
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,680
I install computers there.

330
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:28,680
If you don't mind, I'm going to leave you just near the station.
I don't really like being around pigs.

331
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,640
-Say, that motor sounds great for a taxi. -You know cars?

332
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,480
Just a fan.

333
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,640
It's a V6, a bit modified.
A motor just wants to "sing".

334
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,680
Um, don't sing too loud,
the speed limit is 50.

335
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,640
-You're talking about the signs written 50?
-Yeah.

336
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,400
I thought it was for skateboards.

337
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,640
No, no, I think it's for anything that drives.

338
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,640
There's driving and driving, you see I'm at 100.
Good car...

339
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,640
...good driver, I'm relaxed.
No risks.

340
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,400
I'm less dangerous at 100
then that shit at 20 km/h.

341
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,480
There...

342
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,480
You saw it ?

343
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,440
I saw it, yeah !

344
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,640
-You're not afraid of radars?
-We know where there are radars.

345
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:23,600
Pigs doesn't like change.
Always eating at the same place.

346
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,640
You'll see, there's one just here.
You see them, they're so stupid.

347
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,720
Picture ! Picture !

348
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,720
You know they can't do anything about it,
they just follow the system.

349
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,720
They signed up, nobody forced them.

350
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,720
Sometimes I guess they are forced to join

351
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,720
-'Cause you need to be stupid to join the police force.
-Look,...

352
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,720
...I see them a lot...because of the computers.

353
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,480
The image I had of them was wrong.

354
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,560
Really? It's worse than we hear of them?

355
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:54,520
No. it's better. There aren't just idiots in the police force.

356
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,720
Right, there are also alcoholics, crooks, morons!

357
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,760
Seriously, between us...

358
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,720
...you know any normal person
who would want to join the pig farm?

359
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,720
-And taxi drivers?
-What about them?

360
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,720
You know anybody that
would want to become a taxi driver ?

361
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:15,720
Those complainers that take you
only when feel like it.

362
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,760
And that scream at you
when the tip isn't good.

363
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,760
And drinking in the coffee shops!

364
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,680
They are all friends with the police.

365
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,720
Y se casan con una portera
para tener casa gratis.

366
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,520
You're not married to a cop?

367
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,600
-No...
-Ah that's reassuring!

368
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,800
Ok, there are maybe a few drivers
who are rude with the customers.

369
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,760
-But they are not all like you said.
-So? With the police it's the same thing.

370
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,760
They aren't all drunk at 6 in the morning,
beating on innocent people.

371
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,760
Some of them do their jobs,
just like you... and like me.

372
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,760
Maybe, yeah maybe.

373
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,280
But the thing is,
being a taxi driver isn't my real job.

374
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,800
Ah you drive a taxi only for fun...
what is your real job then?

375
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,800
I'm going to show you.

376
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,760
Do you have a bag, I don't feel good.

377
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,800
Don't worry, as long as we drive fast,
nothing will come out.

378
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,800
Shit!

379
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,800
I'm sorry sir,
that's the first time that's happened with me.

380
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,840
Usually the client gets out
and walks a bit...then...

381
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,840
-I'm really sorry.
-I'm going to confess something.

382
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,840
Me too, that's not my real job...

383
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,640
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yes.

384
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,880
-Last and first Name.
-Morales, Daniel.

385
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,880
Profession... should I write crazy taxi driver
or just crazy driver?

386
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,720
Whatever you want.

387
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:26,840
-At what speed were you going back there?
-Barely 90.

388
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,880
-Barely 90.
-Yes, it seems worse because the motor really kicks.

389
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,680
...but in reality,
the car doesn't really go that fast.

390
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,920
-Hey world champion, how's it going?
-Very good.

391
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,920
-Can you go look in the stands
to see if I'm there?

392
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,920
Remember that taxi,
we saw it 5 minutes ago on the street.

393
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,880
Going 190 Km/h. He's slowing down!

394
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,720
You see? Not 90... 190.

395
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,920
Ah, must be the sun.
I didn't see the 1 on the speedometer.

396
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,920
That's why I saw 90.
If I had known, I would have slowed down.

397
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,880
Anyway, 90 is illegal.
The limit is 50... for everybody!

398
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,920
cars, skateboards,
taxis... everybody !

399
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,920
Is he happy now? caught ht me,
did his job, he's happy now.

400
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,920
My license is my living,
if tonight I'm not driving, tomorrow I'm dead.

401
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,920
You're going to be nice and finish me quickly.

402
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,920
Hey slow down, so I can enjoy it a bit.

403
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,920
Usually I'm the one screamed at all day,
now for once I get lucky.

404
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,920
-I didn't knock because of my wrist.
-Ah it doesn't matter.

405
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,720
-That you didn't knock I mean.
-Thank you.

406
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,960
-Your dinner, your software that can't wait.
-Yes?

407
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,720
So it will wait until I've healed.

408
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,960
Unless you want to have
dinner with a scarecrow.

409
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,960
I doesn't bother me...
you're perfect Petra.

410
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,960
It's not important... I mean no...
yes it matters

411
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,720
It's important.
It's very bad for you...

412
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,960
... but for me..
for the software it doesn't matter.

413
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,960
You see!
All day it's like that.

414
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,960
If only I could catch
those German bastards

415
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,960
You're going to finish me now?
You'll see, you'll feel better.

416
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,960
Yeah, I have to...
unless you have an idea.

417
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,960
-Can promise not to do it again?
-I said an idea, not a an idiocy.

418
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,960
I'm talking about a real idea
of public interest.

419
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,960
-You want to turn me in a dog shit cleaner?
-No!

420
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,960
Something of public interest, for me. Understand?

421
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,720
It's like I represent the public...

422
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:41,000
... and you do something in my interest.

423
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,000
-Ah you want money !.
-You're really stupid!

424
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:49,000
Tell me clearly what you want.
It's been an hour now with your blabbing.

425
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,000
-What do you want?
-Listen.

426
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,040
The Mercedes gang, does that ring a bell ?

427
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,040
No, the only gangs I know
would be into scooters.

428
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,040
They're a gang specialized in robbing banks.
Yesterday was the 7th.

429
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,040
-And that pisses me off.
-Ah that's too bad.

430
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,880
Yes, mostly for us.
Listen, I'll make you a proposal.

431
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,040
You're a good mechanic, you drive well
and I need a driver.

432
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,040
3 good reasons to hire you
as an assistant for 1 month.
I'll remove all your infractions.

433
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,040
-You want me to be a cop for 1 month?
-Choose : cop or pedestrian.

434
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:22,040
-Death or shame?
-You got it.

435
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,080
Here you have all 7 attacks in order.

436
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,080
Don't know much about Mercedes
I'm more Ferrari.

437
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,040
Right now the gang is "Mercedes"
but as soon they get into Ferraris, I'll call you.

438
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:40,040
-A red Mercedes, how awful.
-I know it's red, tell us something we don't know.

439
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:45,080
We've looked everywhere but maybe...

440
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,080
-We just need a detail.
-You're talking about a detail...

441
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,920
Your gang.
They're German.

442
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,080
Very nice! Mercedes, therefore Germans.
You want to relax 5 minutes now? You must be exhausted.

443
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,080
The tires are very inflated,
typical of Germans.

444
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,080
Also they have 8" so they had to do that in Germany
'cause you can't find that in France.

445
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,120
The Tires are quite worn,
they'll need to order some soon.

446
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,120
In this picture, the muffler is a little bent
but not on this one.

447
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,120
They must have bent it during an attack
and repaired it afterwards.

448
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,080
Kruger is the only one who repairs this type in Marseille.

449
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,080
And Kruger is German.

450
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,080
Luckily you're not a Mercedes expert!

451
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,120
-Where are we going?
-We're starting with Kruger to see if he remembers anything.

452
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,920
What are you waiting for?
You want me to sing a song?

453
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,960
In this neighbourhood, I wouldn't turn the Christmas lights on.

454
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:50,120
-What are we doing now?
-We're starting the phase that takes 80% of a policeman's life...

455
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,120
...observation.

456
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,080
Get familiar with the terrain,
observation of entrances and exits.

457
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,080
...and analyse the situation.

458
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,920
When it closes we'll go ask Mr. Kruger a few questions.

459
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:07,120
-When does the store close?
-Kruger? He never closes, he's an insomniac.

460
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,960
Thanks!

461
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,960
They didn't have anything else.

462
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,080
Too bad we didn't stop by my mother's,
she makes terrific sandwiches.

463
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,120
Ham and Cheese.
Half Bayonne, half Parisian.

464
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,120
-It's excellent.
-She made you one?
-Yeah.

465
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:30,160
A small slice of cheese in the middle with lettuce.

466
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:34,960
...and pickles. Fabulous.

467
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,960
-This is mine?
-Really good, congratulations.

468
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,200
-What does he do?
-They're Koreans.

469
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,680
A real pain in the ass for me,
they work 24 hours a day.

470
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,200
-He must sleep at some point, they're human.
-No, they've got a "technique".

471
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,200
One taxi, one plate, one license...

472
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,200
...and 2 drivers.

473
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:13,200
-You can tell the difference between
2 koreans - incredible.

474
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:24,200
I know a Korean, he's in the food business.

475
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,960
No. We wait for him to close the garage.

476
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,200
We're going to wait a long time,
the guy is an insomniac and never closes.

477
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,200
-How do you know that?
-From the bar owner just in front of us.

478
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,200
Why didn't you tell me before?

479
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,200
I haven't been in the police force long,
I don't have the reflexes.

480
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,200
It's not a matter of being a cop,
it's just common sense, shit!

481
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,200
We're here like 2 idiots
waiting for an insomniac to go to sleep!

482
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,240
Does that sound logical to you?

483
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,240
If I'm the Mercedes driver
and I know the mechanic is an insomniac...

484
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,040
...I'll come during the night,
it's much more discrete.

485
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,240
Oh yeah? You think the driver will just show up...

486
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,080
...with his nice Mercedes?

487
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,240
I can't believe it !

488
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,080
When a driver isn't driving, he's in  the garage.

489
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,280
-What are they doing there ?
-Probably the 8" tires they ordered from Kruger.

490
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,240
It's a miracle!
I can't let such an opportunity get away.

491
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,240
if it goes bad, call the station
and give them the Mercedes plate numbers.

492
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,240
-Where are you going?
-After observation, action.

493
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,240
-The Korean trick.
-What?

494
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,240
The Korean trick !

495
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,280
What an idiot !

496
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,240
And the new tires,
where are they going to put them?

497
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,240
-What are you doing there?
-Me? Sleeping.

498
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,280
I don't have a house, my country is very cold.

499
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:59,080
Please! Don't hurt me!
I just wanted to sleep.

500
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,280
I'm going to find you a house
where you'll sleep...

501
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,280
and even eat maybe with a little bit of luck.

502
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,320
-Hey you're hurting me!
-I just do what I can.

503
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,320
-What's your name?
-Daniel.

504
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,360
Ah, yeah. Daniel.
I'm Emilien.

505
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,360
-We're going to call each other by name, it'll be better.
-Yeah, better.

506
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,320
Now that we're friends,
what just happened...

507
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,320
It stays between us...

508
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,360
When you let go of my hand,
can I go to bed?

509
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,400
I'm no insomniac or Korean.

510
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,240
Of course not.

511
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,360
I waited for you all night.

512
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,360
I did it on purpose,
so that you really want me.

513
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,360
You won't regret waiting.

514
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,400
Promises, promises.
Let me see what you can do.

515
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,400
Ah, not too bad.
A little bit more.

516
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,400
Huh? What's going on?

517
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,400
It's 6 am and it's not Sunday, it's Monday.

518
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,400
You can't do that, Lily.
I waited all night.

519
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:45,120
-And me? Did I play dominos?
-Can't you call in sick?

520
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:48,160
Sick on Monday morning?
My boss will love that.

521
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,160
Nobody has ever tried that one.

522
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,160
It can happen to anybody
to be sick Monday morning.

523
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,160
You went to eat at your parents
and you ate too much...

524
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,200
...and you puked all night.
It's possible, isn't it?

525
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,440
A man that works all week
and then isn't around on Sunday.

526
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,440
Do you think it's reasonable ?

527
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,400
I'm really sorry, Lily.
I had a shitty day.

528
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,440
I promise that if you accept a dinner here
tonight, I'll explain everything.

529
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,440
Ok, just a light meal.
I don't want to be sick on Tuesday morning.

530
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,440
Yes, a short time at the table
and a long time in bed.

531
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,440
We could even eat in bed to save time.

532
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,440
You'd better be good,
it's your last chance.

533
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,400
I'm going to impress you.

534
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,440
We're going to wait
all day in front of the garage again?

535
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,440
Observation is finished,
now comes questioning.

536
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,440
Are you interested in seeing
some real questioning?

537
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,440
-No.
-Well, you're going to come anyway.

538
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:47,440
It's better if I wait in the taxi,
in case things go bad... like last time.

539
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,440
I need a translator.
I don't want him to confuse me with technicalities.

540
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,440
Kruger won't waste time to kick you out,
I'm telling you.

541
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,480
Good morning people.

542
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,480
which one of you  is called Kruger, please?

543
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,520
It's written on the label
just like a waitress.

544
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,520
Mr. Kruger,
I've got a few questions for you.

545
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,520
Don't worry, it won't be long.

546
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,520
-Fuck no more ammo!
-What for? They left a long time ago.

547
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,520
-Really?
-Open your eyes, there's nobody here.

548
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,520
Oh yeah, nobody.

549
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,520
-Can I ask you a little question?
-What?

550
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:56,280
Are your questioning sessions
always like that, or was it just to please me?

551
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,520
Usually I get to ask at least 1 question.

552
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,560
Let's go out to get some air.

553
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,560
-You know, you saved my life back there.
-No.
-Yes.

554
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,560
It was worth a lot.
So let's get rid of that one month of labour.

555
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,560
And turn it into only 1 week.

556
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,320
-You know how to deal.
-I need to catch that gang, it's important for me.

557
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,560
-Because of the blonde chick?
-No.

558
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,560
In part yes, but mostly for me.

559
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:23,560
I'm tired of finishing off nights
in the garbage can.

560
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,560
It's a question of honour,
maybe it's crazy, but I need this.

561
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,560
-Can I have the night for myself?
-You've got to be kidding.

562
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,560
-Can I borrow him?
-Mom, it's because...

563
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,560
I lost my prescription and
the doctor agreed to write another one.

564
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:40,560
They're closing in 5 minutes.
It's my heart medicine.

565
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:45,600
I won't let you die here, and that way
I'll have saved the whole family today.

566
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,600
-You're so charming, Daniel.
-I know, I know.

567
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,600
-Look Johnny, here they come.
-Don't worry, baby.

568
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,600
I've put a transmitter in that bullet,
that way they won't get away.

569
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,600
-You're so clever Johnny
-It's my job, baby.

570
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:19,560
-Johnny.
-Now we just have to follow them.

571
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,600
-Incredible!
-...let's save your father.

572
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,600
-I'll never forget what you've done for me Johnny.
-It's my job, baby.

573
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,560
Guys, we just received a call.

574
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,600
They give us a rendezvous.

575
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,600
It's gonna be the Bank of Marseille.

576
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,680
Since they are clear with us,
I'm going to be the same with you.

577
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,640
I won't tolerate any misbehaviour,
any accidents, nothing!

578
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,600
Perfect coordination.

579
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,640
There are 2 words for this mission...

580
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:57,600
Serenity...

581
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,640
...and efficiency.

582
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:04,680
So I've decided to name this mission..

583
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:06,720
the mission...

584
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,720
... Zen.

585
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:13,440
Chief!

586
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,640
Listen up Tiny Snakes and Cobras!
I just got the idea of the century.

587
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,680
The Mercedes gang will be nailed tonight,
or my name isn't Emilien Barbadec.

588
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,720
I hope your plan is foolproof
'cause this is your last chance.

589
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,680
You've got the gun, so be nice and don't miss.

590
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,720
Everybody on the floor!
Quickly!

591
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,720
Hands on the head!

592
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,720
Lie down ! Don't move.

593
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,520
Come on!

594
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,560
-It's working.
-Good, very good.

595
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,600
Follow them at a distance.

596
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,560
So you won't be scared.

597
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:07,720
They stopped. Gauguin Street.
I'm telling you, we've got them.

598
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,800
This is Gilbert.

599
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,800
All units : close off Gauguin street at 10 Km. around.

600
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,840
They didn't move.
Just one street.

601
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:40,680
What's happening?

602
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,840
-The dot disappeared.
-I know it disappeared.

603
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:48,560
-Find out why it vanished.
-They must be this way,...

604
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:49,800
...a red Mercedes doesn't go by unnoticed.

605
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,680
They're close, I can feel it.

606
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:10,840
They're supposed to be here.

607
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,880
Go, go !

608
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,720
Don't shoot, I'm the hostage.

609
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:30,720
Emilien...

610
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:32,720
How...?

611
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,880
I don't understand, I'm missing something.

612
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,920
A red Mercedes vanished.
Even Houdini never did that.

613
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,880
Hello, your papers please.

614
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,520
What's going on, officer?

615
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,680
-You're German?
-Yes Why?

616
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,880
Already at the border?

617
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,680
Chief, 4 Germans in a Mercedes, not red.
Interested?

618
00:50:58,760 --> 00:50:59,360
I'll handle it.

619
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,880
-So you're German.
-Yes, is that a problem?

620
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,880
No, it's good actually.
Open the trunk.

621
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:11,880
-What are they doing in Marseille?
-They came to spend Deutchmarks...

622
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,920
-...but they can do that in another country if you prefer...
-No,...

623
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,920
...I prefer that you keep that in our territory.

624
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:26,920
Ok, goodbye.
Have a nice stay.

625
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:32,920
Emilien.

626
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,720
I don't understand, it's impossible.
I must have missed something.

627
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:42,880
-You see, he forgot about the kettle.
-You think so? He's not like that.

628
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:49,920
It's 8pm. I've turned on the answering machine,
and the alarm is set for 6am.

629
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,960
-We've got 10 hours. It should be enough, no?
-I think it's going to be close...

630
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,760
...but we can hurry just a bit at the end.

631
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:03,680
Expecting somebody?

632
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,760
Yes my lover, but when I found out
you'd come, I cancelled.

633
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,960
-Who could it be?
-Leave it, they'll probably go.

634
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:17,040
-Where were we?
-I was kissing you.

635
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,040
No, you were kissing me.

636
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,000
-And if it's important?
-How?

637
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:30,000
I don't know... the cops...

638
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:33,000
Yeah, maybe you're a notorious criminal
and they've come to get you.

639
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:36,040
You would take me hostage.
And if you just took me now?

640
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:42,040
-Open, Police!
-You didn't kill anybody?

641
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:44,880
No.

642
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,840
Thank God, Daniel!
You're here!

643
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:49,680
Fantastic!

644
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:53,040
-You just can't imagine what shit I'm in.
-Yes, I can imagine.

645
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,040
No, no you can't imagine.

646
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,040
It's gone, we don't have
an apartment anymore.

647
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:00,040
The apartment that my father gave us.

648
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:04,040
-Gone up in smoke, just like my father.
-My husband smoked a lot,...

649
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,000
...but he died of liver cancer,
we never knew why, he didn't drink.

650
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:12,040
The apartment is nothing, the worst
is that I messed up again.

651
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:15,040
If I don't catch them by the end of the week,
I'll be on traffic patrol by Monday.

652
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,040
Stick, whistle, move along kids!

653
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,920
What I'm saying is, Monday I'm dead.

654
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,080
-Daniel, who's that dwarf?
-A friend.

655
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,840
Really? Playing with smurfs now?

656
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,040
-It's a bit complicated, he's a cop...
-What?

657
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,080
-You've got a friend in the police?
-Not a real friend,...

658
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,080
-...I work for him, because...
-You work for the cops?

659
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:38,080
No, not for the cops, for him!
He's not really a cop....

660
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:42,080
...he looks more like a secret agent
, or something like that.

661
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,080
Right, and the old lady is Mata Hari.

662
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:48,040
Can someone explain this to her?
I can't do it.

663
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:51,040
Hello. My name is Camille.

664
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:54,040
The smurf over there is my son, Emilien.

665
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:57,800
I want you to show me the kitchen,
I'm going to make us some  coffee.

666
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,040
-and then I'll explain everything.
-There's nothing to explain mom...

667
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:04,040
...I'm finished, I'm in the street.
It's over, but it started so well...

668
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:10,040
but then came the garbage bin, the butcher, the  Mercedes...

669
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:13,800
What are you going to do with them then?
Should I call the cops, the real ones?

670
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,040
Just be nice, and don't complicate the situation.
Ok, agreed?

671
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,800
I'm not complicating the situation.

672
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,040
I just want to finish what we started.

673
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:24,080
And I don't want to waste an hour
because the schedule is very tight.

674
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:27,880
I'm caught in a tight spot
and when I say caught I mean seriously.

675
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,080
I could lose my license for 100 years.

676
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:33,920
I help him and he gives me back my licence,
100 years of unemployment you see?

677
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,080
Police, blackmailer, and smurf.

678
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,080
Nice picture, you could have finished him
before putting him in traffic.

679
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:43,080
Here you go, it was completely stupid of me.

680
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:49,120
I'm not kidding, you're free.

681
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:51,760
Take it.

682
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:59,120
Daniel, you know I didn't come here
because of our deal.

683
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,960
I haven't got any other friends.
Mom told me you had a big heart.

684
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:10,120
"Daniel has a big heart.
Really, he'll help?."

685
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,120
Ok, I think we made a mistake.
It doesn't matter.

686
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:24,160
It's not important, it's not your problem.

687
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,200
Don't worry, I'll catch that gang alone.

688
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:35,160
Without a car, it won't be easy.
But I'm gonna do it.

689
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,200
Listen, the best way to get rid of him
is to solve his problem.

690
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:50,200
But he doesn't have one problem,
he's got a thousand.

691
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:53,160
Look at his face,
he reminds me of "silence of the lambs".

692
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,160
You take care of Mata Hari
and I'll take care of the smurf.

693
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:00,960
-In 2 hours I'm back.
-And what do I do with the lady for 2 hours?

694
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,160
-Should we play bingo?
-Please, Lily.

695
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,200
-If in 2 hours you're not here, I burn the lady.
-It's a deal.

696
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,200
-Come on.
-Where are we going?
-To solve your problem.

697
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,160
I'm sorry to have ruined your evening.

698
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,000
-Your coffee is really good?
-The best in town.

699
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,200
A nice coffee to change the mood
and for forgiveness.

700
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:47,240
I know you don't really want to talk
to me anymore, but please listen.

701
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,240
-Ok?
-Is 1 minute enough?

702
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:54,960
Yes. I thought about it all night and
there was one question I couldn't answer.

703
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,000
Why are they
pissing us off like that?

704
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,200
Why a red Mercedes when grey is much more discrete?

705
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,240
To get our attention:
look here, then...

706
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:08,000
...it appears over there!
It's a diversion!

707
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:12,240
Conclusion: i think they left the building empty-handed
and the money took another route.

708
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,200
Or maybe the money is still in the bank.

709
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,240
1 minute, end of show.

710
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:29,280
I'll be back later.

711
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,320
-10 grand.
-Thank you very much.

712
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:06,320
-To help pay the rent for the next few years.
-And my wife?

713
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:13,320
-You really want her?
-Well, I'm used to her now.

714
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:22,320
Calm down dear.

715
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:26,320
Now, everything's going to be fine.

716
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,320
"One more bank, and we retire."

717
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:43,360
And for the last one, I suggest we finish greatly.

718
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,360
-Emilien. Emilien!
-You're a pain.

719
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:59,120
I'll tell you how they changed
from a red to a grey Mercedes.

720
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:03,360
-Go ahead.
-They didn't change the car, they changed the colour.

721
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,360
A nice red Mercedes enters the parking lot...

722
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,360
...and a classic grey Mercedes
exists and then disappears.

723
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:14,160
-Is it possible?
-Child's play.

724
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:17,400
If they did repaint the car
we would have found paint traces somewhere.

725
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,360
Unless they used a truck
to get the car in.

726
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,120
They'd need to buy tons of paint
if they do that each time.

727
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:31,120
They did it in record time, they had less than 10 minutes.
Is there paint which dries in 10 minutes?

728
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,400
Hello, Gegé?
Sorry to wake you, it's Daniel.

729
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,400
I need your magic paint, the MD10.

730
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,240
Color metal grey.

731
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:44,400
You ran out?
Who could have bought all that in one shot?

732
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:47,400
At the race track?

733
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:51,400
What are they doing with that much paint? Are they painting the track red?

734
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:55,400
No, don't worry about it.
I'll try dealing with them myself.

735
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,240
Talk to you soon, thanks man.

736
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:03,400
-What does that mean, MD10?
-Less than 10 minutes.

737
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,440
So? You like my theory?

738
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:28,440
-You think it's them?
-No, it's some  old ladies training every Tuesday.

739
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,440
Explain it to me Daniel.
What's the plan?

740
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:35,480
-What are you doing?
-We're going to say hello.

741
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:38,520
-They're going to see us.
-Yep, we'll make it so they won't forget us.

742
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:41,480
They're going to remember me,
they saw me in the trunk!

743
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:43,480
-Put that on.
-Oh shit.

744
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:47,320
Is it alright like that ?

745
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:49,480
It's perfect.

746
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:55,520
Hey faggots, everything ok?
Think you're Schumacher?

747
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:59,520
You spin around the track.
What are those little cars you've got?

748
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:01,520
Mercedes?

749
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:06,240
They build cars too?
Do Germans know how to play the tortoise and the hare?

750
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,480
He doesn't know how to play?
I'm going to teach him.

751
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:09,480
Give me 55.

752
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:14,520
-Maybe I should get out now, eh?
-No, you'll see, they're playful.

753
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,520
The turtle and the hare goes like this...

754
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:21,520
...55 to the one that passes my car over 2 laps. 1 + 1.

755
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:24,240
-You know how to count?
-We don't want the money.

756
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,480
I said 55 because I had a good conscience not to take more.

757
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:30,480
But a tourist that doesn't get robbed
is not really a tourist, right?

758
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:34,280
Look in your rear-view mirror in case I've
already lapped you after the 1st lap.

759
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:37,360
So it wouldn't be worth an doing an extra lap.

760
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:50,320
Thanks girls !

761
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:55,520
Get lost!
Quick !

762
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:59,520
It's not that I'm bored
but I gotta go to the garage.

763
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,520
I don't know what's going on with my car.
It just doesn't run fast anymore.

764
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,480
Whenever you want, we'll have a rematch.

765
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,520
-Here's your 55.
-What are we doing now?
-Let's get a drink.

766
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:20,360
French...

767
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:24,560
You're completely crazy, we had the whole gang.
And you pull that stupid stunt?

768
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:28,560
-We could have called for backup and got them!
-Yeah, on what?

769
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:31,560
-Speeding... on a race track?
Great evidence.

770
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,600
We would have found the evidence later,
we do it all the time.

771
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:36,600
We need to catch them in the act,
that's what you said? Yes or no?

772
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,360
But for the moment we're only collecting offences.

773
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:42,640
If we continue, it's us who will end up in jail.

774
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:46,600
You'll have your flag.

775
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,640
Now they're all warmed up and
nobody's more playful than a pilot.

776
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:54,400
Now we can set a trap for them.

777
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:57,400
-Yeah? What kind of trap?
-A trap for idiots.

778
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:00,400
-And what is your "idiot trap"?
-Not an "Idiot trap".

779
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:03,400
-I said a trap for idiots.
-Ok. How does it goes?

780
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:07,640
It goes like this:
we make them go where we want.

781
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,680
And this is: here.

782
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:13,680
We'll need 20 traffic light keys
and 20 super Walkie-Talkies.

783
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:20,720
Walkie-Talkies are ok but for the keys,
the guys always carry them.

784
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:22,720
Except when they take their showers.

785
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:28,680
-Oh no?
-Oh yes.

786
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:29,640
-Oh no?
-Oh yes.

787
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:57,760
You've got talent!

788
01:03:58,800 --> 01:03:59,760
Here you go, Jimmy.

789
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,720
-It's going to take time, I'm freezing.
-One minute.

790
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:10,720
Emilien, I got one...

791
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:12,720
What are you doing naked ?

792
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:18,760
I'm not naked.
I've got a towel wrapped around me.

793
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:22,760
What do you care?

794
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:25,760
I have the right to be naked in my office, no ?

795
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:27,760
-It's my office isn't it?
-Yes.

796
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:30,720
Nobody taught you to knock before entering?

797
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:33,480
You've never learned anything idiot!

798
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:36,720
Oh, what a welcome!
I wanted to tell you a good joke.

799
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:39,760
Your jokes are never funny, get out!

800
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:43,760
Ah! it feels so good!

801
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:47,640
COME IN!

802
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:49,600
Petra...!

803
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,800
-Am I disturbing you?
-Never!

804
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,800
Yes, I can see I'm disturbing you.
I'll come back later.

805
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:02,760
For once she comes into my office
with something to tell me...

806
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:05,800
...and I'm naked in the middle of the office.
Can you believe that Daniel?

807
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,560
What can I say?
Anyway look at that...

808
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:12,760
She's so beautiful.
And she's already Sergeant.

809
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:15,800
-What could she want with a guy like me?
-Ho, ho. Enough.

810
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:21,560
You're done whining ?
You already started digging your grave.

811
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:25,560
She's not lady charity.
An engine like her doesn't work with low grade oil.

812
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,560
What she needs is a MAN.

813
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,800
Get up!
You look more like an monkey now.

814
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:31,600
Stand up straight!

815
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:37,760
Now you go see her and you kiss her
and that's it.

816
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:41,800
You either get a slap in the face
or you get her for at least 10 years.

817
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:44,800
There's a 50/50 chance.
If it doesn't work at least you'll know.

818
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:47,680
It's like a game show,
either you get it or you don't.

819
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:51,880
Are you ok, Emilien?
Are you alright?

820
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:55,880
You're right.
We shouldn't worry like that.

821
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:59,720
I'll go for it.
I got it.

822
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:14,880
-It was a 50/50.
-He'll have other chances.

823
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:19,880
-Where are we with the keys?
-Done !

824
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:22,720
Take them.

825
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:24,880
You think they're going to be mad?

826
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:28,880
If a girl shows up 17 hours late,
what would you do ?

827
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,920
-I kill her.
-So you got your answer!

828
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,720
But we've got flowers here.

829
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,840
-Oh the nice flowers!
-Can we smoke them?

830
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,880
-Did you bake all these cakes?
-Yes.

831
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:47,880
Since we both didn't get any love,
we got our revenge on the cakes.

832
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:50,920
What a crisis!

833
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:54,920
Thanks, Camille.
I had a wonderful day.

834
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,920
Are the flowers for me?
Thanks,  goodbye.

835
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,920
You don't want to have a intimate evening ?

836
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,720
You've got visitors, Daniel.
You have to take care of them.

837
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:14,680
We'll do it an other day, we're not short of time.

838
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:16,680
Camille will sleep in your bed,
her back hurts.

839
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:21,920
Good night boys.

840
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,960
-Man this is good stuff.
-Sure, it's Jamaican.

841
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,920
-You see, it's not so bad in the forces.
-Stop it, you're tempting me.

842
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:42,920
Tell me, why didn't you race directly
instead of doing it with a taxi?

843
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,960
My father spent his life in a wheelchair
because of a car accident.

844
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,960
How could I explain him that I wanted to be a race car driver?

845
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,920
-I see.
-And you? How did you end up where you are?

846
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:59,800
My story isn't bad either.

847
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,960
My dad died when I was 17,
my mother and I were alone.

848
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,960
So I had to go to work right away.

849
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,800
And without a degree, only the cops wants you.

850
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:15,000
-Where did you live?
-In Asnières.

851
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:17,960
-In Jules Ferry?
-Yes. Why?

852
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,960
-You too?
-Yes, I swear.

853
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,960
It's crazy, we could have ended up in the same class.

854
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
I would have taught you to steal bikes
and you wouldn't have turned out so bad!

855
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:36,040
Life's like that, you dream about so many things
when you're a kid and in the end...

856
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:38,000
...nothing goes as planned.

857
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:43,000
You dream of playing forward
and you end up a goalie.

858
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,040
Do you think our plan will work, Daniel ?

859
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:51,040
It will work.

860
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:54,040
Are you sure?

861
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:56,920
Come in.

862
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:00,040
Am I disturbing you?

863
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:04,040
No, I'm fine now.
What do you need?

864
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:06,080
Red Alert!

865
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:13,080
Guys, the cougar's plan has started.

866
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:15,080
It's the S.D.L.M. banks.

867
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,800
Here are you positions for today.

868
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:22,040
Arthur, at the crossroads Nº 1.
Jacky, Nº 2,...

869
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:25,880
...at National Flamarion crossroads.
Momo at the crossroads de Le Beché.

870
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:32,080
Nº 2, radio and key.
Nº 3, radio and key. Nº 4...

871
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:55,880
Yes?

872
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:59,080
-Yes, I know you'll come back in 1 hour.
-Exactly.

873
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:01,080
I'll wait for you at your place.

874
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:23,080
Cougar speaking
The bird is in the cage.

875
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:27,080
Everybody quiet!
On your knees!

876
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:35,080
Cougar speaking.
The bird will soon leave his cage.

877
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:37,080
Prepare yourselves.

878
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:42,080
Shit, they got hostages.
Don't do anything yet.

879
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,080
-Sorry, no more room for you.
-Ok, no problem.

880
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:50,840
You're going to run next to the car.
It won't be bad for you.

881
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:52,920
I'm tired!

882
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:04,120
Shit! All cougar units get out!
Catch the bird!

883
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:05,960
Catch the bird!

884
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:31,000
You see it's not the Mercedes we needed to follow...

885
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:33,960
it's the Mercedes truck we needed to follow.

886
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:36,160
This calls for a toast!

887
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:39,200
And now we all go home!
Cheers! Cheers!

888
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,160
It's a go.

889
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:06,200
-Everything ready?
-20 strategic points blocked.

890
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,200
If they cross any of these diagonals
they're caught like rats.

891
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:10,200
If they take Michelet boulevard,
they'll end up at place Mazard.

892
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:13,200
Who's on that corner?

893
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:16,200
-Jean-Bat, Nº 7.
-Call him, he'll be the opening act.

894
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:18,240
Nº 7, Jean-Bat.
You hear me?

895
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:22,240
-Yes, I'm here.
-You'll be the first, are you in position?

896
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,240
-Yes, no problem.
-So it's our turn now.

897
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,200
-It doesn't fit there.
-Yes, yes.

898
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:35,240
Hey Bavarians, how are you?
Still driving the tractor?

899
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:39,240
Sorry about last time.
I forgot I had the handbrake on,
that's why I didn't go very fast.

900
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:42,240
Hey, I'm talking to you.
Now it's a lot better.

901
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:45,240
-Do we race again or are you
staying the losers? -Ok.

902
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:49,200
You french always have such big mouths.

903
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:52,200
-Come onto the highway with me, we'll see!
-Did I upset you?

904
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:56,000
-I'm going blow up your Peugeot!
-Sorry, I did upset you.

905
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,720
I'll give you an other chance,
but I'll try harder this time.

906
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:03,240
I feel cheap taking money from you so easily.
Here you go darling, 10 francs.

907
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:06,240
-You're going to pay for your insolence.
-Better to be insolent than ridiculous !

908
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:13,240
-I think you overdid it a bit.
-No, no. Tell 7, 8 and 9 to go to red.

909
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:15,280
Jean-Bat, go to red now.

910
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:42,280
-Nº 10, in position.
-Nº 11, in position.

911
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:45,120
Perfect. 12 and 13, prepare yourselves.

912
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:50,280
This is number 13.
I've got a small problem here.

913
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:54,280
-There are 2 cops at the traffic light.
-Shit!

914
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:58,120
-Get rid of them!
-Easy to say! They're not going anywhere.

915
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,320
We're getting close, find a solution!
Otherwise, we're finished.

916
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:09,320
Pollo, let me talk to the cops.

917
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:13,360
Sorry sir, it's for you.

918
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:18,360
-Hello.
-This is Sergeant Gibert, we've found a bomb and it's just next to you.

919
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,360
-Where?
-In the traffic light.

920
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:23,360
Stay calm, we know how to stop the mechanism.

921
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:27,360
Listen carefully: put the key in the light
and make the light turn red.

922
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:32,360
-It's already red!
-Don't worry about the colour!

923
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:34,360
...just turn the key to the right!

924
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:36,360
Yes, yes, Sergeant.

925
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:47,360
-We just passed 12.
-Hurry up, hurry up!

926
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,360
Can I do it?

927
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:56,200
-19 and 20, get ready. After 20, there's nothing.
-I know.

928
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,400
-Are you sure there's a road there ?
-It's a shortcut.

929
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:15,440
On the highway, they're dead.
We've got more power.

930
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:57,480
-If there was a fence, maybe there was a reason.
-Yep, the highway isn't finished, it's a dead end.

931
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:03,320
The important thing is that you know it.

932
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:09,520
-I look calm like but in fact I'm not.
-It won't be long.

933
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:12,280
-That's what worries me, I want to live long!
-10 seconds.

934
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:13,560
Take that frog!

935
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:17,520
-We've got to stop, there's no bridge!
-5 seconds.

936
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:21,520
Go! Take him! Take him!

937
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:26,320
Let them win, Daniel!
You only bet 10 francs!

938
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,560
-I don't want to die for 10 francs!
-It's now or never! Hold on!!!

939
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:40,520
Way to go, Karl!
We won!

940
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:43,520
Are you sure?

941
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:55,520
I swear, you scared me to death!

942
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:59,520
I really thought you would
rather die than lose.

943
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,520
Between the tortoise and the hare
it's always the tortoise that wins!

944
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,520
Einstein! You know "La Fontaine"?

945
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:19,520
Big hare not happy to been fucked by little Tortoise.

946
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:26,560
Cougar will be happy.
For a long time he's wanted to eat hare.

947
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:29,240
Yes, big hare, big hare.

948
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:50,560
I'm sorry about the place.

949
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:53,560
It's not very romantic.

950
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,400
-But I really wanted it.
-Oh really?

951
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:58,560
You really wanted... I didn't feel it.

952
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:02,560
Should we try again?

953
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:08,560
No, later.
We've really got to go now.

954
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:15,560
Daniel, What are you doing?
I've been looking for you for 15 minutes.

955
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:19,360
-What were you doing in the dark?
-Photo finishing.

956
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:22,440
It's not the time for photo finishing.
The sergeant is waiting!

957
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:32,640
In the name of the president of the Republic...

958
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:36,480
...it is an honour to offer you
the medal of the knight.

959
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:44,480
Congratulations.

960
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:56,640
-I owe you an apology.
-For not believing in me, or for slapping me?

961
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:59,680
Both. How can you forgive me?

962
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:03,640
We'll find a way.

963
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:07,640
I read the story of your exploits.

964
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:09,640
Amazing!

965
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:13,640
This experience made us think.
Thank you.

966
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:17,680
We are going to change the way we see the road.

967
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:20,480
We are going to implement a police force
more efficient and modern.

968
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:22,680
-And all that thanks to you.
-Thank you.

969
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:27,680
This medal is only a symbol.
It won't give you your license back.

970
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:30,680
-I was hoping for more...
-Mercy?
-Exactly.

971
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:35,480
We've got mercy. We've got enough to put you in
jail for many years... but you are free.

972
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:37,680
-I'm not free, I can't drive.
-I understand.

973
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:40,720
Without a car, you are like an orphan.

974
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,680
-Yes, an orphan on foot.
-I understand.

975
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:45,680
I got a solution
but I'm not sure it will suit you.

976
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:49,680
Tell me, and we'll see.

977
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:02,680
-So? Are you happy?
-Yes.

978
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:04,680
-You're not happy?
-Yes it's great.

979
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:09,680
I don't understand. Your first Grand Prix,
pole position, a great car, friends...

980
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:13,680
-...your girlfriend. What's wrong?
-The sponsor!

981
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:18,720
We find him money, a car
and he's still not happy.

982
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:26,480
Tell the cheerleader to stop moving, it distracts me.

983
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:30,480
-You know what you could do
that would make me happy?
-What?

984
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:33,720
Win that race! Because we don't give a damn
about the sponsors on the car.

985
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:38,560
Ok then, take the champagne out of
the freezer. It's not good too cold.

986
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:47,720
Let's go, Daniel!
