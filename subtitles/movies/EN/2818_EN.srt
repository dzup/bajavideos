1
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:52,586
You came here to kill me.

2
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:03,098
You came here to kill me.

3
00:01:57,468 --> 00:02:02,178
This is precinct 80: Niedermann
should be considered extremely dangerous.

4
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:05,027
Approach with extreme caution.

5
00:02:05,228 --> 00:02:09,267
81-20, please acknowledge.
Over.

6
00:02:32,668 --> 00:02:35,307
81-20, can you hear me?
Over.

7
00:02:35,508 --> 00:02:38,580
Eight - one - two - zero. Can you hear me?
Over.

8
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:49,097
Her name is Lisbeth Salander.

9
00:03:49,308 --> 00:03:51,822
She's 27 years old.

10
00:03:54,508 --> 00:03:56,738
In this edition of Millennium we reveal...

11
00:03:56,948 --> 00:04:01,180
...how Swedish government officials
conspired against her...

12
00:04:01,388 --> 00:04:04,698
...to cover for a pathological killer.

13
00:04:06,468 --> 00:04:11,940
Alexander Zalachenko, a dissident GRU agent
from the Soviet Union,

14
00:04:12,148 --> 00:04:16,107
is responsible for a series of serious crimes in Sweden.

15
00:04:16,308 --> 00:04:21,507
These include arms dealing, human and trafficking and Assault.

16
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:26,623
Alexander Zalachenko is Lisbeth Salander's father.

17
00:04:26,828 --> 00:04:31,902
This edition of Millennium
is dedicated to clearing her name.

18
00:04:32,108 --> 00:04:33,780
Hi,

19
00:04:33,988 --> 00:04:36,422
Can you open your eyes?

20
00:04:37,868 --> 00:04:41,986
I'm Anders Jonasson.
I'm the doctor in charge of your case.

21
00:04:44,068 --> 00:04:47,822
You are at the Sahlgrenska
hospital in Göteborg.

22
00:04:51,868 --> 00:04:53,779
Can you count to ten?

23
00:04:56,348 --> 00:04:59,704
One, two, three...

24
00:05:07,628 --> 00:05:09,983
That's great.

25
00:05:10,828 --> 00:05:14,343
My report is about 40 to 50 pages,

26
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:18,461
and I will include copies of documents
from Björck's original investigation...

27
00:05:18,668 --> 00:05:21,057
...to back up and validate the claims.

28
00:05:21,268 --> 00:05:24,578
What photography do we have?
- Not much.

29
00:05:24,788 --> 00:05:29,384
We could include pictures of Gunnar Bjorck,
Teleborian and Zalachenko.

30
00:05:29,588 --> 00:05:33,547
And some of St. Stephen's Hospital.
- Oh, and Lisbeth.

31
00:05:33,748 --> 00:05:37,661
That sounds like a good 75 pages.
- Could well be more - it will make good reading.

32
00:05:37,868 --> 00:05:42,384
Can we unearth any more names?
- No, let's focus on those we have for now.

33
00:05:42,588 --> 00:05:46,467
and hope that more will come up
by the time we publish.

34
00:05:46,668 --> 00:05:48,784
It'll only be a matter of time,
and then...

35
00:05:54,468 --> 00:05:56,584
Let's get to work.

36
00:05:57,548 --> 00:06:02,497
Latest news:
police mobilise additional forces following
the brutal murders near Gosseberga this morning.

37
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:05,825
A massive search is underway for the suspect,

38
00:06:06,028 --> 00:06:08,622
whom police have identified...

39
00:06:08,828 --> 00:06:11,900
...as Ronald Niedermann,
a 35 year old German national.

40
00:06:12,108 --> 00:06:16,704
According to police sources,
he is armed and extremely dangerous.

41
00:06:19,828 --> 00:06:23,457
I'm here to see Fredrik Clinton.
- May I say who is calling?

42
00:06:23,668 --> 00:06:26,660
I'm Evert Gullberg,
an old colleague of his.

43
00:06:26,868 --> 00:06:29,826
Dad's sleeping at the moment,
but do please come in.

44
00:06:32,268 --> 00:06:37,661
Zalachenko will always act in his own best
interests, no matter what the consequences.

45
00:06:37,868 --> 00:06:39,904
My reputation is at stake.

46
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:45,182
We can't risk him talking.

47
00:06:45,388 --> 00:06:49,461
He must be silenced at any price.

48
00:06:49,668 --> 00:06:52,626
Agreed, as ever.

49
00:06:52,828 --> 00:06:56,138
But look at the state I'm in.

50
00:06:58,028 --> 00:07:01,782
Fredrik, we need you.
One final time.

51
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,024
I really can't help you.

52
00:07:04,228 --> 00:07:06,378
I'm in hospital every other day...

53
00:07:06,588 --> 00:07:11,537
...for five hours of haemodialysis.

54
00:07:12,508 --> 00:07:15,500
I haven't got much time left.

55
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,097
They can't find me a kidney donor.

56
00:07:19,828 --> 00:07:22,217
This is it, my friend.

57
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:32,098
Thank you, dear.
- They're freshly baked.

58
00:07:36,428 --> 00:07:39,226
I didn't realize you had a daughter.

59
00:07:40,548 --> 00:07:42,584
No...

60
00:07:42,788 --> 00:07:46,064
We know little of each other's
personal lives...

61
00:07:46,988 --> 00:07:51,220
Despite having worked together...

62
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,658
...oh, over 35 years.

63
00:07:59,308 --> 00:08:01,902
What about Lisbeth Salander?

64
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:05,623
Her prosecution has already begun.
What do we do with her?

65
00:08:18,268 --> 00:08:20,498
Hi Lisbeth.

66
00:08:21,108 --> 00:08:23,463
How's it going?

67
00:08:25,508 --> 00:08:29,467
Remember me?
I'm Anders Jonasson.

68
00:08:31,748 --> 00:08:34,581
I can understand if you're still tired...

69
00:08:34,788 --> 00:08:37,700
...You took a shot to the head.

70
00:08:37,908 --> 00:08:40,980
We sucessfully removed the bullet,

71
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:45,306
as far as we can tell,
no vital regions were damaged.


72
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:48,864
You also had gunshot wounds in
your right shoulder and left hip,

73
00:08:49,068 --> 00:08:51,536
but those will heal nicely.

74
00:08:51,748 --> 00:08:55,866
Is there any brain damage?

75
00:08:56,708 --> 00:09:01,065
Brain injuries are complex and
sometimes difficult to anticipate. Don't worry.

76
00:09:06,548 --> 00:09:08,857
The police want to interview you.

77
00:09:09,068 --> 00:09:12,026
But I refused
due to your condition

78
00:09:12,228 --> 00:09:16,824
They'll be back, but for now
I won't let them near you.

79
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:24,620
Is Zalachenko alive?

80
00:09:24,828 --> 00:09:28,025
He's been patched up and is stable.

81
00:09:28,228 --> 00:09:30,947
But he is rather badly messed up.

82
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:38,424
Fuck.

83
00:09:38,628 --> 00:09:41,700
I was wondering when you'd show up.

84
00:09:41,908 --> 00:09:45,742
We've been discussing how to help you,

85
00:09:45,948 --> 00:09:50,863
but we need to hear your version in order
to come up with an effective strategy.

86
00:09:53,988 --> 00:09:58,698
Any thoughts on what form that should take?

87
00:09:58,908 --> 00:10:01,297
Between us, we'll come up with something.

88
00:10:01,508 --> 00:10:05,467
But it's going to be difficult
to avoid a prison sentence entirely.

89
00:10:05,668 --> 00:10:08,307
Gee, you reckon?

90
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:12,945
We'll help you with a lawyer
and anything else you need.

91
00:10:13,148 --> 00:10:18,427
But you have to cooperate
and we must have guarantees.

92
00:10:18,628 --> 00:10:22,462
Niedermann...
Niedermann's the scapegoat.

93
00:10:22,668 --> 00:10:25,023
He's the one who shot Lisbeth.

94
00:10:25,228 --> 00:10:30,700
There are serious allegations against you
which will be difficult to make go away

95
00:10:30,908 --> 00:10:32,864
That's your problem...

96
00:10:33,068 --> 00:10:35,536
...entirely your problem.

97
00:10:35,748 --> 00:10:38,057
Either find a solution...

98
00:10:38,268 --> 00:10:41,146
...or I'll contact the press.

99
00:10:41,348 --> 00:10:44,943
I have names, dates, events...
everything.

100
00:10:45,148 --> 00:10:48,697
I can take you all down.

101
00:10:50,148 --> 00:10:53,584
I'm a survivor - 
you should know that by now.

102
00:10:53,788 --> 00:10:57,667
Zalachenko, you don't understand...
- No! you, don't understand!

103
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:04,626
This conversation is <i>over</i>.

104
00:11:13,348 --> 00:11:15,543
Just one more thing.

105
00:11:16,948 --> 00:11:19,257
Lisbeth...

106
00:11:19,468 --> 00:11:23,939
What about her?
- She has to be taken care of, understood?

107
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:30,302
Good. Good...

108
00:11:33,668 --> 00:11:36,580
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

109
00:11:36,788 --> 00:11:40,303
My sister's arrived.
Let's talk later.

110
00:11:40,508 --> 00:11:43,102
Is no one in?
- No.

111
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:51,267
...but Micke, she tried
to hack her father to death with an axe.

112
00:11:52,788 --> 00:11:54,983
That's attempted murder.

113
00:11:58,828 --> 00:12:01,137
Or self-defence.

114
00:12:01,348 --> 00:12:05,739
But hasn't she been arrested for attempting
to murder Zalachenko?

115
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:13,657
So she needs a criminal lawyer.

116
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,628
You know women's rights.

117
00:12:17,828 --> 00:12:22,618
Lisbeth and her mother were subjected
to physical and psychological abuse...

118
00:12:22,828 --> 00:12:28,061
...By both Zalachenko and the authorities.
It started long before Gosseberga.

119
00:12:28,268 --> 00:12:31,385
This document proves it.

120
00:12:39,228 --> 00:12:44,097
They're records of the investigation, compiled
by Gunnar Björck of the Security Services.

121
00:12:45,548 --> 00:12:50,906
They prove that an innocent twelve-year old girl
was to comitted to St. Stephen's...

122
00:12:51,108 --> 00:12:54,066
...purely to silence her.

123
00:12:54,268 --> 00:12:57,180
Is it confidential?

124
00:12:57,388 --> 00:13:02,416
Say you got it from a journalist
who refuses to reveal his sources.

125
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:08,781
You're really prepared to stick your neck out
for Lisbeth Salander, aren't you?

126
00:13:11,908 --> 00:13:13,182
Yeah.

127
00:14:13,908 --> 00:14:20,063
SJ's X2000 No. 429 from Stockholm
has just arrived at platform 6.

128
00:14:48,828 --> 00:14:52,059
I don't need a lawyer.

129
00:14:53,668 --> 00:14:56,819
You're accused of attempting
to murder your father.

130
00:14:58,268 --> 00:15:01,738
Micke thinks that they'll try to commit you
to a psychiatric hospital again...

131
00:15:01,948 --> 00:15:04,781
...so you will need a lawyer.

132
00:15:07,868 --> 00:15:10,621
but you're free to choose someone else....

133
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:15,856
...unless you prefer the court to
appoint a public defender.

134
00:15:19,948 --> 00:15:23,418
Would you like me to leave?

135
00:15:34,588 --> 00:15:36,544
It's entirely up to you.

136
00:15:38,428 --> 00:15:40,862
Do you have a cigarette?

137
00:15:42,228 --> 00:15:46,346
Do you have any nicotine patches?
- Yes, just one moment please.

138
00:15:55,548 --> 00:15:59,700
I got this copy off Micke.
You're familiar with the contents, aren't you?

139
00:16:03,348 --> 00:16:06,545
We'll need to spend
much time together,

140
00:16:06,748 --> 00:16:10,024
and I need you to be completely
honest with me.

141
00:16:13,028 --> 00:16:16,225
Micke has explained most of it,
but there are some areas which he wants you...

142
00:16:16,428 --> 00:16:19,306
...to decide how much you wish to disclose.

143
00:16:21,508 --> 00:16:24,147
I assume you understand what he means...

144
00:16:24,348 --> 00:16:28,182
Something to do with computers
and a DVD recording.

145
00:16:36,668 --> 00:16:40,741
After all we've done for you
through the years...

146
00:16:40,948 --> 00:16:44,941
...and now you're threatening us.
You're treading dangerously.

147
00:16:45,148 --> 00:16:50,381
I'm a survivor.
I'll do whatever it takes.

148
00:16:50,588 --> 00:16:55,708
You haven't the slightest shred
of loyalty, honour...

149
00:16:55,908 --> 00:16:57,864
and have absolutely no morals...

150
00:17:01,148 --> 00:17:04,823
I'm here to forward a message.

151
00:17:05,028 --> 00:17:08,543
You're on your own this time.
Full stop.

152
00:17:08,748 --> 00:17:12,536
I have no choice - understand?

153
00:17:12,748 --> 00:17:17,060
There's always a choice.

154
00:17:18,148 --> 00:17:20,537
Idiots.

155
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,784
Idiots!

156
00:17:22,988 --> 00:17:26,298
I'll take you down if it's the last thing I do
- That's your choice!

157
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:33,660
Lie still. Please!
I'll go and see what's happening.

158
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:39,066
Out! Now!

159
00:17:40,308 --> 00:17:42,185
He's got a gun!

160
00:17:42,388 --> 00:17:44,140
What's going on?

161
00:17:45,188 --> 00:17:47,338
Hurry!

162
00:17:53,548 --> 00:17:57,063
Hang on, I'm coming.
Hold me tight.

163
00:17:58,868 --> 00:18:00,267
Hold on.

164
00:18:02,308 --> 00:18:03,900
Hold on tight!

165
00:18:29,868 --> 00:18:34,146
He tugged at the door, but couldn't
open it. It was so unreal.

166
00:18:34,348 --> 00:18:37,181
An old man with a gun.

167
00:18:38,628 --> 00:18:41,301
I heard him shoot himself.

168
00:18:41,508 --> 00:18:45,023
Are you sure he was after Lisbeth?

169
00:18:45,228 --> 00:18:48,618
Absolutely, it was awful!
I've never been so scared.

170
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:52,184
Shall I come down?
- No.

171
00:18:52,388 --> 00:18:58,702
It won't be necessary. I'll stay with
my friend Vera Åkerlund in Kålltorp.

172
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:02,897
Press conference - police headquarters - 3pm.
- I have to go.

173
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,497
Take care.
- Sure.

174
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:08,268
We'll talk later.
- Ok. Bye.

175
00:19:12,108 --> 00:19:15,544
How come there wasn't better
police protection?

176
00:19:15,748 --> 00:19:18,979
Absolutely incredible.
Here of all places 

177
00:19:19,188 --> 00:19:24,626
To carry a weapon into a hospital ward
and shoot patient - unbelievable!

178
00:20:03,948 --> 00:20:06,223
Heavens! Fredrik?

179
00:20:06,428 --> 00:20:09,465
What on earth happened?
Come in, come in.

180
00:20:13,428 --> 00:20:17,660
We're trying to get further
details right now.

181
00:20:31,348 --> 00:20:34,863
What time did it happen?
Find out.

182
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:37,059
What the hell?

183
00:20:37,268 --> 00:20:40,305
Any idea what happened?
- Zalachenko's been shot.

184
00:20:40,508 --> 00:20:44,262
By all accounts Evert Gullberg shot him.

185
00:20:44,468 --> 00:20:47,858
It's chaotic down there.
Nothing's been confirmed as yet.

186
00:20:48,068 --> 00:20:53,017
Then I'll confirm it.
Evert did shoot him.

187
00:20:53,228 --> 00:20:56,186
Exactly as planned.

188
00:20:56,388 --> 00:21:00,859
Should I organise coffee or something?
- No, not now.

189
00:21:06,868 --> 00:21:10,781
What the hell are you talking about?
What plans?

190
00:21:10,988 --> 00:21:16,540
Gullberg had liver cancer.
He only had a few months left to live.

191
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:21,905
He chose to help us one last time.

192
00:21:23,068 --> 00:21:25,218
He died with honour.

193
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:32,304
Did you know he'd kill Zalachenko?
- Of course.

194
00:21:32,508 --> 00:21:37,741
His job was to silence Zalachenko...

195
00:21:37,948 --> 00:21:41,258
...and Salander, as planned.

196
00:21:46,148 --> 00:21:49,663
Are you as fucking deranged as Gullberg?

197
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:55,702
Watch your tongue, Hallberg.
It was the right decision.

198
00:21:55,908 --> 00:21:59,787
We did what was necessary.
- Necessary? Decision?

199
00:21:59,988 --> 00:22:04,937
Neither you nor Gullberg had any mandate to
make any kind of decision at all, damn it!

200
00:22:05,148 --> 00:22:10,427
In any event, we can never be 
connected to either Zalachenko's death

201
00:22:11,348 --> 00:22:14,465
...or Evert Gullberg's.

202
00:22:17,988 --> 00:22:22,982
It's our job to make decisions...

203
00:22:23,188 --> 00:22:25,941
...that no one else dares to.

204
00:22:27,468 --> 00:22:31,347
Least of all politicians.
It comes with the territory.

205
00:22:33,108 --> 00:22:35,497
One more thing...

206
00:22:37,188 --> 00:22:40,817
I'm returning to active service.

207
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:44,703
I'll take charge of operations...

208
00:22:44,908 --> 00:22:47,706
...until this crisis is over.

209
00:22:47,988 --> 00:22:53,381
The man who pulled the 
trigger and later took his own life...

210
00:22:53,588 --> 00:22:59,026
...has been identified as a
78-year-old pensioner.

211
00:22:59,228 --> 00:23:04,461
He used to work as an accountant
and tax lawyer.

212
00:23:04,668 --> 00:23:08,627
What was his name?
- We're not at liberty to diclose that at this time.

213
00:23:08,828 --> 00:23:11,900
Is there any connection with
Lisbeth Salander?

214
00:23:12,108 --> 00:23:16,386
We have firmly ruled out any possible
connection with Lisbeth Salander.

215
00:23:16,588 --> 00:23:20,581
It was the act of a lone assailant
who has acted...

216
00:23:20,788 --> 00:23:24,906
...out his own paranoid
imagination.

217
00:23:25,108 --> 00:23:30,865
He has sent confused messages,
to the media and politicians...

218
00:23:31,068 --> 00:23:35,186
...containing death threats towards
Alexander Zalachenko.

219
00:23:35,388 --> 00:23:40,701
Security Services have analyzed them, and
believe him to have been mentally unstable.

220
00:23:40,908 --> 00:23:43,820
That's all so far from
the police press conference.

221
00:23:44,028 --> 00:23:49,182
We return to the incident at
Sahlgrenska hospital in Göteborg.

222
00:23:49,388 --> 00:23:50,980
No!

223
00:23:54,908 --> 00:23:59,026
Feeding time?
- Yeah. Salisbury steak today.

224
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:02,744
Go on in.
- Thanks.

225
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,865
Lisbeth?

226
00:24:07,908 --> 00:24:09,864
Lisbeth?

227
00:24:13,068 --> 00:24:15,866
Need any help?
- No thanks.

228
00:24:34,188 --> 00:24:36,543
Bon apetit!

229
00:25:20,388 --> 00:25:22,856
I have a suggestion.

230
00:25:23,068 --> 00:25:26,504
I'm not going home.
I've booked a room here.

231
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:28,983
Why don't you stay overnight?

232
00:25:31,188 --> 00:25:34,544
I'm completely exhausted. I slept badly
with all that editorial shit.

233
00:25:34,748 --> 00:25:37,057
We'll just sleep then.

234
00:25:38,188 --> 00:25:41,464
This is the fourth time that car
has been parked in the same spot.

235
00:25:41,668 --> 00:25:44,057
Are you sure?
- Yes.

236
00:26:04,268 --> 00:26:08,307
How do suggest we get out of this?
- We couldn't have forseen everything.

237
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:14,259
Hospital security has been tightened.
- Thanks a fucking lot for that!

238
00:26:14,468 --> 00:26:18,859
How the hell are we going to
avoid a trial now?

239
00:26:19,068 --> 00:26:21,184
I don't think that's possible.

240
00:26:33,828 --> 00:26:40,176
Only a psychiatric evaluation
and having her comitted will silence her.

241
00:26:40,388 --> 00:26:44,347
She has to pay for the
attempt on Zalachenko's life...

242
00:26:44,548 --> 00:26:48,700
...and be committed to psychiatric care.

243
00:26:48,908 --> 00:26:53,220
How about here at St. Stephen's?
- Yes.

244
00:26:54,228 --> 00:26:57,618
For her own sake.

245
00:26:57,828 --> 00:27:00,865
Who's the prosecutor?

246
00:27:02,148 --> 00:27:06,221
Ekström.
Not a star, but ambitious.

247
00:27:07,348 --> 00:27:08,906
We can handle him.

248
00:27:09,108 --> 00:27:13,306
And the copies of Björck's
investigation? - We destroy them.

249
00:27:13,508 --> 00:27:16,306
Now there's something you might
be able to handle, hmm?

250
00:27:17,748 --> 00:27:20,546
You worry too much.

251
00:27:21,788 --> 00:27:27,021
What about that blond thug
who worked for Zalachenko?

252
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:31,016
Whatever happened to him?
- Ronald Niedermann...

253
00:27:31,228 --> 00:27:33,105
He's on the run.

254
00:27:33,308 --> 00:27:36,186
It's only a matter of time...

255
00:27:38,308 --> 00:27:42,824
He's Lisbeth Salander's half-brother.

256
00:27:43,788 --> 00:27:48,259
Zalachenko once had an affair
with a woman in Hamburg.

257
00:27:57,668 --> 00:28:00,899
It's like a bloody Greek tragedy!

258
00:28:01,108 --> 00:28:05,784
Zalachenko tries to kill his daughter
with the help of her brother.

259
00:28:05,988 --> 00:28:08,297
Then she rises from the dead...

260
00:28:08,508 --> 00:28:11,625
...to bury an axe in dad's head...
-heh...

261
00:28:19,548 --> 00:28:23,780
...You could look at it that way.

262
00:28:25,548 --> 00:28:27,698
I'll be in touch.

263
00:29:02,868 --> 00:29:05,063
See you later, Vera. Bye.

264
00:29:12,508 --> 00:29:16,421
Hey!
Give me my bag!

265
00:29:16,628 --> 00:29:19,188
Give me my bag!

266
00:29:22,188 --> 00:29:23,826
What the fuck!

267
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:26,781
Someone on a scooter snatched my bag.

268
00:29:26,988 --> 00:29:30,378
What? And you?
Are you okay?

269
00:29:30,588 --> 00:29:34,945
I'm fine, but Björck's files
were in the bag.

270
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,867
Don't worry.
I'll get another copy to you.

271
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:40,821
Annika, I'll call you back.

272
00:30:17,068 --> 00:30:19,423
Milton Security, Armanskij.

273
00:30:19,628 --> 00:30:23,064
This is Mikael Blomkvist.
I need your help.

274
00:30:23,268 --> 00:30:27,147
What is the problem?
- Someone broke into my house.

275
00:30:27,348 --> 00:30:31,341
We can help you with that.
Can I call you back from my office?

276
00:30:31,548 --> 00:30:35,143
Of course, call me on my mobile.
- Ok, bye.

277
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:39,265
The indictment against Lisbeth Salander
is simple.

278
00:30:39,468 --> 00:30:43,143
Even with Zalachenko dead.

279
00:30:44,628 --> 00:30:49,782
But if the truth about Zalachenko comes out,
the trial will get very complicated.

280
00:30:51,388 --> 00:30:55,586
It is about human lives, about our
relationship with a foreign power...

281
00:30:55,788 --> 00:30:58,985
...and the secret contacts of
the Security Service.

282
00:30:59,188 --> 00:31:03,101
Yes, I've read the report as
background material.

283
00:31:03,308 --> 00:31:07,096
For the prosecution of Lisbeth Salander,
the report has little relevance...

284
00:31:07,308 --> 00:31:10,220
...and the Director of Public Prosecutions
has confiscated it.

285
00:31:10,428 --> 00:31:13,101
However, some bits are useful.

286
00:31:13,308 --> 00:31:17,745
Especially where Lisbeth Salander tried
to kill her father in the past.

287
00:31:17,948 --> 00:31:20,940
I'll see if you can have access
to that part.

288
00:31:21,148 --> 00:31:24,618
Yes, that might help.

289
00:31:24,828 --> 00:31:27,626
Then I'll make sure you get it.

290
00:31:30,468 --> 00:31:32,982
Who d'you work for?

291
00:31:35,508 --> 00:31:38,818
My orders come from the very top.

292
00:31:39,028 --> 00:31:42,907
That means that you can't discuss
this with anyone but me.

293
00:31:45,508 --> 00:31:48,545
I'll be especially discreet.

294
00:31:57,828 --> 00:32:00,217
Anders Jonasson?
- Yes.

295
00:32:01,588 --> 00:32:03,579
My name is Peter Teleborian.

296
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:08,543
I am a physician at St. Stephen's
psychiatric clinic in Uppsala.

297
00:32:08,748 --> 00:32:11,137
I need to talk to you.

298
00:32:11,348 --> 00:32:15,500
It's about one of your patients,
Lisbeth Salander.

299
00:32:15,708 --> 00:32:19,986
Uh huh...
- Well... shall we.

300
00:32:23,388 --> 00:32:27,586
I have been dealing with her
since she was twelve years old...

301
00:32:27,788 --> 00:32:31,747
...and I am very familiar
with her clinical profile.

302
00:32:31,948 --> 00:32:36,260
Which is?
- Lisbeth is extremely disturbed.

303
00:32:36,468 --> 00:32:41,826
She is highly delusional
with paranoid schizophrenic tendencies.

304
00:32:42,028 --> 00:32:47,102
And as with all sociopaths
she exhibts a total lack of empathy.

305
00:32:47,308 --> 00:32:50,061
In a nutshell.

306
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:55,786
I have found her to be quiet and withdrawn,
but not a paranoid sociopath.

307
00:32:55,988 --> 00:32:59,697
She's extremely manipulative,
it's all part of her symptoms.

308
00:32:59,908 --> 00:33:03,617
She manifests what she 
believes you want to see.

309
00:33:03,828 --> 00:33:08,140
As you can imagine, I'm greatly
concerned about her mental health.

310
00:33:08,348 --> 00:33:10,020
Yes, I understand.

311
00:33:10,228 --> 00:33:15,541
I have to see her to assess
her fitness for the trial.

312
00:33:15,748 --> 00:33:19,024
I can't help you with that.

313
00:33:21,068 --> 00:33:23,377
I'm responsible for Lisbeth.

314
00:33:23,588 --> 00:33:28,264
She's not strong enough to
meet with anyone other than her lawyer.

315
00:33:28,468 --> 00:33:32,905
The prosecutor has given me
specific instructions to asses her.

316
00:33:34,588 --> 00:33:38,900
I'd hoped to avoid getting formal with
a colleague, but you leave me no choice.

317
00:33:39,108 --> 00:33:43,340
As a fellow doctor you should know that
it's my diagnosis that counts...

318
00:33:43,548 --> 00:33:46,540
...regardless of the prosecutor's wishes.

319
00:33:46,748 --> 00:33:50,343
So, you'll have to be patient
and wait until I change my diagnosis.

320
00:33:54,388 --> 00:33:56,697
Well...

321
00:33:59,228 --> 00:34:03,380
I had hoped for a some
professional courtesy.

322
00:34:07,588 --> 00:34:10,660
Can we rule out the government
knowing anything about it?

323
00:34:10,868 --> 00:34:16,181
They must have known a Russian spy
had defected to Sweden.

324
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:20,142
We had a conservative government in '76
when Zalachenko defected.

325
00:34:20,348 --> 00:34:22,862
30 years, and nothing has leaked out.

326
00:34:23,068 --> 00:34:27,300
It couldn't be kept secret, if many
politicians were aware of it.

327
00:34:27,508 --> 00:34:30,102
A lot of them have would have written memoirs by now.

328
00:34:30,308 --> 00:34:34,984
The same's true of the Security Services.
It would have leaked out sooner or later.

329
00:34:36,028 --> 00:34:40,943
There must be a small secret group
acting independantly.

330
00:34:41,148 --> 00:34:43,378
One with substantial resources and influence.

331
00:34:43,588 --> 00:34:49,026
If there were no leaks about the group in
30 years, where do we start digging?

332
00:34:49,228 --> 00:34:52,026
Our best bet is Evert Gullberg.

333
00:34:53,468 --> 00:34:56,904
There's a good chance of getting somewhere
By digging into his background.

334
00:34:57,108 --> 00:35:00,339
However, it mustn't take too long
or Millennium will be in trouble.

335
00:35:00,548 --> 00:35:04,018
The magazine release has to
coincide with the trial.

336
00:35:17,388 --> 00:35:19,344
Take a look at this, please.

337
00:35:22,908 --> 00:35:27,265
How am I doing?
- You're steadily improving.

338
00:35:29,668 --> 00:35:35,345
I'll make sure you get help
to get started with physiotherapy.

339
00:35:35,548 --> 00:35:40,178
I don't need any help.
- You do - and don't scratch the scab.

340
00:35:41,908 --> 00:35:44,820
What's more, you need to eat better.

341
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:47,983
Have you tried the food recently?

342
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:51,942
The food?
- Get me a pizza or something.

343
00:35:52,988 --> 00:35:58,938
I doubt the budget covers pizza.

344
00:36:00,108 --> 00:36:03,498
A certain Dr. Peter Teleborian wanted to see you.

345
00:36:05,268 --> 00:36:08,943
He said that you'd had contact in the past.

346
00:36:11,988 --> 00:36:15,219
Anyway, he had to leave disappointed.

347
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:18,826
Good...

348
00:37:14,428 --> 00:37:16,896
It seems this is for you.

349
00:38:03,988 --> 00:38:08,504
Hello. We were at the hospital the same
night Lisbeth Salander was brought in.

350
00:38:08,708 --> 00:38:12,542
Yes, I do remember.
- I want to talk to you about something.

351
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:16,457
I can't disclose any information
about Lisbeth Salander.

352
00:38:16,668 --> 00:38:22,538
No, I have information about Lisbeth
for you. Important information.

353
00:38:24,628 --> 00:38:29,418
A conspiracy like that... sorry,
but it sounds extremely unlikely.

354
00:38:29,628 --> 00:38:34,577
I can understand your scepticism,
but I assure you - it's all true.

355
00:38:34,788 --> 00:38:38,383
Everything has been documented
and I'm publishing the full story.

356
00:38:38,588 --> 00:38:42,945
I'm preparing the defence for Lisbeth's trial.
That's why I'm here.

357
00:38:44,908 --> 00:38:48,821
I'll only ask you one thing.
- What's that?

358
00:38:49,028 --> 00:38:51,906
Lisbeth has secrets.

359
00:38:53,348 --> 00:38:57,227
Personal ones. She may need them
for her defence.

360
00:38:57,428 --> 00:39:00,864
To gain access to evidence she'll need this.

361
00:39:04,068 --> 00:39:08,778
The prosecutor has imposed restrictions.
- That's why I'm asking you.

362
00:39:12,948 --> 00:39:15,667
Hi, how are you doing?
- Fine.

363
00:39:16,708 --> 00:39:18,858
May I examine you a little?
- Sure.

364
00:39:19,628 --> 00:39:21,664
Let's take a look...

365
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:25,546
Do you feel any pain?
- No.

366
00:39:27,628 --> 00:39:30,586
Any headaches?
- mild ones.

367
00:39:30,788 --> 00:39:33,780
They are gradually improving.
- That's good.

368
00:39:34,628 --> 00:39:37,347
The Stockholm police called again.

369
00:39:37,548 --> 00:39:41,939
Hans Faste was his name. He said he was
in charge of the investigation.

370
00:39:42,148 --> 00:39:44,787
He wanted to come here to interrogate you.

371
00:39:44,988 --> 00:39:48,105
Can you bend your head backwards slightly?

372
00:39:48,308 --> 00:39:53,587
Not too far. I'm a little annoyed
that they're so persistent.

373
00:39:54,508 --> 00:39:58,740
I can't keep refusing on grounds of your 
medical condition for much longer.

374
00:39:58,948 --> 00:40:03,305
You're improving rapidly.
Do you understand?

375
00:40:03,508 --> 00:40:08,024
I told him that you needed a couple of
more weeks of rehabilitation.

376
00:40:09,348 --> 00:40:14,376
After that you'll be transferred to
prison in Stockholm.

377
00:40:14,588 --> 00:40:19,104
I've seen the tattoo on your back.
It's rather large.

378
00:40:19,308 --> 00:40:22,698
Why d'you get it done?
- Why d'you ask?

379
00:40:22,908 --> 00:40:26,264
Pure curiosity.
- For personal reasons I don't want to share.

380
00:40:28,108 --> 00:40:30,668
Okay. Sorry.

381
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:45,265
It must have hurt and taken alot of time.

382
00:40:45,468 --> 00:40:48,540
Yeah, both.

383
00:40:49,588 --> 00:40:52,022
Excuse me.

384
00:41:22,908 --> 00:41:27,663
Hi Lisbeth. You can recount
your version of events with this.

385
00:41:27,868 --> 00:41:29,779
Your memoirs.

386
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:35,301
Annika doesn't know that you have your PDA now,
and it's better to keep it that way.

387
00:41:35,508 --> 00:41:38,705
Should I give her the DVD?

388
00:41:38,908 --> 00:41:42,184
We also need to know more about Teleborian.

389
00:41:42,388 --> 00:41:46,381
I'm staying in your apartment.
Mine's under observation and possibly bugged.

390
00:41:56,908 --> 00:42:02,221
Murder suspect Lisbeth Salander will be
transferred from Sahlgrenska in Göteborg...

391
00:42:02,428 --> 00:42:06,706
...to Kronoberg prison in Stockholm
as soon as her condition permits.

392
00:42:06,908 --> 00:42:09,376
According to a police spokesman.

393
00:42:09,588 --> 00:42:15,345
The trial is scheduled for the beginning
of November this year.

394
00:42:23,948 --> 00:42:26,143
Plague, are you there?

395
00:43:08,228 --> 00:43:13,541
It's okay to give the DVD to Annika.
But I'll write about the rape myself.

396
00:43:14,388 --> 00:43:17,221
I've contacted Plague about Teleborian.

397
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:20,943
He'll contact you if he finds anything.

398
00:43:49,868 --> 00:43:52,746
I have links to the government.

399
00:43:52,948 --> 00:43:58,386
Guess who visited the Prime Minister at the
Cabinet Office on October 5, 1976?

400
00:43:59,188 --> 00:44:04,216
No guesses? Evert Gullberg and a person named
Hans von Rottinger.

401
00:44:04,428 --> 00:44:07,659
They were there three weeks after
Zalachenko defected.

402
00:44:07,868 --> 00:44:12,146
How did you find that out?
- I checked the visitor's book.

403
00:44:12,348 --> 00:44:16,261
There was only one visit, on October 5, 1976.

404
00:44:17,708 --> 00:44:19,664
Well done, Christer.

405
00:44:19,868 --> 00:44:25,738
however, we still need to prove that they were
there to provide information about Zalachenko.

406
00:44:26,628 --> 00:44:31,463
Did you find any notes?
- No, just names and dates.

407
00:44:32,828 --> 00:44:37,424
Where do we go from here?
- We'll check the Secretaries of State.

408
00:44:37,628 --> 00:44:41,985
Two people who worked there 
might know something.
- Do we have any names?

409
00:44:42,188 --> 00:44:45,464
One's dead and the other's
a retired ambassador.

410
00:44:45,668 --> 00:44:49,104
His name is Bengt Janeryd
and he lives outside Grisslehamn.

411
00:44:49,308 --> 00:44:53,745
We should have a chat with him.
- Good. I'll take care of that.

412
00:44:53,948 --> 00:44:57,827
I know the case better than you do,
so I am more of a threat to him.

413
00:45:04,828 --> 00:45:07,137
I said...
- Yes, I heard what you said...

414
00:45:07,348 --> 00:45:09,259
Address?

415
00:45:10,308 --> 00:45:12,185
Okay.

416
00:45:15,388 --> 00:45:17,344
And you...

417
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,504
...well done!

418
00:45:41,468 --> 00:45:45,507
You're aware that Gullberg
has shot Zalachenko, aren't you?

419
00:45:45,708 --> 00:45:48,268
Did you read it in the newspapers?
- Yes.

420
00:45:49,068 --> 00:45:54,779
Why didn't you call the police?
- I thought I'd wait for them to call.

421
00:45:54,988 --> 00:45:58,867
That sounds likely.
- I didn't know anything about his daughter.

422
00:45:59,068 --> 00:46:01,946
What she went through was terrible.

423
00:46:02,148 --> 00:46:05,663
However, the Prime Minister wasn't aware of it.

424
00:46:05,868 --> 00:46:07,540
Neither was I.

425
00:46:08,468 --> 00:46:12,347
You need to convince me and
the Millennium readers about that.

426
00:46:12,548 --> 00:46:16,985
I forbid you to publish my name in
connection with this.

427
00:46:17,188 --> 00:46:20,066
I didn't have anything to do with it.

428
00:46:20,748 --> 00:46:23,342
What I've read here is new to me.

429
00:46:23,548 --> 00:46:28,781
You've only read only some of the material
we're publishing. There's a lot more.

430
00:46:28,988 --> 00:46:31,058
Everything can be proved.

431
00:46:31,268 --> 00:46:35,864
I won't hang you out to dry, but you
are liable, and you have a responsibility.

432
00:46:36,068 --> 00:46:40,220
So tell me now and I'll keep
your name out of it.

433
00:46:40,428 --> 00:46:43,465
That's blackmail.
- Call it what you will.

434
00:46:43,668 --> 00:46:47,707
If you talk, I promise you
not to publish your name.

435
00:46:50,148 --> 00:46:54,346
Did the prime minister have contact with
Evert Gullberg and Hans von Rottinger?

436
00:46:54,548 --> 00:46:56,903
Did you also contact them?
- Yes.

437
00:46:57,108 --> 00:47:01,704
There was one other, named Clinton,
like the American president.

438
00:47:01,908 --> 00:47:03,500
Clinton?
- Yes.

439
00:47:03,708 --> 00:47:06,541
How often did you meet?

440
00:47:06,748 --> 00:47:11,105
A dozen times during my time as
a Secretary of State.

441
00:47:11,308 --> 00:47:15,142
I didn't know anything.
Only that Zalachenko collaborated...

442
00:47:15,348 --> 00:47:18,784
...and that the information he gave
was invaluable.

443
00:47:18,988 --> 00:47:21,138
Who took over the contact then?

444
00:47:21,348 --> 00:47:23,782
I don't know.

445
00:47:25,388 --> 00:47:28,107
You didn't hand over to anyone?
- No.

446
00:47:28,308 --> 00:47:30,617
And you didn't write any report?

447
00:47:30,828 --> 00:47:34,343
No, everything was top secret, naturally.

448
00:47:34,548 --> 00:47:37,938
I didn't even take notes during meetings.

449
00:47:38,148 --> 00:47:42,699
So, no subsequent governments
had any idea...

450
00:47:42,908 --> 00:47:46,662
...that there was a Soviet defector
in Sweden?

451
00:47:48,108 --> 00:47:51,544
It might sound incredible,
but that's the way it was.

452
00:48:03,548 --> 00:48:05,778
What's up?
- We've got a problem.

453
00:48:05,988 --> 00:48:10,345
I've checked Teleborian's hard disk
and e-mails but haven't found anything.

454
00:48:10,548 --> 00:48:14,427
Nothing?
- Nothing about you or the trial.

455
00:48:14,628 --> 00:48:17,904
The only thing of interest
is two short e-mails...

456
00:48:18,108 --> 00:48:21,066
...sent by Jonas through Hotmail.

457
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:27,626
"PSU 1 ready next week".
It's dated September 20, this year.

458
00:48:27,828 --> 00:48:32,948
The second's equally brief:
"PSU 2 ready tomorrow".

459
00:48:33,148 --> 00:48:38,347
PSU? Psychiatric opinion?

460
00:48:38,548 --> 00:48:41,301
Yes, could be.

461
00:48:41,508 --> 00:48:43,339
No files?
- No.

462
00:48:43,548 --> 00:48:46,858
He didn't send anything
from his PC at work.

463
00:48:47,068 --> 00:48:50,822
He's probably got laptop
with mobile broadband.

464
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:55,579
It might be difficult to access.
- But not impossible?

465
00:48:55,788 --> 00:48:57,904
Given sufficient time, anything's is possible.

466
00:48:58,868 --> 00:49:05,216
I'll keep an eye on his mailbox.
- Do it. But don't call me again.

467
00:49:05,428 --> 00:49:08,147
Send me Text or E-mail.
- Okay, bye.

468
00:49:09,428 --> 00:49:11,305
Damn it!

469
00:49:33,548 --> 00:49:38,099
Hello, Mikael Blomkvist. I'm Monica Figuerola,
Constitutional Protection Department.

470
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:42,017
Yes?
- I'd like to invite you for a chat.

471
00:49:43,748 --> 00:49:48,264
It's an informal invitation.
There's nothing to worry about.

472
00:49:48,468 --> 00:49:52,256
Can I get my mail first?
- Of course.

473
00:49:52,468 --> 00:49:55,858
And a pair of clean underpants?
- Absolutely.

474
00:50:22,588 --> 00:50:25,341
Torsten Edklinth,
Constitutional Protection Department.

475
00:50:25,548 --> 00:50:28,460
Blomkvist.
- Please, take a seat.

476
00:50:29,908 --> 00:50:33,662
You probably know why we
want to speak to you.

477
00:50:33,868 --> 00:50:36,587
So let's get straight to the point.

478
00:50:37,588 --> 00:50:42,787
We have information that there's
a secret group, a conspiracy...

479
00:50:42,988 --> 00:50:47,061
...in an exceptionally sensitive
area of state administration.

480
00:50:48,468 --> 00:50:54,657
My meeting with the Prime Minister yesterday
evening has intigated a full blown investigation.

481
00:50:54,868 --> 00:50:57,462
Meaning...?

482
00:50:57,668 --> 00:50:59,943
A complete investigation.

483
00:51:02,108 --> 00:51:07,978
The report will go straight to the
General Prosecutor, who'll decide
whether to prosecute.

484
00:51:11,748 --> 00:51:17,345
But we need some time to identify
those involved.

485
00:51:17,548 --> 00:51:20,938
I understand.
Where do I come in?

486
00:51:21,148 --> 00:51:23,742
We need to know when you're planning to publish.

487
00:51:23,948 --> 00:51:28,419
If happens before the investigation is complete,
it could jeopardize the whole operation.

488
00:51:29,868 --> 00:51:33,463
When do you think I can publish?

489
00:51:33,668 --> 00:51:37,058
We have no way of knowing that yet.

490
00:51:37,268 --> 00:51:41,580
It's entirely up to you, but I'm
asking for your cooperation.

491
00:51:48,948 --> 00:51:51,508
I have this to say...

492
00:51:52,548 --> 00:51:55,824
The state, the government, the Secret Service:
they all piss me off...

493
00:51:56,028 --> 00:51:59,941
...as well as all the other fucking assholes
who locked up a twelve-year-old girl...

494
00:52:00,148 --> 00:52:05,381
...in a mental hospital, for absolutely no reason,
and declare her mentally incompetent.

495
00:52:05,588 --> 00:52:09,501
I'm also very upset about
what happened to Lisbeth Salander.

496
00:52:09,708 --> 00:52:12,745
and those responsible will be punished.

497
00:52:13,788 --> 00:52:19,420
But until then, we have to identify
all involved.

498
00:52:19,628 --> 00:52:21,619
That's exactly what I want as well.

499
00:52:21,828 --> 00:52:27,903
But I also want Lisbeth Salander
acquitted and declared competent.

500
00:52:28,708 --> 00:52:33,259
Neither we nor the goverment can get
involved, I'm sure you understand.

501
00:52:47,388 --> 00:52:51,666
As long as I get full access
to the results of your investigation...

502
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:55,383
...you can tell me what to publish and when.

503
00:52:55,588 --> 00:52:58,261
Information for information.

504
00:53:00,308 --> 00:53:03,505
That can easily be arranged.

505
00:53:03,708 --> 00:53:09,021
It's up to us who we recruit
for the investigation.

506
00:53:09,228 --> 00:53:13,619
We can recruit Mikael Blomkvist
as an external consultant.

507
00:53:19,588 --> 00:53:23,866
Evert Gullberg.
Do you have any other names?

508
00:53:24,108 --> 00:53:28,181
Hans von Rottinger, Frederick Clinton.
One is dead, the other has retired.

509
00:53:28,388 --> 00:53:32,666
Both were active in the group during the
'70 and '80s. - Group?

510
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:37,263
Can we give it a working title?
Maybe we should call it "The Section".

511
00:53:37,468 --> 00:53:39,936
The Section? Ok.

512
00:53:41,188 --> 00:53:43,748
How did you find out about them?

513
00:53:45,908 --> 00:53:48,502
I have a reliable source.

514
00:53:49,788 --> 00:53:53,781
Should we make that the working title?
- Absolutely, I'll take care of it.

515
00:53:56,908 --> 00:54:02,699
I was strapped onto the bed.
Peter Teleborian stood next to the bed.

516
00:54:02,908 --> 00:54:07,504
He smelled of aftershave.
I hated his smell.

517
00:54:07,708 --> 00:54:13,340
I heard his breathing change
and saw his mouth move.

518
00:54:13,548 --> 00:54:16,221
But I couldn't make out what he was saying.

519
00:54:16,428 --> 00:54:19,067
I hated his mouth.

520
00:54:19,268 --> 00:54:22,465
That was the night of my thirteenth Birthday.

521
00:54:42,188 --> 00:54:44,179
Niedermann is your brother.

522
00:55:31,268 --> 00:55:34,066
Come on Buster, search!

523
00:55:35,108 --> 00:55:37,542
Yes, search.
- 80-1651, come in.

524
00:55:38,508 --> 00:55:40,339
Come in, 1651.

525
00:55:40,548 --> 00:55:44,223
We've searched the lower floor.
It's clear.

526
00:55:55,788 --> 00:56:00,179
Someone broke into the house
next door, but the police is there.

527
00:56:00,388 --> 00:56:03,027
Do you need anything to help you sleep?

528
00:56:26,468 --> 00:56:30,666
Lisbeth tried on several occasions
to inform social services...

529
00:56:30,868 --> 00:56:33,780
...about Zalachenko's abuse
of her mother...

530
00:56:33,988 --> 00:56:38,459
...but nobody took the ten year old
girl's accusations seriously.

531
00:56:38,668 --> 00:56:43,264
Finally, Lisbeth was driven to killing 
her father in order to save her mother...

532
00:56:43,468 --> 00:56:47,746
...by throwing a milk carton
full of petrol into his face...

533
00:56:47,948 --> 00:56:50,701
...followed by a lit match.

534
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:53,217
Only then did society react.

535
00:56:53,428 --> 00:56:57,137
But not by punishing
Alexander Zalachenko.

536
00:56:57,348 --> 00:57:00,306
Instead, Lisbeth was punished.

537
00:57:00,508 --> 00:57:06,424
At twelve, she was committed to St Stephen's,
a psychiatric hospital in Uppsala.

538
00:57:06,628 --> 00:57:12,385
On her release, she was declared legally
incompetent and placed under trusteeship.

539
00:57:20,788 --> 00:57:22,426
It's me.
-Why are you calling?

540
00:57:22,628 --> 00:57:26,701
Teleborian is meeting with Jonas
at four in the shopping centre.

541
00:57:26,908 --> 00:57:29,217
What time is it now?
- Nearly half past three.

542
00:57:29,428 --> 00:57:31,066
Fuck!

543
00:57:33,468 --> 00:57:38,019
Hi. I'm here to take some blood.
- I just need to go to the toilet.

544
00:58:01,468 --> 00:58:04,505
Yes, Christer.
- I'm on the staircase.

545
00:58:04,708 --> 00:58:09,065
Yes, I see you now.
I'm just below you.

546
00:58:11,628 --> 00:58:16,065
Teleborian's in the centre of the hall.
Christer, you go. I'll stay here.

547
00:58:16,268 --> 00:58:18,065
Ok.

548
00:58:18,268 --> 00:58:22,466
You should see him soon.
Black jacket.

549
00:58:22,668 --> 00:58:25,705
I see him. He just standing waiting.

550
00:58:25,908 --> 00:58:30,265
Keep an eye on him, but don't get too close.
- No, I'm just watching him.

551
00:58:30,948 --> 00:58:33,781
Someone's coming. It must be Jonas.

552
00:58:33,988 --> 00:58:37,105
Grey jacket, middle-aged.
I don't recognize him.

553
00:58:37,308 --> 00:58:41,096
Now they're leaving. Shall I...?
- Yes, follow them!

554
00:58:41,308 --> 00:58:44,505
They've exited onto Vasagatan.
- Keep following them.

555
00:58:53,108 --> 00:58:58,785
Mikael here. Teleborian's meeting
someone who works for the Section.

556
00:58:58,988 --> 00:59:02,503
Ok, where?
- Vasagatan. Are you coming?

557
00:59:02,708 --> 00:59:05,017
Ok. Yes, I'm on my way.

558
00:59:23,908 --> 00:59:25,785
Hi.
- Hello.

559
00:59:26,828 --> 00:59:28,625
They're in there.

560
00:59:50,828 --> 00:59:53,979
Micke.
- They're leaving now.

561
00:59:54,188 --> 00:59:57,783
Follow Teleborian.
We'll follow the other one.

562
01:00:05,148 --> 01:00:08,663
Monica here.
I need information about a car.

563
01:00:34,868 --> 01:00:38,144
Guess who went in there four hours ago.
- Who?

564
01:00:38,348 --> 01:00:40,464
Fredrik Clinton.

565
01:00:43,548 --> 01:00:46,665
Teleborian's statement?
- It's a draft.

566
01:00:46,868 --> 01:00:50,622
It needs editing,
but it looks good.

567
01:01:09,668 --> 01:01:14,059
Did Teleborian go from a meeting with
Jonas Sandberg of the Section...

568
01:01:14,268 --> 01:01:17,146
...to a meeting at the police station?

569
01:01:19,428 --> 01:01:21,703
With whom?
- We'll find out.

570
01:01:22,268 --> 01:01:27,661
Jonas Sandberg joined the security department
in 1998. For counter-espionage.

571
01:01:27,868 --> 01:01:32,498
In 2001 he was transferred
to a secret location abroad.

572
01:01:32,708 --> 01:01:36,986
He's supposedly working at the embassy in
Madrid, but they've never heard of him.

573
01:01:37,188 --> 01:01:39,622
These are the Section's properties.

574
01:01:39,828 --> 01:01:42,661
A block of apartments, six floors,
23 flats.

575
01:01:42,868 --> 01:01:47,498
I've checked all tenants
but nothing unusual came out.

576
01:01:48,548 --> 01:01:53,861
In addition there is the penthouse.
11 rooms and a kitchen.

577
01:01:54,068 --> 01:01:58,266
A company called Bellona owns it.
The owners live abroad.

578
01:01:58,468 --> 01:02:00,777
Can we get a camera up there?
- Do we have the authority for that?

579
01:02:00,988 --> 01:02:05,186
I'll get the authority,
if you can manage a pot of tea.

580
01:02:06,628 --> 01:02:09,620
Never mind, I'll have one at home.

581
01:02:19,348 --> 01:02:21,703
Hello.
- Hi.

582
01:02:24,108 --> 01:02:26,144
Am I interrupting you?
- Yes.

583
01:02:26,348 --> 01:02:29,784
I'll be back.
- I've nearly finished it.

584
01:02:40,068 --> 01:02:44,903
I just wanted to warn you
that the police is coming tomorrow.

585
01:02:45,108 --> 01:02:46,666
Ok.

586
01:02:46,868 --> 01:02:52,340
I could delay it a couple of days, but...

587
01:02:52,548 --> 01:02:56,143
...my colleagues would be suspicious.
- So leave it.

588
01:02:56,348 --> 01:02:58,339
You sure?
- Yes.

589
01:03:00,188 --> 01:03:04,101
You don't seem particularly worried.
- No.

590
01:03:07,788 --> 01:03:10,700
I have a present for you.

591
01:03:10,908 --> 01:03:12,864
What for?

592
01:03:14,508 --> 01:03:19,343
You've been one of my most entertaining
patients in a long time.

593
01:03:23,188 --> 01:03:28,785
In case you get bored in jail...
The latest on DNA research.

594
01:03:34,188 --> 01:03:37,419
Your mobile phone...
- It's in the chocolate box.

595
01:04:06,428 --> 01:04:09,784
Teleborian has written an expert opinion.

596
01:04:09,988 --> 01:04:14,459
He'll conclude that you need
closed psychiatric care.

597
01:04:16,068 --> 01:04:18,707
The prosecutor requested it.

598
01:04:18,908 --> 01:04:24,858
So, we'll have to hire an independant
one who will come with his own opinion.

599
01:04:27,508 --> 01:04:30,181
Lisbeth, it's for your own good.

600
01:04:30,948 --> 01:04:35,544
I won't talk to a shrink.
I've already told you.

601
01:04:45,988 --> 01:04:48,741
I hope they'll fit.

602
01:04:51,508 --> 01:04:55,501
You're the only one who'll lose out.

603
01:04:59,428 --> 01:05:01,658
Lisbeth...

604
01:05:40,148 --> 01:05:42,582
Make way please.
- Miss Salander?

605
01:05:42,788 --> 01:05:46,747
How are you feeling, Miss Salander?
- Lisbeth...

606
01:05:46,948 --> 01:05:49,143
Do you have any comments?

607
01:06:15,588 --> 01:06:19,501
Today murder suspect Lisbeth Salander
was transferred under police escort...

608
01:06:19,708 --> 01:06:24,304
...from Sahlgrenska in Göteborg
to Kronoberg prison in Stockholm.

609
01:06:24,508 --> 01:06:28,342
According to prosecutor Richard Ekström
the trial...

610
01:06:28,548 --> 01:06:31,187
...has been scheduled for November 6.

611
01:06:31,388 --> 01:06:34,585
Lisbeth Salander has been accused...

612
01:06:34,788 --> 01:06:38,701
...of the alledged attempted murder of
her father, Alexander Zalachenko...

613
01:06:38,908 --> 01:06:43,026
...who was later brutally murdered
at Sahlgrenska Hospital.

614
01:06:43,228 --> 01:06:47,858
There will be increased security
surrounding the trial...

615
01:06:48,068 --> 01:06:51,947
...after threats were made during
the course of police investigation.

616
01:07:16,548 --> 01:07:20,461
Sonny? When the hell did you get out?
- This morning.

617
01:07:20,668 --> 01:07:23,785
Magge too?
- No, he'll have to stay a little longer.

618
01:07:23,988 --> 01:07:25,706
Good to see you again.

619
01:07:25,908 --> 01:07:29,378
The police conducted a raid
the day you were arrested.

620
01:07:29,588 --> 01:07:35,265
They found nothing. Later on that blond
bastard passed by and needed a hideout...

621
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:38,221
...you know: yours and Magge's buddy.

622
01:07:38,428 --> 01:07:42,182
He's not my buddy, damn it!
He's wanted throughout Sweden.

623
01:07:42,388 --> 01:07:47,416
So that's why he needed a hideout.
I sent him to Viktor's place.

624
01:08:17,628 --> 01:08:19,300
Fuck...

625
01:08:19,508 --> 01:08:21,738
Sonny!

626
01:08:23,188 --> 01:08:25,543
What the hell...

627
01:08:27,028 --> 01:08:29,747
Jenny... Jenny!

628
01:08:31,508 --> 01:08:32,861
Jenny!

629
01:08:39,428 --> 01:08:43,706
Jenny? It's me, Sonny.

630
01:08:44,708 --> 01:08:46,346
Who was it?

631
01:08:46,548 --> 01:08:48,425
Nied...

632
01:08:48,628 --> 01:08:50,823
Niedermann.

633
01:08:52,468 --> 01:08:54,823
Viktor, Viktor...

634
01:08:58,148 --> 01:09:02,938
Niedermann...
He'll fucking die for this.

635
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:08,219
He will fucking die for this!

636
01:09:10,988 --> 01:09:14,503
Lisbeth Salander's Autobiography...

637
01:09:16,668 --> 01:09:22,459
Can any of this be proved?
- Impossible. They have no proof.

638
01:09:24,268 --> 01:09:28,898
Blomkvist is no fool.
Nor is Erika Berger.

639
01:09:30,588 --> 01:09:36,777
We have to try harder
to contain them.

640
01:09:36,988 --> 01:09:39,456
Press the green button.

641
01:09:40,708 --> 01:09:44,098
We don't have much time.
Let's pump up the pressure.

642
01:09:44,308 --> 01:09:48,221
Who's turn is it today?
- It's Malin's, isn't it?

643
01:09:48,428 --> 01:09:50,384
Hi. How's it going?

644
01:09:51,028 --> 01:09:55,738
You want sushi?
- No sushi. No fish. Chicken teriyaki for me.

645
01:09:55,948 --> 01:09:59,338
Are you having lunch, Micke?
- No, I don't have time.
Ok. Erika, eight pieces?

646
01:09:59,548 --> 01:10:05,000
"You slept with the lights on last night.
Are you afraid of the dark, Erica?
And were late for work today.
I'm watching. Wonder what I want?"


647
01:10:05,428 --> 01:10:08,704
Can I replace my battery with yours?
Mine's flat.

648
01:10:09,748 --> 01:10:13,377
Micke... have a look.

649
01:10:16,228 --> 01:10:19,982
It's anonymous. I think it's from
the same sender as the last.

650
01:10:20,188 --> 01:10:23,498
Have you had many?
- I got one last week.

651
01:10:23,708 --> 01:10:27,098
Why didn't you say anything?
- I didn't take it seriously.

652
01:10:31,868 --> 01:10:35,019
Let's keep it to ourselves for now.
We'll talk about it later today.

653
01:10:35,228 --> 01:10:37,617
May I take it then?
- Take it.

654
01:10:40,708 --> 01:10:44,178
Would you like to have eight pieces?
- I'm not so hungry today.

655
01:10:44,388 --> 01:10:46,583
I'll skip a meal.

656
01:10:54,668 --> 01:10:57,136
You're due at the hearing.

657
01:11:13,188 --> 01:11:16,305
So, we finally meet.

658
01:11:16,508 --> 01:11:19,580
Ekström, prosecutor.

659
01:11:26,828 --> 01:11:33,222
Let's view this initial meeting as more
of a conversation than interrogation.

660
01:11:33,428 --> 01:11:37,387
A way to bring some order
to this complicated story.

661
01:11:37,588 --> 01:11:41,467
I assume you don't have
anything against that?

662
01:11:43,108 --> 01:11:46,180
The charges against you are serious.

663
01:11:46,388 --> 01:11:52,338
However, as a prosecutor I have to
consider all mitigating circumstances.

664
01:11:52,548 --> 01:11:57,144
It's important that you are aware of that,
for your own sake.

665
01:12:02,068 --> 01:12:05,026
It's a simple question.
Answer yes or no.

666
01:12:05,228 --> 01:12:07,947
When you went to Gosseberga
to meet your dad...

667
01:12:08,148 --> 01:12:11,936
...did you already have plans
to kill him?

668
01:12:14,548 --> 01:12:19,338
I will ask counsel once again
to convince Miss Salander to respond.

669
01:12:19,548 --> 01:12:25,305
And I repeat that it's up my client to
decide whether she wishes to answer.

670
01:12:33,708 --> 01:12:38,702
I must ask counsel to have a serious
talk with Miss Salander.

671
01:12:40,308 --> 01:12:43,823
For her own sake.

672
01:12:49,908 --> 01:12:52,103
Well...

673
01:12:52,308 --> 01:12:57,336
I was surprised how small and delicate
she is, like a little girl.

674
01:12:57,548 --> 01:13:01,461
The trial begins on the 13th.
The magazine has to be ready then.

675
01:13:01,668 --> 01:13:04,307
We go to press the week before.

676
01:13:04,508 --> 01:13:08,342
How can we manage that?
- We'll all have to help.

677
01:13:09,508 --> 01:13:15,219
You and Malin write about Teleborian's
background and a bit about St.Stephen's.

678
01:13:15,428 --> 01:13:18,386
Approximately 30 pages. Is that ok?

679
01:13:18,588 --> 01:13:20,738
Yes, that's fine.
- Good.

680
01:13:23,348 --> 01:13:25,020
Well...

681
01:13:26,108 --> 01:13:28,827
And there's another thing.

682
01:13:31,148 --> 01:13:35,426
I've received two anonymous e-mails...

683
01:13:35,628 --> 01:13:38,700
...during the course of the past
week, of which you need to be aware.

684
01:13:39,548 --> 01:13:41,266
Threats?

685
01:13:45,948 --> 01:13:49,463
Shit!
What fucking idiot could do that?

686
01:13:49,668 --> 01:13:53,024
Have you informed the police?
- I don't want to involve the police.

687
01:13:53,228 --> 01:13:56,698
But they're threatening Erika.

688
01:13:56,908 --> 01:14:02,107
We are taking it seriously. But I
don't want police here at the office.

689
01:14:02,308 --> 01:14:06,779
So, you'll just forget about it?
- No. That's not what I said.

690
01:14:06,988 --> 01:14:09,343
I'll sort it out myself.
- How?

691
01:14:09,548 --> 01:14:13,826
The police wont't help.
They don't give a shit!

692
01:14:14,028 --> 01:14:17,941
Please, stop it! God!

693
01:14:18,588 --> 01:14:23,059
I haven't had any more, and no harm's
been done. Let's just forget it, Ok?

694
01:14:24,388 --> 01:14:27,425
Next item.
- 30 pages.

695
01:14:27,628 --> 01:14:31,507
How's Lisbeth Salander?
- She's ok, under the circumstances.

696
01:14:31,708 --> 01:14:34,859
Any comment about the allegations?
- No comment.

697
01:14:35,068 --> 01:14:38,617
You're defending her. Surely you
must have something to say.

698
01:14:42,268 --> 01:14:47,137
Hi sweethearts. You're in here?
Sorry I'm late.

699
01:14:47,348 --> 01:14:49,304
I'm glad you've already eaten.

700
01:14:49,508 --> 01:14:53,262
I'm sure you'll find this interesting.
It's Lisbeth's autobiography.

701
01:14:53,468 --> 01:14:56,904
What? When did she write it?

702
01:14:57,108 --> 01:14:59,417
That not important.

703
01:15:03,308 --> 01:15:06,266
Bjurman?
Lisbeth's guardian?

704
01:15:08,108 --> 01:15:11,896
What's this?
- It's a movie.

705
01:15:12,108 --> 01:15:14,144
You need to see it for yourself.

706
01:15:15,188 --> 01:15:20,740
Lisbeth has authorised its use
in the trial, should it come in handy.

707
01:16:28,708 --> 01:16:30,778
Want some?

708
01:17:08,188 --> 01:17:12,306
Is Lisbeth Salander ok now?
- Yes, well enough to be interviewed.

709
01:17:12,508 --> 01:17:16,865
Physically she's fine.
- Meaning not mentally?

710
01:17:17,068 --> 01:17:21,619
Lisbeth Salander's medical history
indicates several years' treatment
in a mental hospital

711
01:17:21,828 --> 01:17:25,343
Is Lisbeth Salander still mentally ill?

712
01:17:25,548 --> 01:17:28,187
I'm not a psychiatrist, but...

713
01:17:28,388 --> 01:17:31,619
...I have requested a psychiatric
evaluation to determine that. 

714
01:17:31,828 --> 01:17:35,025
Who'll be conducting that?
- Dr. Peter Teleborian.

715
01:17:35,228 --> 01:17:38,698
He's chief psychiatrist
at St. Stephen's hospital.

716
01:17:38,908 --> 01:17:42,617
Peter Teleborian...what a surprise.

717
01:18:02,068 --> 01:18:03,626
Christer?

718
01:18:10,348 --> 01:18:13,067
Is it from the same sender?
- Yes.

719
01:18:17,948 --> 01:18:21,099
"It's getting worse now. For all of you".

720
01:18:21,308 --> 01:18:23,378
Is it about all of us?

721
01:18:23,588 --> 01:18:27,183
Has Micke tried to trace the sender?
- He called somebody.

722
01:18:27,388 --> 01:18:30,824
That didn't help much.
We've got to report it.

723
01:18:31,028 --> 01:18:35,419
We can't just wait for something to happen.
- I want to speak with Mikael first.

724
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:40,383
I'll call him right now.
- No. I'm in charge of publishing.

725
01:18:40,588 --> 01:18:45,025
And what's more, I'm the one who received the
e-mails. I will not go behind Mikael's back.

726
01:18:46,588 --> 01:18:50,900
We have to stick together and be united.
Particularly now.

727
01:18:54,748 --> 01:18:56,704
I'll call him.

728
01:19:04,228 --> 01:19:09,780
Mikael Blomkvist. I can't answer right
now, but please leave a message.

729
01:19:10,628 --> 01:19:14,860
Micke, where the hell are you?
I've received another e-mail.

730
01:19:15,068 --> 01:19:18,981
It's not just about me, any more.
And I feel extremely uncomfortable.

731
01:19:19,188 --> 01:19:21,224
Call me.

732
01:19:28,308 --> 01:19:30,538
Hi Lisbeth.

733
01:19:35,948 --> 01:19:40,464
I want you to know how sorry I am
that you got dragged into this.

734
01:19:41,628 --> 01:19:45,018
I'll try to help you in any way I can.

735
01:19:46,788 --> 01:19:52,624
I hope that we can cooperate, you and I.

736
01:19:54,508 --> 01:19:59,821
I feel we got very close, you and I....

737
01:20:00,028 --> 01:20:02,258
...in those days.

738
01:20:03,468 --> 01:20:05,936
You were a stubborn,..

739
01:20:06,148 --> 01:20:10,824
...obstinate
twelve-year-old girl.

740
01:20:13,428 --> 01:20:16,147
You bit my finger once...

741
01:20:17,188 --> 01:20:19,622
...Remember?

742
01:20:21,908 --> 01:20:26,538
You wouldn't understand that physical
contact was crucial to the treatment...

743
01:20:26,748 --> 01:20:30,821
...that it promoted closeness and trust.

744
01:20:32,708 --> 01:20:35,666
Particularly with children.

745
01:20:40,228 --> 01:20:43,459
You do realize that I'm the one person...

746
01:20:43,668 --> 01:20:47,183
...who can help you?

747
01:20:51,788 --> 01:20:53,744
Don't you?

748
01:21:01,388 --> 01:21:06,337
Hi. Are you still here?
- I tried your mobile several times.

749
01:21:06,548 --> 01:21:09,779
I switched it off because I was writing.

750
01:21:10,828 --> 01:21:13,183
Same sender.

751
01:21:16,028 --> 01:21:20,897
Christer was determined to call the 
police today. But I stalled him.

752
01:21:22,868 --> 01:21:26,144
We need to sort this out immediately.

753
01:21:27,148 --> 01:21:30,106
We're running a magazine.

754
01:21:30,308 --> 01:21:34,859
And we're responsible for our staff.
It isn't just about us anymore.

755
01:21:35,068 --> 01:21:39,061
I've contacted one of Lisbeth's
hacker friends, Plague.

756
01:21:39,268 --> 01:21:41,657
Are you saying we don't need to report it?

757
01:21:41,868 --> 01:21:46,066
If anyone can find the sender,
it's him, but it'll take time.

758
01:21:46,268 --> 01:21:48,987
BUT... it's faster than the police.

759
01:21:49,188 --> 01:21:52,385
Are we talking days or weeks?

760
01:21:56,428 --> 01:21:58,658
To be honest, I've no idea.

761
01:22:00,868 --> 01:22:05,942
Let's assume that Millennium has
something to publish...

762
01:22:06,148 --> 01:22:08,139
...what could it possibly be?

763
01:22:08,348 --> 01:22:14,105
Worst-case scenario is they have
a copy of Björck's investigation.

764
01:22:16,708 --> 01:22:19,859
But they still might be unaware
of our involvement.

765
01:22:20,068 --> 01:22:25,347
However, Blomqvist is very credible,
And so is the magazine.

766
01:22:30,228 --> 01:22:34,779
Perhaps we could discredit them?

767
01:22:39,388 --> 01:22:42,107
...All I know is...

768
01:22:42,308 --> 01:22:46,460
...we have to put an end to this,
once and for all.

769
01:23:22,908 --> 01:23:26,105
She called at quarter past three
this morning.

770
01:23:26,308 --> 01:23:29,778
She'd locked herself in an upstairs room.

771
01:23:29,988 --> 01:23:33,264
We got there in 20 minutes.
- Did you find any traces?

772
01:23:33,468 --> 01:23:38,337
The police took care of that.
And we've installed alarms since then.

773
01:23:39,388 --> 01:23:42,186
Erika told me about the e-mails.

774
01:23:42,388 --> 01:23:45,346
They're probably connected with
what happened last night.

775
01:23:45,548 --> 01:23:49,097
I've got a contact trying to trace them,
And I don't want the police involved.

776
01:23:49,308 --> 01:23:53,540
You should. You and Erika are both
the subject of physical threats.

777
01:23:53,748 --> 01:23:55,864
Me?
- Yes, you as well.

778
01:23:56,068 --> 01:23:59,265
The silent alarm was tripped
in your apartment last night.

779
01:24:05,068 --> 01:24:10,540
It took us 17 minutes to get there,
and when we searched the apartment...

780
01:24:10,748 --> 01:24:15,264
...we found 180 grams of cocaine
hidden in one of your speakers...

781
01:24:15,468 --> 01:24:19,825
...as well as 120,000kr cash in your wardrobe.

782
01:24:20,028 --> 01:24:23,100
What the fuck?!
- They're trying to frame you,

783
01:24:23,308 --> 01:24:26,539
As they can't discredit the magazine.

784
01:24:27,588 --> 01:24:30,466
Is it still there?
- Only the money.

785
01:24:30,668 --> 01:24:32,659
We got rid of the coke.

786
01:24:38,108 --> 01:24:42,818
I've got to call Erika.
- I think she's asleep.

787
01:24:50,628 --> 01:24:53,222
Erika.
- Hi, it's me.

788
01:24:59,588 --> 01:25:01,624
I heard what happened. I'm sorry!

789
01:25:01,828 --> 01:25:06,185
I want to see you. Can I come over?
- No, not here.

790
01:25:07,228 --> 01:25:09,344
Let's talk later.

791
01:25:09,548 --> 01:25:12,858
I have to see you right now.
- I need to grab a few hours' sleep.

792
01:25:16,668 --> 01:25:18,340
How about at three o'clock then?

793
01:25:18,548 --> 01:25:20,903
At Samir's Gryta?

794
01:25:21,948 --> 01:25:26,624
Will you come?
- Three's good.

795
01:25:26,828 --> 01:25:29,388
Great. Bye.
- Bye.

796
01:25:43,188 --> 01:25:47,022
I'll print those three pages.

797
01:25:47,228 --> 01:25:49,947
Have you heard from Erika?

798
01:25:50,148 --> 01:25:54,744
I did talk to her. She wasn't feeling
well last night. Catching up on sleep

799
01:25:54,948 --> 01:25:58,827
How is she now?
- Better. Bloody hell, I have to go.

800
01:25:59,028 --> 01:26:01,462
Has she had any more e-mails?

801
01:26:01,668 --> 01:26:06,298
We've really done a great job
with this edition, all of us.

802
01:26:06,508 --> 01:26:10,740
Fancy a beer later?
- Can't, I've got meeting at Samir.

803
01:26:10,948 --> 01:26:15,419
We're not sure how many of these...

804
01:26:15,628 --> 01:26:19,018
...have connections with the Section.

805
01:26:19,228 --> 01:26:22,982
There may be more than we're aware of.

806
01:26:23,188 --> 01:26:27,943
The key players will all be arrested
in a coordinated operation.

807
01:26:28,148 --> 01:26:31,777
You'll have more details later.

808
01:26:33,348 --> 01:26:38,945
It's ten to three. We'll take a break
and reconvene in an hour.

809
01:26:40,948 --> 01:26:44,099
Anything new today?
- Clinton's undergoing dialysis.

810
01:26:44,308 --> 01:26:46,663
The others were coming and going.

811
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:50,224
Jonas Sandberg is probably the only one
who's been active.

812
01:26:50,428 --> 01:26:55,741
He met with two individuals at a
pizzeria in Bredäng at 10:30.

813
01:26:55,948 --> 01:26:59,463
Any idea whom?
- I didn't recognise them.

814
01:26:59,668 --> 01:27:02,705
They looked East European.
- That'll be the Nikolich brothers.

815
01:27:02,908 --> 01:27:07,345
Tomi and Miro Nikolich. Originally from Serbia,
but they've been living in Huddinge.

816
01:27:07,548 --> 01:27:10,824
Very unpleasant characters.
Snipers during the Civil War.

817
01:27:11,028 --> 01:27:15,385
Miro's wanted for assault, but since
they live in Serbia most of the time...

818
01:27:15,588 --> 01:27:17,544
Mikael...

819
01:27:26,628 --> 01:27:28,584
Hi, Samir.

820
01:27:31,268 --> 01:27:34,226
Sorry I'm late.

821
01:27:37,108 --> 01:27:40,418
How are you?
- How do you think?

822
01:27:40,628 --> 01:27:43,506
Why didn't you call last night?
- What could you have done?

823
01:27:43,708 --> 01:27:48,145
I called Milton Security
because I needed help.

824
01:27:55,108 --> 01:27:57,576
We have to back down, Micke.

825
01:27:59,708 --> 01:28:04,498
Samir's Gryta on Söder.
Patch me through immediately, please.

826
01:28:10,828 --> 01:28:15,618
I've called the office and put
everything on hold.
- Everything on hold?

827
01:28:17,828 --> 01:28:21,582
We have to put Malin and
Christer's safety first.

828
01:28:21,788 --> 01:28:26,145
Have you called the printers?
- I don't want the responsibility.

829
01:28:26,348 --> 01:28:28,703
It's too dangerous.
- Damn it...

830
01:28:28,908 --> 01:28:31,900
Micke, there's a call for you.
- No, not now.

831
01:28:32,108 --> 01:28:34,303
They say it's urgent.

832
01:28:42,628 --> 01:28:44,266
Mind out!

833
01:28:53,548 --> 01:28:55,186
Get down!

834
01:28:55,388 --> 01:28:58,027
They're shooting!
- Take a shortcut, here!.

835
01:29:02,868 --> 01:29:04,745
What the hell!

836
01:29:29,628 --> 01:29:30,947
Get down!

837
01:29:37,668 --> 01:29:40,978
Police! Police!
Show me your hands!

838
01:29:43,548 --> 01:29:44,867
Now!

839
01:29:45,948 --> 01:29:49,497
Police! Show me your hands!

840
01:29:53,028 --> 01:29:54,984
How are you?

841
01:29:58,748 --> 01:30:00,864
Are you ok?

842
01:30:02,828 --> 01:30:06,662
Here, wipe yourself off.
- How are you?

843
01:30:07,308 --> 01:30:11,017
Get Blomkvist and Berger
out as fast as possible.

844
01:30:11,228 --> 01:30:14,106
Go through the kitchen!

845
01:30:14,308 --> 01:30:18,221
The two police officers were
dining at the restaurant...

846
01:30:18,428 --> 01:30:22,706
...and recognized the brothers,
one of whom is wanted for assault.

847
01:30:22,908 --> 01:30:27,026
Shots were fired as they tried to
apprehend them, but no one was injured.

848
01:30:27,228 --> 01:30:30,937
The brothers are now under arrest
for attempted murder.

849
01:30:32,468 --> 01:30:35,187
Damn it!

850
01:30:35,388 --> 01:30:37,902
Goddamit!

851
01:30:43,508 --> 01:30:47,023
I spoke to Christer and Malin.

852
01:30:48,028 --> 01:30:51,498
They can't stay at the office now.
- No...

853
01:30:56,628 --> 01:30:59,347
We could have been killed today.

854
01:30:59,548 --> 01:31:01,504
Both of us.

855
01:31:05,108 --> 01:31:09,147
No job's worth dying for.

856
01:31:11,908 --> 01:31:13,660
No.

857
01:31:18,908 --> 01:31:24,062
We don't know if they just wanted
to kill you, Mikael, or Erika as well.

858
01:31:25,348 --> 01:31:30,183
But the plan was that the police
would find the drugs and money...

859
01:31:30,388 --> 01:31:33,858
...and connect it to a
Yugoslavian drugs deal.

860
01:31:34,068 --> 01:31:39,096
What about the others and the office?
- We're closing it for a couple of days.

861
01:31:39,308 --> 01:31:44,257
We're also postponing publication
of the magazine.

862
01:31:45,788 --> 01:31:48,700
I'll organise personal protection
for you and Erika.

863
01:31:48,908 --> 01:31:52,662
No, I don't want anyone following me.

864
01:31:53,908 --> 01:31:58,982
Let's find out what's going on.
- Have you had any contact with her?

865
01:32:00,148 --> 01:32:01,900
What's going to happen?

866
01:32:02,108 --> 01:32:05,305
I will insist on psychiatric
care for Lisbeth Salander...

867
01:32:05,508 --> 01:32:08,625
...as well as a long prison sentence.

868
01:32:08,828 --> 01:32:11,262
Shouldn't it be the other way round?

869
01:32:11,468 --> 01:32:14,028
Normally, but in this case...

870
01:32:14,228 --> 01:32:17,982
...the psychiatric report is
so conclusive...

871
01:32:18,188 --> 01:32:20,907
...that there is no choice.

872
01:32:21,108 --> 01:32:22,905
Thank you very much.

873
01:32:24,068 --> 01:32:28,823
Lisbeth Salander's trial begins
here in Stockholm's District Court...

874
01:32:29,028 --> 01:32:32,145
...at 1 p.m., in about an hour's time.

875
01:32:32,348 --> 01:32:38,457
It is expected to last three days, and has
drawn a large crowd, as you can see.

876
01:32:38,668 --> 01:32:42,183
During the preliminary investigation
both police and prosecutor...

877
01:32:42,388 --> 01:32:46,347
...have been talking to the media, while
defence has consistently refused to comment...

878
01:32:46,548 --> 01:32:49,858
My God. Is it time already?

879
01:32:52,788 --> 01:32:55,905
I didn't even sleep an hour last night.
- It'll all be fine.

880
01:32:56,108 --> 01:32:58,064
Of course...!

881
01:33:01,988 --> 01:33:03,944
It'll go very well.

882
01:33:05,148 --> 01:33:09,300
Sure!
- Thanks. See you later. Bye.

883
01:34:27,148 --> 01:34:29,616
Move back, please. A bit more...

884
01:34:58,588 --> 01:35:00,499
Unfortunately...

885
01:35:00,708 --> 01:35:05,099
...Lisbeth Salander didn't utter
a single word during all seven hearings.

886
01:35:05,308 --> 01:35:10,063
But, that doesn't detract 
from any of the charges.

887
01:35:10,268 --> 01:35:12,020
Thank you.

888
01:35:12,228 --> 01:35:16,187
The floor is now open for the defence.

889
01:35:16,388 --> 01:35:18,185
Thank you.

890
01:35:19,268 --> 01:35:22,897
The defence deny all charges.

891
01:35:23,108 --> 01:35:27,147
I will demonstrate not only that all
the prosecution's allegations are unsound...

892
01:35:27,348 --> 01:35:31,182
...but that my client has been
subjected to serious human rights violations.

893
01:35:31,388 --> 01:35:34,698
I will demand that she be
declared innocent...

894
01:35:34,908 --> 01:35:39,186
...that her guardianship be terminated
and that she be released immediately.

895
01:35:40,308 --> 01:35:42,105
Thank you.

896
01:35:42,308 --> 01:35:45,345
Does the prosecutor have anything to add?

897
01:35:45,548 --> 01:35:52,226
For several reasons I propose that this trial
will be conducted behind closed doors.

898
01:35:52,428 --> 01:35:56,740
The case is about the mental condition and
the welfare of a vulnerable person...

899
01:35:56,948 --> 01:36:00,099
...and about material that is
classified as confidential...

900
01:36:00,308 --> 01:36:04,540
...and in some areas may
affect national security.

901
01:36:10,628 --> 01:36:12,858
We'll talk tonight.

902
01:36:24,508 --> 01:36:26,339
That looks good.

903
01:36:27,028 --> 01:36:32,056
Firstly I would like to clarify...

904
01:36:32,268 --> 01:36:35,340
...why you went to Gosseberga...

905
01:36:35,548 --> 01:36:40,019
...to try and kill your father,
Alexander Zalachenko.

906
01:36:45,748 --> 01:36:49,582
Are we to take your silence, 
as a refusal to answer questions?

907
01:36:49,788 --> 01:36:52,541
I'm happy to answer.

908
01:36:55,028 --> 01:36:57,747
Then perhaps you could answer that question.

909
01:36:57,948 --> 01:37:01,145
I didn't hear any question.

910
01:37:03,108 --> 01:37:07,260
I asked if you went to Gosseberga
with the intention to kill your father.

911
01:37:07,468 --> 01:37:10,824
No, you said you wanted to
try to clarify...

912
01:37:11,028 --> 01:37:15,101
...why I went to Gosseberga
to try to kill my father.

913
01:37:15,308 --> 01:37:18,698
That was merely a general statement
in which you pre-supposed my answer.

914
01:37:18,908 --> 01:37:22,184
Answer the question.
- No.

915
01:37:22,908 --> 01:37:26,867
"No" what?
- That's the answer to the question.

916
01:37:33,948 --> 01:37:37,224
Did you strike your father's head
with an axe?

917
01:37:37,428 --> 01:37:38,827
Yes.

918
01:37:39,028 --> 01:37:43,818
I put it to you that he was seriously
injured and that this was attempted murder.

919
01:37:44,948 --> 01:37:46,620
What is your response to that?

920
01:37:46,828 --> 01:37:50,662
You made two statements. To which one
would you like me to respond?

921
01:37:50,868 --> 01:37:54,702
That striking your fathers head with
an axe was attempted murder.

922
01:37:54,908 --> 01:37:58,378
It wasn't attempted murder.
It was self-defence.

923
01:38:10,108 --> 01:38:11,621
Thank you.

924
01:38:11,828 --> 01:38:14,740
Let me know if you need anything.

925
01:38:14,948 --> 01:38:18,577
Can you get me some cigarettes?
- Forget it.

926
01:38:29,428 --> 01:38:31,146
Thank you.

927
01:38:41,948 --> 01:38:44,143
Hello.
- Hi.

928
01:38:53,988 --> 01:38:58,425
How does it feel to be under guard?
- Not too bad.

929
01:38:58,628 --> 01:39:01,586
As long as they stay outside.

930
01:39:08,708 --> 01:39:10,744
Erika...

931
01:39:13,268 --> 01:39:15,702
I couldn't do it.

932
01:39:23,108 --> 01:39:25,303
You are an egotist.

933
01:39:25,508 --> 01:39:27,658
And an idiot.

934
01:39:34,548 --> 01:39:39,417
I'm staying home this week.
And next.

935
01:39:39,628 --> 01:39:44,019
I want to be sure that I made
the right decision.

936
01:39:44,228 --> 01:39:45,786
Well...

937
01:39:51,708 --> 01:39:55,098
Is it about us or Millennium?

938
01:39:55,308 --> 01:39:57,776
About both...

939
01:39:57,988 --> 01:39:59,944
...I think.

940
01:40:01,668 --> 01:40:03,659
You'll hear from me.

941
01:40:09,228 --> 01:40:11,184
Take care of yourself.

942
01:40:14,348 --> 01:40:15,747
Damn it.

943
01:40:28,988 --> 01:40:31,343
Salander, it's time.

944
01:40:35,508 --> 01:40:39,626
Lisbeth Salander's so-called
autobiography...

945
01:40:39,828 --> 01:40:42,388
...lacks any credibility.

946
01:40:43,708 --> 01:40:47,223
There are a number of allegations
against various people...

947
01:40:47,428 --> 01:40:49,896
...each more absurd than the previous.

948
01:40:50,908 --> 01:40:53,547
It's all symptomatic...

949
01:40:53,748 --> 01:40:58,742
of the paranoid schizophrenia
Lisbeth Salander suffers from.

950
01:40:59,708 --> 01:41:01,664
Can you give an example?

951
01:41:01,868 --> 01:41:07,977
The most obvious is the depiction of rape...

952
01:41:08,188 --> 01:41:10,543
...of which - she alleges -...

953
01:41:10,748 --> 01:41:15,424
...her guardian, advocate Bjurman,
would be guilty of.

954
01:41:15,628 --> 01:41:20,463
The entire story, with such vivid detail...

955
01:41:20,668 --> 01:41:26,379
...is a classic example of
the grotesque fantasies...

956
01:41:26,588 --> 01:41:30,058
...which children tend to exhibit.

957
01:41:31,708 --> 01:41:35,496
But Lisbeth Salander is no longer a child,
she is a mature adult.

958
01:41:35,708 --> 01:41:37,938
It still remains to be determined...

959
01:41:38,148 --> 01:41:44,383
...the exact mental level she operating
under is now.

960
01:41:45,428 --> 01:41:48,340
In principle however, you are right.

961
01:41:49,428 --> 01:41:51,578
I understand.

962
01:41:54,068 --> 01:41:59,620
In 1993 Lisbeth Salander was involuntarily
admitted to St. Stephen's hospital.

963
01:42:00,668 --> 01:42:03,944
During the years she was a patient there,
you were responsible for her.

964
01:42:04,148 --> 01:42:06,742
Is that correct?
- Yes.

965
01:42:08,068 --> 01:42:11,378
For how many days was she lying restrained?

966
01:42:11,588 --> 01:42:14,102
In other words: clamped to the bed.

967
01:42:14,308 --> 01:42:17,937
I don't remember exactly.
But not very many.

968
01:42:18,708 --> 01:42:20,699
Approximately how many?

969
01:42:21,828 --> 01:42:26,856
Possibly... thirty times. But I don't
understand the relevance of this question.

970
01:42:27,068 --> 01:42:31,141
Lisbeth Salander claims it was 381 days.

971
01:42:31,348 --> 01:42:35,136
That is pure fantasy.
It doesn't make any sense.

972
01:42:35,348 --> 01:42:38,704
So tell me, was she not restrained
to the bed for over a year...

973
01:42:38,908 --> 01:42:42,139
...of the two years she was a patient?
- Of course not.

974
01:42:43,108 --> 01:42:49,138
The defence has repeatedly tried
to obtain Lisbeth Salander's file...

975
01:42:49,348 --> 01:42:54,058
...covering the years of incarceration
at St. Stephen's without any success.

976
01:42:54,268 --> 01:42:58,500
Can you please explain the reason?
- Because it's highly confidential.

977
01:42:58,708 --> 01:43:02,826
As is quite normal in these cases.

978
01:43:03,028 --> 01:43:05,826
As a lawyer should be well aware of that.

979
01:43:06,028 --> 01:43:10,783
I have here a copy of Lisbeth Salander's
file, covering the years:

980
01:43:10,988 --> 01:43:13,980
1993 and 1994.

981
01:43:15,148 --> 01:43:20,780
It's clearly stated here that Lisbeth
Salander was physically restrained to
her bed for a full 381 days.

982
01:43:20,988 --> 01:43:26,142
Ms. Giannini, I fail to see the
relevance of that to this trial?

983
01:43:26,348 --> 01:43:31,422
I want to prove that Peter Teleborian is
not being truthful in this matter.

984
01:43:31,628 --> 01:43:38,579
Ms. Giannini, records from
1993 and 1994 can't be used today...

985
01:43:38,788 --> 01:43:43,737
...to cast doubt on Peter Teleborian's credibility.

986
01:43:46,588 --> 01:43:48,465
I understand.

987
01:44:32,508 --> 01:44:34,942
I feel like an idiot.

988
01:44:35,148 --> 01:44:41,223
When the prosecutor submits Teleborian's
new report, it will all have been for nothing.

989
01:44:42,788 --> 01:44:47,464
She'll wind up in the mental hospital again
and there's not a damned thing I can do about it.

990
01:45:25,468 --> 01:45:29,825
"Welcome to your private young girls"

991
01:46:08,148 --> 01:46:09,820
Who the fuck...?

992
01:46:10,028 --> 01:46:11,939
Plague.

993
01:46:14,348 --> 01:46:16,498
What's this?

994
01:46:16,708 --> 01:46:20,781
Peter Teleborian's private PC.
A USB copy

995
01:46:23,188 --> 01:46:25,861
Oh, I'm sorry. Do come in.

996
01:46:28,948 --> 01:46:31,337
What's on it?

997
01:46:31,548 --> 01:46:33,937
Everything you need.

998
01:46:36,188 --> 01:46:39,339
Plus real nasty shit.

999
01:46:56,948 --> 01:47:02,227
Annika, I have everything you'll need
right here. Contact with the Section...

1000
01:47:02,428 --> 01:47:06,387
...Several different version of the
psychiatric report, with falsified dates...

1001
01:47:06,588 --> 01:47:10,501
...e-mail correspondence, everything.

1002
01:47:10,708 --> 01:47:13,222
Ah, there you are. Excellent.

1003
01:47:13,428 --> 01:47:16,898
Here.
- I'll never have time to read all of this.

1004
01:47:17,108 --> 01:47:20,703
Read it over lunch.
The dates are all important.

1005
01:47:20,908 --> 01:47:25,663
Good, great!
See you later. Bye.

1006
01:47:29,628 --> 01:47:31,937
You ended up at St. Stephen's...

1007
01:47:32,148 --> 01:47:35,379
...after dousing your father with petrol
and igniting it.

1008
01:47:35,588 --> 01:47:38,421
Yes.
- Why would you do that?

1009
01:47:40,988 --> 01:47:44,264
Because he had abused my mother
for several years.

1010
01:47:44,468 --> 01:47:48,746
On June 12 1993, he assaulted her
so brutally she became handicapped.

1011
01:47:48,948 --> 01:47:53,624
She suffered permanent brain damage.
- Did you tell anyone?

1012
01:47:54,508 --> 01:47:57,784
Yes, the police officer
who interrogated me...

1013
01:47:57,988 --> 01:48:02,903
...Social Services, a number of
doctors, a priest and that pig there.

1014
01:48:08,268 --> 01:48:12,580
When I arrved at St. Stephen's,
I tried to explain what had happened.

1015
01:48:12,788 --> 01:48:16,701
But he claimed that it was all a
Fantasy. As punishment I was tied to the bed.

1016
01:48:16,908 --> 01:48:21,186
That's utter nonsense.
Another example that your client

1017
01:48:21,388 --> 01:48:25,506
...lacks the capacity to distinguish
between fantasy and reality.

1018
01:48:25,708 --> 01:48:31,499
You're lying, you fucking bastard!
- Lisbeth Salander, I won't tolerate
that language in my court.

1019
01:48:33,268 --> 01:48:37,659
I would like to move on now
to the sexual abuse...

1020
01:48:37,868 --> 01:48:42,146
...that my client was subjected to
at the hands of advocate Nils Bjurman.

1021
01:48:42,348 --> 01:48:44,942
That has no relevance to this case.

1022
01:48:45,148 --> 01:48:49,585
Those allegations are absurd and
totally unsubstanciated!

1023
01:48:49,788 --> 01:48:55,624
It is an example of the violation of 
human rights which Lisbeth has endured.

1024
01:48:55,828 --> 01:48:59,537
...With the exception of Frederick Clinton:
who might be on dialysis...

1025
01:48:59,748 --> 01:49:02,660
...in which case, he'll be at
Karolinska Hospital.

1026
01:49:02,868 --> 01:49:07,419
Everyone here will receive all
necessary information.

1027
01:49:07,628 --> 01:49:11,462
I repeat.
Group 1: Bublanski.

1028
01:49:11,668 --> 01:49:13,704
Group 2: Svensson.

1029
01:49:13,908 --> 01:49:15,864
Group 3: Modig.

1030
01:49:16,068 --> 01:49:18,263
Group 4: Figuerola.

1031
01:49:18,468 --> 01:49:21,141
Group 5: Holmberg.

1032
01:49:21,348 --> 01:49:26,741
In case of questions or problems
contact your chief of division.

1033
01:49:28,428 --> 01:49:29,941
Good luck.

1034
01:49:30,948 --> 01:49:35,976
You expect us to believe that Nils Bjurman 
raped you? - Yes.

1035
01:49:36,188 --> 01:49:39,624
When did that allegedly take place?
- Not "allegedly"...

1036
01:49:39,828 --> 01:49:42,740
It was on Tuesday, February 18, 2008...

1037
01:49:42,948 --> 01:49:47,544
...and Friday, March 7 of the same year.
It is clearly stated in my biography.

1038
01:49:47,748 --> 01:49:50,660
Did you report the rape to the police?
- No.

1039
01:49:50,868 --> 01:49:55,100
Why not?
- The police have never listened to me.

1040
01:49:58,348 --> 01:50:01,897
Did you seek medical help for your injuries?

1041
01:50:02,108 --> 01:50:04,064
No.

1042
01:50:05,228 --> 01:50:08,459
Did you talk to anyone about it?
- No.

1043
01:50:13,868 --> 01:50:18,339
The late Nils Bjurman has never
been convicted for any crime.

1044
01:50:18,548 --> 01:50:23,383
He has never been reported to the police
nor was he the subject of any investigation.

1045
01:50:23,588 --> 01:50:27,866
On the other hand, I remind you
that Lisbeth Salander...

1046
01:50:28,068 --> 01:50:31,777
...has been diagnosed as paranoid
schizophrenic.

1047
01:50:33,348 --> 01:50:36,226
She has spent several years in a
psychiatric clinic for children...

1048
01:50:36,428 --> 01:50:40,307
...and has been under guardianship
since her eighteenth birthday.

1049
01:50:40,508 --> 01:50:45,423
However regrettable that may be,
there was, of course good reason.

1050
01:50:47,188 --> 01:50:53,627
Lisbeth Salander has her
very own confused world-view...

1051
01:50:54,548 --> 01:51:00,145
...which is demontrated very clearly
from her "autobiography".

1052
01:51:00,348 --> 01:51:04,739
Nowhere else has her lack of touch with
reality been demonstrated so clearly.

1053
01:51:04,948 --> 01:51:06,745
Because of this...

1054
01:51:06,948 --> 01:51:12,341
...we have serious doubts about the
credibility of anything she says or writes.

1055
01:51:14,828 --> 01:51:18,423
Has the prosecutor finished?
- Yes.

1056
01:51:18,628 --> 01:51:22,940
Then the defence may present their evidence.
- Thank you.

1057
01:51:25,828 --> 01:51:31,266
Peter Teleborian claims that
Lisbeth Salander is lying...

1058
01:51:31,468 --> 01:51:36,383
about the allegations that she was
sexually abused by Bjurman.

1059
01:51:37,428 --> 01:51:40,898
The prosecutor is of the same mind.

1060
01:51:42,068 --> 01:51:48,143
I will now prove to the court
that Lisbeth is telling the truth.

1061
01:51:49,468 --> 01:51:52,187
When was this recording made?

1062
01:51:52,388 --> 01:51:56,176
On March 7, 2008.
I used a hidden camera.

1063
01:52:08,908 --> 01:52:11,058
If you are sweet...

1064
01:52:11,268 --> 01:52:13,736
If you...

1065
01:52:13,948 --> 01:52:16,701
If you are sweet...

1066
01:52:22,228 --> 01:52:24,378
...I will also be sweet.

1067
01:52:26,228 --> 01:52:28,378
Are you sweet?

1068
01:52:28,588 --> 01:52:31,500
Are you sweet? Are you sweet?

1069
01:52:34,828 --> 01:52:36,944
It's too late now.

1070
01:52:46,988 --> 01:52:48,944
Stop the film!

1071
01:52:49,148 --> 01:52:51,059
That's enough!

1072
01:53:01,108 --> 01:53:04,783
Why did you film it?
- Nils Bjurman had raped me before.

1073
01:53:04,988 --> 01:53:07,058
He forced me to have oral sex.

1074
01:53:07,268 --> 01:53:10,863
He demanded more if I wanted my money.

1075
01:53:11,068 --> 01:53:14,140
It was the only way for me to obtain
evidence against him.

1076
01:53:14,348 --> 01:53:18,057
The only way to make him stop.

1077
01:53:19,108 --> 01:53:22,544
We'll take a recess. A one hour recess.

1078
01:54:05,748 --> 01:54:09,661
Sorry I'm late.
- It's ok. Thanks.

1079
01:54:12,148 --> 01:54:15,220
Is the defence submitting new evidence?

1080
01:54:15,428 --> 01:54:20,502
No, the court already has copies of these,
but with minor but crucial differences.

1081
01:54:20,708 --> 01:54:23,063
I will come to that later.

1082
01:54:23,268 --> 01:54:26,863
In that case, the defence has the floor.
- Thank you.

1083
01:54:29,308 --> 01:54:31,060
Well...

1084
01:54:32,668 --> 01:54:35,341
It can no longer be denied that
Lisbeth was the victim...

1085
01:54:35,548 --> 01:54:41,180
...of serious sexual abuse by her guardian,
advocate Nils Bjurman.

1086
01:54:41,388 --> 01:54:44,744
A person she thought that she could trust.

1087
01:54:46,348 --> 01:54:51,945
As I have said, it illustrates the
type of assaults against Lisbeth.

1088
01:54:53,148 --> 01:54:57,505
Assaults both judicial and psychological
in nature.

1089
01:54:58,708 --> 01:55:04,499
The person most responsible
for this, is Dr. Peter Teleborian.

1090
01:55:05,748 --> 01:55:09,502
In 1993 he wrote a psychiatric report...

1091
01:55:09,708 --> 01:55:14,907
...together with Gunnar Björck...

1092
01:55:15,108 --> 01:55:18,498
...- who was a member of an illegal group within
the Security Service -...

1093
01:55:18,708 --> 01:55:23,657
...in order to silence a dangerous witness...

1094
01:55:23,868 --> 01:55:29,784
...and that's why Lisbeth Salander was
commited to a closed psychiatric clinic.

1095
01:55:29,988 --> 01:55:33,742
Is there no end to these ridiculous allegations...

1096
01:55:33,948 --> 01:55:36,382
Excuse me, but I have the floor for now.

1097
01:55:37,428 --> 01:55:40,704
This happened after Lisbeth had poured petrol
on her father...

1098
01:55:40,908 --> 01:55:46,221
...Alexander Zalachenko, in a
desperate attempt to save her mother.

1099
01:55:47,468 --> 01:55:50,346
But those who protected Zalachenko...

1100
01:55:50,548 --> 01:55:55,019
...covered it up and marked the
investigations as classified.

1101
01:55:55,228 --> 01:55:59,540
And with the collusion of Peter Teleborian...

1102
01:55:59,748 --> 01:56:03,821
...they imprisoned Lisbeth at St. Stephen's
Hospital in Uppsala.

1103
01:56:04,028 --> 01:56:06,986
That's a ridiculous accusation!

1104
01:56:07,188 --> 01:56:12,342
I have tried to help Lisbeth
Salander in every way. She attempted...

1105
01:56:12,548 --> 01:56:17,861
Yesterday Peter Teleborian presented
his latest psychiatric report.

1106
01:56:18,068 --> 01:56:20,059
Once again, he recommends..

1107
01:56:20,268 --> 01:56:24,500
...compulsory detention and imprisonment
of Lisbeth Salander.

1108
01:56:25,068 --> 01:56:28,299
But just as in 1993 this has
been falsified.

1109
01:56:28,508 --> 01:56:30,146
That is completely...

1110
01:56:30,348 --> 01:56:34,819
I must ask you to allow counsel
to finish speaking, thank you!

1111
01:56:39,228 --> 01:56:41,059
Thank you.

1112
01:56:44,628 --> 01:56:49,577
His report is based on the "observation"
of my client.

1113
01:56:52,268 --> 01:56:56,580
That must have happened after she was
transferred to Kronoberg prison...

1114
01:56:56,788 --> 01:57:01,578
...on October 6, and completed on November 5.

1115
01:57:02,548 --> 01:57:05,460
Is that correct, Dr Teleborian?

1116
01:57:09,988 --> 01:57:11,979
I would like to call two witnesses.

1117
01:57:18,228 --> 01:57:20,219
No!

1118
01:57:29,388 --> 01:57:30,946
Police! Drop your weapon!

1119
01:57:35,428 --> 01:57:39,023
So... do you recognise this document?

1120
01:57:43,908 --> 01:57:45,785
Yes.

1121
01:57:47,228 --> 01:57:52,746
It is the psychiatric report on
Lisbeth Salander by Peter Teleborian.

1122
01:57:54,268 --> 01:57:57,066
There are three versions.

1123
01:57:57,268 --> 01:58:01,819
The first dated September 20,
the second October 1...

1124
01:58:02,028 --> 01:58:05,987
...and this one is the third,
dated October 6.

1125
01:58:06,988 --> 01:58:09,741
You gave me the documents.

1126
01:58:09,948 --> 01:58:14,544
And I have noticed that the first
report dated October 1...

1127
01:58:14,748 --> 01:58:20,823
...is identical to the report which
Peter Teleborian submitted yesterday.

1128
01:58:21,028 --> 01:58:23,667
Dated November 5.

1129
01:58:23,868 --> 01:58:26,462
Very odd, to put it mildly.

1130
01:58:27,468 --> 01:58:31,666
The only possble conclusion is that
Peter Teleborian wrote the reports...

1131
01:58:31,868 --> 01:58:34,940
...before he met Lisbeth Salander.

1132
01:58:36,188 --> 01:58:39,544
For this reason alone it lacks all credibility.

1133
01:58:42,948 --> 01:58:45,587
Superintendent Edklinth, it is true...

1134
01:58:45,788 --> 01:58:50,498
...that you received these reports
about Salander from Mikael Blomkvist?

1135
01:58:50,708 --> 01:58:52,061
Yes.

1136
01:58:52,268 --> 01:58:56,580
What are your overall conclusions?
- They have been falsified.

1137
01:58:57,428 --> 01:59:00,101
They were written long before...

1138
01:59:00,308 --> 01:59:05,780
...Peter Teleborian had the opportunity
to meet Lisbeth Salander in prison.

1139
01:59:05,988 --> 01:59:10,823
Moreover, they were completed with the
collaboration of a certain Jonas Sandberg.

1140
01:59:11,028 --> 01:59:13,019
That's a lie.

1141
01:59:14,068 --> 01:59:16,946
Is it a lie?
- No, not at all.

1142
01:59:17,148 --> 01:59:20,697
The documents are dated
and there is e-mail correspondence...

1143
01:59:20,908 --> 01:59:25,424
...between Peter Teleborian and
Jonas Sandberg that prove it.

1144
01:59:25,628 --> 01:59:31,464
He is part of a clandestine group
within the Security Service...

1145
01:59:31,668 --> 01:59:34,580
...who have protected Alexander Zalachenko
since the late 70's.

1146
01:59:34,788 --> 01:59:37,666
The group was responsible for the decision...

1147
01:59:37,868 --> 01:59:42,737
...to lock up Lisbeth Salander at
St. Stephen's hospital in 1993.

1148
01:59:44,508 --> 01:59:47,500
Jonas Sandberg is one of a dozen people...

1149
01:59:47,708 --> 01:59:50,984
...who were arrested today by order
of the General Prosecutor.

1150
01:59:51,188 --> 01:59:55,500
Sandberg is suspected of involvement in
the murder of Gunnar Björck...

1151
01:59:55,708 --> 02:00:01,305
...and probably of one other murder.
We have evidence and several witnesses.

1152
02:00:09,708 --> 02:00:13,098
Would Peter Teleborian like to
comment?

1153
02:00:23,228 --> 02:00:26,345
There are two policemen waiting outside
the courtroom.

1154
02:00:26,548 --> 02:00:31,178
They want to take Peter Teleborian
away for interrogation.

1155
02:00:31,388 --> 02:00:32,946
What for?

1156
02:00:33,148 --> 02:00:39,018
It is in connection with child 
pornography offences...

1157
02:00:39,228 --> 02:00:45,497
Specifically, for possession of 8,000
pornographic images and movies...

1158
02:00:45,708 --> 02:00:48,541
...found on his laptop.

1159
02:01:03,228 --> 02:01:05,788
We are seizing this as evidence.

1160
02:01:07,068 --> 02:01:09,707
Please come with us.

1161
02:01:43,028 --> 02:01:45,667
You may sit down.

1162
02:01:49,588 --> 02:01:54,742
The court has not been able to assess
all the information yet...

1163
02:01:54,948 --> 02:02:00,784
...but can find no reason to keep
Lisbeth Salander in custody.

1164
02:02:01,708 --> 02:02:04,780
Therefore, you are free to go while
awaiting the verdict.

1165
02:02:19,868 --> 02:02:23,178
Are you sure that you don't want to
come Millennium with me?

1166
02:02:23,388 --> 02:02:26,698
You can drop me here on Folkungagatan.

1167
02:02:30,268 --> 02:02:33,738
You know that you owe all of this
to Micke, don't you?

1168
02:02:35,268 --> 02:02:37,498
Yes. But...

1169
02:02:39,068 --> 02:02:40,820
Yes.

1170
02:02:53,148 --> 02:02:57,346
How can I get hold of you.
- You can reach me by e-mail.

1171
02:02:58,588 --> 02:03:00,544
Ok.

1172
02:03:23,588 --> 02:03:25,180
See you.

1173
02:04:12,028 --> 02:04:15,703
How did it go?
- Justice prevailed.

1174
02:04:15,908 --> 02:04:19,218
So now you party?
- Now we party.

1175
02:04:19,428 --> 02:04:22,864
What will you do now?
- It's starting!

1176
02:04:23,068 --> 02:04:25,866
...suspected of murder, among other things.

1177
02:04:26,068 --> 02:04:30,220
The organization, which co-ordinated its
activities from this apartment in Stockholm...

1178
02:04:30,428 --> 02:04:34,580
...was responsible for serious human 
rights offence against Lisbeth Salander.

1179
02:04:34,788 --> 02:04:37,382
But, this story beins in the 1960's.

1180
02:04:37,588 --> 02:04:42,867
When the Section was created to
watch over the nation's interests.

1181
02:04:43,068 --> 02:04:49,416
Officially they never existed, and
secretly operated from this apartment.

1182
02:04:49,628 --> 02:04:54,907
Evidence suggests that even the head of the
National Police was not aware of the group.

1183
02:04:55,108 --> 02:05:01,547
In the mid-70's the Section recruited
a top Soviet spy...

1184
02:05:01,748 --> 02:05:05,138
Lisbeth has been released
pending the verdict.

1185
02:05:05,348 --> 02:05:09,580
So, she'll either be acquitted or
receive a suspended sentence.

1186
02:05:33,548 --> 02:05:36,745
Here you are!
- What's this, "Estate inventory"?

1187
02:05:36,948 --> 02:05:39,257
It's Zalachenko's Estate.

1188
02:05:39,468 --> 02:05:42,619
I don't want anything from that pig.

1189
02:05:44,348 --> 02:05:47,260
No, but you're legally emancipated now.

1190
02:05:47,468 --> 02:05:51,825
So, I need your signature to prove
that you received it.

1191
02:05:54,988 --> 02:05:57,377
Bonds with a value of 300,000...

1192
02:05:57,588 --> 02:06:01,024
...plus property in Gosseberga
valued at 1,5 million.

1193
02:06:01,228 --> 02:06:04,379
I don't want to have anything
to do with any of it.

1194
02:06:05,588 --> 02:06:07,863
Then there's this...

1195
02:06:08,788 --> 02:06:11,985
An abandoned brickyard somewhere
outside Norrtälje.

1196
02:06:12,188 --> 02:06:15,578
The plot alone has been valued
at 150,000.

1197
02:06:16,388 --> 02:06:18,265
Ok.

1198
02:06:18,468 --> 02:06:21,619
Sell all that shit and give
the money to charity.

1199
02:06:25,828 --> 02:06:28,740
I think you should read it.

1200
02:06:28,948 --> 02:06:32,099
I can always sell it for you later.

1201
02:06:41,788 --> 02:06:44,177
Micke says hello.

1202
02:07:00,908 --> 02:07:05,345
Pizza Bussola? Here you are!
- Thank you. Bye.

1203
02:07:17,628 --> 02:07:19,858
What is this shit?

1204
02:12:53,668 --> 02:12:57,263
You deserve to die, you fucking freak.

1205
02:13:14,708 --> 02:13:17,268
Telephone directory service.
- Yes, hello.

1206
02:13:17,468 --> 02:13:21,620
I'm looking for the number of a
motorcycle club in Svavelsjö.

1207
02:13:29,868 --> 02:13:33,861
Who's that? - Are you interested in
the whereabouts of Ronald Niedermann?

1208
02:13:34,068 --> 02:13:35,706
OK, I'm listening.

1209
02:13:58,068 --> 02:13:59,581
Emergency services.

1210
02:13:59,788 --> 02:14:04,418
Police killer Ronald Niedermann is
at Skederyd's brickyard in Norrtälje.

1211
02:14:04,628 --> 02:14:08,780
There's a motorcycle gang is on their way
to kill him. They're heavily armed.

1212
02:14:46,188 --> 02:14:48,748
Am I disturbing you?

1213
02:14:49,628 --> 02:14:53,223
I was having a bath.
- Oh, I see...

1214
02:14:54,628 --> 02:14:57,188
Have you seen the news?
- No.

1215
02:14:57,828 --> 02:15:03,107
Ronald Niedermann is dead. A gang
from Svavelsjö has killed him.

1216
02:15:03,948 --> 02:15:07,623
Then the police came and arrested
the whole lot.

1217
02:15:32,268 --> 02:15:34,498
Thanks for everything.
