0
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,320
<i>More than</i>
<i>six thousand soldiers,</i>

1
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:03,986
And the same in Police...

2
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,093
Banned air traffic.

3
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,634
Snipers on the roof.

4
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:16,904
Secret agents.

5
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,142
Politicians.

6
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:28,286
We had the idea of
flying a spy plane

7
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:30,219
above the congress...

8
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,259
to see what would happen
to see how long it would be

9
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:36,557
before they shot it down.

10
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:39,063
Well, here we are now,
and nobody dares...

11
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,468
- What number have you got?
- 36.

12
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,942
There's two 26's.

13
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:54,571
- Boys?
- Yes a boy.

14
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:56,512
<i>I'll get it to you</i>

15
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,778
<i>as quickly as possible.</i>

16
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:01,116
She's in debt...

17
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:03,815
Nowadays she lives on <i>mate.</i>
Who's she in debt to?

18
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,451
From today's government.
That's why they live like that.

19
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:17,335
<i>You can see it now.</i>

20
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:19,633
<i>Last year</i>
<i>there were no boats...</i>

21
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:22,334
<i>in February.</i>
<i>Today there are.</i>

22
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:26,139
He's saying the system's on
course again so that's positive

23
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:29,104
Now the debt must be paid.

24
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,519
Now, who is to blame for...

25
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:40,482
the last 100yrs
in Argentina?

26
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,223
Psychologists say the IMF
are like analysts.

27
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:51,161
It's an act, but for us it's
the central analytical part.

28
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,237
DEBT

29
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:44,050
lmagine the world: Instead
of having 6 Billion people,

30
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:47,786
it is a town of
a 1000 inhabitants.

31
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:50,927
<i>In that world there are 506 men...</i>

32
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,064
<i>and 494 women.</i>

33
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,931
Do you know what's the most
spoken language in the world?

34
00:03:57,003 --> 00:04:01,599
It's Mandarin... 144 people
in 1000 speak Chinese.

35
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:07,203
60 speak Hindu, 56 English.
53 speak Spanish.

36
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,046
In that town of 1000 people,
there are 6 Argentines.

37
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:14,450
And 3 of them live below
the poverty line

38
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,819
1 out of those 3 has some
degree of malnutrition.

39
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:23,285
One third of that world,
330 people, have anemia.

40
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:28,164
More than 10 %, 130 people,
have chronic malnutrition.

41
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:32,068
Half of the town of a 1000,
500 people,

42
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:34,299
live with less
than $2 a day

43
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:37,002
and 200 with less than $1.

44
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:43,972
The 200 richest people
have 86 % of the wealth

45
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,951
and the 200 poorest,
only 1 % .

46
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,251
In reality, the world has
6 Billion inhabitants.

47
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,416
It'd be good to give
these numbers a second thought.

48
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:55,325
But talking about
billions of people.

49
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:07,504
What I wanted to do...

50
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:12,509
and I spent 6 years trying...

51
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:14,842
was to open the program showing
what television was like.

52
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:16,541
In the end,

53
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:21,553
6 years later, I showed
the workings I wanted.

54
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:25,079
The idea of seeing studios...
walking through corridors

55
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:29,185
showing all about television
clerks, chorus girls,

56
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:32,663
kids from a reality show,
corrupt politicians, cooks

57
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:35,132
a magician screwing a girl...

58
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:41,305
Then we could say: This is it,
what you see is television.

59
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:43,942
It was in vain,
a week later...

60
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:49,042
what we thought we'd captured,

61
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,083
surprised us again.

62
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:56,179
<i>What did you eat today?</i>
<i>Because we saw you there.</i>

63
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:57,916
<i>Omelette.</i>

64
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:02,122
<i>- And last night?</i>
- Nothing.

65
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:07,826
- Do they feed you at school?
- No.

66
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,868
CHILDREN THAT FAINT OF HUNGER

67
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:13,634
- Are you sad?
- Yes.

68
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,879
Why! What's the matter? Tell me.

69
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:32,480
We didn't eat yesterday,
we didn't have the money.

70
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:36,287
- How old are you?
- Eight.

71
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:38,626
What'll you do when
you grow up?

72
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,399
Nothing.

73
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:46,501
It's simple and atrocious
and terrible to see.

74
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:50,064
I've never seen anything like it,
either in life or on TV

75
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:52,938
And the worst is, I found out...

76
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:57,108
the girl was called Barbara
like my daughter, Barbara,

77
00:06:57,183 --> 00:07:00,084
who may be viewing the program
in another part of town.

78
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,883
That's how I met Barbara Flores.

79
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,480
THE GIRL THAT FAINTED OF HUNGER,
SHE NOW HAS MALNUTRITION.

80
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,082
TUCUMÁN: THE GIRL THAT FAINTED
IS AGAIN UNDERNOURISHED.

81
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:18,126
After that interview,
Barbarita became a symbol.

82
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:26,601
And she and her mum started
going round the studios.

83
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,874
From then on...

84
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:31,172
nothing could be controlled.

85
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,775
Barbarita, in the media circus.

86
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:36,949
Have we done the right thing?

87
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:40,254
She was on the cover
of "Gente"

88
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:43,659
"Personality of the year",
I don't know if it was worth it.

89
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:50,259
After the interview, campaigns
to send food to Tucumán began.

90
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:56,571
I was touched by their pain,
that really touched me!

91
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:03,941
Everything we are,
feel and dream...

92
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,813
goes through our brain.

93
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:08,353
It's our fastest
growing organ...

94
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:11,822
It rapidly develops the shape
it has in adulthood.

95
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:14,792
It takes an incredible
amount of energy.

96
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:19,127
Can we compare the brain
of a child with a machine?

97
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:23,999
A byte is the minimum unit
of information in a computer.

98
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:27,264
It's a dot,
a letter, a character.

99
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,901
1 billion bytes make a Gigabyte,

100
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,468
the unit for storing memory.

101
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:37,778
A computer like this
has between 4 and 5 Gigabytes...

102
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,250
of memory capacity.

103
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:48,385
This means about 1800 books
of 300 pages each.

104
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:52,022
You know how many Gigabytes
that boy has in comparison?

105
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:59,869
500,000. He can store 227 million
books of 300 pages each.

106
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,171
During the first few months
of growth...

107
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:08,179
the brain creates
100 billion neurons...

108
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:16,484
which will create 100 trillion
possible connections between them.

109
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,957
In the 3rd. Week of life,
embryos develop...

110
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:23,291
250.000 cells per minute

111
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:29,665
that give the shape of what will
be the spine and the brain.

112
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:33,762
By week 7, the neurons begin
to multiply at an incredible rate,

113
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,105
and will continue after birth
depending on supplied nutrients,

114
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:41,977
to connect with the largest
possible amount of neurons.

115
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:47,281
In its 1st few months, a baby's
brain is almost complete.

116
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:49,116
It's now the body...

117
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:51,748
that begins to grow.

118
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:55,718
The brain normally consumes
half the sugar in the blood,

119
00:09:55,795 --> 00:10:03,292
a quarter of the nutrients and
a fifth of the oxygen consumed.

120
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,394
And a huge amount of proteins,

121
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:10,465
almost 2 mg per minute,
and 84 different minerals.

122
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:13,205
But if all these nutrients
didn't exist,

123
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,771
the development of the brain
would be different.

124
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:19,682
The growth of the neurons...

125
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:22,812
and their connection
would be less...

126
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:26,824
and therefore would
reduce fat tissue,

127
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:29,793
destroying vital muscles
and organs.

128
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:34,799
You see, the brain destroys
the body in order to feed itself.

129
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:40,965
Malnutrition in this case will
kill in between 8 to 12 weeks.

130
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,440
And he's wearing glasses

131
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:48,538
He's got to have a beard
Give it to me...

132
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:52,175
like this... look...

133
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,947
The eyes and beard
are like this.

134
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,421
Mine have been undernourished.

135
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,482
Now, thank God,
they're better...

136
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,754
because I struggle a lot.

137
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,796
Have they been undernourished?

138
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:09,301
No, No! Under weight. I've a boy
of eight and a girl of nine.

139
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,230
Have you just arrived?

140
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:15,404
Three more meals over there...

141
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:20,275
One of the girls in the soup
kitchen was undernourished.

142
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:26,275
Lord. Bless this food
we're about to receive.

143
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,913
Now the government is giving us
70 cents per child,

144
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:33,152
In the soup kitchen we can
only have ninety children.

145
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:37,025
Feeding a police dog costs
nine pesos a day.

146
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:41,260
We receive 170, 180
according to the lists.

147
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:05,253
BARBARITA TOD AY

148
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:12,223
<i>Be eternal the laurels</i>

149
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:15,790
<i>that we obtained</i>

150
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,568
Why Barbara?
Why?

151
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:22,129
And not my son,
I'm in a worse situation.

152
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,369
But, she's the chosen one.

153
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:28,436
How can you explain
she was chosen by Destiny?

154
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,640
Or hunger...

155
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:33,579
or chances?

156
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,416
In this school, this girl
has been assigned a priority.

157
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,118
And not any other child.

158
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,626
Barbarita's mum is the sister
of my sister in law.

159
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,822
- The Barbarita's family.
- This is Natalia's cousin.

160
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:47,798
She has malnutrition
as does Natalia,

161
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,495
How do you explain to those
that haven't received anything

162
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:55,131
that it wasn't personal, it was
not because of them or Barbara?

163
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:59,143
What I don't understand today
and I'm not talking enviously.

164
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:02,112
It was all of them,
they were all in the shit.

165
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:05,617
And all the things
went to one little girl.

166
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:10,053
I wouldn't profit from a
daughter to be able to eat.

167
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:13,080
The little girl kept repeating...
I thought it was terrible...

168
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,855
that the girl
was so well trained.

169
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,488
My dad has no work
and my mum gets no support,

170
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,088
we are a big family..."

171
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,066
She'd learned it by heart.

172
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,695
When you were doing the
paperwork in Buenos Aires,

173
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:29,935
she came with clothes,
hair and hygiene products...

174
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:33,342
and her mother sold them.

175
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:36,074
There's a lot of people here
that have kept quiet.

176
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,843
This could be called:

177
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:40,579
"The poor against the poor".

178
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:50,425
- How's it going?
- Fine, thank you.

179
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,027
Hi! What's up? Come in.

180
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:59,194
How are you sweetheart?

181
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:02,638
What I've noticed from some
of your neighbors...

182
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:06,371
is that they criticized you
for selling the clothes...

183
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:09,881
That's true! But I didn't sell them.
I swapped them for goods.

184
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:12,941
I want to be clear for all
the people who don't know.

185
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,645
Imagine, I have...

186
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,781
5 bottles of oil
but have no bread for the kids.

187
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,223
- Sure.
- How do you manage?

188
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:21,589
I go to the store and say,

189
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,525
Will you swap a bottle of oil
for a kilo of bread, "No!"

190
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,928
Well! So 2 bottles of oil
for a kilo of bread? "Yes!"

191
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:30,162
They negotiated with me,
I didn't negotiate with them.

192
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:33,399
Now, is it her fault or?

193
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,736
It's not her fault.
She's a kid.

194
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:40,609
This generated one thing,
"Barbarita, Barbarita...".

195
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:43,739
What's also true about
what happened to Barbarita,

196
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:47,752
is that many people sent
many things to everyone.

197
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,254
Yes! Yes! It's true.
It works.

198
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:56,124
All the media chaos and
the social chaos was good

199
00:14:56,195 --> 00:15:00,723
to list all the undernourished.

200
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:04,701
There's 28,000 to 30,000
undernourished in the province.

201
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,738
And the population is?

202
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:08,864
400,000 under 14 years old.

203
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:13,002
When did it all begin,
as far as I know,

204
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,013
the undernourishment,
the people hungry,

205
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,606
began, more or less in
or around 1966

206
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:21,152
- During Onganía's...
- They closed the sugar mills.

207
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:28,626
People lost there jobs and
kids lost out on nutrition...

208
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:33,063
people used to work in the mills
from my dad, an accountant...

209
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,327
to the local people who
were manual laborers,

210
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:38,734
they would eat round a table
and had a good standard of life.

211
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:43,002
Is the increase in malnutrition
related to this? Yes!

212
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,771
Look what I have here!

213
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,744
This is a photo of Tucumán.

214
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:53,407
Or at least what it looked like
until the mid sixties...

215
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:55,377
Do you know what that is?

216
00:15:55,454 --> 00:16:00,653
A plan of Alsogaray and Onganía
changed the economy of Tucumán.

217
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:04,890
As requested by the World Bank
who wanted to modernize it.

218
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,161
They felt the best thing to do
was to concentrate the industry...

219
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:12,329
into a few firms and get rid
of the smaller businesses...

220
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:17,501
that sustained the economy
in the province.

221
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:22,104
They did it. The cost of that
was to close 11 of 27 mills,

222
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:28,245
More than 200,000 people in
Tucumán lost their jobs.

223
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,187
Because of the sugar debate
and the concentrated market...

224
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:34,919
the lemon business appeared.

225
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:39,363
Today Tucumán is the 2nd
biggest producer of lemons.

226
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:44,027
19.4 % of the world's lemon
exports come from Tucumán.

227
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,367
The 1st producer is the USA

228
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:47,905
Why the lemon?

229
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:51,465
It's cheap to produce and
whole families work unofficially...

230
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:54,876
for a pay that
is $1 or $2 a day...

231
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:58,075
for the whole family.

232
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,085
When we speak of malnutrition
we don't mean one generation,

233
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:06,955
we mean the sons of those
already undernourished.

234
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:11,827
So why build a 5 star hotel
in the Third World?

235
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:13,990
Because it was near Venice,

236
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,325
as I always say.

237
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:19,599
He's a legendary Italian chef,
His name is Cipriani,

238
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:23,869
he invented the Rissotto Primavera.

239
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:27,571
The 3rd world is a
European invention,

240
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:28,977
it doesn't exist.

241
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,312
He's a European,
millionaire

242
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,250
who has partners in Angola...

243
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:40,888
for money laund... I mean,
to open a hotel in Uruguay.

244
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:44,087
The idea of the Public Debt has got
more to do with a financial concept...

245
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:45,460
than with something real.

246
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:48,261
Do you all know
what debt means?

247
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,632
Lets see! Someone tell me
what debt means.

248
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,694
- When you owe money.
- When you owe money,

249
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:56,070
only money?
Anything else?

250
00:17:56,141 --> 00:18:01,807
The Ministry of Economy
explains the International debt.

251
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,612
Come on.

252
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:07,015
Think of a typical family,
for example.

253
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:13,616
When they don't have
enough money, they borrow.

254
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,892
When you run out of money,
do you borrow?

255
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:27,661
He earns $25,000 a month.

256
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,368
Money isn't everything.

257
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:14,853
Countries and people borrow
money from richer countries.

258
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:22,060
Countries and people borrow
money from richer countries.

259
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,925
England's growth happened...

260
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,692
thanks to the large
Public Debt it had.

261
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,232
Yes! Also the U.S.A.

262
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:32,600
I think the Public Debt should be at
the service of other initiatives.

263
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,639
I think there must
be a Public Debt.

264
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:37,834
Numbers are incredible!
There's numbers for everything.

265
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:41,311
Look! It's the social debt.

266
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:45,111
To avoid poverty, Argentina
needs that blue bar.

267
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,278
16 billion were needed
last year...

268
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:52,653
For the people not to be
below the poverty line.

269
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:56,285
It's more or less
the interest of the debt.

270
00:19:57,262 --> 00:20:00,197
<i>The more I think about it</i>
<i>the more I can't understand.</i>

271
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,233
<i>What do you need to react?</i>

272
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,394
<i>Too much agony.</i>
<i>You and your coffee</i>

273
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,869
<i>Surely at night it'll</i>
<i>be champagne.</i>

274
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,907
<i>You have it</i>
<i>all and you want more,</i>

275
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:11,101
<i>nothing's left</i>
<i>for the rest.</i>

276
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:13,337
<i>You can be seen</i>
<i>suffering on T.V.</i>

277
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,778
<i>But if you see misery</i>
<i>you change the channel.</i>

278
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:20,648
It's not true that
we either eat or we pay

279
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,085
I believe we must try
to pay and eat.

280
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:26,090
Honestly, I believe all
debts must be paid.

281
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:29,389
The debt must be paid...

282
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:33,329
in any possible way.

283
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:38,529
In this country there are jobs
but people don't want to work.

284
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:41,869
We're in Uruguay,

285
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,740
there's lots of Argentines
and lots of debt.

286
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,306
No, it can be paid,

287
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,177
we must make an effort.

288
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,348
BECAUSE SHE HAD NO FOOD SHE
FED HER CHILDREN WITH CATS.

289
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:57,752
This is from last year
in the "Gazette".

290
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:02,226
What she says isn't true:
She never ate cat.

291
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:07,596
She says it's true because
she had cat skins in the fridge.

292
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,190
It's a lie,

293
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,494
it's a lie!
Not even she believes that.

294
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:16,007
The neighbors laugh...
what else can they do.

295
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:18,941
Listen there's no need
to kill a cat and eat it.

296
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:22,606
I never saw her working...

297
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:25,581
things don't come for free.

298
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:34,252
Aug 6th,2002,

299
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,757
they saw this
in the Washington Post.

300
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:44,699
After the collapse of
the economy, poverty...

301
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:49,036
is taking dignity
as one of its victims.

302
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,076
35 lbs of rice, cereals,

303
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,477
nappies, carrots, potatoes...

304
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:57,742
this is what they sent.

305
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:19,225
<i>People in the U.S. A,</i>
<i>who sent us...</i>

306
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:24,139
<i>all these things</i>
<i>Are complaining due...</i>

307
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:27,110
<i>to the paper work</i>
<i>and bureaucracy.</i>

308
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,806
<i>Lost papers...</i>

309
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,714
<i>The boat arrived on the 5th</i>
<i>and was held until the 24th</i>

310
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:34,149
<i>24th, October.</i>

311
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:36,779
<i>Are you blaming "Caritas"</i>
<i>for that?</i>

312
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,755
<i>No, I'm not blaming anyone,</i>
<i>I'm just saying,</i>

313
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:41,019
<i>that what you said about</i>
<i>the ship being held...</i>

314
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:45,257
at Customs.

315
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,264
<i>It's a lie to the people!</i>

316
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:51,393
<i>Because in the Customs</i>
<i>that I administrate,</i>

317
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,303
<i>we check, and</i>
<i>whatever arrived</i>

318
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,307
<i>from the USA was rubbish.</i>

319
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,367
I'm not ashamed...

320
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,846
of my country but...

321
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:06,248
but in the US,
I was embarrassed to go...

322
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:08,149
into those people's homes.

323
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:16,318
Saying "I'm from the place
where you sent the food..."

324
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:19,728
Then came an odd media event.

325
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,356
The Customs Chief...

326
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,560
and a "Post"
journalist were shouting...

327
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:26,030
and I didn't know
who was right...

328
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:28,629
Until I met the people
that had sent the things.

329
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:47,481
I started to question myself,

330
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:50,289
Thinking back...
I asked myself...

331
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,530
Why do we blame others
and never ourselves.

332
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:57,659
<i>They should worry about</i>
<i>malnutrition in the country,</i>

333
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:59,636
<i>not only in Tucumán,</i>

334
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:01,535
your country has
a lot to do with it.

335
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,731
It's got nothing to do with us?

336
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,842
It's got nothing to do with us?

337
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:11,610
<i>People would like to help,</i>
<i>are you saying they can't?</i>

338
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:13,310
<i>We accept the help!</i>

339
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:15,250
<i>Come on then!</i>

340
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,050
<i>Come on!</i>
<i>Without control?</i>

341
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,853
<i>There must be control!</i>
<i>Now we control!</i>

342
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:23,520
<i>Before they smuggled</i>
<i>weapons, drugs...</i>

343
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:25,859
<i>We control.</i>

344
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:37,406
- This is Franco...
- This is Franco...

345
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,411
...s a baby.
...s a baby.

346
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:42,106
And me?

347
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,375
What shocks me most
is the lack of men...

348
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:46,110
in the neighborhood.

349
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:50,143
The men must be sleeping,

350
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:51,450
and I don't want
to bad mouth them.

351
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:54,253
- What does your husband do?
- He's on Benefit.

352
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:58,854
And Friday, Saturday and Sunday
he has his music like the rest.

353
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,090
They get the benefit.

354
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:03,896
So now they're resting.

355
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:08,599
The parks here are full of men
and youngsters playing soccer.

356
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,699
My husband left me 3 years
ago with 8 children.

357
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:15,041
I had a two month old baby
when he left.

358
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:17,741
And I carry on.
My daughter is in 4th year.

359
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:20,751
- How do you manage with ten?
- How do I manage?

360
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:22,150
I go out and I beg.

361
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,053
Everyone asked!
"Is it true?"

362
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:30,117
They didn't believe it.
I say it's true...

363
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,028
and they never asked again.

364
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:35,726
They call me the "cat eater"

365
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,860
How is it possible in a country
full of food...

366
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:43,738
that children die
of malnutrition?

367
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:48,711
We're either mad or we just
cannot govern our Nation.

368
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,839
The responsibility...

369
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:55,250
belongs to those who have
the nerve to talk.

370
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:07,698
Every day at 5pm, they start
to distribute food.

371
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:38,224
Ask him if that matches
the American dream.

372
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,351
This is very odd. Were there
any poor people in Washington?

373
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:08,653
There were.

374
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:13,463
And this is even odder,

375
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:17,091
they were eating
in a soup kitchen.

376
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:23,596
The building you see behind
is the World Bank.

377
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:12,922
This is the toilet.

378
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:17,318
You dig a hole, lay the tiles
and put the toilet on top.

379
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:18,760
This is the toilet.

380
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,362
The toilet.

381
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,934
I don't have a toilet.

382
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:34,871
They said a thousand times
they'd build a sewage system.

383
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:36,880
You don't have sewers!

384
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:40,076
There are no sewers!
In 1992 there was a project,

385
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:43,052
to build a sewage pipe line...

386
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:44,645
at a cost of $26 million.

387
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:50,252
It would have been treated
in biological pools.

388
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:53,263
The Nation provided resources...

389
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:57,495
from organizations
to international finance.

390
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:03,269
That work was planned,
offered to society, tendered...

391
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:05,172
It received the resources.
They weren't used...

392
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,108
for its completion.

393
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:28,227
I think that
the Bank's worries...

394
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:30,267
are not only
that countries pay

395
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:33,702
but that it creates
an impact...

396
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,399
and benefits the people.

397
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:36,838
To fulfill
the credit's objective

398
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:39,843
You spoke
of the sewage works...

399
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:42,038
If I'm not wrong,

400
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:46,072
ten years ago there was
a project to build...

401
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:48,984
the biggest plant
in the city.

402
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:53,547
They didn't have the resources
to complete it.

403
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:57,083
They sent 10 million dollars.
They built the 1st section,

404
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:59,722
and then stopped.

405
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:04,929
Here we are at the bottom of
what should have been a pool.

406
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:09,940
The development loan
is actually a rescue loan.

407
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:13,068
Then they use the loan to patch
things up, not to build anything.

408
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,135
Ok, we shall have a crisis in
6 months, let's invent something.

409
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:16,976
We say we need 500 millions
to paint Avenida de Mayo green.

410
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:20,381
We never paint but with
that money we pay salaries.

411
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:22,612
You cannot pay salaries...

412
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:25,315
with money that's there
to buy books.

413
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,950
They got the loan

414
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:29,653
as a cover up

415
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:32,924
The bank has an evaluation
committee for all the projects...

416
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:36,990
that's independent from the bank

417
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:39,298
Every time they consider
a loan...

418
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:42,032
they study the risks extensively

419
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:44,666
I believe that
the Wolfenson era...

420
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:47,870
was spectacular
in the sense...

421
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:52,144
that it created a "renaissance"
in terms of combining...

422
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:55,380
knowledge, technology,
infrastructure,

423
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:58,081
human capital and a social role.

424
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:13,031
When we went to ask for
the resources to begin...

425
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:16,267
development we found out
that the resources

426
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:19,504
had been sent to Tucumán

427
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:23,911
The Nation couldn't send
the money twice...

428
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:28,442
Tucumán had already
received the resources,

429
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:33,218
the work was still incomplete.

430
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:40,129
Most of the loans had local
subsidies, were budgeted...

431
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:44,032
then added to external finances

432
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:48,163
If the local subsidies
are not there,

433
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:54,200
Argentina, like every country
pays commission on commitment

434
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:55,746
What's the commitment rate?

435
00:31:55,813 --> 00:32:00,807
When a credit entity
lends to a country...

436
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:07,449
it deprives another country
of the use of that loan.

437
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:10,085
It's a commitment
that they assume.

438
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:13,722
They pay the interest
as if the loan was on course.

439
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:15,857
Actually the money's frozen...

440
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,561
If we borrow money

441
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:21,799
and don't spend it,
we still pay interests.

442
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:27,573
So we owe twice, we don't
have the money or the work.

443
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:30,279
That's the commitment rate.

444
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:33,283
The infant mortality figures
are getting higher...

445
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:36,047
More cases of malnutrition
with more debt,

446
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:40,989
So obviously we're not
doing things right.

447
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:43,152
There are two things.
One: Why are we in debt?

448
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:45,320
Our debt is for things
to go on as they are,

449
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:47,091
while someone gets richer.

450
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:50,066
Argentina has always
had a debt...

451
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:53,297
which it couldn't pay back!

452
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:56,670
This is a part of the history
of Argentina, always in crisis,

453
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:59,369
getting money to save itself.

454
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:05,041
I always say there are 3 things
that should be addressed:

455
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:09,052
Illegitimacy, insolvency,
and co-responsibility.

456
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:53,020
<i>A new chapter in the Argentine</i>
<i>economic history begins.</i>

457
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:56,897
<i>We've turned the page of state</i>

458
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:05,237
<i>interference and oppression...</i>

459
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:11,716
<i>to give way to the freedom</i>
<i>of productive powers.</i>

460
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:15,613
So the IMF,
the World Bank

461
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:20,146
<i>and other international entities</i>
<i>found it a solution...</i>

462
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:23,216
<i>to assign that huge</i>
<i>amount of dollars...</i>

463
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:26,559
<i>to countries that</i>
<i>would absorb credit.</i>

464
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:31,193
<i>Argentina was among</i>
<i>those selected.</i>

465
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:33,927
<i>This means,</i>
<i>the international debt...</i>

466
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:42,310
<i>is created, in fact</i>
<i>not to solve its problems...</i>

467
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,281
<i>but to solve the problems</i>
<i>of the banking world.</i>

468
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:49,709
The 80 % say: Who is he?

469
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:51,983
That is the question.

470
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:54,217
Yes! Who was Olmos?

471
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:57,420
Where did this "nonpartisan"
man, come from...

472
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:00,762
who denounced the debt?
Who was Olmos?

473
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:03,062
Well! His story
is important because...

474
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:06,331
it was the only case
that came to trial.

475
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:08,201
There's 3 causes.

476
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:11,764
Olmos I,
the debt during the Junta,

477
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:17,713
Olmos II, the debt under
democracy from '83-'92,

478
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:20,945
The Brady Plan & Megacanje.

479
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:26,388
<i>The debt has no economical</i>
<i>foundation or any other.</i>

480
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:30,593
<i>The debt comes from</i>
<i>illicit acts...</i>

481
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:34,188
Who knows where the funds went?

482
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:38,599
Olmos was persecuted,
had no job had no identity...

483
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:42,571
for more than 10 years.
Considered disappeared...

484
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,904
Were you asked at school
about your dad's job?

485
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,342
- What did you say?
- Journalist,

486
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:49,743
I didn't say
he was in prison.

487
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,578
May '57.
How old were you?

488
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,639
Five years old.

489
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:59,213
The landlord that sheltered dad
as a fugitive and my brothers.

490
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:02,020
When did he start worrying
about the debt?

491
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:06,626
At the beginning of the
military dictatorship.

492
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:09,666
Term of Martínez de Hoz

493
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,793
Right yes!

494
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:16,101
Frondizi talked to Martínez
de Hoz and he tells him,

495
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:21,111
his political Project was to
dismantle the Argentine Industry.

496
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,680
Frondizi says this
in a public act in '82

497
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:28,014
and Olmos reports
his speech...

498
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:32,681
and tells the judge: "this guy
conspired against Argentina".

499
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:36,124
That was Olmos's power,
he was a man who said "no".

500
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:40,057
That's all that was needed
a guy that said "no".

501
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:43,066
Who would take the report
to the judge and...

502
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:45,962
and would say no.

503
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:48,529
<i>Hello.</i>

504
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:50,801
I'd like to speak to
Martínez de Hoz, please.

505
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,843
<i>- Who's calling?</i>
- Jorge Lanata.

506
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:55,641
<i>He's not here right now.</i>

507
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:58,011
What time will he be in?

508
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:01,516
<i>After 9 o'clock.</i>

509
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:04,555
Please tell him
I'll call back.

510
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:07,523
<i>- O.k.</i>
Thank you, bye.

511
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:14,059
They take over
power and start...

512
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:16,599
<i>the National</i>
<i>Reorganization Process.</i>

513
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:47,591
He takes charge of the
presidency until the next day...

514
00:37:57,174 --> 00:38:00,007
The debt is 160 billions.

515
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:02,375
It's about 180 billions.

516
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:05,609
180, 185 billion dollars
are owed.

517
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:08,914
Around 186 billion dollars.

518
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:15,949
The total debt is 179.702544
and continuously changes.

519
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:17,892
So it ticks like a taxi meter

520
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,897
every hour of our life, it runs

521
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:25,629
and Argentina has to pay
1.700.000 pesos in interests.

522
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:28,604
15.488.233.

523
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:30,903
What was the role
of the State in this?

524
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,705
- Was there any control?
- Well! Here's the problem.

525
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:38,044
They talk of the responsibility
of operative levels,

526
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:40,083
but I feel the role
of the controlling mechanisms

527
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,745
is essential here.

528
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,916
Sir, we received the $200m
loan from the World Bank...

529
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,755
who in the Ministry of Economy...

530
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:53,058
vouched for the capacity
of repayment?

531
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:57,624
The Nation's Gral Auditor is
the one who controls the debt.

532
00:38:57,702 --> 00:39:00,762
Regarding the debt, you control
if some money came in,

533
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:04,001
how it was spent?

534
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:08,739
Well, we have two areas,
We generally audit...

535
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:12,544
the Finance and Accounting Dept.

536
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:16,484
We also watch over the
completion of the project...

537
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:19,682
and if objectives
have been reached.

538
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:22,658
We should be doing
a lot more.

539
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:25,218
There's a bureau in the
ministry that works on that.

540
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:29,460
Apart from the internal control
that the ministry has...

541
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:32,764
we also have a specific team
that depends on us,

542
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:36,329
and there's one in the ministry
for easy access to information.

543
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:38,432
- Can we see it?
- We could see it.

544
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:42,001
We wanted to go to the office
of the Ministry of Economy.

545
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:46,448
The control office for the debt
in the Ministry of Economy,

546
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:49,509
what happened was incredible.

547
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:59,154
Yes, Audit Bureau...
Audit Bureau.

548
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,460
First hurdle, the chofer...

549
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:03,193
Audit Bureau, please.

550
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:04,892
Can you hear me?

551
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:06,266
Where?

552
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:07,895
The President of the Audit Bureau
comes to see the Debt Dept.

553
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:08,904
He insists.

554
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:10,941
The president is coming.

555
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,571
Well! We're going in.

556
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:19,177
I told you: They control
the debt.

557
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:23,684
Interior, Lift, Day.

558
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,984
- Where are we going to?
- Which floor? - Tenth

559
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:28,854
- It's in the other building. - What?
Are you going to see the Auditor?

560
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:32,362
- The National Audit Bureau.
- The other building.

561
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,628
- 2nd floor.
- No! It's on the 10th fl oor,

562
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:40,602
we've people
at the Yrigoyen entrance.

563
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:42,866
The auditor isn't up there.

564
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,874
That's the Ministry of Economy.

565
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,569
The face of the auditor.

566
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:48,612
The Auditor's office
in the Ministry of Economy.

567
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:51,580
- Ah! Yes! Auditor no!
- Office yes!

568
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:55,608
- What floor is it then?
The tenth, but let me check

569
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:59,447
with these people. They've set up
a camp for a few years now

570
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:01,847
Corridors.

571
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,117
A corridor.

572
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,864
Another corridor.

573
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:11,166
Another corridor.

574
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:15,494
And here we are.

575
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,375
Did I say they control
the debt.

576
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:21,570
You don't control how
the money is spent...

577
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:24,079
- You control whether it comes in.
- Yes.

578
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,116
- Basically.
- Basically.

579
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:29,675
Can you tell today,
how much the debt is?

580
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:32,119
Around 170 billion dollars.

581
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:39,254
On September 30th, 2003
it stood at 166 billion dollars,

582
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,127
plus arrears.

583
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:45,032
What year did this office
begin to control the debt?

584
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:48,868
'93, they created
the Audit Dept.

585
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:51,567
What happened before '92?

586
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:54,702
It was in a process of
recognition of the debt,

587
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:58,339
when the Brady bonds appeared,

588
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:02,442
The "Brady" bonds agreement
is a mix of a previous process.

589
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,149
They consolidated an amount,
they never finished checking.

590
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:08,885
That was before our time,
but yes... kind of...

591
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:11,223
So, no registries of the debt.

592
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:13,456
There's neither
hide nor hair of them!

593
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:18,764
At that time they didn't know
how much, to who, or why...

594
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:21,134
when it was due,
at what rate,

595
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:23,173
it was total ignorance.

596
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,265
- That's not a metaphor, is it?
- No, no, no.

597
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:27,469
Wasn't there
a note book saying...

598
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,775
Chase Manhattan Bank:

599
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:33,078
4 billions?

600
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:40,386
We had to ask to add
up to the amount.

601
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:43,221
- Ask who?
- The private sector,

602
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:45,489
to see what their
international debt was.

603
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,622
What's the Olmos II case?

604
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:53,632
When they implemented the Brady Plan,
he opened another case,

605
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:59,173
the idea was, something that's
illegitimate can't be legitimate.

606
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:03,907
The debt was administrated by
Price Waterhouse Consultants

607
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:09,078
and the agent was the Citibank.

608
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:12,486
The dealings of the debt was
based on the creditors data.

609
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:15,787
What the Citibank did was
ask all the banks world wide

610
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:17,588
if they had made loans
to Argentina

611
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:20,221
To back up what was said
before, we must point out...

612
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:22,925
that the government had to check
the registry of creditors...

613
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,664
to get information on the debt
including the Brady Plan...

614
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:30,832
that was then assigned
through a consulting company.

615
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:33,809
The process of getting
the resources via the debt...

616
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:38,109
was done without any
control or registry.

617
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:43,950
There were only statistics
registries, simple notes.

618
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:48,890
The Ministry received notification
of the expiry dates...

619
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,723
or the creditors' claims
to proceed with the payments.

620
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:55,856
What payments? Of the debt
they said we had,

621
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:57,457
Was it verified?

622
00:43:57,534 --> 00:44:00,298
Let me understand!
If they said...

623
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:04,000
100 not 200,
was that the same?

624
00:44:04,074 --> 00:44:07,373
No, that's why they did all
the work I'm telling you about.

625
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:12,677
Alejandro said that in a bank
in Arkansas, they said...

626
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:17,778
Argentina owes u$ s100 millions.
So come collect your pay.

627
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:20,722
That was declared here,
we did the registries...

628
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:26,696
of the debt asking the creditors
how much we owed them...

629
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:31,929
and after 18 years,
our justice is not very fast,

630
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,493
it came out that there's
a lot of documents where...

631
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:36,869
the judge agrees with Olmos.

632
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:41,707
They can't incriminate anyone
as so much time has gone by.

633
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:43,576
The documents would be worth...

634
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:46,047
something if the politicians
were bold,

635
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:50,212
honest, patriotic and if
the Nation was behind pushing.

636
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:53,745
Up to now that's not happening,

637
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:55,689
the documents are sitting on

638
00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:58,062
the basement of Congress.

639
00:44:58,062 --> 00:44:59,663
The basement of Congress.

640
00:44:59,663 --> 00:45:08,594
<i>The debt is being paid</i>
<i>unconstitutionally...</i>

641
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:18,570
<i>because Congress should pass</i>
<i>payment on the Nation's debt.</i>

642
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:29,885
<i>Our government opens the</i>
<i>door on Congress to see files...</i>

643
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:35,091
<i>of everything related</i>
<i>to Argentina's debt,</i>

644
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:40,193
<i>including this mandate.</i>

645
00:45:40,537 --> 00:45:46,066
<i>You don't proclaim transparency,</i>
<i>you achieve it.</i>

646
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:51,577
<i>The books will be open for you.</i>

647
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:14,366
This case nobody
wants to see...

648
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:18,841
has 28 parts, 6333 pages

649
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:21,400
with 477 irregularities,

650
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:26,245
5 judges neglected 477 crimes.

651
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:28,250
It's in the Central Bank.

652
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:30,479
Anzoátegui, Castillo,
Dibur, Wexler,

653
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:33,284
and Pati Ballesteros, judge,
he was the one...

654
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:36,758
who had the case
on his desk for 8 years.

655
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:43,027
38 times Congress refused
to address the issue of the debt.

656
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:47,969
38 times it refused to read it,

657
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:51,337
28 parts, 20 reports,

658
00:46:51,408 --> 00:46:55,777
30 statements, 500 annexes,
30 accountants

659
00:46:55,846 --> 00:46:59,407
5 judges and 477 crimes...

660
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:06,389
on the Argentine debt
which today is 178.795 millions.

661
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:14,355
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Is that Dr Martínez de Hoz?

662
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,864
<i>- Yes.</i>
- How are you?

663
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:17,696
<i>- My name is Jorge Lanata.</i>
- How are you?

664
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:19,099
Well, thank you.

665
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:20,830
I'm a journalist.

666
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:22,496
<i>I know who you are.</i>

667
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:28,978
I'd like to have a chat with
you for about half an hour.

668
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:31,344
Could it be possible?

669
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:38,446
<i>Listen! If it's private I'd be</i>
<i>happy to but no interviews.</i>

670
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:45,655
<i>At the end of '91, I published</i>
<i>a book called "15 years on".</i>

671
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:52,635
<i>A chapter in the book</i>
<i>is about the debt.</i>

672
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,102
Ok! Thank you!

673
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:56,036
Good bye.

674
00:47:56,673 --> 00:48:01,133
No one of importance, Cavallo
or Martínez de Hoz talk in it.

675
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:04,703
<i>We want to get a Stand By</i>
<i>Credit from the IMF,</i>

676
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:10,048
<i>We want important disbursements...</i>

677
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:13,783
<i>from the World Bank and</i>
<i>the Interamerican Bank</i>

678
00:48:13,857 --> 00:48:21,764
<i>as those just mentioned are needed,</i>
<i>not to stop the Convertibility Plan</i>

679
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:24,665
<i>or to stabilize Argentina,</i>

680
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:27,761
<i>but it's needed so we</i>
<i>can start negotiating...</i>

681
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:36,007
<i>the arrangements</i>
<i>of the debt...</i>

682
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:39,947
<i>with the Commercial Banking</i>
<i>and...</i>

683
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:45,683
<i>if all's well, we start 1992,</i>

684
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:51,558
<i>with the debt as a memory</i>
<i>rather than a problem.</i>

685
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:59,968
The debt that was built through
years of corruption...

686
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:04,030
is the money that was stolen.

687
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:09,272
Pay, we must,
but for years they've

688
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:12,873
killed us with the interests.

689
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,975
We can come to an agreement...

690
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:18,283
but you can't subject a people
already hungry and in poverty...

691
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:19,822
to pay a debt.

692
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:25,920
Our government was the one
that looked for the speculators.

693
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:31,764
After World War 2, the IMF,
gave Belgium one option:

694
00:49:31,835 --> 00:49:38,900
That they paid only
what they could.

695
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:43,140
They lent as long as
the country's country's GDP...

696
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:45,340
didn't go below 10 % .

697
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:49,080
That was in '49,

698
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:52,550
it's different now,
now you have to pay.

699
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:41,999
Come in.

700
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:43,369
- How are you?
- Fine!

701
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,341
Welcome to our
humble little home.

702
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:48,634
Claudio Loser was...

703
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,510
the highest ranking
Argentine in the IMF,

704
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:53,811
He was director for
the Western Hemisphere,

705
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:56,876
the richest part of the world.

706
00:50:56,953 --> 00:50:58,580
Sorry to interrupt you on Sunday.

707
00:50:58,655 --> 00:50:59,849
<i>That's alright!</i>

708
00:50:59,923 --> 00:51:03,381
It's not any Sunday.
It's our anniversary Sunday.

709
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:07,658
- Would you like some cake?
- Yes! Please.

710
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,926
This is cheese
and this is peach.

711
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:16,530
International organizations
pay well, no one starves.

712
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:22,645
The World Economic Forum

713
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:26,309
meets once a year in Davos.

714
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:30,149
To get to Davos, to the
World Economic Conference,

715
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:33,621
costs any businessman
u$ s 30,000.

716
00:51:45,635 --> 00:51:47,603
Davos is also this:

717
00:51:47,871 --> 00:51:54,367
Different credentials allow you
access to levels of power.

718
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:59,404
It's not easy to go through
these levels if you're press.

719
00:52:00,984 --> 00:52:02,884
You have to go back.

720
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:09,447
Credentials for Davos,
for the kids in Tucumán.

721
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,793
Would they let them in?

722
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:21,571
She's Anne Krueger,

723
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:25,171
the Vice-president of the IMF.

724
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:32,011
Those four on the right
are the delegates of Argentina.

725
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:34,477
They've come to explain
that they cannot pay.

726
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:36,416
- Five?
- Five.

727
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:39,250
Your opinion
on Anne Krueger?

728
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:48,789
She is...

729
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:52,533
...let's say...

730
00:52:54,304 --> 00:52:57,398
Get to work, do it!

731
00:52:57,474 --> 00:53:01,137
She's very obstinate...

732
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:07,208
You can't change her mind.

733
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:14,017
Considering your economy
I can only lend you 10 cents.

734
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:32,530
The institution as it is,
is like a small market,

735
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:38,370
a small world where those inside
don't relate to the outside

736
00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:56,720
It's a bureaucratic culture.
They're bureaucrats.

737
00:54:56,793 --> 00:55:01,230
They have there own sports
clubs, gyms, restaurants,

738
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:03,823
they don't relate
to the rest of society.

739
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:08,633
If you play golf, it costs
about $200 to $250 a month.

740
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:15,076
There's a lot of criticism
in the U. S about the IMF,

741
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:20,208
and World Bank's social dealings
with the rest of the world.

742
00:55:33,563 --> 00:55:35,929
Mummy's over there.

743
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:40,867
Hello! How are you?

744
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,401
What are you going to call it?

745
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:45,703
If it's a boy Rodrigo Nicolás,

746
00:55:45,775 --> 00:55:48,039
if it's a girl Priscila Luciana.

747
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:51,638
We wanted it, we've been
together for a year.

748
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:54,115
If it's a girl, Priscila, right?

749
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:56,277
- Yes! Yes.
- And if it's a boy?

750
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,446
- Rodrigo Nicolás.
- Rodrigo Nicolás.

751
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:00,546
- How many kids have you got?
- Ten.

752
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:05,219
We're almost the forgotten ones,
must be because we're poor.

753
00:56:05,295 --> 00:56:06,922
Where does Nancy live?

754
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:09,259
Hi Nancy! How are you?

755
00:56:09,499 --> 00:56:11,763
How many people live here?

756
00:56:11,835 --> 00:56:14,804
10 kids plus me and my husband.

757
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:17,669
- How many kids have you got?
- Seven.

758
00:56:18,408 --> 00:56:20,638
- How many have you got?
- Eight.

759
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:21,904
I have eight kids.

760
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:23,969
All 12 sleep here?

761
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:26,743
In this room
and in the other one.

762
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:30,343
- Who are underweight?
- The little girl...

763
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:34,652
and the five year old boy are.

764
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:37,420
You tell Mary:
"I need tennis".

765
00:56:37,494 --> 00:56:39,724
We won't buy them,

766
00:56:39,796 --> 00:56:45,860
we'll get them, you go
to the soup kitchen.

767
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:48,165
We'll get them.
We'll bring them or Mary will...

768
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,035
There's no initiative,

769
00:56:50,106 --> 00:56:53,166
there's no reason to have,

770
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:55,973
- these are people that have...
- Nothing.

771
00:56:56,045 --> 00:57:00,948
No toilet, no table, no chair
What initiative can you have...

772
00:57:01,017 --> 00:57:03,508
- There is nothing.
- The problem is,

773
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:06,316
they just wait for
the benefit and that's it,

774
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:11,258
They wait for the milk, they do
nothing to better themselves.

775
00:57:11,327 --> 00:57:16,594
You stop them from living,
you stop them from loving.

776
00:57:16,666 --> 00:57:20,830
They don't have a house, car,
shower, they have nothing.

777
00:57:20,904 --> 00:57:23,168
They need sexual education.

778
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:27,676
They don't feel motherly love,
Maybe with the 1st or the 2nd,

779
00:57:27,744 --> 00:57:32,374
after 5 or 6 it's not the same.

780
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:35,475
I think that more than love
they lack sexual education...

781
00:57:35,552 --> 00:57:39,147
Sometimes they have many partners,
even from the same family.

782
00:57:39,222 --> 00:57:42,123
That's horrifying
because it's not love.

783
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:48,324
I'd like to know what you
know about contraceptives.

784
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:53,594
Nothing at all?

785
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:59,941
Do you know that we women
can decide...

786
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:02,637
when we want to
get pregnant?

787
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:08,179
That's why we've contraceptives.

788
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:10,219
You've 2, how old are you?

789
00:58:10,286 --> 00:58:11,378
19.

790
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:13,513
How old were you when you
had your 1st baby?

791
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:15,217
15.

792
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:17,054
- How old are you?
- 19.

793
00:58:17,126 --> 00:58:19,458
- How old are you Maira?
- 16?

794
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:21,861
Is this your 1st baby?

795
00:58:22,198 --> 00:58:25,167
- It's her 3rd baby.

796
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:29,069
- How old are you?
- 18.

797
00:58:29,138 --> 00:58:30,935
So you had your 1st at 15?

798
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:33,373
- At 14.
- At 14!

799
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:36,276
She brings home
another brother.

800
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:37,973
They don't have partners,

801
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:39,844
they go back to the family home.

802
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:42,476
The most important thing is
that they want to get pregnant

803
00:58:42,552 --> 00:58:45,680
as that changes their status.

804
00:58:45,755 --> 00:58:49,247
A patient used to say:
"Dr., I can't go back home...

805
00:58:49,325 --> 00:58:54,786
because my mum won't
feed another baby.

806
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:58,061
We must blame someone.

807
00:58:58,134 --> 00:59:03,470
It's not the girl's fault that
she's pregnant.

808
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,338
It's the work of the government.

809
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:08,070
International credit institutions

810
00:59:08,144 --> 00:59:09,736
share responsibility also.

811
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:15,009
They always blame someone else.

812
00:59:15,084 --> 00:59:17,712
It's very clear that
they share responsibility.

813
00:59:17,787 --> 00:59:19,414
Barbarita, Barbarita...

814
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:21,218
Teenage mothers.

815
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:23,816
There's lack of solidarity.

816
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,451
For me, it's the debt.

817
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:35,737
The IMF is the ultimate lender,

818
00:59:35,805 --> 00:59:40,902
the loan shark that you go
to as a last alternative,

819
00:59:40,977 --> 00:59:43,969
and if the loan shark charges
excessive interest...

820
00:59:44,047 --> 00:59:46,777
and is brutal
the IMF instead,

821
00:59:46,849 --> 00:59:49,750
charges you
with reforms,

822
00:59:49,819 --> 00:59:55,257
with measures that
are meant to "tighten belts"

823
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:59,989
And normally this falls back
on the weakest in society.

824
01:00:00,063 --> 01:00:03,226
They heard from the press
accusations about corruption,

825
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:11,206
that didn't stop the IMF
from lending money.

826
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:13,139
- Why?
- Corruption.

827
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:18,579
It's a problem...
An internal problem.

828
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:20,946
The economic policy is also
internal but they intrude.

829
01:00:21,017 --> 01:00:27,855
This corresponds to the mandate.

830
01:00:27,924 --> 01:00:31,724
The economic adjustments...

831
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:36,231
fall into the IMF's jurisdiction.

832
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,855
We'll try again.

833
01:01:14,203 --> 01:01:15,534
Press.

834
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:17,672
We can go in.

835
01:01:23,446 --> 01:01:26,381
There's only one door.
That's not the place either.

836
01:01:36,592 --> 01:01:38,560
I don't know exactly.
Here they plan...

837
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:42,120
the agenda
for the year,

838
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:43,722
the politicians...

839
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:46,200
business people,

840
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:48,396
what happens
in here nobody knows.

841
01:01:48,471 --> 01:01:52,703
We decided to visit
the Open Forum. Can we go in?

842
01:01:52,775 --> 01:01:57,474
There's Stiglitz, one of the
most remorseful bankers.

843
01:02:39,055 --> 01:02:43,185
I asked him: "Does the IMF
have any lessons to learn?"

844
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:46,695
I asked that
and the answer was

845
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:49,994
"We always have things to learn".

846
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:55,265
Like a soundbyte I could use
to analyze with other analysts.

847
01:02:55,338 --> 01:03:00,605
What I do remember, is that
an official asked me...

848
01:03:00,676 --> 01:03:06,046
who did I think I was asking
those questions to?

849
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:07,673
You're not a journalist.

850
01:03:15,658 --> 01:03:19,560
We're inside the IMF.

851
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:22,154
Finally, after many phone
calls and mixed information.

852
01:03:22,231 --> 01:03:26,930
They were afraid we would
bring Barbarita Flores.

853
01:03:27,003 --> 01:03:28,630
We're without Barbarita.

854
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:33,902
There were 2 people coming
with us, now there's 3.

855
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:36,911
They don't want to answer
our questions or talk to us.

856
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:40,506
Until we speak with
the spokesman.

857
01:03:42,351 --> 01:03:45,878
They won't go on camera.

858
01:03:45,955 --> 01:03:47,149
No.

859
01:03:51,527 --> 01:03:53,688
Because the camera shows them?

860
01:03:53,763 --> 01:03:55,458
They don't want to be seen.

861
01:03:55,531 --> 01:03:57,260
Well! Let's walk around.

862
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:59,301
- When are we meeting him, at 2?
- At 2.

863
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:07,974
The idea is: We go to Dawson.

864
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:55,354
Am I really trying to get an
interview with a bureaucrat?

865
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:03,424
What was the responsibility of
the IMF in the Argentina crisis?

866
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:20,444
How do you explain that a
country that owes 170 billions

867
01:05:20,516 --> 01:05:24,008
is now worse off than before?

868
01:05:49,712 --> 01:05:51,771
How much do you earn a month?

869
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:01,348
Ask him what would happen
if he couldn't pay his mortgage,

870
01:06:01,424 --> 01:06:07,795
the bank repossessed his house,
his son had to change career,

871
01:06:07,863 --> 01:06:10,798
and ended up working in
"Kentucky Fried Chicken"

872
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:14,859
and his wife had
to clean houses?

873
01:06:46,902 --> 01:06:52,670
Ask him if he knows that the
image of the IMF is not good.

874
01:08:24,033 --> 01:08:25,933
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

875
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:40,705
We could say, the IMF's
no crook...

876
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:44,446
but by the way he acts
and the way

877
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:47,250
he relates with society,

878
01:08:47,323 --> 01:08:50,884
it makes him look like
an accomplice.

879
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:55,954
The IMF is the agent for
other governments,

880
01:08:56,031 --> 01:08:59,694
say the Italian government,
the Spanish government,

881
01:08:59,768 --> 01:09:01,759
They want a good relationship
with Argentina.

882
01:09:01,837 --> 01:09:04,328
So someone has to be
the bad boy.

883
01:09:04,406 --> 01:09:07,432
The problem is not only the IMF,
it's the people behind it.

884
01:09:13,616 --> 01:09:18,110
Desperate solitary nights...

885
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:21,485
Desperate solitary nights...

886
01:09:21,557 --> 01:09:24,048
In there, they take drugs...

887
01:09:24,126 --> 01:09:27,994
Desperate solitary nights...

888
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:33,124
Desperate solitary nights...

889
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:48,844
Barbarita: For a time I've been
thinking how I can explain,

890
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:51,648
as I had promised,

891
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:54,018
what happened to you.

892
01:09:54,089 --> 01:09:55,522
I can't remember it.

893
01:09:55,591 --> 01:09:58,924
I never said anything
but I should have explained.

894
01:09:58,994 --> 01:10:01,963
I can't stand it when...

895
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:05,159
I can't explain it

896
01:10:07,102 --> 01:10:11,732
The easiest way is
to find the guilty...

897
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,267
I tried...

898
01:10:14,343 --> 01:10:18,609
until I realized that real
life is not like silent films.

899
01:10:18,681 --> 01:10:24,381
I wish it was as easy as it
is in the movies but it's not.

900
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:08,119
Here the heads of state aren't
the most important people.

901
01:11:08,197 --> 01:11:13,464
The most important are
the businessmen from Europe.

902
01:11:13,535 --> 01:11:19,474
You see more VIPs here
in 3 days than anywhere else!

903
01:11:40,996 --> 01:11:43,863
Did you see that in this film,
they all have an excuse?

904
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:46,924
They all say they understand
that it's an atrocity.

905
01:11:47,002 --> 01:11:49,994
You come from Argentina,
you know how things are there.

906
01:11:50,072 --> 01:11:54,031
Do you think this is worth
anything to the poor?

907
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:04,647
On the contrary.
They'll get poorer.

908
01:12:26,975 --> 01:12:34,973
No, no, they talk about how
to stop the explosion of poverty

909
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:39,817
as happened in Argentina
in December 2001.

910
01:12:39,888 --> 01:12:42,686
I see people in the north
worried about what happens to us.

911
01:12:42,758 --> 01:12:46,159
But I feel they don't
understand what happens to us.

912
01:12:46,228 --> 01:12:52,895
They think they have the answer
to the problems of the south.

913
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:57,605
They don't realize that they
themselves are the problem!

914
01:13:13,655 --> 01:13:15,520
They make the rich richer

915
01:13:15,591 --> 01:13:17,218
and the poor poorer.

916
01:13:17,292 --> 01:13:21,023
Meeting bureaucrats, men
in ties, italian managers,

917
01:13:21,096 --> 01:13:24,532
professors, golfers,
top novelists,

918
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,329
Guys that say:

919
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:28,165
"We're looking for solutions".

920
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:31,365
Yes, it's a farce, nothing more.

921
01:13:32,007 --> 01:13:34,669
This is the heart of Davos

922
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:36,108
and the meeting's in Davos.

923
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:38,908
It's like a big stage...

924
01:13:38,981 --> 01:13:40,380
and this place, come on...

925
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:45,210
These are the important places

926
01:13:47,956 --> 01:13:50,891
They're called "Bilateral Room",

927
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,687
bilateral meeting rooms.

928
01:13:54,496 --> 01:13:59,126
In this horrible brown place

929
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:03,160
with no ventilation,

930
01:14:06,508 --> 01:14:09,238
The president of the IMF can
meet the president of Nigeria,

931
01:14:09,645 --> 01:14:13,741
Cisco System's CEO
can meet Windows'

932
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:17,218
Nestle's Manager for L. America

933
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:19,717
and a Brazilian minister.

934
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:26,559
There's 200 meetings a day
in the heart of Davos,

935
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:31,565
It's the big PR operation
of the world's richest men...

936
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:34,193
in one of the most expensive
places in Switzerland.

937
01:14:34,937 --> 01:14:36,564
It seemed unbelievable, didn't it?

938
01:14:37,339 --> 01:14:40,399
We had to pass all
the stages to get here.

939
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:42,504
This is Davos.

940
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:48,372
I asked myself a 1000 times
why we were making this film,

941
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:51,248
what we wanted to say in it.

942
01:14:52,521 --> 01:14:56,184
I wondered, was worried about
what was happening to you.

943
01:14:56,925 --> 01:15:01,555
And I remembered something
I always say...

944
01:15:02,531 --> 01:15:05,022
A guy meets someone
and asks:

945
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:08,067
Are you desperate?

946
01:15:08,136 --> 01:15:10,104
Yes! He says!

947
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:13,903
Are you sure you're desperate?
Yes, yes of course.

948
01:15:14,643 --> 01:15:16,338
Can you sleep?

949
01:15:17,446 --> 01:15:18,879
Yes.

950
01:15:19,982 --> 01:15:22,109
Desperate people cannot sleep.

951
01:15:27,656 --> 01:15:30,682
There was a worsening social
situation in Argentina...

952
01:15:32,628 --> 01:15:36,189
that was parallel to
the increase of the debt.

953
01:15:38,967 --> 01:15:42,835
The money borrowed wasn't
used as it had been promised.

954
01:15:46,508 --> 01:15:51,309
And Argentina's responsible
for spending it incorrectly.

955
01:15:57,819 --> 01:15:59,980
That's Argentina's responsibility.

956
01:16:01,924 --> 01:16:04,916
What's the lenders' responsibility?

957
01:16:05,994 --> 01:16:09,930
Did they lend it incorrectly?

958
01:17:13,028 --> 01:17:14,620
One last thing.

959
01:17:16,231 --> 01:17:21,669
We started this working on the
story of an undernourished girl.

960
01:17:24,439 --> 01:17:28,739
There is a link between
that girl in Tucumán...

961
01:17:30,045 --> 01:17:36,041
and the credit institutions.

962
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:25,523
One last question:

963
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:29,234
Do you have any
conscience problems?

964
01:18:33,809 --> 01:18:36,869
Because of the policies
you carry out.

965
01:18:58,433 --> 01:19:00,526
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

966
01:19:04,106 --> 01:19:07,405
Sounds naive, but I look at you
and ask: How can the world sleep?

967
01:19:07,476 --> 01:19:09,410
Three sad tigers...

968
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:11,606
Three sad "triggers"...

969
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:13,477
No... <i>tigers</i>.

970
01:19:13,548 --> 01:19:16,483
...they swallow wheat...
...they swallow wheat...

971
01:19:16,551 --> 01:19:18,382
...and they choke.
...and they choke.

972
01:19:18,453 --> 01:19:19,442
Let's try again.

973
01:19:19,521 --> 01:19:21,751
3 sad tigers,

974
01:19:22,324 --> 01:19:26,226
...eat wheat...
- Eat! No!

975
01:19:26,294 --> 01:19:28,091
Come back in March.

976
01:19:28,163 --> 01:19:31,155
Maybe we forget,
to be able to sleep...

977
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:35,233
but I wonder how long
we can keep forgetting.

978
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:21,579
I believe that the USA
has some responsibility.

979
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:24,084
The Clinton administration
at a certain time,

980
01:20:24,152 --> 01:20:30,819
gave Argentina an incentive
to keep the Convertibility.

981
01:21:12,467 --> 01:21:16,062
Brazil is the 4th biggest food
exporter in the world.

982
01:21:16,137 --> 01:21:20,164
And they have hungry people.

983
01:21:21,243 --> 01:21:28,308
Argentina is an agricultural
heaven, yet we have poverty.

984
01:21:28,383 --> 01:21:31,648
Please don't tell me
that the problem of Argentina

985
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:34,883
or Brazil comes from the outside!

986
01:21:34,956 --> 01:21:39,120
What's true is that the verdict
in Washington didn't help,

987
01:21:39,194 --> 01:21:42,994
It didn't rid Argentina
and Mexico of malnutrition.

988
01:21:43,064 --> 01:21:48,092
And 20 years have passed.
We must ask ourselves why...

989
01:21:48,169 --> 01:21:49,898
We must look for alternatives.

990
01:21:49,971 --> 01:21:53,805
But the existing link
is a lost illusion,

991
01:21:53,875 --> 01:22:01,839
of opportunities, failures,
concoctions that didn't work.

992
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:04,181
If you asked me,
would I rather...

993
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:07,244
feed a child or pay the IMF,

994
01:22:07,322 --> 01:22:10,189
I'd rather feed a child
but that doesn't mean...

995
01:22:10,258 --> 01:22:16,493
I wouldn't prefer that the money
robbed by the politicians,

996
01:22:16,564 --> 01:22:18,794
was returned in order
to pay the debt,

997
01:22:18,867 --> 01:22:21,461
so Argentina wouldn't be
in so much debt.

998
01:22:21,536 --> 01:22:23,197
I'd prefer that.

999
01:22:48,063 --> 01:22:51,055
Is it the IMF's fault?
Yes! That's no news.

1000
01:22:51,132 --> 01:22:53,157
The World Bank also,

1001
01:22:53,234 --> 01:22:55,964
The North against the South...

1002
01:22:56,037 --> 01:22:58,198
but also the governor
of Tucumán

1003
01:22:58,273 --> 01:22:59,934
and president "Who knows".

1004
01:23:00,008 --> 01:23:04,945
And the minister of "Who".
The man your life depends on.

1005
01:23:15,357 --> 01:23:19,487
It's night now and Anne Krueger

1006
01:23:19,561 --> 01:23:23,224
will have her nightdress on...

1007
01:23:23,765 --> 01:23:25,232
and she sleeps so well.

1008
01:23:28,269 --> 01:23:34,003
The 2000 richest men in the
world are dreaming of big fish.

1009
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:48,846
Cavallo sleeps in Harvard...

1010
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:58,389
and Martínez de Hoz
in the Kavanagh building.

1011
01:24:06,107 --> 01:24:08,132
Nobody sleeps well in Tucumán,

1012
01:24:09,177 --> 01:24:12,146
and they are all gazing
at the ceiling...

1013
01:24:13,515 --> 01:24:15,676
for the desperate cannot sleep.

1014
01:24:17,786 --> 01:24:21,620
I'm going to sleep in a while...

1015
01:24:23,558 --> 01:24:26,652
even if I now think
I will never sleep again.

1016
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:28,889
But in a while I will sleep.

1017
01:24:28,963 --> 01:24:34,833
Never had the world so much
wealth as in the 21st century

1018
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:38,304
Never before had the north
accumulated so much wealth

1019
01:24:38,373 --> 01:24:40,773
yet half of the world's
population lives on less...

1020
01:24:40,842 --> 01:24:43,572
than $2 a day.

1021
01:24:43,645 --> 01:24:46,205
Hunger's a political problem.
But selfishness, the mother

1022
01:24:46,281 --> 01:24:50,775
of hunger is a human problem.

1023
01:24:51,319 --> 01:24:54,686
You know what? I don't know
if human problems have solutions.

1024
01:24:54,756 --> 01:24:58,954
A kid cries of hunger, then stop
everything, stop it now.

1025
01:24:59,561 --> 01:25:01,825
Stop! A kid's crying of hunger,

1026
01:25:01,896 --> 01:25:03,761
close the bank,
don't go to work.

1027
01:25:03,832 --> 01:25:05,732
Get off the buses,

1028
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:08,633
stop everything now,
This camera, this computer.

1029
01:25:08,703 --> 01:25:10,568
There's a kid crying of hunger.

1030
01:25:11,172 --> 01:25:12,764
Why don't we do anything?

1031
01:25:12,974 --> 01:25:19,675
Perhaps as we're cruel,
God created forgetfulness, to forget.

1032
01:25:19,747 --> 01:25:23,376
The mirror that we built and
we're incapable of breaking.

1033
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:26,414
It's complicated isn't it?

1034
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:30,651
Barbarita, it's complicated.

1035
01:25:30,725 --> 01:25:33,819
Maybe with time we can
find a better answer.

1036
01:25:33,895 --> 01:25:37,023
I wanted to talk about you
but ended up talking about us.

1037
01:25:37,899 --> 01:25:42,336
I feel I want to ask you to
forgive me but I don't know why,

1038
01:25:43,371 --> 01:25:44,963
perhaps I should,

1039
01:25:45,206 --> 01:25:48,300
because I've only
just noticed you.

1040
01:25:49,277 --> 01:25:53,646
<i>We know we are all</i>
<i>a bit afraid.</i>

1041
01:25:53,915 --> 01:25:58,215
<i>We know we are all</i>
<i>a bit afraid.</i>

1042
01:25:58,586 --> 01:26:01,419
<i>It's difficult to get up at times.</i>

1043
01:26:01,489 --> 01:26:02,888
Everything hurts.

1044
01:26:02,957 --> 01:26:04,925
Yes! Very happy.

1045
01:26:05,293 --> 01:26:07,727
He doesn't care
how he'll earn more,

1046
01:26:07,795 --> 01:26:09,285
- Is he asking?
- Yes.

1047
01:26:09,364 --> 01:26:11,093
He thinks how he'll
enjoy himself.

1048
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:15,500
Tell me, policeman or lawyer

1049
01:26:16,571 --> 01:26:18,198
A lawyer earns more.

1050
01:26:18,273 --> 01:26:20,707
He mustn't be materialistic
of course,

1051
01:26:20,775 --> 01:26:26,145
A good person isn't
materialistic, I believe.

1052
01:26:26,214 --> 01:26:27,442
It's true.

1053
01:26:27,515 --> 01:26:29,346
My name is Patricia,
I'm 12...

1054
01:26:29,417 --> 01:26:31,476
I want to be a vet.

1055
01:26:31,553 --> 01:26:33,180
My name's Cecilia,
I'm 11...

1056
01:26:33,254 --> 01:26:35,688
and I want to be a doctor.

1057
01:26:35,757 --> 01:26:38,021
I want to be a chofer

1058
01:26:38,092 --> 01:26:40,458
- Supermarket cashier.
- Policeman.

1059
01:26:40,528 --> 01:26:41,654
Car salesman.

1060
01:26:41,729 --> 01:26:42,855
- Policeman.
- Lawyer.

1061
01:26:42,931 --> 01:26:45,456
When I grow up I'd like to be
a kindergarden teacher.

1062
01:26:54,409 --> 01:26:56,775
<i>Sometimes you must kill</i>

1063
01:26:56,844 --> 01:27:01,144
<i>Sometimes you must forgive</i>
Sometimes you forget...

1064
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:02,877
<i>and smile...</i>

1065
01:27:03,418 --> 01:27:08,151
<i>Like fear at night</i>
<i>Like fear in the morning.</i>

1066
01:27:08,223 --> 01:27:12,091
<i>And carry on</i>
<i>and carry on.</i>

1067
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:17,254
<i>We know we are all</i>
<i>a bit afraid.</i>

1068
01:27:17,465 --> 01:27:21,959
<i>We know we are all</i>
<i>a bit afraid.</i>

1069
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:26,469
<i>We know we are all</i>
<i>a bit afraid.</i>

1070
01:27:26,841 --> 01:27:31,608
<i>We know we are all</i>
