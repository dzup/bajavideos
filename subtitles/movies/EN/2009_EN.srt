For narrative reasons' some ofthe facts'

4
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:32,362
Buenos Aires' January 1923

5
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:54,277
REBELLION IN PATAGONIA

6
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,879
Son of a bitch!

7
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,500
Río Gallegos' 3 years before

8
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:19,576
Things have to be said without
mincing words' comrades.

9
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:23,146
Hotel owners are all
a bunch of exploiters.

10
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:26,184
Yes! Despicable exploiters!

11
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:29,185
The waiters and kitchen
staff of Hotel Argentino...

12
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:32,355
work from 6 in the morning
through to midnight.

13
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,992
And for that they pay us
a miserable 80 pesos!

14
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:41,066
And anyone who dares to look
askance at it' is fired...

15
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,568
and isn't able to get work
in any other hotel.

16
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,304
There are two alternatives' comrades:

17
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:49,141
Either die of hunger
or kowtow to them.

18
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,209
We have to fuel the fire' comrades!

19
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,210
There's no chance ofwinning here:
I demand that the Federation...

20
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,348
calls a strike in the hotels.

21
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,349
Because otherwise' we'll
do justice with our own hands...

22
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:02,385
and not an exploiter will be left
with a head in all of Río Gallegos.

23
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:05,555
Starting with my boss'
the bloodsucker Carballeira.

24
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:09,392
One moment' comrades!
Wait a moment.

25
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:13,198
Permission to speak.
Go on.

26
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,199
You're right"
but we must be disciplined.

27
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,670
If hotels have to be burnt'
we'll burn them'

28
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,675
but it must be by a
majority resolution.

29
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:26,478
Because there are two fundamental
words that shouldn't be forgotten...

30
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,479
in union anarchy:
Discipline and Organization.

31
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,452
Comrade Graña.

32
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,456
Comrades' the time has come
for plain speaking.

33
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:44,994
The issues about...

34
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:48,097
organization and discipline
you've been listening to'

35
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:53,536
leave out human values.

36
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,808
Speak plainly' then.

37
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,544
OK' but say once and for all.

38
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:02,545
Do you agree with
the hotel strike? Yes or no?

39
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,649
Comrade Secretary General'

40
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,918
you're restricting me
in my turn to speak.

41
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:09,919
You're right' comrade.
But be concrete' please.

42
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:13,523
I'm being asked for
definitions here'

43
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:16,626
but I'm replying
that before a strike...

44
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:20,797
it's preferable to know
where the individual's going.

45
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:25,535
Whatthe revolution is for.

46
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:29,105
Well said Kropotkin
that revolutions...

47
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:32,809
Comrade Graña' we'll discuss
that in the ideology lessons.

48
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:36,579
Right now we're dealing
with the hotel staff strike.

49
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,017
Begging your pardon.

50
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:42,018
Comrade Danielewski
reports now.

51
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,524
Comrades' I have to
denounce the Hotel España...

52
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:52,929
which pays Chilean workers
halfwages...

53
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,367
justfor being Chilean.

54
00:08:57,603 --> 00:09:00,603
We cab drivers...

55
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:03,673
inform the Federation
of our solidarity...

56
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,877
with the strike' by not driving
a single passenger...

57
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:11,550
to the hotels! Not one!

58
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,551
- Strike!
- Yes' Strike!

59
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:16,354
I want to tell you' that I've come
from Puerto Santa Cruz...

60
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:19,355
I want to tell you' that I've come
from Puerto Santa Cruz...

61
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:23,426
to bring you the solidarity
ofthe stevedores'

62
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:26,963
- ... waiters and wagoners.
- Well done' comrade!

63
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:30,099
And to inform you that if
you declare a strike'

64
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:34,037
we will also stop work in
the hotels of Puerto Santa Cruz.

65
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:38,441
Long live the comrades
of Santa Cruz! Hurrah!

66
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:41,644
- Long live anarchy!
- Hurrah!

67
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:48,320
Comrades... Comrades...

68
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:51,189
Comrades'

69
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,190
Patagonian exploiters...

70
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,927
value men less than
mules or packhorses'

71
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:04,033
since today one worker
is replaced by another...

72
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:07,706
without any cost.

73
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:10,442
- Well said.
- Very well said.

74
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,443
We're workers from
all parts ofthe world.

75
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,349
Isn'tthat so' German?

76
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,417
Eh' Poles?

77
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:22,418
And you' Chilean comrades.

78
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:25,655
And we are here'
united by solidarity.

79
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:31,427
Today that solidarity is called:

80
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,299
Support forthe comrades
hotel workers.

81
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,373
I ask' then...

82
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:44,374
for us to vote for the strike
for an indeterminate time'

83
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,313
until we win.

84
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,616
I would say' my friend'
what we need now...

85
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,621
is a bit of organization.

86
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:32,622
Nearly all the landowners
are with us.

87
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:36,159
That's good. I'm glad..
For ifthe workers unite...

88
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:39,064
No' no' no.
Athrust is needed.

89
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,266
Someone directing.

90
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:44,267
Who directs and knows
how to defend our interests.

91
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,805
What do you think' my friend?

92
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:49,806
We need a manager
for our organization.

93
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:53,545
Finding one in Río Gallegos
will be hard.

94
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,546
No' no.
We've already found him.

95
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,284
And he's very near.

96
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:02,285
Here' atthis table.

97
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,495
You' Méndez Garzón.

98
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:16,165
But' sirs' are you forgetting that I'm
the Governor ofthe territory?

99
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:20,536
Whatwould they say in BuenosAires?
Imagine'

100
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:23,675
Governor of Santa Cruz
and Manager ofthe Rural Society.

101
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:26,010
Don't you think there's
an incompatibility?

102
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:27,545
Do you think so?

103
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:30,546
From both jobs you will have
a better perspective.

104
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,350
What's more'
think of yourfuture.

105
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:37,453
Public office
is very unstable.

106
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:41,457
You're a Conservative'
the National Government is Radical.

107
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:45,962
Gentlemen' I would like to thank you
for your presence in my house.

108
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,967
Thank you' Carballeira' we are
in solidarity with the only hotel...

109
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:55,073
- ... which managed to scorn the strike.
- Thank you.

110
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,741
And how did you achieve it?

111
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:59,742
Well' quite simply'
with people of goodwill'

112
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:02,413
with responsible workers.

113
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,716
Out! Out! Scabs! Blacklegs!

114
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:07,717
I'll kick your arse!

115
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,622
Look what you've done! Look!

116
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,024
- Look at that pan!
- Get out!

117
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:15,627
- Out!
- Let me be' comrade.

118
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,628
- I have seven kids.
- That's nonsense.

119
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:21,065
Leave everything'
we'll help you.

120
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:24,066
Come on! Be off! Out!

121
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,728
See' German'

122
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:53,729
that's what I'm lacking.

123
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,634
Awoman.

124
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:59,635
A companion.

125
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:03,906
Of bourgeois upbringing'
as Graña would say.

126
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:10,479
But you won't deny
that a good pair...

127
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:15,687
Awoman!

128
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,688
To love. To love her well.

129
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:22,825
Damn it' how nice!

130
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:26,562
One thing' orthe other.

131
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:30,034
Come on' old man'

132
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,103
Because I had one'
I know what I'm saying.

133
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:35,104
Because I had one'
I know what I'm saying.

134
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,712
First itwas ideas...

135
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,713
and love.

136
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,583
Then when the kids came...

137
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:51,687
and jail.

138
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,493
Lookwhat I gave her, poor thing.

139
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:58,229
My times in jail...

140
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,230
and the kids going hungry.

141
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:05,167
- Did you leave them in Germany?
- Yes.

142
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:09,171
With the promise to bring them
over soon to enjoy the freedom'

143
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:13,376
ofjustice!

144
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:17,448
You certainly chose well.

145
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:20,449
Even in the uttermost corner
there's egoism' exploitation.

146
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:24,553
You thought you were coming
to paradise?

147
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:28,257
Look' I'll join you in the fight
until we win'

148
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,762
and then' go to live with my own ones
in earthly paradise'

149
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,235
far away from men.

150
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:39,537
And where's that?

151
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:42,538
Listen' I'm only telling itto you.

152
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:47,176
Among forests and mountains'

153
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,681
by Lago Argentino.

154
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,893
- Blood sucker!
- Criminal!

155
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:04,796
- Bastard!
- Exploiter!

156
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,797
Comrades' make way!

157
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:13,235
- Bloodsucker' slave-driver.
- Exploiter.

158
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:18,341
Gentlemen... Gentlemen' I'm here
on the advice ofthe Judge...

159
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,214
to settle this dispute.

160
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:27,852
A legitimate weapon
ofthe workers.

161
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:30,853
- Yes' yes' apologize.
- Notto us.

162
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:33,424
The ones you should apologize
to are the workers...

163
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:35,293
you fired.

164
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:37,295
The comrades.

165
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:40,296
What's more' they must be paid
the wages owing up to today.

166
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,900
And deposit in the Workers' Society
1'500 pesos as a fine' sir.

167
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:50,272
1'500?

168
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:52,343
As a fine?

169
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,146
Yes. For legal damages.

170
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:58,147
For the cost of organizing
the boycott against you'

171
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,183
printing offlyers
and moral damages.

172
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:08,924
The staffwages.

173
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:11,961
- Good!
- Well done' comrade!

174
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:48,030
- 1'500 pesos!
- Bravo!

175
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:53,803
- Good!
- Bravo!

176
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:03,546
chlldren ofthe people

177
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:08,417
and that Injustlce
cannotcontlnue.

178
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:12,655
Ifyourexlstence
Is a world oftroubles,

179
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:17,359
I'd soonerdle
than slavery.

180
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:21,664
Those bourgeols,
so selflsh,

181
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:26,135
who thus desplse
Humanlty.

182
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:30,506
They shallbe sweptaway
by anarchlsts

183
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:35,044
to the strldentshout offreedom.

184
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:40,049
Red flag,
sufferno more,

185
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,487
exploitatlon
mustsuccumb.

186
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:48,724
Rlse up, loyalpeople,

187
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:53,062
to the shout ofsoclalrevolutlon.

188
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:59,034
Dlgnlty,
Is not to be asked,

189
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:03,272
only unity
can demand It.

190
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:07,743
Ourshlelds
you shallnot smash.

191
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:12,014
clumsy bourgeols,
get back! Get back!

192
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:25,261
Comrades. Comrades

193
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,831
Comrades' with this money...

194
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:33,469
we'll be able to buy
one ofthe most-prized weapons...

195
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:36,407
of unionist anarchy.

196
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:39,408
- A printing press!
- Very good!

197
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:43,979
A printing press to clarify things
for our rural comrades...

198
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:50,886
and so thatthe ignominy
of exploitation is ended.

199
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,660
Comrades.

200
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:58,661
don't think that ranch owners
will be convinced by words.

201
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:03,367
We know it' comrade.

202
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,368
We know that the landowners
are very strong and powerful.

203
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,039
But we also know thatwe have
the fundamental weapon...

204
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:13,010
to overcome them.
The strike!

205
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:16,011
- Long live the strike!
- Hurrah!

206
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:19,217
Silence' comrades.

207
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,752
Comrades'

208
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:24,753
to carry to the final victory...

209
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,391
the black banner of anarchy...

210
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:30,361
and the red of unionism'

211
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:33,362
we must start from the bottom.

212
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:36,865
Comrades' we must affiliate
al the rural workers...

213
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:43,407
to our federation.

214
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,408
Here.

215
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:55,653
Look' Mr. Soto'

216
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:58,623
I don't understand anything
of politics' but I do try to...

217
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,725
help the rural workers'
you can count on me.

218
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:03,327
I expected no less.

219
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:06,328
You know that I earn my pesos
with my fleet ofwagons.

220
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:09,665
But I've always been
on the side ofthe underlings.

221
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,768
More than once I've been thrashed
for demanding fair wages.

222
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:16,607
That isn'tforgotten.

223
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,608
And when one has to fight' I fight'

224
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:22,713
that's why I'm called "Facón Grande".

225
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:25,182
You are a very well-respected man'

226
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:28,152
that's why we're asking you to go
affiliating the rural workers for us.

227
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:31,153
Certainly. Leave it to me.

228
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:23,806
Lookfriends'
do you know whatthis is?

229
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:27,876
Here the abuses ofthe
bad bosses are denounced.

230
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:33,117
And you know what you have to do'

231
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:35,252
join the federation...

232
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:38,253
and supportthe workers' society
which defends you.

233
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,560
Yes' man' which defends you.

234
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,561
From the bosses
and from the police too.

235
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:49,832
And from that bastard
of a governor we have.

236
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:55,304
Come on' we mustn't be afraid.

237
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:59,443
In this city we have
a nest of rats.

238
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:02,413
Rats who wantto destroy
nationality'

239
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:04,382
nationhood' ownership.

240
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,383
But my friend' don't be scared
by those crazy anarchists.

241
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:10,419
They're nothing more than a bunch of
mouthy simpleton Spanish immigrants.

242
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:13,756
Simpletons? The Russian Revolution
was made by simpletons like them.

243
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:19,962
Remember Lenin himself has to
get rid of 20 thousand anarchists.

244
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:24,867
Go on.

245
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,975
Imagine' sir, if Lenin
had killed them all'

246
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:33,976
whatwould we have to do?

247
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:37,346
Read. Read the terms carefully.

248
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:40,549
They don't acknowledge nationhood'
frontiers' or anything.

249
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:45,154
Now they're preparing a tribute
to a man who was executed in Spain.

250
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:49,291
Now that's a provocation.
I will not permit excess.

251
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:53,562
Take care' Governor' I'm warning you
that I'll report...

252
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:56,333
any breach ofthe Law.

253
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:58,335
Your Honor'

254
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:01,336
don'tthink you'll intimidate me
with your relationship with Yrigoyen.

255
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:03,908
I too have my friends'

256
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:06,909
and in more powerful places
than the Presidential Palace.

257
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:33,068
Sir, excuse me but
you may not go in.

258
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:35,539
Do you know what you're doing?

259
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,309
You are lacking respect
for my position as Judge!

260
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,744
But' sir' it's an order
from the governor.

261
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:43,013
What governor! Bullshit!

262
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:46,014
Tell that gentleman to go
and govern the Rural Society.

263
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:50,419
Gentlemen' I'm here in person
to advise you of the court's ruling:

264
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:56,227
The ceremony is permitted'

265
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,863
because it does not break
any constitutional...

266
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:01,864
or legal regulations of the Republic.

267
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:32,229
Inspector' arrest them all.

268
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,230
And confiscate the Unionist leaflets'
newspapers and books.

269
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:40,769
Come on!
Get a move on!

270
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,206
The party's over!

271
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:50,812
Those of us who were not caught have
decided to go to a general strike.

272
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:57,819
Clearly' we have to
paralyze the ports.

273
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:01,189
And the countryside.

274
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:03,527
Hello.

275
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:06,528
Comrade Soto has told us
we should turn to you.

276
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:18,106
That's right.

277
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:22,811
You three' go to Clark's descent.

278
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:27,115
You two to' make for
La Esperanza.

279
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:30,786
And us?

280
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:34,056
Over by El Cifre.

281
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:58,513
For the strike.

282
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,285
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

283
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,654
Please' gentlemen.

284
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:06,655
Gentlemen' it is essential
that urgent measures are taken.

285
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:11,028
Nearly all the estancias
in the territory...

286
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:13,397
are paralyzed by the strike.

287
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:16,398
It can't be that for the sake of
those foreign anarchists...

288
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,371
we are all in danger of ruin.

289
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:23,372
Excuse me' gentlemen. Atelegram
from BuenosAires' Mr. Governor.

290
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:26,076
Excuse me' gentlemen.
- Yes.

291
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:29,077
Traders sort outtheir problems
and then sell more'

292
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:32,948
whereas for us
the shearing is held up'

293
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:35,352
- and the price of wool drops.
- Precisely.

294
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:37,321
Gentlemen'

295
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:40,322
PresidentYrigoyen orders the
immediate release of the detained

296
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:43,494
and the opening
ofthe Workers' Society.

297
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,495
These Radicals
don't know whatthey're doing.

298
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:49,698
They thinkthat by being lenient
they'll stop them.

299
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:52,803
They're dreamers!

300
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:55,804
We've been setfree thanks to
the rural worker comrades.

301
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:01,777
Now we must fight for them.

302
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:05,313
We must achieve the first
rural workers' agreement.

303
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:09,951
So they don't carry on
living like animals!

304
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:12,954
...and itwill be presented
to the owners.

305
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:15,592
I'll read it to you.

306
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:18,028
"List of conditions:

307
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,964
First.
Bunks are abolished.

308
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:23,965
Second.
In each house for workers...

309
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:27,269
there shall be a washbasin to... to...

310
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:30,674
...to wash themselves.

311
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:33,675
Third. Lighting shall be
provided by the owner.

312
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:38,413
One packet of candles per month
for each worker.

313
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:43,051
Fourth. Each estancia
shall have a first aid kit...

314
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:47,422
with instructions in Spanish
and not in English.

315
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:51,259
Fifth. Minimum wage for sheep hands'
horse hands and herdsmen'

316
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:56,665
100 pesos. It's fair,
notwhat's paid at present.

317
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,737
Sixth. To encourage
the increase ofthe population...

318
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,907
preference will be given to workers
with families and with children.

319
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:10,378
Not as at presentwhere only
single men are contracted.

320
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:14,816
Seventh. Landowners
must recognize...

321
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:18,553
as the only organization
representing the workers...

322
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,990
the General Workers' Federation
of Río Gallegos'

323
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:26,196
a member ofthe FORA."

324
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:29,197
That's all.

325
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:35,737
Mr. Manager, sir, we'd like
you to reply to the gentlemen.

326
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,610
The Rural Society will not enter
into dealings with an organization...

327
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:45,247
led by foreigners.
On no account.

328
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:49,918
Neitherwill we discuss the
running of our estancias.

329
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:53,722
That is our business
and ours alone.

330
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:56,260
So'

331
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:59,261
the rural strike will continue
as far as its ultimate consequences.

332
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:04,199
Let's go.

333
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:17,078
Firstly' gentlemen'
we wantto put your minds at rest.

334
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:21,516
Although we are far away'
our interests are here.

335
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,455
And in Chile' of course.

336
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:28,456
We are in full
agreementwith you.

337
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:31,726
In BuenosAires we have undertaken
extremely important dealings.

338
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,730
And I say extremely important
because there is' as intermediary...

339
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:38,335
the President ofthe Republic.

340
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:41,336
On the other hand there are
the Armour and Swift meat exporters.

341
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,741
Putting pressure on through
North American Embassy?

342
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:46,577
Exactly.

343
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:49,578
Waiter, please.

344
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:55,250
But' gentlemen' the most urgent
problem is that we have to start...

345
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:58,188
with the shearing and the workers
are still on strike.

346
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:01,189
My dear friend' don'tforget that
we have a few little sheep.

347
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:08,196
In BuenosAires theAssociation of
Free Workers has been constituted'

348
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:13,802
and they're sending us the first
batch of a hundred collaborators.

349
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,268
Strike-breakers!

350
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:47,269
- Scabs! Blacklegs!
- Let's go!

351
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,337
No. Don't shoot to kill' man.

352
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:23,338
Self defense.

353
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:34,883
We gotthem scared!

354
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:45,093
InspectorMlchelll' you are to
take 10 gendarmes out there...

355
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:48,263
and brlng me those
crlmlnals underarrest.

356
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,175
The gendarmes!

357
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:01,176
They'll shitthemselves!

358
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:18,526
Shoot damn you!

359
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:53,497
So you're one of those
who beats rural workers' are you?

360
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:55,665
Forwhich land owner do you work?

361
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:58,666
They've killed Gracián!
Michelli' the son of a bitch!

362
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,138
And he fled.

363
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:04,139
You're not going to escape so easily.

364
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,577
That's how to give it
to all these dogs.

365
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:10,578
Not like that' comrade'
he was injured.

366
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:13,681
Go and heal him' if you can.

367
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:17,352
This is going from bad to worse'
five gendarmes dead.

368
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:22,557
You have to go and see
what's happening.

369
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:26,561
While the judge tells us one thing'
the governor says another.

370
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:32,233
Santa Cruz is a
bag full of cats!

371
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,572
The problem is serious.
There are many interests at stake.

372
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:43,445
There's even pressure from abroad.

373
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,817
I understand' Minister, but'

374
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:49,818
I'd like to have
more precise orders.

375
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:54,558
You spoke with the President.

376
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:57,559
Yes' but he limited himself to saying:

377
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,664
"Go' Lieutenant Colonel
and do your duty. "

378
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:03,166
Not a word more' my friend'

379
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:06,167
go and do your duty.

380
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:21,042
Mlnlster, slr, I must
tell YourExcellency

381
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:25,213
thatI've found here
that those responslble...

382
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:29,184
for the chaotlc sltuatlon
In the terrltoryofSanta cruz...

383
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:33,888
are the authorities themselves.

384
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:39,394
And thatthe police
can be classified...

385
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:45,133
as appalling.

386
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,038
The rural worker is exploited
in the most primitive manner.

387
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:57,445
He is paid with checks or vouchers'
which he has to exchange...

388
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:02,584
in the shops or stores ofthe
same companies that employ them.

389
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:09,190
Without exaggerating' I must say...

390
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:13,294
that after having
worked for a year'

391
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:16,364
he leaves as poor as when he started.

392
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:21,269
This' Minister, is one of
the origins of the strikes...

393
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:27,342
of a revolutionary nature'

394
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,679
and the cause of hatred
towards society.

395
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,649
- Does it seem reasonable' Soto?
- Yes' sir,

396
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,650
butwe can't make any decision...

397
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,720
until Facón Grande
returns from El Deseado.

398
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:40,924
Tomorrow' no?

399
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,925
Whatwe cannot accept' sir,
is handing over our weapons.

400
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:49,633
Butwhy not' Schultz?
Tell me why.

401
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:52,634
How can we be expected to hand in
our weapons? It's preposterous!

402
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:57,305
But most of them have
been stolen from the estancias.

403
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:01,009
Confiscated' Your Honor.
Confiscated.

404
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:04,846
I think it's enough
that we hand over the hostages...

405
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:08,685
and call off the strike.

406
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:11,288
Appreciate the importance'
gentlemen.

407
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,289
Itwould be the first agreement
for rural workers in Patagonia.

408
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:19,827
Sir, we will abide by
our comrades' decision.

409
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:24,432
The assembly Is soverelgn.

410
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:42,185
45 days of strike' we've won'

411
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:45,186
and now they want to exchange
our weapons for a piece of paper.

412
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:03,271
Florentino Cuello.

413
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:10,745
You're not going to tell me' sir,
that these are all the weapons?

414
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:13,216
Don't you worry'
Lieutenant Colonel

415
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:16,217
Sixty-eight and El Toscano' they'll
go shooting guanaco in the mountains.

416
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:20,188
They're not good honest working folk.

417
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,696
Alright' friends'
the party's over.

418
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:33,067
Now you have the agreement
you wanted'

419
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:36,204
now' getto work.

420
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,236
- Traitors!
- Madam!

421
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:11,339
Colonel...

422
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:16,377
I beg you' Lieutenant Colonel' sirs'
accept our apologies and...

423
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:19,582
forgive the lady.

424
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:22,085
The thing is we're all very hurt...

425
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,587
by the outcome of your negotiations.

426
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:27,588
You've handed over the triumph
to the bandits.

427
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:30,093
You don't know what you're saying'
Mr. Novas.

428
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:33,094
You must understand' those of us
who work' who live here'

429
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:36,631
- ... we have the authority to speak.
- That's not disputed!

430
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:39,469
Maybe not yourself'
but the others'

431
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,470
those from Buenos Aires'
who don't know the provinces'

432
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:46,407
why don'tthey come and struggle here'
in June' with 30 degrees below zero...

433
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:49,512
and 2 meters of snow?

434
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:52,513
I beg you to calm down'
remember there are also landowners...

435
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:55,583
who live in London and don't know
Patagonia even on the map.

436
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,920
Understand this' Lieutenant Colonel'
they've killed gendarmes'

437
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:02,423
they've setfire to estancias and you
reward them giving them an agreement.

438
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:06,463
- You leave and this will explode.
- No.

439
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,498
Ifthe landowners fulfill
their part of the agreement'

440
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:11,201
peace will be definite.

441
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:14,103
In any case' gentlemen'
I've done no more than

442
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:17,104
carry outthe orders
ofthe President.

443
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:21,742
Good night.

444
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:38,326
No' comrade'
no alcohol in here.

445
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:40,463
- It's justto counteract the fat.
- I beg you.

446
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:43,366
Alcohol only serves
to turn people brutish.

447
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:46,367
It's a weapon ofthe bourgeoisie.

448
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:48,905
Have a cup oftea.

449
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:51,906
You must be kidding' friend.
To hell with gringo habits.

450
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,710
Eating mutton with a cup of tea?!

451
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,180
Comrades' the bourgeois
reaction has begun.

452
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:03,184
That bloodsucker Fernández
has thrown me out ofthe store'

453
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:05,755
for being an agitator.

454
00:42:05,756 --> 00:42:08,756
And they've left these comrade waiters
of the café "LaArmonía" withoutjobs.

455
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:22,038
I assume responsibility

456
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:25,039
for declaring as from now
the boycott of Fernández...

457
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:28,576
and "La Armonía":

458
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:39,487
- Ready to go?
- Yes' sir.

459
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:43,991
Look.

460
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:54,368
- Friend.
Old Felix' that's all we needed.

461
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:00,677
I've been replaced
as Governor.

462
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:02,312
But that's absurd!

463
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:05,313
And' Commander Zavala's
reports.

464
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:13,554
There you have it' that's
the peacemaking he's left us.

465
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:16,993
This will never be sorted out.

466
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:18,895
Yes it will'

467
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:21,598
in BuenosAires.

468
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,100
Look here' Felix' as soon as
the new Governor arrives'

469
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:27,101
I'm going to the capital.

470
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:42,083
Where are you golng
wlth parcels and llsts?

471
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,621
ThatI see you
In such a hurry.

472
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:51,025
To the congress
ofthe anarchlsts...

473
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:55,496
to speak
and be understood.

474
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,900
Explaln,
one moment' ifyou wlll,

475
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:04,538
anarchlst'
whatdoes Itmean?

476
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:09,143
The Immense
common front ofworkers,

477
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:13,648
who clalm
the rlght to llve.

478
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,119
The worker
who tolls and sweats,

479
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:22,790
tellme, how come
he can be badly off?

480
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:27,228
Because the mule
whlch eats straw'

481
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:31,866
carrles the graln
foranotheranlmal.

482
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:36,270
It's strange,
butI don't understand,

483
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:40,975
whatdoesyou
new alluslon mean?

484
00:44:42,713 --> 00:44:45,713
That the same
thlng Is happenlng...

485
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:50,017
to the worker
with hls output.

486
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,522
That the same
thlng Is happenlng...

487
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:59,126
to the worker
with hls output.

488
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:03,397
That the same
thlng Is happenlng...

489
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:07,968
to the worker
with hls output.

490
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:46,474
And' Mr. Méndez'
when will you be traveling?

491
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:49,810
Nextweek'
on the "Asturiano".

492
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:53,147
Bring the food.

493
00:45:54,718 --> 00:45:57,718
Bring the food!

494
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:05,159
Serve the table!

495
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:13,734
Gentlemen' the food is ready'

496
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:17,138
but not one of us
is going to lift a finger.

497
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:20,141
There is someone seated here who
has been boycotted for exploiting'

498
00:46:20,644 --> 00:46:23,644
and you will not be served until
that bloodsucker Fernández...

499
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,749
- ... leaves.
- But' what are you saying?

500
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:29,750
- Butthis is outrageous.
- There was more!

501
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:33,954
- Sit down.
- You' take a hand in the matter.

502
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:36,626
This is an insult
to the nation...

503
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,661
and to the ladies present here.

504
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:41,662
Nothing. Nothing! You can stamp with
rage' we aren't lifting a finger.

505
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:45,366
Either the bloodsucker goes
or we don't serve!

506
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:53,674
Gentlemen! Gentlemen' calm down!

507
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:57,711
What's the problem?
We'll serve ourselves.

508
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,696
- How's it going' comrade?
- Good to see you.

509
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:53,302
Well' and how are
things going at Paso Ibañez?

510
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:56,005
Very bad' Mr. Font' sir. Very bad.

511
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:59,006
They're forcing us
to get nasty.

512
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:02,111
It's the same in Las Heras.

513
00:48:02,112 --> 00:48:04,580
They're saying the same everywhere:
"Forgive us' Mr. Font'

514
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:06,983
but we can't pay the raise. "

515
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:09,984
It's the order from BuenosAires'
from Gallegos' from La Mercantil.

516
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:13,890
- I don't know what.
- Damn it'

517
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:16,259
they've tricked us
with the piece of paper.

518
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,660
That's how it is.

519
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:19,962
For the moment'
in Puerto Santa Cruz...

520
00:48:19,963 --> 00:48:22,963
it's been decided to stop
the shearing of the eyes.

521
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:29,305
Comrades'

522
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:32,306
I'm deeply grateful to you...

523
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:35,709
for the post of General
Secretary of the Federation'

524
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,480
with which you have just honored me.

525
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:44,551
With the roads now passable'
the news is beginning to arrive.

526
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:51,292
The landowners
are not fulfilling the agreement.

527
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:57,233
Comrades
have to go round the countryside...

528
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:59,402
and warn
the ruralworkers...

529
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:02,171
so thatnext summer
they flnd us ready and wllllng...

530
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:05,172
to face a flght that cannot
be putoffany longer.

531
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:11,378
- And' German?
- Everything's ready.

532
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:14,682
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

533
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:47,149
Afew minutes of your patience.

534
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,951
There is some news.

535
00:49:48,952 --> 00:49:51,952
The Chilean Embassy is
very concerned aboutthis matter.

536
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:55,689
Anotherfavorable fact.
The English representative...

537
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:59,929
warned the Chancery
that another strike...

538
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:02,565
would damage
British interests.

539
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:04,934
Very good' we're not alone.

540
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:07,935
What's more' he hinted
that in the Falklands'

541
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:11,205
there are two warships
ready for any emergency.

542
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:15,509
These Radicals are beginning
to have problems. Port stoppages'

543
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:20,314
strikes in La Forestal'
internal conflicts in the party'

544
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:24,220
and as an added extra' the coming
presidential elections.

545
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:27,221
I don'tthink the government wants to
complicate things with a new conflict.

546
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:31,025
Gentlemen' you may go in.

547
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:08,662
Stop!

548
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:35,789
Comrades' in Gallegos
they've unmasked.

549
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:39,695
Politicians and exploiters
all mixed up in it.

550
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:41,397
They've started stirring it up.

551
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:44,398
- Any arrested?
- Arrested?

552
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,768
All ofthem!

553
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:59,446
Comrades' take as delegated
the order for a general strike...

554
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:04,785
to each of the estancias
where you work.

555
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:07,923
We'll respond
to the owners' provocation...

556
00:52:07,924 --> 00:52:10,893
with the orders
of the organized workers.

557
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:13,095
Strike!

558
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:16,096
And form one single
great column of protest.

559
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:20,567
All the columns of strikers
must meet at Lago Argentino.

560
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:26,106
OK' mister' you're facing
the Red Council which will make...

561
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:29,345
the Socialist Revolution
in Patagonia.

562
00:52:29,346 --> 00:52:32,346
El Toscano' yours truly'
my comrade' No. 68' from Ushuaia'

563
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:37,618
Frank Cross' cowboy from Arizona'

564
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:41,121
José Barría' Chilean'
but not Chilote [as an insult]'

565
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:44,591
and Zacarías Caro'
Patagonian by adoption.

566
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:51,899
OK' mister, go handing over
all the weapons you have'

567
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,170
money' jewels...

568
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,680
The Red Council greets
the striking comrades.

569
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,619
Go on!

570
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:46,620
You're nothing but bandits!

571
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:50,724
Scantfavor you're doing
to the workers' cause.

572
00:53:52,596 --> 00:53:55,596
The strike has been called to
free the detained comrades.

573
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,200
And for the landowners
to comply with the agreement.

574
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:01,904
And that's all!

575
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:04,807
Alright.
But stirring things.

576
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:07,808
Any gendarme that's found...

577
00:54:07,844 --> 00:54:10,844
And all the cash
to buy weapons.

578
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:14,681
Join us!

579
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:18,252
Not one of you lot has
anything to do with the strike.

580
00:54:19,055 --> 00:54:22,055
This is a genuine
workers' movement!

581
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:28,430
When the strike ends
the Workers' Federation...

582
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:31,431
will pay you for the damages
and the provisions.

583
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:35,369
Now you have to come
with us as a hostage.

584
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,312
They'll wipe out the lot of you
Let's go.

585
00:54:43,313 --> 00:54:46,313
The situation' Lieutenant Colonel'
is much more serious...

586
00:54:47,217 --> 00:54:49,385
than you realized.

587
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:52,321
The territory is overrun
by bandits.

588
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:55,322
They kill land owners'
rape their women.

589
00:54:55,425 --> 00:54:58,425
They say they're going to raise
the red flag in the Plaza de Mayo.

590
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:04,431
The President
has decided that you...

591
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:08,168
shall command the troops once again.

592
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:11,838
Zavala' you well know the high esteem
in which PresidentYrigoyen holds you.

593
00:55:15,845 --> 00:55:18,845
Your responsibility
now is greater.

594
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:22,316
We run the risk
of losing the Patagonia.

595
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:26,653
Think of Chile.

596
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:33,226
Lieutenant Colonel' we have
to finish once and for all...

597
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:37,164
with these anarchists.

598
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:43,170
Take them to the room.

599
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,075
Lieutenant Colonel' sir'
I'm going to settle the troops.

600
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:49,076
Go on then.

601
00:55:50,613 --> 00:55:53,613
You arrive and I leave.
I've been called to Buenos Aires.

602
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:56,418
- Indeed!
- No problem.

603
00:55:56,419 --> 00:55:59,419
- You'll get it all sorted.
- Yes' definitively.

604
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:03,492
See here' the workers
trust you.

605
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:05,594
The workers have let me down.

606
00:56:05,595 --> 00:56:08,595
Farewell' sir,
have a good trip.

607
00:56:12,135 --> 00:56:15,135
The Spaniard Outerello is at
Puerto Santa Cruz and Paso Ibáñez.

608
00:56:18,308 --> 00:56:21,308
In the north' José Font'
alias Facón Grande'

609
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:26,146
in control of the Puerto Deseado
to Las Heras railway line.

610
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:31,351
In the foothills of the Andes'
the leader Soto.

611
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:36,289
And somewhere about'

612
00:56:36,526 --> 00:56:39,526
the famous Red Council.

613
00:56:41,865 --> 00:56:44,865
LieutenantArrieta' take a truck'
fifteen soldiers'

614
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:49,136
go out in search ofthe Red Council
and on a mission to harass...

615
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:51,373
the Spaniard Soto.

616
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:54,374
CaptainArzeno' the big group
will begin operations...

617
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:57,379
clearing up the center
and north of the area.

618
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:59,281
Excuse me' Lieutenant
Colonel' sir?

619
00:56:59,282 --> 00:57:01,917
According to the information gathered'
each column of strikers...

620
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,286
is four or five times
bigger than our troops.

621
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:07,287
Captain Arzeno' we can't
make an academic war here.

622
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:10,325
The orders we have
are perfectly clear,

623
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:13,326
to utterly destroy the uprising.

624
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:18,901
Death sentence"

625
00:57:18,902 --> 00:57:21,737
Anyone who resists
will be executed.

626
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:23,772
Without batting an eyelid!

627
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:26,773
We have to stain
the Patagonia with blood.

628
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:29,910
May no one feel weak...

629
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:33,079
and may everyone
fulfil his duty.

630
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:37,584
Any questions?

631
00:57:38,054 --> 00:57:40,489
Good.

632
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:42,524
Lieutenant Colonel' sir'

633
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:45,525
The gentlemen Matthews and Saunders
have asked to accompany us.

634
00:57:45,728 --> 00:57:48,297
They could act as guides.

635
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:51,298
That's fine.

636
00:57:51,534 --> 00:57:53,769
Very good sir.

637
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:56,770
Only this way can this land
continue being Argentina.

638
00:57:58,041 --> 00:58:01,041
Thank you. Good afternoon.

639
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:05,879
Lieutenant Colonel' sir.

640
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:18,760
Avery hard campaign
awaits us.

641
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:21,761
May I give the troops
some time off?

642
00:58:21,764 --> 00:58:23,966
Only until 10 p. m.

643
00:58:23,967 --> 00:58:26,967
Tomorrow we rise at 5 a. m.

644
00:59:04,173 --> 00:59:07,173
Excuse me' Lieutenant Colonel' sir.

645
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:14,748
Mayer' take time off.

646
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:18,153
I'm told there are very
pretty girls here.

647
00:59:18,154 --> 00:59:21,154
Thank you' Lieutenant Colonel' sir.

648
00:59:21,257 --> 00:59:24,257
- Mayer.
- Sir.

649
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:26,595
Are you of German
descent or...?

650
00:59:26,596 --> 00:59:28,530
German' Lieutenant Colonel' sir.

651
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:31,531
A good race' Mayer. Good race.

652
00:59:32,302 --> 00:59:35,302
- Viel Vergnugen.
- Danke schön' Herr Obertsleutnant.

653
01:00:05,535 --> 01:00:07,135
Kneel down.

654
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:10,136
Kneel down!

655
01:00:12,575 --> 01:00:14,476
Order fire.

656
01:00:14,477 --> 01:00:16,778
- Aim!
- Aim!

657
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:19,779
- Fire!
- Fire!

658
01:00:25,588 --> 01:00:28,588
The army! Soldiers!

659
01:00:38,668 --> 01:00:41,668
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot' it's Zavala!

660
01:00:42,238 --> 01:00:45,238
Bring a sheet.

661
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:52,579
Flag to discuss peace terms.

662
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:56,850
Order a cease fire.

663
01:01:29,485 --> 01:01:31,153
We want to tell you...

664
01:01:31,154 --> 01:01:34,154
Take your hat off when
you speak to me' eh?

665
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:40,026
We don'twantto have
a confrontation with the army.

666
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:43,331
All we are asking is that
our detained comrades are freed...

667
01:01:43,332 --> 01:01:44,933
and the rural agreement obeyed.

668
01:01:44,934 --> 01:01:47,169
I am here in person
so thatthere can be no doubt...

669
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:49,337
regarding my position'

670
01:01:49,338 --> 01:01:51,840
unconditional surrender...

671
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:54,841
or the death penalty
for all who resist.

672
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:01,183
We were hoping you had come
to see thatthe agreementwas obeyed...

673
01:02:01,184 --> 01:02:03,685
- ... which you yourself signed.
- and you lot didn't obey.

674
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:06,521
- The landowners...
- The owners and all of you lot.

675
01:02:06,522 --> 01:02:09,391
All! Look' don'ttalk to me
about agreements.

676
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:12,392
This is all that matters.

677
01:02:15,364 --> 01:02:18,364
Good. With regard to your demand'

678
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:22,068
we must consult
with the ranch delegates.

679
01:02:23,606 --> 01:02:26,606
Wait a moment.

680
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:31,446
Sirs' we are atwar.

681
01:02:31,447 --> 01:02:33,248
We must act swiftly.

682
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:36,249
We have to rescue the hostages and
save the blood of our soldiers.

683
01:02:39,055 --> 01:02:42,055
And ifwhen these criminals
come we receive them with gunfire?

684
01:02:42,692 --> 01:02:45,692
The leaders dead' the Chilean
scum will surrender immediately.

685
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:50,530
If you give the order,
Lieutenant Colonel' sir...

686
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:53,967
But Colonel...
What are you doing?

687
01:02:54,003 --> 01:02:56,938
They'll kill us all.

688
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:59,939
There are many strikers
out there.

689
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:03,610
And I...

690
01:03:04,046 --> 01:03:06,681
I have a family'

691
01:03:06,682 --> 01:03:08,483
three children.

692
01:03:08,484 --> 01:03:11,484
I have six children.

693
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:19,027
Do you realize' Captain?

694
01:03:19,028 --> 01:03:22,028
Civilians can't be brought in
to deal with these things.

695
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:26,332
It has been decided...

696
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:29,337
It has been decided
to call an assembly.

697
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:31,740
As from now' we will
free the hostages...

698
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:34,042
to show them that
we have nothing against you lot...

699
01:03:34,043 --> 01:03:36,812
and the only thing we ask
is justice.

700
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:39,714
I said unconditional surrender.

701
01:03:39,715 --> 01:03:42,715
You have 2 hours to decide.

702
01:03:45,054 --> 01:03:48,054
And remember,
my hand will not tremble.

703
01:04:02,305 --> 01:04:05,305
They won't surrender,

704
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:08,508
all the worse for them.

705
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:21,623
And so?

706
01:04:21,624 --> 01:04:24,624
The surrender will be accepted only
when freedom is given...

707
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:28,795
to the strikers and you
assure us of fulfillment...

708
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:31,666
ofthe rural agreement.

709
01:04:31,667 --> 01:04:33,768
Who is he?

710
01:04:33,769 --> 01:04:35,837
The owner of La Barrancosa.

711
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:37,305
Why did you kill him?

712
01:04:37,306 --> 01:04:40,306
- Itwas the soldiers.
- You are the murderers'

713
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:43,376
because you provoked this situation.
Captain' four shots.

714
01:04:45,681 --> 01:04:48,149
What' Lieutenant Colonel' sir?

715
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:51,150
Fire him four shots!

716
01:04:51,921 --> 01:04:54,022
- Come on...
- Sergeant!

717
01:04:54,023 --> 01:04:56,725
Come on' Commander' don'tjoke.

718
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:59,227
You four' seize him.

719
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:01,663
You lot' seize the rest.

720
01:05:01,664 --> 01:05:04,065
No! No' no! Let me go!

721
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:06,835
Zavala! Zavala! No! Please!

722
01:05:06,836 --> 01:05:09,836
Zavala' no' please!
Let me go! Let me go! Zavala!

723
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:13,273
Zavala' please!

724
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:19,014
- Zavala' please!
- Aim!

725
01:05:19,015 --> 01:05:22,015
- Fire!
- Zavala' please! No!

726
01:05:33,729 --> 01:05:36,729
"Lieutenant Colonel Zavala disembarked
at Gallegos on his way to Deseado. "

727
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:40,602
Just as well.

728
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:43,603
The Commander is a guarantee.

729
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:52,312
- Hurrah for the strike' damn it!
- Hurrah!

730
01:05:52,915 --> 01:05:54,683
Down with the exploiters!

731
01:05:54,684 --> 01:05:57,684
Stop this all of you!

732
01:05:59,422 --> 01:06:02,422
I didn't know there were
so many thieves amongst you!

733
01:06:03,993 --> 01:06:05,694
Drop everything and get out!

734
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:08,463
Come on' friend...

735
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:11,333
Get out' I said!

736
01:06:11,334 --> 01:06:14,334
Alcohol is our
worst enemy.

737
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:18,338
Damn them' they're like priests.

738
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:39,625
Here you have him Facón'
quite tame.

739
01:06:41,263 --> 01:06:43,999
Do you remember when
he put you in the stocks?

740
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,835
Goddamn son of a bitch!

741
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:49,836
I can still feel
the lashes you gave me.

742
01:06:50,072 --> 01:06:53,072
No' leave him!
He's alone and unarmed.

743
01:06:53,709 --> 01:06:56,709
Remove his badges' he doesn't
deserve them' for bad police.

744
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:04,183
And now let him go.

745
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:07,854
It's notthe done thing to
kick a man when he's down.

746
01:07:42,925 --> 01:07:45,925
Look out! They're gendarmes.

747
01:07:46,996 --> 01:07:49,996
Ready!

748
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:53,066
It's not the police' it's the army.

749
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:55,770
Lower your weapons!

750
01:07:55,771 --> 01:07:58,771
Take aim.

751
01:07:58,774 --> 01:08:01,774
Fire!

752
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:17,358
Withdraw!

753
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:20,359
All back to the camp!

754
01:08:49,058 --> 01:08:52,058
Mr. friend Martense'
how's business?

755
01:08:52,228 --> 01:08:55,228
So-so.
With passengers?

756
01:08:57,233 --> 01:09:00,233
No' I'm with my comrade'
on Federation business.

757
01:09:01,737 --> 01:09:04,737
Get out of here! Right now!

758
01:09:05,007 --> 01:09:07,609
They're shooting
all the Federates!

759
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:10,378
- Butwho's shooting?
- Well who do you think?

760
01:09:10,379 --> 01:09:13,379
Your beloved Zavala.

761
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:16,684
Butwhere? Who?

762
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:19,685
Who? Well Ramón's already
taken care of.

763
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:24,323
- Outerello?
- The same. As you hear it.

764
01:09:25,194 --> 01:09:28,096
And in Cañadón León'
he's left them scattered.

765
01:09:28,097 --> 01:09:30,532
About a hundred are left dead.

766
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:33,533
Indeed' they make you dig your grave'
they can't be bothered even with that.

767
01:09:35,471 --> 01:09:38,471
And when the ground Is hard
they make a plle ofyou,

768
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:42,675
they sprlnkle itwith petrol
and then setllght to It.

769
01:09:46,215 --> 01:09:49,215
Dead when attempting
to flee: 13.

770
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:53,219
Dead when attempting
to flee: 13.

771
01:09:58,093 --> 01:10:01,093
Excuse me' Lieutenant Colonel' sir?

772
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:05,698
I need to tell you something.

773
01:10:06,468 --> 01:10:09,468
Isn't it too much punishment
for what these men have done?

774
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:20,680
Do you think I
enjoy shooting?

775
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:26,686
There's not other remedy here.

776
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:30,223
There are too few of us
to dominate them.

777
01:10:31,794 --> 01:10:34,794
In this empty wilderness'
the only way is being hard handed.

778
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:40,201
Last night we took 400 prisoners.

779
01:10:40,202 --> 01:10:43,202
Do you thinkwe're able to keep watch
day and night over so many rebels?

780
01:10:44,106 --> 01:10:47,106
We're running the risk now
of losing Patagonia.

781
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:50,810
Think of Chile' Captain.
Think of Chile.

782
01:12:29,878 --> 01:12:32,878
They must be scabs' blacklegs.
We'll stop them.

783
01:12:32,881 --> 01:12:35,881
Come on!

784
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:44,023
It's Facón Grande' that's all.

785
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:45,827
Get ready.

786
01:12:45,828 --> 01:12:47,962
Ready!

787
01:12:47,963 --> 01:12:50,331
- Get ready.
- Ready!

788
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:52,433
Ready!

789
01:12:52,434 --> 01:12:55,434
Quickly!

790
01:12:58,774 --> 01:13:00,475
Aim!

791
01:13:00,476 --> 01:13:02,343
- Aim!
- Aim!

792
01:13:02,344 --> 01:13:03,678
Stop!

793
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:06,679
- Fire!
- Fire!

794
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:12,754
Attack!

795
01:13:12,755 --> 01:13:15,490
Attack. Come on.

796
01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:18,092
Come on! Come on' forward!

797
01:13:18,093 --> 01:13:21,093
Stand up to them!

798
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:24,630
- To the ground.
- To the ground!

799
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:30,338
Fire!

800
01:13:30,339 --> 01:13:33,339
Attack!

801
01:13:33,675 --> 01:13:36,675
Keep firing' damn it!

802
01:13:48,957 --> 01:13:51,957
Cover him! Cover him!

803
01:13:59,635 --> 01:14:02,635
Stop! Stop firing!

804
01:14:04,573 --> 01:14:07,573
Damn it.
Itwas Zavala.

805
01:14:08,544 --> 01:14:11,544
We made him back down.

806
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:33,067
We made a heck of a mistake.

807
01:14:33,068 --> 01:14:35,136
You're going to worry now?

808
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:38,137
Let's celebrate!

809
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:03,898
You're already drunk
again' friend.

810
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:05,967
Don't do thatto me.

811
01:15:05,968 --> 01:15:08,302
Come' Mr. Font' sir' the telegraph.

812
01:15:08,303 --> 01:15:11,105
Facón Grande is receiving.

813
01:15:11,106 --> 01:15:13,441
Put this.

814
01:15:13,442 --> 01:15:16,442
Friend José Font'

815
01:15:16,545 --> 01:15:19,545
Edward Matthews
offers himself as a mediator.

816
01:15:21,917 --> 01:15:24,917
Please travel to Jaramillo.

817
01:15:26,588 --> 01:15:29,588
Guarantee offered.

818
01:15:30,559 --> 01:15:32,527
Commander Zavala...

819
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:35,463
...open to positive solutions.

820
01:15:35,464 --> 01:15:37,932
OK' tell him that I've
already set off for there and...

821
01:15:37,933 --> 01:15:40,933
thank the gringo Matthews.

822
01:16:18,941 --> 01:16:21,941
Facón' give yourself up!

823
01:16:23,145 --> 01:16:25,546
I'm here to discuss peace terms
with Commander Zavala.

824
01:16:25,547 --> 01:16:28,547
Who wantto talk to me?

825
01:16:35,524 --> 01:16:38,524
Arrest him' for murdering
Argentine soldiers.

826
01:16:43,565 --> 01:16:46,565
That's treason!

827
01:16:47,536 --> 01:16:50,536
If you're a man
I'll fight you with my hands tied!

828
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:54,640
Take him away!

829
01:16:56,078 --> 01:16:59,078
I'm Facón Grande's second in command.
I'm here to make a pact.

830
01:17:00,148 --> 01:17:02,617
Get down. Come on!
Get down!

831
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:04,619
Wait a minute'

832
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:07,620
I'm the Gaucho Cuello'

833
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:10,725
delegate of the Fede...

834
01:17:10,726 --> 01:17:13,726
...ofthe Workers' Federation.

835
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:22,635
You take care ofthe other one.

836
01:17:28,944 --> 01:17:30,778
Take them away.

837
01:17:30,779 --> 01:17:33,779
Come on. Walk!

838
01:17:33,849 --> 01:17:36,849
Come on!

839
01:17:37,386 --> 01:17:40,386
Get up. Get him up.

840
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:43,724
Come on' walk.

841
01:17:43,725 --> 01:17:46,725
Walk! Come on!

842
01:17:54,436 --> 01:17:57,436
Come on' look sharp. Justthere.
Justthere.

843
01:17:57,472 --> 01:18:00,472
Get ready.

844
01:18:07,549 --> 01:18:09,350
Aim!

845
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:11,752
You don't kill a gaucho like that!

846
01:18:11,753 --> 01:18:14,753
Fire!

847
01:18:16,491 --> 01:18:19,491
Load.

848
01:19:46,348 --> 01:19:49,348
Come on.

849
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:55,220
Lieutenant Colonel' sir' we good
men have organized ourselves

850
01:19:57,325 --> 01:20:00,325
as a white guard and we're here
to offer you our support

851
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:04,832
That's fine.

852
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:07,101
You may join the column.

853
01:20:07,102 --> 01:20:10,102
We wantto tell you thatthe
Rural Society is to put your name...

854
01:20:11,306 --> 01:20:14,306
forward as military governor
of Santa Cruz.

855
01:20:16,611 --> 01:20:19,611
Gentlemen' I'm not guided
by any personal ambition.

856
01:20:21,049 --> 01:20:24,049
I'm doing my duty'
as I understand I must.

857
01:20:27,389 --> 01:20:29,790
Excuse me' Lieutenant Colonel' sir.

858
01:20:29,791 --> 01:20:32,791
The Red Council.

859
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:40,666
So you lot wanted to implant
socialism in Patagonia.

860
01:20:42,437 --> 01:20:44,471
A good catch' Chief.

861
01:20:44,472 --> 01:20:47,174
A photo for the BuenosAires
newspapers.

862
01:20:47,175 --> 01:20:50,175
So the readers find out
what these strikers are like.

863
01:20:51,713 --> 01:20:54,713
Letthem see the armbands clearly.

864
01:20:56,351 --> 01:20:59,019
That's it.

865
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:02,020
I think' friend Zavala' that it
would be best to leave these alive'

866
01:21:03,124 --> 01:21:06,124
so that public opinion finds out
what the Patagonian reds are like.

867
01:21:06,995 --> 01:21:09,995
Very good'
friend Méndez Garzón.

868
01:21:11,566 --> 01:21:14,566
We'll place them at the disposal
of the Judge.

869
01:21:15,637 --> 01:21:18,637
Ready' now!

870
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:25,544
As I feared. When they attacked us
as a mob I understood it all.

871
01:21:27,749 --> 01:21:30,749
Antonio' all that's left to us
is to fight' confrontthem.

872
01:21:32,854 --> 01:21:35,854
Fight? With these men?

873
01:21:36,391 --> 01:21:38,559
Most ofthem don't even know
how to use a weapon.

874
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,395
They must be taught!

875
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:43,731
Listen' German'

876
01:21:43,732 --> 01:21:46,732
the comrades are already looking
at us askance' you know?

877
01:21:46,935 --> 01:21:49,935
They have to be spoken to' prepared.

878
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:54,039
For two and a half months now
we've been out in the countryside.

879
01:21:55,443 --> 01:21:58,245
Sleeping out in the open
most ofthe time.

880
01:21:58,246 --> 01:22:01,246
Eating whatever there is.
We don't even have tobacco left

881
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:04,750
Antonio' that's struggling.
You have to be organized.

882
01:22:06,955 --> 01:22:09,823
You Spaniards'
you talk a lot...

883
01:22:09,824 --> 01:22:12,824
but you're not organized' no discipline.
How many weapons are there?

884
01:22:16,031 --> 01:22:19,031
Some fifty rifles
and about a hundred revolvers.

885
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:22,336
Ammunition?

886
01:22:22,337 --> 01:22:24,271
There'd be ten shots per gun.

887
01:22:24,272 --> 01:22:26,473
Enough to hold out.

888
01:22:26,474 --> 01:22:28,542
And when they're all gone?

889
01:22:28,543 --> 01:22:31,111
We'll fight them with knives.

890
01:22:31,112 --> 01:22:33,747
Take aim.

891
01:22:33,748 --> 01:22:36,083
Lower your weapons!

892
01:22:36,084 --> 01:22:39,053
Unload!

893
01:22:39,054 --> 01:22:42,054
Load. Unload.

894
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:45,791
Good' comrade' and?
What are we waiting for?

895
01:22:46,561 --> 01:22:48,929
Tonight's assembly.

896
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:51,930
No' my people want
the assembly right now.

897
01:22:52,867 --> 01:22:55,867
That's no problem.

898
01:22:57,472 --> 01:23:00,107
They're more aroused.

899
01:23:00,108 --> 01:23:03,108
Also' ifthere's no shearing'
we'll be spending a hard winter.

900
01:23:08,550 --> 01:23:11,550
We'll do whatthe majority decides.

901
01:23:20,128 --> 01:23:23,128
Because' what this is about here'
comrades'

902
01:23:23,565 --> 01:23:26,565
is making humanity
understand'

903
01:23:26,968 --> 01:23:29,968
that everything can be achieved
through reason and freedom.

904
01:23:33,308 --> 01:23:36,308
Anarchist ideas
are the only ones...

905
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:39,845
Shut up' big mouth!

906
01:23:40,348 --> 01:23:43,348
No' comrade. That's against
our principles offreedom.

907
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:48,854
To interrupt a speech
is to cut freedom.

908
01:23:49,958 --> 01:23:52,958
These big mouths talk and talk
but we have the troops on top of us.

909
01:23:55,764 --> 01:23:58,764
For they mustbe made to understand,
thatweapons are products...

910
01:24:01,536 --> 01:24:04,536
of stupidity
and irrationality.

911
01:24:05,407 --> 01:24:08,407
Alright' but cut it out' comrade.
We're wasting time.

912
01:24:10,578 --> 01:24:13,380
Everyone here knows thatZavala
is camped at Río Perro.

913
01:24:13,381 --> 01:24:15,015
Right here!

914
01:24:15,016 --> 01:24:17,951
So' we have to decide right now
whatwe're going to do.

915
01:24:17,952 --> 01:24:20,952
Like what are we going to do' comrade?
Resist! Resistwith the weapons!

916
01:24:23,858 --> 01:24:26,858
Or maybe you don't know that the murderer
Zavala has killed Ramón Outerello...

917
01:24:28,096 --> 01:24:30,864
and dozens of comrades
at Cañadón León?

918
01:24:30,865 --> 01:24:33,500
But where do you get that from?
What' did you see it yourself perhaps?

919
01:24:33,501 --> 01:24:36,501
I didn't see it. Butthe person
who told me deserves to be believed.

920
01:24:37,405 --> 01:24:40,374
Ah! You didn't see it'
you were told' then!

921
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:43,177
He wouldn't have seen them'
but we did see...

922
01:24:43,178 --> 01:24:46,178
how they attacked us without warning
and we lost nine comrades there.

923
01:24:47,515 --> 01:24:50,515
I think we mustn't
expect mercy'

924
01:24:51,619 --> 01:24:54,021
neither am I prepared to ask it.

925
01:24:54,022 --> 01:24:57,022
Comrade' you've limited me here
with my turn to speak.

926
01:24:58,259 --> 01:25:01,259
No' comrade' stop him.

927
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:04,262
Now it's up to us to talk
to the Chilean rural workers.

928
01:25:06,734 --> 01:25:09,269
We don't want any
kind of problems...

929
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:11,138
with the authorities.

930
01:25:11,139 --> 01:25:14,139
The only thing we do want is
to be allowed to work in peace.

931
01:25:14,742 --> 01:25:17,742
That we're treated properly
and paid as we deserve.

932
01:25:19,147 --> 01:25:21,315
That's why we think...

933
01:25:21,316 --> 01:25:24,316
thatwe ought to go and talk
with the military to lift this strike.

934
01:25:25,753 --> 01:25:28,753
Comrades. Comrades!

935
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:32,958
The only way to win
is to fight.

936
01:25:34,062 --> 01:25:37,062
Fightto the last man!

937
01:25:37,632 --> 01:25:40,632
Only one possibility is leftfor us'
to resist!

938
01:25:42,003 --> 01:25:44,872
To defend this estancia
with trenches...

939
01:25:44,873 --> 01:25:47,873
and turn back
those who attack us!

940
01:25:49,444 --> 01:25:52,379
I propose we carry on
with out tactics'

941
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:55,380
occupy ranches
and take hostages.

942
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:58,750
And when the army arrives'
disappear.

943
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:01,722
Hide ourselves in the woods'
in the mountain region'

944
01:26:01,723 --> 01:26:04,723
until they have to
come to terms with us.

945
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:07,826
Because withoutthe workers
the estancias can't function!

946
01:26:10,064 --> 01:26:13,064
No' comrade' if we split up
they'll go catching us one by one.

947
01:26:14,802 --> 01:26:17,802
We must resist
all together, here.

948
01:26:18,072 --> 01:26:20,874
But comrade'

949
01:26:20,875 --> 01:26:23,844
ifthe army can't
beat us with 100 armed men...

950
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:26,813
they'll send 200' or 1 '000.

951
01:26:26,814 --> 01:26:29,814
And us? What are we going to
fight againstZavala with? Ah?

952
01:26:30,118 --> 01:26:33,118
With our bare hands? No' we have to
agree terms' arrive at an arrangement.

953
01:26:35,790 --> 01:26:38,790
Is itthat perhaps we didn't do
it in the last strike?

954
01:26:40,528 --> 01:26:43,528
Comrades' we can't
throw out ofthe window...

955
01:26:45,066 --> 01:26:48,066
all the sacrifices
we've made.

956
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:51,770
You want us to talk
to the army? So be it!

957
01:26:56,844 --> 01:26:59,844
We'll electtwo comrades
to have an interview with Zavala...

958
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:03,048
and ask for conditions.

959
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:17,998
Excuse me' Lieutenant Colonel' sir,

960
01:27:17,999 --> 01:27:20,267
two strikers
askto be received.

961
01:27:20,268 --> 01:27:23,268
Show them in.

962
01:27:26,341 --> 01:27:29,341
Go in.

963
01:27:32,914 --> 01:27:35,914
Excuse us.
Apologies for interrupting your meal.

964
01:27:37,218 --> 01:27:38,585
What do you want?

965
01:27:38,586 --> 01:27:41,255
We represent
the Workers' Federation.

966
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:44,256
We've come to talk
as equals'

967
01:27:44,592 --> 01:27:47,592
about the conditions for an agreement.

968
01:27:47,795 --> 01:27:50,795
As equals.

969
01:27:51,299 --> 01:27:54,299
- What nationality are you?
- Spanish.

970
01:27:54,335 --> 01:27:57,335
- And the other?
- Polish.

971
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:01,840
And you two rebelling foreigners'
want to impose conditions on me?

972
01:28:02,577 --> 01:28:04,811
But' conditions forwhat?
Sons of bitches!

973
01:28:04,812 --> 01:28:07,812
Conditions for what?

974
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:15,020
Sergeant!

975
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:18,790
Come out. Come on' come on!

976
01:28:18,993 --> 01:28:21,928
Captain'

977
01:28:21,929 --> 01:28:24,929
go up to the column.
A sargeant and a white flag.

978
01:28:25,566 --> 01:28:27,734
Go and askthem for
unconditional surrender.

979
01:28:27,735 --> 01:28:30,735
Yes' sir' Lieutenant Colonel.

980
01:28:39,414 --> 01:28:42,414
You've all seen
how insolently they behave.

981
01:28:42,684 --> 01:28:45,684
I'm not going to letthem
raise their heads.

982
01:28:46,254 --> 01:28:49,254
Especially Soto.

983
01:28:49,390 --> 01:28:52,390
ThatAntonio Soto'
who's filled them with those ideas.

984
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:58,330
And we'll have done
with all this for good and all.

985
01:28:59,901 --> 01:29:02,901
Ready. Aim.

986
01:29:03,538 --> 01:29:06,538
Brothers' throw down those guns'
embrace the cause...

987
01:29:07,575 --> 01:29:10,575
- ... ofthe libertarian ideal.
- Fire!

988
01:29:37,238 --> 01:29:39,840
Aren't you the leaders
of the Workers' Federation?

989
01:29:39,841 --> 01:29:41,575
Yes' sir.

990
01:29:41,576 --> 01:29:44,576
Orderfrom Lieutenant Colonel Zavala.
Unconditional surrender.

991
01:29:46,047 --> 01:29:49,047
Hand over of hostages'
horses and weapons.

992
01:29:49,717 --> 01:29:52,717
Otherwise we shall not
hesitate to proceed.

993
01:29:56,624 --> 01:29:59,624
Didn't Lieutenant Colonel Zavala
receive our delegation?

994
01:30:00,061 --> 01:30:02,696
No delegation
will be received.

995
01:30:02,697 --> 01:30:05,532
That is the last offer.

996
01:30:05,533 --> 01:30:08,533
We won't decide
without consulting the Assembly.

997
01:30:10,138 --> 01:30:13,138
As you like.
You have 2 hours.

998
01:30:16,844 --> 01:30:19,844
Don't accept. They'll shoot you all'
not a single one will be left alive.

999
01:30:23,818 --> 01:30:26,818
Comrades' don't trust
Zavala' don't surrender.

1000
01:30:30,691 --> 01:30:33,691
You're laborers' you're workers!

1001
01:30:34,529 --> 01:30:37,529
Comrades' carry on with the strike!

1002
01:30:39,467 --> 01:30:42,467
To triumph definitively so as to
form a new society...

1003
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:50,442
where there are no poor or rich'
where there are no weapons'

1004
01:30:55,283 --> 01:30:58,283
where there is happiness and respect
for human beings!

1005
01:31:07,161 --> 01:31:10,161
Let's get going.

1006
01:31:15,336 --> 01:31:18,336
...tire ourselves out like beasts.

1007
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:21,374
We must make
the trenches now.

1008
01:31:21,375 --> 01:31:23,109
Let's return to the camp.

1009
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:25,612
And I'm saying it plainly and clearly
so there's no doubt left:

1010
01:31:25,613 --> 01:31:28,613
The only way to win
is with weapons!

1011
01:31:29,817 --> 01:31:32,817
Comrades' I move that we
surrender ourselves unconditionally.

1012
01:32:00,715 --> 01:32:03,715
I didn't expectthis end.

1013
01:32:04,919 --> 01:32:07,919
I didn't expect it.

1014
01:32:11,058 --> 01:32:14,058
Come on' German'

1015
01:32:14,629 --> 01:32:17,264
there's nothing leftto do here.

1016
01:32:17,265 --> 01:32:20,265
NoAntonio' I'm staying.

1017
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:23,535
I respect the decision
ofthe majority.

1018
01:32:23,871 --> 01:32:26,871
But it's suicide!

1019
01:32:27,141 --> 01:32:29,543
They'll shoot you first!

1020
01:32:29,544 --> 01:32:32,312
I've always complied with
the decision of my comrades'

1021
01:32:32,313 --> 01:32:35,313
even ifthey were mistaken.

1022
01:32:36,317 --> 01:32:38,919
Today they've chosen death.

1023
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:41,555
I too respect it'

1024
01:32:41,556 --> 01:32:44,556
but I'm not meat
to be thrown to the dogs.

1025
01:32:46,027 --> 01:32:49,027
If it's to fight' I'll stay'

1026
01:32:49,397 --> 01:32:52,397
butthe comrades
don'twantto fight.

1027
01:32:53,601 --> 01:32:56,269
I do.

1028
01:32:56,270 --> 01:32:59,270
I'll carry on fighting.

1029
01:33:27,034 --> 01:33:30,034
Come on' German'

1030
01:33:30,037 --> 01:33:33,037
very near here is that paradise
you were seeking so much.

1031
01:34:56,157 --> 01:34:59,157
Where'sAntonio Soto?

1032
01:35:14,709 --> 01:35:17,709
Where'sAntonio Soto?
Damn it!

1033
01:35:23,384 --> 01:35:26,384
Draw out your gun.

1034
01:35:41,202 --> 01:35:44,202
Where'sAntonio Soto?

1035
01:35:49,009 --> 01:35:52,009
Where'sAntonio Soto?

1036
01:36:04,592 --> 01:36:07,592
Where'sAntonio Soto?

1037
01:36:21,842 --> 01:36:24,842
Where'sAntonio Soto?

1038
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:29,680
Stop' you bastards'

1039
01:36:30,985 --> 01:36:33,985
it's me' Soto!

1040
01:36:40,928 --> 01:36:43,830
Lieutenant Colonel' sir'

1041
01:36:43,831 --> 01:36:46,831
that's the Chilean
who proposed the surrender.

1042
01:36:50,704 --> 01:36:53,704
Good.

1043
01:37:27,308 --> 01:37:30,308
This is the German' Shultz.

1044
01:37:30,711 --> 01:37:33,711
So you're
the great revolutionary.

1045
01:37:36,584 --> 01:37:39,584
Put him to one side.

1046
01:37:54,368 --> 01:37:57,368
Let's see' the ranch delegates'
on step forward!

1047
01:38:02,676 --> 01:38:05,676
One step forward
the ranch delegates!

1048
01:38:11,752 --> 01:38:14,752
It seems there are no delegates' eh?

1049
01:38:16,056 --> 01:38:19,056
Did they all die?

1050
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:23,160
It's OK' they'll appear soon enough.

1051
01:38:26,734 --> 01:38:29,734
Find out about Soto.

1052
01:38:55,996 --> 01:38:58,996
Lieutenant Colonel' sir, maybe notthat one.
He's the only mechanic in the area'

1053
01:39:00,834 --> 01:39:03,834
we might need him.

1054
01:39:03,938 --> 01:39:06,938
Leave him.

1055
01:39:28,562 --> 01:39:31,562
So you've got new clothes.

1056
01:39:32,766 --> 01:39:35,766
Can you tell me
where you gotthem?

1057
01:39:36,403 --> 01:39:39,403
Captain' undress them
and tie them to the fence.

1058
01:39:40,341 --> 01:39:43,341
Letthem spend the night naked!

1059
01:39:47,448 --> 01:39:49,649
I now have the report'
Lleutenant colonel, slr.

1060
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:52,251
Soto and three others are
fleelng by horse to chlle.

1061
01:39:52,252 --> 01:39:55,154
Send outLleutenantArrleta
wlth ten men,

1062
01:39:55,155 --> 01:39:58,155
and bring him back alive or dead.

1063
01:40:18,078 --> 01:40:21,078
- What's your name?
- Esperidión González' sir.

1064
01:40:21,281 --> 01:40:24,281
Now you go straight
to your boss's place...

1065
01:40:24,284 --> 01:40:27,186
And from now on'
if he orders you to be a dog'

1066
01:40:27,187 --> 01:40:30,187
you get down on all fours
and you bark.

1067
01:40:31,759 --> 01:40:34,759
- Is that understood?
- Alright' sir.

1068
01:40:43,203 --> 01:40:46,203
And whoever lets the candle go out
I'll blow the lid off his brains!

1069
01:40:47,641 --> 01:40:50,641
OK?

1070
01:41:35,389 --> 01:41:36,889
Yes?

1071
01:41:36,890 --> 01:41:39,890
Aren't you sleeping' Lt. Col. sir?

1072
01:41:44,364 --> 01:41:46,866
The condemned are already
in the shearing shed.

1073
01:41:46,867 --> 01:41:49,867
Each with a candle
to make it easier to guard them.

1074
01:41:50,104 --> 01:41:53,005
Very good.

1075
01:41:53,006 --> 01:41:55,708
For tomorrow'

1076
01:41:55,709 --> 01:41:57,443
Does the order stands or...?

1077
01:41:57,444 --> 01:42:00,146
Yes' Captain' yes!
The order stands!

1078
01:42:00,147 --> 01:42:03,147
Or do you want me to let
them all go free?

1079
01:42:11,725 --> 01:42:14,725
It's not about
pardoning or punishing here'

1080
01:42:15,963 --> 01:42:18,963
it's about putting an end
to these rebels.

1081
01:42:19,533 --> 01:42:22,533
You prefer to kill a hundred leaders
rather than some day...

1082
01:42:22,603 --> 01:42:25,603
a thousand innocents dying.

1083
01:42:30,677 --> 01:42:33,677
They may say I was
a bloodthirsty military'

1084
01:42:35,015 --> 01:42:38,015
butthey'll never say
I was a disobedient one.

1085
01:42:49,062 --> 01:42:52,062
- Not in the European war...
- Come on.

1086
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:53,259
Ready.

1087
01:43:53,260 --> 01:43:56,195
Aim.

1088
01:43:56,196 --> 01:43:59,196
Fire!

1089
01:44:05,839 --> 01:44:07,773
Aim.

1090
01:44:07,774 --> 01:44:09,342
Fire!

1091
01:44:09,343 --> 01:44:11,143
Aim.

1092
01:44:11,144 --> 01:44:12,945
Fire!

1093
01:44:12,946 --> 01:44:14,847
Aim.

1094
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:17,848
Fire!

1095
01:44:18,652 --> 01:44:21,652
Laborers, reduced from 120
to 80 pesos a month.

1096
01:44:22,723 --> 01:44:25,723
Wagon drlvers, from 130 to 90 pesos

1097
01:44:26,059 --> 01:44:29,059
Sheep hands, from 140 to 100 pesos.

1098
01:44:29,196 --> 01:44:32,196
Ranch cooks'
from 160 to 120 pesos.

1099
01:44:33,133 --> 01:44:36,133
Herders' per day'
from 25 to 12 pesos.

1100
01:44:37,304 --> 01:44:40,304
These wages replace
those from the previous agreement...

1101
01:44:41,908 --> 01:44:44,908
which is
definitively annulled.

1102
01:44:55,155 --> 01:44:58,155
The memory of your action
in Patagonia...

1103
01:44:59,026 --> 01:45:01,994
will remain in the memory
of its inhabitants'

1104
01:45:01,995 --> 01:45:04,995
as a lesson on what inspired
men are capable of...

1105
01:45:06,066 --> 01:45:09,066
in the fulfillment of their duty
and in the greatness ofthe nation.

1106
01:45:10,537 --> 01:45:13,537
Very good!

1107
01:45:15,742 --> 01:45:18,244
