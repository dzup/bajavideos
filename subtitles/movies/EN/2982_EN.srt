1
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,267
As a girl,
you see the world

2
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:13,495
like a giant candy store...

3
00:01:13,604 --> 00:01:13,904
filled with sweet candy
and such.

4
00:01:13,904 --> 00:01:16,498
filled with sweet candy
and such.

5
00:01:19,276 --> 00:01:21,938
But one day you look around
and see a prison...

6
00:01:22,046 --> 00:01:24,014
and you're on death row.

7
00:01:26,951 --> 00:01:28,714
You want to run...

8
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:30,844
or scream...

9
00:01:30,955 --> 00:01:33,287
or cry.

10
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,517
But something's
locking you up.

11
00:01:41,298 --> 00:01:43,266
Are the other folks
cows chewing cud

12
00:01:43,367 --> 00:01:46,268
till the hour come
when their heads roll?

13
00:01:51,141 --> 00:01:53,974
Or are they just
keeping quiet like you?

14
00:01:58,415 --> 00:02:00,542
Planning their escape.

15
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:09,926
On your left, honey.

16
00:02:10,027 --> 00:02:11,585
What's that cashier's name?

17
00:02:11,695 --> 00:02:13,094
Can't say.

18
00:02:13,197 --> 00:02:15,222
When did he start
working here?

19
00:02:15,332 --> 00:02:17,596
Don't know. Yesterday.

20
00:02:19,737 --> 00:02:20,669
Who is he?

21
00:02:20,771 --> 00:02:23,035
Don't know. Can't say.

22
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,801
What are you doing?

23
00:02:24,908 --> 00:02:26,603
It's called work,
princess.

24
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,075
Kind of fun.

25
00:02:28,178 --> 00:02:30,442
You might want to
give it a go some day.

26
00:02:30,547 --> 00:02:32,481
Attention, shoppers.

27
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:36,280
There's a Retail Rodeo special
on aisle 3.

28
00:02:36,387 --> 00:02:39,788
Liquid Drain Cleaner,
2 12-ounce cans for $5.00.

29
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,120
Liquid Drain Cleaner
has churning power...

30
00:02:42,226 --> 00:02:45,457
and it will churn
right through your pipes.

31
00:02:45,562 --> 00:02:47,621
Ladies,
you need female plumbing.

32
00:02:47,731 --> 00:02:50,495
Shove something clean and new
up your filthy pipes.

33
00:02:50,601 --> 00:02:53,468
That's Liquid Drain Cleaner
on aisle 3.

34
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:54,969
Have a good day...

35
00:02:55,072 --> 00:02:57,802
and thank you for shopping
at Retail Rodeo.

36
00:03:01,445 --> 00:03:02,912
Hey, Justine.

37
00:03:03,013 --> 00:03:04,605
Can I talk to you
for a second?

38
00:03:04,715 --> 00:03:05,613
Yeah.

39
00:03:05,716 --> 00:03:07,445
I was just curious, uh...

40
00:03:07,551 --> 00:03:09,451
have you ever been
to a Bible study?

41
00:03:09,553 --> 00:03:10,952
Yeah.

42
00:03:11,055 --> 00:03:12,317
Yeah, well, we got
a good one going on

43
00:03:12,456 --> 00:03:13,423
every Wednesday

44
00:03:13,524 --> 00:03:14,889
at the First Church
of Nazarene.

45
00:03:14,992 --> 00:03:17,085
Rodney comes,
Bonita comes.

46
00:03:17,194 --> 00:03:20,493
You got any interest
in reading the Bible?

47
00:03:20,597 --> 00:03:23,862
I have my own,
you know, beliefs.

48
00:03:23,967 --> 00:03:25,901
Well, we don't preach
fire and brimstone.

49
00:03:26,003 --> 00:03:27,732
10 Commandments...
gotta live by those.

50
00:03:27,838 --> 00:03:29,567
Other than
the usual ways...

51
00:03:29,673 --> 00:03:31,300
we're not interested
in scaring people.

52
00:03:31,408 --> 00:03:32,898
We're about loving Jesus.

53
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,979
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I kind of like
my nights to myself.

54
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,980
Well, maybe you'll have
night after night

55
00:03:38,082 --> 00:03:39,879
of eternal hellfire
all to yourself.

56
00:03:39,983 --> 00:03:42,144
Just kidding you.
Drive safe.

57
00:03:43,287 --> 00:03:44,845
Bye-bye.

58
00:04:12,182 --> 00:04:13,911
Hey, Justine.

59
00:04:14,017 --> 00:04:16,577
Hey, Teeny.
How was your day?

60
00:04:16,687 --> 00:04:20,123
The same. How was yours?

61
00:04:20,224 --> 00:04:23,125
Wind was flipping up paint
in our eyes.

62
00:04:24,528 --> 00:04:26,553
Paint stings.

63
00:04:26,663 --> 00:04:27,789
Feel like
I've been attacked

64
00:04:27,898 --> 00:04:30,389
by hornets
in my eyeballs.

65
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,428
Bubba, stand up.

66
00:04:34,538 --> 00:04:35,505
Why?

67
00:04:38,142 --> 00:04:40,872
Oh, for Christ sakes.

68
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:43,071
Look at that couch, Phil.

69
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,114
Y'all got paint all over it.

70
00:04:45,215 --> 00:04:47,911
This ain't gonna come off.

71
00:04:48,018 --> 00:04:50,282
I bet the... Damn it, Phil.

72
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,555
Including this gorgeous
eggplant shape...

73
00:05:01,231 --> 00:05:03,597
I think we got
most of it up.

74
00:05:05,068 --> 00:05:06,899
You two were stoned.

75
00:05:07,004 --> 00:05:08,164
Keep frying
your brain like that...

76
00:05:08,272 --> 00:05:09,239
you're gonna
slip off a ladder

77
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:11,330
and crack open
your head bone.

78
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:13,636
You do really stupid things
when you're high, Phil.

79
00:05:13,744 --> 00:05:15,837
Like what?

80
00:05:15,946 --> 00:05:18,938
Like sitting on my couch
with your big blue ass.

81
00:05:21,018 --> 00:05:22,576
Everything
just turns to shit.

82
00:05:22,686 --> 00:05:24,085
We're finally getting
nice things...

83
00:05:24,188 --> 00:05:26,554
and then everything
just gets messed up.

84
00:05:26,657 --> 00:05:28,249
Why is this TV buzzing?

85
00:05:28,358 --> 00:05:30,383
Oh, it's the wind
doing that.

86
00:05:32,863 --> 00:05:34,091
They say
the wind's coming in

87
00:05:34,198 --> 00:05:35,859
different lately.

88
00:05:35,966 --> 00:05:37,797
Different from what?

89
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,130
What you reading?

90
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:12,667
Catcher in the Rye.

91
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:15,294
I'm named after it.

92
00:06:15,405 --> 00:06:17,066
What's your name,
Catcher?

93
00:06:17,174 --> 00:06:18,664
Holden.

94
00:06:18,775 --> 00:06:20,208
After Holden Caulfield.

95
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,744
He's the main character.

96
00:06:22,846 --> 00:06:24,336
What's he do?

97
00:06:24,448 --> 00:06:27,747
He's put upon by society...

98
00:06:27,851 --> 00:06:30,046
the hypocrisy of the world.

99
00:06:32,122 --> 00:06:35,649
I notice that you're,
uh, not very social.

100
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,319
I'm a writer, so...

101
00:06:38,428 --> 00:06:39,326
What do you write?

102
00:06:39,429 --> 00:06:42,296
Novels, plays,
screenplays...

103
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:44,833
stories, poetry.

104
00:06:46,737 --> 00:06:47,761
That's good.

105
00:06:47,871 --> 00:06:49,600
Now Justine will be
right over with you.

106
00:06:49,706 --> 00:06:50,730
Where is she?

107
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:52,672
Oh, I better go.

108
00:06:57,547 --> 00:07:01,039
W-What happens
at the end of your book?

109
00:07:01,151 --> 00:07:02,379
Oh, he has
a nervous breakdown...

110
00:07:02,486 --> 00:07:05,080
goes to
a mental hospital.

111
00:07:08,158 --> 00:07:09,853
Hmm.

112
00:07:11,395 --> 00:07:13,488
You don't get paid
to pick your crack.

113
00:07:13,597 --> 00:07:15,189
You get paid to work.

114
00:07:15,299 --> 00:07:18,393
I'm not sure
I can do makeovers.

115
00:07:18,502 --> 00:07:20,595
Oh, come on. A little
pancake, eyeliner...

116
00:07:20,704 --> 00:07:22,171
mascara,
rouge on the cheeks...

117
00:07:22,272 --> 00:07:23,603
and powder it up.

118
00:07:23,707 --> 00:07:25,231
And then you take
a moist tissue...

119
00:07:25,342 --> 00:07:26,274
roll it in a ball...

120
00:07:26,376 --> 00:07:28,435
and toss it
in their face.

121
00:07:31,248 --> 00:07:33,614
Geez Louise, I'm talking
to a tree stump, girl.

122
00:07:33,717 --> 00:07:34,809
Where are you?

123
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:36,852
Sorry. I'm just
a little tired.

124
00:07:36,953 --> 00:07:37,977
I'm telling you...

125
00:07:38,088 --> 00:07:39,749
it's the food you eat,
Justine.

126
00:07:39,856 --> 00:07:41,881
Look at me... I am
10 years older than you...

127
00:07:41,992 --> 00:07:44,290
and I've got
10 times your energy.

128
00:07:44,394 --> 00:07:47,886
'Cause I don't eat meat,
and I don't eat dairy.

129
00:07:47,998 --> 00:07:50,398
It's probably why you can't
get pregnant, honey.

130
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,728
Why you walk around

131
00:07:51,835 --> 00:07:53,268
with that hung-jaw look
on your face.

132
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,235
It's the cheese
in your pizza

133
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:56,772
and the chicken
in your salad.

134
00:07:56,873 --> 00:07:59,467
I've been to the doctor.
He says I'm fertile.

135
00:07:59,576 --> 00:08:01,669
Says I could repopulate
the entire planet.

136
00:08:01,778 --> 00:08:03,143
Then what's the deal here?

137
00:08:03,246 --> 00:08:05,544
Did he say you're
getting enough vitamins?

138
00:08:07,684 --> 00:08:09,242
He didn't say.

139
00:08:17,294 --> 00:08:19,228
Or you can make
a kind of paint

140
00:08:19,329 --> 00:08:21,297
where,
at different angles...

141
00:08:21,398 --> 00:08:23,628
the house
is different colors.

142
00:08:25,268 --> 00:08:28,203
Like, you stand
at the front door...

143
00:08:29,306 --> 00:08:32,002
and the house is red.

144
00:08:32,109 --> 00:08:33,667
But you stand
at the street...

145
00:08:33,777 --> 00:08:35,642
the house is green.

146
00:08:35,746 --> 00:08:39,910
Or you could make, like,
an invisible paint.

147
00:08:40,016 --> 00:08:42,075
Just make
the whole house disappear.

148
00:08:42,185 --> 00:08:45,313
Or what would be really neat
is a paint that could

149
00:08:45,422 --> 00:08:48,220
change the molecular structure
of a house...

150
00:08:48,325 --> 00:08:51,351
like a chemical acid deal.

151
00:08:51,461 --> 00:08:53,395
What do you think, Teeny?

152
00:08:53,497 --> 00:08:56,989
I think you two are
a pair of potheads.

153
00:09:00,904 --> 00:09:03,065
OK, you getting a whole one
of these or a half?

154
00:09:03,173 --> 00:09:04,606
I'm getting that
right there.

155
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:05,732
OK, wonderful.

156
00:09:05,842 --> 00:09:07,002
You didn't bring this
into the store with you?

157
00:09:07,144 --> 00:09:08,111
No.

158
00:09:08,211 --> 00:09:09,701
Then I'll go ahead
and charge you for it.

159
00:09:09,813 --> 00:09:10,939
This is a hand lotion...

160
00:09:11,047 --> 00:09:12,776
so don't put it on any
other part of your body...

161
00:09:12,883 --> 00:09:14,874
even if that part
needs lubrication.

162
00:09:14,985 --> 00:09:17,613
We try to keep frivolous
lawsuits to a minimum...

163
00:09:17,721 --> 00:09:19,416
unless, of course,
the customer is at fault.

164
00:09:19,523 --> 00:09:20,990
Do you
always wear makeup?

165
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:23,855
Oh, not very often.

166
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,554
Here's your change,
and fuck you very much.

167
00:09:26,663 --> 00:09:28,028
Excuse me?

168
00:09:28,131 --> 00:09:30,326
Thank you very much.

169
00:09:30,434 --> 00:09:33,562
Good as new, I tell you.
Good as new.

170
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,002
Now, you might be
interested in purchasing

171
00:09:36,106 --> 00:09:38,131
some of the products
that I used today...

172
00:09:38,241 --> 00:09:41,074
Oh, I'm not buying
anything today.

173
00:09:41,178 --> 00:09:42,668
That'd be a mistake.

174
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:44,713
These are bargain prices.

175
00:09:44,815 --> 00:09:47,613
I didn't bring my purse.

176
00:09:50,854 --> 00:09:52,947
I hate my job.

177
00:09:53,056 --> 00:09:55,047
That makes two of us.

178
00:09:55,158 --> 00:09:56,682
I hate everybody here.

179
00:09:58,161 --> 00:09:59,458
I hate Gwen.

180
00:09:59,563 --> 00:10:02,191
I don't know what the hell
she's so happy about.

181
00:10:04,835 --> 00:10:06,530
I'm starting to understand
why maniacs go out there

182
00:10:06,636 --> 00:10:08,467
and get shotguns and
shoot everybody to pieces.

183
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,370
Maybe you're a maniac.

184
00:10:13,777 --> 00:10:15,142
Maybe so.

185
00:10:25,222 --> 00:10:28,282
You know your lips
are real pouty, like a woman?

186
00:10:28,391 --> 00:10:30,621
And your eyes
always look sad...

187
00:10:30,727 --> 00:10:32,820
the way they droop
off to the side.

188
00:10:32,929 --> 00:10:34,294
How old are you?

189
00:10:34,397 --> 00:10:36,957
Uh, 22.

190
00:10:37,067 --> 00:10:39,695
I'm an old lady next to you.

191
00:10:39,803 --> 00:10:41,703
How old are you?

192
00:10:41,805 --> 00:10:44,672
How old do you think?

193
00:10:44,774 --> 00:10:47,641
I don't know.

194
00:10:49,846 --> 00:10:53,111
I'm 30 years old.

195
00:10:55,585 --> 00:10:57,985
How long you been
working here for?

196
00:10:58,088 --> 00:11:00,522
Forever and a day.

197
00:11:07,464 --> 00:11:09,091
You don't have a car?

198
00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:11,190
I live down the street.

199
00:11:11,301 --> 00:11:13,895
You can ride in here.
There's room.

200
00:11:17,374 --> 00:11:19,205
Do you wanna come in?

201
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:22,301
I don't know.
I'm in a funk.

202
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,215
Well, I'm not
gonna beg you.

203
00:11:25,215 --> 00:11:26,842
Well, I'm not
gonna beg you.

204
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:29,919
You got to
go there in your head...

205
00:11:31,922 --> 00:11:34,857
And I did, and things
changed for me.

206
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,619
I'll be in my room.

207
00:11:36,726 --> 00:11:38,523
OK, Tom.

208
00:11:40,964 --> 00:11:42,795
I can look
over my shoulder...

209
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:44,958
figuratively speaking.

210
00:11:45,068 --> 00:11:47,229
They call you Tom?

211
00:11:47,337 --> 00:11:50,602
It's my slave name.

212
00:11:50,707 --> 00:11:53,540
Holden's what I call myself.

213
00:11:56,246 --> 00:11:58,009
This is my room.

214
00:11:59,115 --> 00:12:01,276
Not a lot to look at.

215
00:12:02,319 --> 00:12:04,879
What are your folks like?

216
00:12:09,826 --> 00:12:12,090
They don't get me.

217
00:12:12,195 --> 00:12:14,789
But they're all right.
They just...

218
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:18,231
My husband doesn't get me.

219
00:12:19,336 --> 00:12:21,429
Since when do you
have a husband?

220
00:12:21,538 --> 00:12:23,267
Since 7 years.

221
00:12:23,373 --> 00:12:25,500
He's a painter.

222
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:29,803
What's he paint?

223
00:12:29,913 --> 00:12:31,608
Houses.

224
00:12:35,285 --> 00:12:39,847
He's a pig. He talks,
but he doesn't think.

225
00:12:39,956 --> 00:12:41,821
I'm sick of it.

226
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,194
Did you go to college?

227
00:12:46,296 --> 00:12:49,197
Um, I had to drop out

228
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:51,494
'cause I had a problem
with drinking and stuff...

229
00:12:51,601 --> 00:12:53,728
but I'll go back.
I just got to...

230
00:12:53,837 --> 00:12:56,829
prove to my folks
I can fly straight.

231
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,374
Did you go to college?

232
00:12:59,476 --> 00:13:03,310
I was afraid
I'd lose Phil if I went.

233
00:13:03,413 --> 00:13:06,280
Now it'd be
reason enough to go.

234
00:13:12,555 --> 00:13:14,420
I was looking at you
in the store...

235
00:13:14,524 --> 00:13:16,958
and I liked how
you kept to yourself.

236
00:13:19,663 --> 00:13:22,791
I saw in your eyes
that you hate the world.

237
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,095
I hate it, too.

238
00:13:29,472 --> 00:13:31,963
You know what
I'm talking about?

239
00:13:49,926 --> 00:13:52,554
After living
in the dark for so long...

240
00:13:52,662 --> 00:13:55,256
a glimpse of the light
can make you giddy.

241
00:13:57,534 --> 00:13:59,525
Strange thoughts
come into your head...

242
00:13:59,636 --> 00:14:01,968
and you better think 'em.

243
00:14:05,108 --> 00:14:07,872
Has a special fate
been calling you

244
00:14:07,977 --> 00:14:09,444
and you not listening?

245
00:14:10,747 --> 00:14:14,205
Is there a secret message
right in front of you...

246
00:14:14,317 --> 00:14:16,182
and you're not reading it?

247
00:14:18,822 --> 00:14:21,814
Is this your last,
best chance?

248
00:14:25,261 --> 00:14:27,354
Are you gonna take it?

249
00:14:31,134 --> 00:14:33,193
Or are you
going to the grave

250
00:14:33,303 --> 00:14:35,737
with unlived lives
in your veins?

251
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:41,299
Notifying your wife,
for instance.

252
00:14:41,411 --> 00:14:42,537
What did I say?

253
00:14:42,645 --> 00:14:43,737
If you had a wife.

254
00:14:43,847 --> 00:14:46,145
What did I talk about?

255
00:14:46,249 --> 00:14:48,274
I talked to Margaret.

256
00:14:48,384 --> 00:14:51,717
She, uh, filled out a red dress.

257
00:14:51,821 --> 00:14:53,482
What else?

258
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,852
Teeny, you're pretty.

259
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:58,519
Bubba, isn't Teeny pretty?

260
00:14:58,628 --> 00:15:00,858
I seen better.
I seen worse.

261
00:15:01,965 --> 00:15:05,560
No, that's why
I ain't never married.

262
00:15:05,668 --> 00:15:09,104
You got yourself
the best fish in the sea.

263
00:15:10,907 --> 00:15:13,501
I wonder what it'd
be like to be a woman.

264
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:18,013
All that smooth skin...

265
00:15:18,114 --> 00:15:20,241
long hair.

266
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:23,911
If I was a woman,
I'd be a slut.

267
00:15:25,021 --> 00:15:28,457
A lesbian slut.

268
00:15:29,726 --> 00:15:33,492
Gwen says smoking marijuana
lowers your sperm.

269
00:15:35,965 --> 00:15:38,058
Lowers it to where?

270
00:15:40,703 --> 00:15:42,933
Maybe you're the infertile one
around here.

271
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:45,735
Maybe every time you smoke
a little doobie...

272
00:15:45,842 --> 00:15:48,242
you're killing
our unborn children.

273
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,820
OK, close.

274
00:16:05,929 --> 00:16:08,420
Why are you limpin'?

275
00:16:08,531 --> 00:16:14,231
l... I twisted up my ankle
on the stairs.

276
00:16:14,337 --> 00:16:15,565
Mm-hmm.

277
00:16:15,672 --> 00:16:20,109
I was wondering maybe
you could give me a ride home.

278
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:23,202
Yeah, sure, OK.

279
00:16:25,014 --> 00:16:27,073
All right, I'll talk to you
about it later.

280
00:16:27,183 --> 00:16:28,309
Mm-hmm.

281
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:32,717
All I know is, every woman
should have one beau

282
00:16:32,822 --> 00:16:35,188
before any woman has 2 beaus.

283
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:38,624
He's not my beau.
He's my friend.

284
00:16:38,728 --> 00:16:41,993
Happy Halloween,
Retail Rodeo shoppers.

285
00:16:42,098 --> 00:16:47,001
There's a Retail Rodeo special
on all bulk candy on aisle 4.

286
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:51,062
Ghouls and goblins,
witches and warlocks...

287
00:16:51,174 --> 00:16:53,665
wandering these aisles
day after day...

288
00:16:53,776 --> 00:16:57,212
I put a Halloween curse
on your hellish heads.

289
00:16:57,313 --> 00:16:58,575
Good night, Corny.

290
00:16:58,681 --> 00:16:59,579
Good night.

291
00:16:59,682 --> 00:17:00,706
Happy Halloween.

292
00:17:00,817 --> 00:17:03,047
Oh, I'm not a pagan,
but thanks all the same.

293
00:17:04,587 --> 00:17:08,284
Which ankle
did you twist, Holden?

294
00:17:08,391 --> 00:17:09,722
My left.

295
00:17:09,826 --> 00:17:11,225
Hmm. Maybe you should

296
00:17:11,327 --> 00:17:13,318
put some cold water on it

297
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:15,522
so it doesn't
swell up and inflame.

298
00:17:15,632 --> 00:17:17,759
OK.

299
00:17:21,738 --> 00:17:25,765
You're a writer, so you have
yourself a goal, I guess.

300
00:17:27,777 --> 00:17:30,177
I used to, you know...

301
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:34,614
lie in bed
and imagine other cities...

302
00:17:34,717 --> 00:17:37,584
other jobs I could have...

303
00:17:37,687 --> 00:17:39,655
other husbands.

304
00:17:40,924 --> 00:17:44,519
Now I don't even know
what to imagine anymore.

305
00:18:07,317 --> 00:18:10,252
Holden, I have a husband.

306
00:18:10,353 --> 00:18:13,584
Thought you said he was a pig.

307
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,488
Well... Holden...

308
00:18:17,593 --> 00:18:20,187
I don't want
to hurt anybody.

309
00:18:35,511 --> 00:18:38,173
So I been thinking
about what you're saying

310
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:40,374
about my sperm being low.

311
00:18:41,484 --> 00:18:44,885
I mean, I know
I got good sperm.

312
00:18:44,988 --> 00:18:47,684
It's baby-making sperm,
but...

313
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:51,021
suppose it couldn't hurt

314
00:18:51,127 --> 00:18:53,755
to have it confirmed
by an expert.

315
00:18:53,863 --> 00:18:55,592
Oh, who gives a shit?

316
00:18:55,698 --> 00:18:57,222
Who needs
a fucking baby, anyway?

317
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,994
You wanna make yourself
useful around here?

318
00:18:59,102 --> 00:19:01,229
Why don't you get
that goddamn TV fixed?

319
00:19:02,805 --> 00:19:04,136
What the hell?

320
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,209
It sounds like a helicopter
is landing in here.

321
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,181
You want a blackberry,
honey?

322
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:25,226
Man was selling 'em
on the road.

323
00:19:25,328 --> 00:19:26,727
No, thank you.

324
00:19:26,829 --> 00:19:29,093
They're real sweet.

325
00:19:29,198 --> 00:19:33,157
This is for you.
It's from Holden.

326
00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:35,066
Where is he?

327
00:19:35,171 --> 00:19:36,570
He's got the day off.

328
00:19:36,672 --> 00:19:38,572
He came by
this morning with it.

329
00:19:38,674 --> 00:19:39,766
Thanks.

330
00:19:39,876 --> 00:19:41,605
Don't mention it.
Hey, Gwen.

331
00:19:41,711 --> 00:19:42,609
Hi, sugar.

332
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,120
DearJustine...

333
00:20:00,229 --> 00:20:03,824
because of you,
I'll be quitting the Retail Rodeo.

334
00:20:05,568 --> 00:20:09,698
The last 2 days have been
the most god-awful of my life.

335
00:20:09,806 --> 00:20:12,434
I've not been able to get
rid of you in my head.

336
00:20:14,143 --> 00:20:16,634
I've never wanted
anything so bad...

337
00:20:16,746 --> 00:20:19,237
and I have wanted
many things.

338
00:20:19,348 --> 00:20:23,341
I'd given up long ago
on being gotten by someone else...

339
00:20:23,453 --> 00:20:25,853
and then you came along.

340
00:20:25,955 --> 00:20:29,152
The idea that I could be gotten
because of circumstance

341
00:20:29,258 --> 00:20:31,886
or never get got is the worst
feeling I've ever felt...

342
00:20:31,994 --> 00:20:34,462
and I have felt
many bad feelings.

343
00:20:34,564 --> 00:20:38,796
I'm sorry I can never
see you again, Justine.

344
00:20:38,901 --> 00:20:42,962
Forgive me for being so weak,
but that is who I am.

345
00:20:43,072 --> 00:20:45,097
Good-bye...

346
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:46,732
Holden Worther.

347
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,314
lf, for some reason...

348
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:57,512
you could change your mind
and want to be with me...

349
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:01,056
body and soul,
meet me after work.

350
00:21:01,157 --> 00:21:03,887
I will be waiting
for you at 5 p.m.

351
00:21:03,993 --> 00:21:05,722
outside Chuck E. Cheese.

352
00:21:05,828 --> 00:21:08,160
If you are not there
at 5:00...

353
00:21:08,264 --> 00:21:11,097
you will never see me again
in your lifetime.

354
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,737
Gwen.

355
00:21:16,906 --> 00:21:18,032
Hmm.

356
00:21:18,141 --> 00:21:19,165
What's wrong?

357
00:21:19,275 --> 00:21:20,640
I'm OK.

358
00:21:20,743 --> 00:21:24,440
I feel a little sick.

359
00:21:31,888 --> 00:21:33,583
Let's go. There he goes.

360
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,754
What happened?

361
00:21:42,865 --> 00:21:44,492
There he goes.

362
00:21:55,611 --> 00:21:56,771
Gwen?

363
00:21:56,879 --> 00:21:58,176
Gwen?

364
00:22:04,253 --> 00:22:05,652
Justine?

365
00:22:05,755 --> 00:22:06,915
You're OK.

366
00:22:07,023 --> 00:22:09,253
What's going on in here?

367
00:22:14,797 --> 00:22:17,322
Jesus.
Gwen, you sick?

368
00:22:20,369 --> 00:22:23,361
We got... We gotta get her
to a hospital.

369
00:22:23,472 --> 00:22:25,872
Justine, you drive her
to Saint Catherine's.

370
00:22:25,975 --> 00:22:27,806
Well, what time is it?

371
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:31,073
It's a quarter to 5:00.
Why, you gotta be somewhere?

372
00:22:52,134 --> 00:22:53,032
Gwen.

373
00:22:53,135 --> 00:22:55,626
Oh, I had a dream.

374
00:22:55,738 --> 00:22:59,071
I had a dream I was sprouting
a beard made of bean sprouts.

375
00:22:59,175 --> 00:23:00,665
Oh.

376
00:23:00,776 --> 00:23:02,641
I'm gonna let you
off here, OK?

377
00:23:02,745 --> 00:23:06,237
OK. You'll meet me inside?

378
00:23:06,349 --> 00:23:09,318
Uh, well, yeah.
You know what I'm gonna do?

379
00:23:09,418 --> 00:23:10,976
I'm gonna park the car...

380
00:23:11,087 --> 00:23:12,315
and then I'll come in
and meet you in there.

381
00:23:12,421 --> 00:23:14,013
OK. Thanks.

382
00:23:16,659 --> 00:23:18,524
You're a doll.

383
00:23:53,729 --> 00:23:55,560
- Hey!
- Ohh!

384
00:23:56,632 --> 00:23:58,600
Oh, God, I'm really glad
you came.

385
00:23:58,701 --> 00:24:01,295
I just ditched Gwen
at the hospital.

386
00:24:01,404 --> 00:24:02,371
Oh, God, thank God.

387
00:24:02,471 --> 00:24:03,369
Where are we going?

388
00:24:03,472 --> 00:24:04,370
Let's go to my house.

389
00:24:04,473 --> 00:24:06,304
No. With your folks there?

390
00:24:06,409 --> 00:24:07,967
We'll just park somewhere.

391
00:24:08,077 --> 00:24:09,544
Oh, this isn't well-planned.

392
00:24:09,645 --> 00:24:11,078
Look, I don't know.
I don't care.

393
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:11,614
Wherever you want.
I just want to hold you.

394
00:24:11,614 --> 00:24:13,548
Wherever you want.
I just want to hold you.

395
00:24:24,193 --> 00:24:26,058
That's $45 even.

396
00:24:26,162 --> 00:24:29,097
And I need you
to fill this out for me.

397
00:25:19,215 --> 00:25:21,183
Stay here.

398
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:56,242
I can't do it.

399
00:25:57,386 --> 00:25:59,980
We'll be back here
before you know it.

400
00:26:03,025 --> 00:26:04,458
I don't want to.

401
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,755
I don't want to go.

402
00:26:07,863 --> 00:26:10,229
Justine.

403
00:26:12,334 --> 00:26:14,495
I'm yours.

404
00:26:14,603 --> 00:26:16,764
I'm all yours.

405
00:26:25,581 --> 00:26:26,548
Hey.

406
00:26:26,649 --> 00:26:27,775
Hey.

407
00:26:29,285 --> 00:26:30,582
Where you been?

408
00:26:32,855 --> 00:26:35,289
Gwen got real sick today.

409
00:26:35,391 --> 00:26:38,189
She was throwing up
all over the store.

410
00:26:38,294 --> 00:26:40,421
I had to take her
to the hospital

411
00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:42,326
and sat with her.

412
00:26:42,431 --> 00:26:45,025
Did she sick up on you?

413
00:26:45,134 --> 00:26:46,692
No.

414
00:26:47,803 --> 00:26:51,136
Did she sick up
on anybody?

415
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,502
Ha ha ha ha.

416
00:26:52,608 --> 00:26:54,735
It's not funny, Phil.
It's serious.

417
00:26:54,844 --> 00:26:57,438
I'm gonna go by there
after work tomorrow, too.

418
00:26:57,546 --> 00:26:59,537
And the next day.

419
00:27:13,996 --> 00:27:16,590
Justine, what
happened to you?

420
00:27:16,699 --> 00:27:17,961
What?

421
00:27:18,067 --> 00:27:19,193
Went down
to Saint Catherine's

422
00:27:19,301 --> 00:27:20,427
to check up on Gwen.

423
00:27:20,536 --> 00:27:22,731
I looked all over for you.
She was asking for you.

424
00:27:22,838 --> 00:27:25,272
How is she?

425
00:27:25,374 --> 00:27:27,103
She was heaving up

426
00:27:27,209 --> 00:27:28,904
until there was
nothing left to heave.

427
00:27:29,011 --> 00:27:30,410
Doctor said she must've
eaten something

428
00:27:30,513 --> 00:27:31,912
with some kind
of parasite in it...

429
00:27:32,014 --> 00:27:33,504
some kind of bacteria.

430
00:27:33,616 --> 00:27:35,447
I bet it was
those blackberries.

431
00:27:35,551 --> 00:27:37,246
They're gonna
keep her in there

432
00:27:37,353 --> 00:27:39,184
until she gets better, so...

433
00:27:39,288 --> 00:27:42,621
you're gonna have to
supervise cosmetics.

434
00:27:57,473 --> 00:27:59,498
Stop it.
Somebody's gonna see.

435
00:27:59,608 --> 00:28:01,132
Who cares? I don't care.

436
00:28:01,243 --> 00:28:02,574
I crave you.

437
00:28:02,678 --> 00:28:06,978
I want to know everything
about you.

438
00:28:07,082 --> 00:28:08,709
Who are you?

439
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,855
I'm just this woman.

440
00:28:13,956 --> 00:28:16,550
I moved to Texas
when I was 11.

441
00:28:16,659 --> 00:28:19,526
My daddy
was in the air force.

442
00:28:19,628 --> 00:28:23,325
I wanna knock your head open
and see what's inside.

443
00:28:23,432 --> 00:28:25,730
I've had so much pain
in my life.

444
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:28,200
I know you have, too.
I can see it.

445
00:29:01,403 --> 00:29:05,203
Holden gave me two
of his stories to read.

446
00:29:05,307 --> 00:29:09,266
It was more like the story
of what a story would be.

447
00:29:09,378 --> 00:29:12,711
It was about a boy
who was put upon...

448
00:29:12,815 --> 00:29:15,511
whose mother
is cold and selfish

449
00:29:15,618 --> 00:29:19,679
and whose father wanted him
to play football.

450
00:29:20,956 --> 00:29:24,084
Other people didn't get him,
especially girls.

451
00:29:26,629 --> 00:29:28,426
Soon enough,
the boy comes to believe

452
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,555
that no one
can ever really know him.

453
00:29:30,666 --> 00:29:32,463
He starts acting out...

454
00:29:32,568 --> 00:29:36,368
drinking and taking all kinds
of drugs.

455
00:29:36,472 --> 00:29:39,032
At the end,
the boy kills himself

456
00:29:39,141 --> 00:29:41,132
by jumping over a bridge.

457
00:29:43,245 --> 00:29:45,713
The second story
was pretty much the same

458
00:29:45,814 --> 00:29:47,213
as the first...

459
00:29:47,316 --> 00:29:49,978
except, at the end,
the boy kills himself

460
00:29:50,085 --> 00:29:52,383
by drinking a bottle
of bug poison.

461
00:30:03,565 --> 00:30:06,227
Your stories are intense.

462
00:30:08,737 --> 00:30:11,900
I just want to leave
some kind of legacy.

463
00:30:12,007 --> 00:30:14,942
Something great.

464
00:30:15,044 --> 00:30:17,774
And after that, I don't
care what happens to me.

465
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,007
Don't say that.

466
00:30:24,053 --> 00:30:27,750
I wish there was
a story about me.

467
00:30:27,856 --> 00:30:31,792
I don't know who would
read it, though.

468
00:30:33,162 --> 00:30:35,255
I would.

469
00:30:38,067 --> 00:30:40,365
I like this.

470
00:30:42,304 --> 00:30:45,068
I like having a secret.

471
00:30:45,174 --> 00:30:47,108
You gave me a secret,
Holden.

472
00:30:47,209 --> 00:30:48,801
See?

473
00:30:48,911 --> 00:30:51,505
Now that you met me,
you're mysterious.

474
00:30:53,148 --> 00:30:55,776
And dark and twisted.

475
00:30:55,884 --> 00:30:57,977
I'm doomed to hell,
aren't I?

476
00:30:58,087 --> 00:30:59,816
Yes, you are.

477
00:31:12,901 --> 00:31:14,926
What is it?

478
00:31:16,071 --> 00:31:18,904
That's Bubba's truck.
Get in the car.

479
00:31:29,184 --> 00:31:31,914
Phil takes that truck
to work every day.

480
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,614
Bubba picks him up
and drops him off.

481
00:31:34,723 --> 00:31:37,692
Why? Why would that truck
be parked there?

482
00:31:37,793 --> 00:31:40,819
Well, I don't know.

483
00:31:40,929 --> 00:31:43,420
If he finds out about us...

484
00:31:43,532 --> 00:31:45,830
I won't let him hurt you.

485
00:31:45,934 --> 00:31:48,300
He's big, Holden.
He'll kill you.

486
00:31:48,403 --> 00:31:50,735
He'll beat me,
but he will kill you.

487
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:54,900
You can't worry about something
that hasn't even happened.

488
00:31:56,011 --> 00:31:58,275
I gotta go
to the hospital.

489
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,369
All right.

490
00:31:59,481 --> 00:32:02,041
Don't. I mean,
he could be following us.

491
00:32:15,397 --> 00:32:16,421
Justine.

492
00:32:18,167 --> 00:32:22,035
Poor lady.
She just passed.

493
00:32:22,137 --> 00:32:23,604
What? Who did?

494
00:32:23,705 --> 00:32:26,833
Gwen.
She passed away.

495
00:32:29,211 --> 00:32:30,769
Wha... What do you mean?

496
00:32:30,879 --> 00:32:32,870
I thought
she had a stomachache.

497
00:32:32,981 --> 00:32:34,278
Well, she got worse...

498
00:32:34,383 --> 00:32:37,841
and she was on
life support all day, and...

499
00:32:40,956 --> 00:32:43,390
I don't understand.

500
00:32:43,492 --> 00:32:45,824
It was God's will, Justine.

501
00:32:45,928 --> 00:32:48,954
No one can understand it.
No point trying.

502
00:32:49,064 --> 00:32:51,589
It was just
Gwen's time to...

503
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,100
fly away home.

504
00:32:55,938 --> 00:32:58,236
Gwen died today.

505
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,467
What?

506
00:33:01,577 --> 00:33:03,841
Are you kidding?
What for?

507
00:33:04,947 --> 00:33:07,507
Parasite. Bacteria.

508
00:33:07,616 --> 00:33:09,083
Something she ate.

509
00:33:09,184 --> 00:33:10,583
Are you OK?

510
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:13,916
Where were you
this afternoon?

511
00:33:14,022 --> 00:33:16,786
Painting on Bovary. Why?

512
00:33:16,892 --> 00:33:19,087
What time did Bubba
bring you home?

513
00:33:19,194 --> 00:33:21,822
Knocked off early,
about 4:00.

514
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:24,990
Bubba had a date
with a stewardess. Why?

515
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:37,873
I can't believe
she's dead.

516
00:33:43,385 --> 00:33:45,615
I wasn't a very good friend
to her.

517
00:33:45,721 --> 00:33:47,689
Aw, don't say that, Teeny.

518
00:33:47,789 --> 00:33:50,519
Of course you were.

519
00:33:50,626 --> 00:33:51,923
Of course you were.

520
00:34:05,173 --> 00:34:06,731
Retail Rodeo employees...

521
00:34:06,842 --> 00:34:09,402
this is Jack Field,
your store manager.

522
00:34:09,511 --> 00:34:11,069
Before we open today...

523
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:14,080
I have some terrible
and shocking news.

524
00:34:14,182 --> 00:34:17,583
One of our best employees,
Gwen Jackson...

525
00:34:17,686 --> 00:34:19,813
died yesterday.

526
00:34:19,922 --> 00:34:24,621
Gwen was a real class act.
She had a good attitude.

527
00:34:24,726 --> 00:34:26,626
She had ideas.

528
00:34:26,728 --> 00:34:29,288
And we're all
gonna miss her.

529
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:31,298
Now, if any of y'all need
to collect your thoughts

530
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,733
and remember Glen... Gwen...

531
00:34:34,836 --> 00:34:38,101
ahem... then today's the day.

532
00:34:38,206 --> 00:34:40,504
You'll be excused from work...

533
00:34:40,609 --> 00:34:43,169
and we'll just have to
do without you.

534
00:34:43,278 --> 00:34:46,975
Gwen, this one's for you.

535
00:35:17,012 --> 00:35:18,809
Holden had the notion

536
00:35:18,914 --> 00:35:20,381
to spend the day
at Gabler's Creek...

537
00:35:20,482 --> 00:35:22,973
skinny-dipping
and making love.

538
00:35:23,085 --> 00:35:25,553
He said
we'd be like Adam and Eve...

539
00:35:25,654 --> 00:35:27,121
rolling
in the sticks and dirt

540
00:35:27,222 --> 00:35:29,349
and being one
with the wilderness.

541
00:35:31,026 --> 00:35:32,755
He was so fixed on the idea

542
00:35:32,861 --> 00:35:35,091
that even when the clouds
were coming in

543
00:35:35,197 --> 00:35:37,893
and the sky
was getting dark...

544
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,968
he kept on swimmin'.

545
00:35:42,637 --> 00:35:45,333
All my thoughts
turned to death.

546
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,534
I thought of Gwen's body
rotting away.

547
00:35:50,145 --> 00:35:53,308
I thought about
what a nice person she was...

548
00:35:53,415 --> 00:35:56,714
so full of life
and goodwill.

549
00:35:56,818 --> 00:36:00,515
If there is a heaven,
Gwen would be there...

550
00:36:00,622 --> 00:36:03,557
giving makeovers
and offering up helpful advice.

551
00:36:05,494 --> 00:36:09,294
I thought if I died today,
what would happen to me...

552
00:36:09,398 --> 00:36:11,764
a hateful girl...

553
00:36:11,867 --> 00:36:14,335
a selfish girl?

554
00:36:15,704 --> 00:36:18,832
An adulteress.

555
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,373
A liar.

556
00:36:25,247 --> 00:36:26,714
Oh.

557
00:36:41,129 --> 00:36:42,892
What are we doing?

558
00:36:42,998 --> 00:36:45,489
Making one out of two.

559
00:36:48,336 --> 00:36:51,032
I haven't thought
this through.

560
00:36:51,139 --> 00:36:53,607
Justine...

561
00:36:53,708 --> 00:36:55,437
you leave him.

562
00:36:57,946 --> 00:37:00,005
And go where?

563
00:37:01,917 --> 00:37:03,885
With you on my arm...

564
00:37:03,985 --> 00:37:06,749
my folks would think
I've changed...

565
00:37:06,855 --> 00:37:10,222
and they'd stop thinking
I'm such a loner.

566
00:37:10,325 --> 00:37:12,350
I have a girlfriend,
a pretty one...

567
00:37:12,461 --> 00:37:15,624
who knows me and likes me,
and they'd be so happy

568
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:19,257
they'd give me money
to write my novel.

569
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:22,268
But where will we go?

570
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:24,167
It'll be like...

571
00:37:24,272 --> 00:37:26,570
Catcher in the Rye...

572
00:37:26,675 --> 00:37:29,075
but by me.

573
00:37:29,177 --> 00:37:31,771
I'll be immortal, and then,
likeJ.D. Salinger...

574
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,245
I'll just vanish.

575
00:37:35,117 --> 00:37:37,585
- Hey, Teeny.

576
00:37:37,686 --> 00:37:39,813
We been up to no good.

577
00:37:39,921 --> 00:37:44,483
Got the day off
on account of the rain.

578
00:37:44,593 --> 00:37:47,187
I thought you might.

579
00:37:49,064 --> 00:37:50,998
What are you doing?

580
00:37:53,368 --> 00:37:56,633
Say, I heard about your friend
being dead and all.

581
00:37:56,738 --> 00:37:58,638
I'm sorry.

582
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:02,642
Yeah, she was
real healthy, too.

583
00:38:02,744 --> 00:38:07,078
Well, at least you were
with her when she went.

584
00:38:09,751 --> 00:38:14,745
Isn't that right? You were
with her when she went.

585
00:38:15,857 --> 00:38:17,552
Yeah.

586
00:38:17,659 --> 00:38:20,560
I wish it would rain
every day from here on out.

587
00:38:20,662 --> 00:38:23,187
Never have to paint again.

588
00:38:40,649 --> 00:38:42,480
Now, you have to make sure
you order the right ones

589
00:38:42,584 --> 00:38:43,482
when you run out.

590
00:38:43,585 --> 00:38:45,485
- Hey, Justine.
- Hi.

591
00:38:45,587 --> 00:38:46,952
How you holding up?

592
00:38:47,055 --> 00:38:48,044
Fine.

593
00:38:48,156 --> 00:38:50,056
Real shocker.

594
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:54,021
I decided to move Cheryl
over to cosmetics.

595
00:38:54,129 --> 00:38:55,926
She got a little
too creative on the P.A.

596
00:38:56,031 --> 00:38:57,828
Maybe she'll watch
her Ps and Qs over here.

597
00:38:57,933 --> 00:38:59,628
If she don't,
she's out on her butt.

598
00:38:59,734 --> 00:39:01,998
Now you listen
toJustine, sister.

599
00:39:06,975 --> 00:39:09,773
Do you want me to help you
get stuff out of storage?

600
00:39:09,878 --> 00:39:11,436
Oh...

601
00:39:11,546 --> 00:39:13,639
no. Maybe later?

602
00:39:13,748 --> 00:39:16,182
All right. Well, are you going
to give me a ride home today?

603
00:39:16,284 --> 00:39:18,946
My ankle sure is acting up.

604
00:39:19,054 --> 00:39:21,887
I got to get home.
But maybe Cheryl can.

605
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:24,254
What?
You need a ride?

606
00:39:25,493 --> 00:39:27,620
Forget it.

607
00:39:27,729 --> 00:39:29,924
I think we got
to take a breather.

608
00:39:30,031 --> 00:39:33,296
I'm nervous.
I feel guilty.

609
00:39:33,401 --> 00:39:35,335
Well, can't we go
to the motel?

610
00:39:35,437 --> 00:39:36,836
Not today.

611
00:39:36,938 --> 00:39:40,806
Well, let's go
to the storeroom.

612
00:39:40,909 --> 00:39:43,639
Just be patient, Holden.

613
00:39:49,751 --> 00:39:51,776
Um, I was wondering

614
00:39:51,886 --> 00:39:54,650
what time was that,
uh, Bible study?

615
00:39:54,756 --> 00:39:56,849
It's tomorrow night
at 8:00.

616
00:39:56,958 --> 00:39:59,085
We'd sure
love to have you.

617
00:39:59,194 --> 00:40:00,752
Can I bring my husband?

618
00:40:00,862 --> 00:40:03,057
Of course.

619
00:40:03,164 --> 00:40:05,724
You know, the couple that
prays together stays together.

620
00:40:28,023 --> 00:40:29,490
What's this?

621
00:40:29,591 --> 00:40:31,024
The Holy Bible.

622
00:40:31,126 --> 00:40:34,789
There's one for you
and one for me.

623
00:40:34,896 --> 00:40:37,364
Not very light, is it?

624
00:40:37,465 --> 00:40:40,161
We're going
to Bible study.

625
00:40:40,268 --> 00:40:42,065
The couple
that prays together

626
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:44,400
stays together.

627
00:40:44,506 --> 00:40:45,530
I heard it was

628
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,871
the couple that lays together
stays together.

629
00:40:48,977 --> 00:40:51,571
Well, you heard wrong.

630
00:40:55,016 --> 00:40:56,142
Cheryl...

631
00:40:56,251 --> 00:40:58,151
do you think you could
take this one?

632
00:40:58,253 --> 00:40:59,777
Sure.

633
00:40:59,888 --> 00:41:01,446
Sit right down here, ma'am.

634
00:41:01,556 --> 00:41:03,319
We're going
to make you pretty.

635
00:41:03,425 --> 00:41:05,086
Now how do you
like your hair?

636
00:41:05,193 --> 00:41:06,956
What? Are you going
to do my hair?

637
00:41:07,062 --> 00:41:08,222
No, I just need to know

638
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:09,763
if that's your usual way
of wearing it...

639
00:41:09,864 --> 00:41:10,922
all big and high.

640
00:41:11,066 --> 00:41:12,363
If it is,
I'll just put more makeup

641
00:41:12,467 --> 00:41:14,162
on your chin
to offset it.

642
00:41:14,269 --> 00:41:15,759
You're going
to want to take

643
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:17,428
a whole bottle
of this home with you.

644
00:41:17,539 --> 00:41:19,268
It's got quite a lot
of ingredients in it...

645
00:41:19,374 --> 00:41:20,773
so you're getting
a good deal.

646
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:22,103
It's got
ginkgo extract in it.

647
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:23,438
Do you know what that is?

648
00:41:23,545 --> 00:41:24,443
No.

649
00:41:24,546 --> 00:41:26,241
It's extract
of the ginkgo...

650
00:41:26,348 --> 00:41:27,679
and it makes
your skin real slick

651
00:41:27,782 --> 00:41:30,114
so that any liquid
will roll right off you...

652
00:41:30,218 --> 00:41:33,153
be it water,
or lemon juice, or urine.

653
00:41:33,254 --> 00:41:35,154
I'll put it
in a bag for you.

654
00:41:39,394 --> 00:41:40,292
Phil...

655
00:41:40,395 --> 00:41:41,529
what are you doing?

656
00:41:41,529 --> 00:41:43,087
what are you doing?

657
00:41:43,198 --> 00:41:45,029
What?

658
00:41:45,133 --> 00:41:47,101
We're going to be late
for Bible study.

659
00:41:47,202 --> 00:41:49,136
You're stoned.
You got paint in your hair.

660
00:41:49,237 --> 00:41:51,068
Would you get in
the shower, dummy?

661
00:41:51,172 --> 00:41:52,935
I completely
didn't remember.

662
00:41:53,041 --> 00:41:55,942
Ohh, get in the shower.

663
00:42:01,483 --> 00:42:04,316
Working on
your spiritual life?

664
00:42:07,989 --> 00:42:09,718
Yeah, I guess.

665
00:42:09,824 --> 00:42:11,849
Ain't that
a hoot and a holler?

666
00:42:14,129 --> 00:42:15,653
What do you mean?

667
00:42:17,365 --> 00:42:19,196
I saw you, Justine.

668
00:42:21,069 --> 00:42:22,661
You saw me what?

669
00:42:22,771 --> 00:42:26,002
I saw you.

670
00:42:28,243 --> 00:42:30,177
We got some things
to talk about...

671
00:42:30,278 --> 00:42:31,677
you and me.

672
00:42:34,949 --> 00:42:38,407
You come by my house
tomorrow after work...

673
00:42:40,021 --> 00:42:42,148
if you know
what's good for you.

674
00:43:00,208 --> 00:43:01,698
Hey...

675
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:03,141
where's Bubba?

676
00:43:05,213 --> 00:43:06,578
He left.

677
00:43:06,681 --> 00:43:08,876
Well, I'm ready.
Let's go.

678
00:43:21,162 --> 00:43:24,131
I don't know what
to say aboutJesus.

679
00:43:24,232 --> 00:43:25,995
I'm stoned.

680
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:29,263
Just let the other people
do the talking.

681
00:43:30,572 --> 00:43:31,470
Oh, geez...

682
00:43:31,573 --> 00:43:33,871
we forgot
the Bibles, Justine.

683
00:43:33,975 --> 00:43:36,500
Well, that's all right,
they'll forgive us.

684
00:43:37,779 --> 00:43:39,974
Howdy. Welcome.

685
00:43:40,081 --> 00:43:41,776
Hey there, people.

686
00:43:41,883 --> 00:43:43,373
Glad you could make it.

687
00:43:43,485 --> 00:43:44,543
Hi, Corny.

688
00:43:44,652 --> 00:43:45,550
This is my husband...

689
00:43:45,653 --> 00:43:46,551
Phil.

690
00:43:46,654 --> 00:43:47,552
Howdy, Phil.

691
00:43:47,655 --> 00:43:49,316
Y'all are in for a treat.

692
00:43:49,424 --> 00:43:51,654
We got a good discussion
planned for tonight.

693
00:43:51,759 --> 00:43:53,226
If man is made
in God's image...

694
00:43:53,328 --> 00:43:56,195
what does that
say about God?

695
00:43:56,297 --> 00:43:58,765
Yeah, that sounds
like a good one, man.

696
00:43:58,867 --> 00:44:00,960
Hey, Brandon,
I want to talk to you

697
00:44:01,069 --> 00:44:03,264
about the casting of
Pilgrim's Progress.

698
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,178
Phil, come
with me to the car.

699
00:44:13,281 --> 00:44:14,339
What?

700
00:44:14,449 --> 00:44:16,815
Come with me to the car.
I got to get something.

701
00:44:21,689 --> 00:44:22,587
What are you doing?

702
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:23,816
Get in the car.

703
00:44:23,925 --> 00:44:25,859
Just get
in the car, Phil.

704
00:44:29,764 --> 00:44:30,992
What the hell?

705
00:44:31,099 --> 00:44:32,999
I don't want
to go to Bible study.

706
00:44:33,101 --> 00:44:34,193
Why not?

707
00:44:34,302 --> 00:44:35,792
Because I don't want to.

708
00:44:35,904 --> 00:44:38,134
Now let's just
get out of here.

709
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:40,332
Justine,
this is embarrassing.

710
00:44:40,441 --> 00:44:41,840
We're running away
from Bible study

711
00:44:41,943 --> 00:44:43,604
like a couple of
devil worshipers.

712
00:44:43,711 --> 00:44:46,271
I don't care.
I'm not in the mood.

713
00:44:46,381 --> 00:44:49,282
You are
freaking me out, man.

714
00:44:49,384 --> 00:44:50,681
Why?

715
00:44:50,785 --> 00:44:52,309
Why?

716
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:56,117
Because we forgot
our Bibles is why.

717
00:44:56,224 --> 00:44:57,418
You just said 2 seconds ago

718
00:44:57,525 --> 00:44:59,823
they'd forgive us.

719
00:44:59,928 --> 00:45:01,919
Well, they may not,
all right?

720
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:04,794
So can we please just
get the shit out of here?

721
00:45:04,899 --> 00:45:05,888
All right.

722
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,729
I'm never going back
to Bible study again.

723
00:45:07,835 --> 00:45:09,234
I can tell you that much.

724
00:45:09,337 --> 00:45:11,669
I don't care.
Fine by me. Let's just go.

725
00:45:19,581 --> 00:45:22,141
I look too white,
don't you think?

726
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:24,741
Not at all. I'm just trying
to match your face with your hair.

727
00:45:24,852 --> 00:45:26,752
I was thinking
you're not white enough.

728
00:45:26,854 --> 00:45:29,220
I think I look
kind of weird.

729
00:45:29,324 --> 00:45:31,224
The first rule of fashion

730
00:45:31,326 --> 00:45:32,884
is you have to look weird.

731
00:45:32,994 --> 00:45:35,485
What I'm doing has come
straight here from France.

732
00:45:35,597 --> 00:45:36,655
Oh?

733
00:45:36,764 --> 00:45:38,095
It's called Cirque du Face...

734
00:45:38,199 --> 00:45:39,689
meaning
"Circus of the Face,"

735
00:45:39,801 --> 00:45:41,996
and it's all the rage
with the Frenchies, ma'am.

736
00:45:42,103 --> 00:45:44,037
Well, you're
the professional.

737
00:45:44,138 --> 00:45:45,127
That's right...

738
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:47,139
and you're in good hands.

739
00:45:48,343 --> 00:45:50,777
Justine,
what happened to you?

740
00:45:50,878 --> 00:45:52,607
I looked over,
and I saw you two driving off

741
00:45:52,714 --> 00:45:53,772
like vampires in the night.

742
00:45:53,881 --> 00:45:55,109
Oh, gee...

743
00:45:55,216 --> 00:45:57,377
we... we forgot our Bibles.

744
00:45:57,485 --> 00:45:59,282
Well, you could have just
looked on with your neighbor.

745
00:45:59,387 --> 00:46:00,615
It's a church, you know.

746
00:46:00,722 --> 00:46:03,384
You can't make water without
bumping your nut on a Bible.

747
00:46:03,491 --> 00:46:06,153
Well, we felt bad.

748
00:46:07,729 --> 00:46:10,289
What in blazes?

749
00:46:10,398 --> 00:46:12,696
Do you like it?

750
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,603
I can't go.

751
00:46:15,837 --> 00:46:16,735
What?

752
00:46:16,838 --> 00:46:18,533
I can't go today.

753
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,538
There's something important

754
00:46:19,641 --> 00:46:21,404
that I have to tend to.

755
00:46:21,509 --> 00:46:23,875
I thought you said
we'd go today.

756
00:46:23,978 --> 00:46:26,708
Yeah, something came up.

757
00:46:26,814 --> 00:46:30,079
Well, what?
What came up?

758
00:46:30,184 --> 00:46:32,618
OK, look, uh...

759
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,881
I think, um, maybe...

760
00:46:34,989 --> 00:46:37,514
somebody has found out about us.

761
00:46:41,029 --> 00:46:44,430
Well, I'm starting to wonder
if you even want to go.

762
00:46:46,034 --> 00:46:48,366
I'm starting to think
you don't get me.

763
00:46:53,841 --> 00:46:56,833
Maybe I don't get you.

764
00:47:05,453 --> 00:47:06,442
You do! You do get me!

765
00:47:06,554 --> 00:47:07,578
You just don't
want to get me...

766
00:47:07,689 --> 00:47:09,714
because I'm
too intensified for you.

767
00:47:09,824 --> 00:47:11,587
Justine, who cares...

768
00:47:11,693 --> 00:47:13,126
Who cares
if someone found out?

769
00:47:13,227 --> 00:47:15,218
Look, we don't have to
live like this, Justine.

770
00:47:15,329 --> 00:47:17,422
I know what it's like
to go home every night

771
00:47:17,532 --> 00:47:19,022
and feel like
you're hiding out.

772
00:47:19,133 --> 00:47:20,566
We can leave
all this behind.

773
00:47:20,668 --> 00:47:22,033
That's easy for you
to say, Holden.

774
00:47:22,136 --> 00:47:23,330
You are not married.

775
00:47:23,438 --> 00:47:24,803
Are you just
going to give up?

776
00:47:24,906 --> 00:47:25,873
You going to go
crawling back?

777
00:47:25,973 --> 00:47:27,873
Holden, you are going
to get us caught!

778
00:47:27,975 --> 00:47:29,203
You're so
fucking frightened...

779
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:30,470
it makes me sick.

780
00:47:32,213 --> 00:47:33,305
Wait...

781
00:47:33,414 --> 00:47:36,611
don't give up on us.

782
00:47:36,718 --> 00:47:38,583
I won't.

783
00:47:44,792 --> 00:47:47,352
OK.

784
00:47:50,565 --> 00:47:51,623
OK.

785
00:48:00,074 --> 00:48:02,804
I'll see you
tomorrow, OK?

786
00:48:04,479 --> 00:48:06,140
OK?

787
00:48:06,247 --> 00:48:07,407
OK.

788
00:48:07,515 --> 00:48:10,245
Good luck on
your important thing.

789
00:48:10,351 --> 00:48:12,546
Thanks.

790
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:34,234
Easy, Bits. Easy, Bits.

791
00:48:34,342 --> 00:48:36,401
Back in your corner!
Back in your corner!

792
00:48:36,511 --> 00:48:38,741
Back in your corner, Bits!

793
00:48:40,515 --> 00:48:41,812
Come on in.

794
00:48:44,118 --> 00:48:46,382
I want
to show you something.

795
00:48:47,889 --> 00:48:48,787
Sit.

796
00:48:50,691 --> 00:48:51,715
You get in your corner!

797
00:48:51,826 --> 00:48:53,088
Get in your corner!

798
00:48:53,194 --> 00:48:54,161
I mean it!
In your corner!

799
00:48:54,262 --> 00:48:56,287
In your corner!

800
00:49:07,575 --> 00:49:10,043
I'm in shock.

801
00:49:15,416 --> 00:49:17,316
Why?

802
00:49:17,418 --> 00:49:19,818
You know why.

803
00:49:21,923 --> 00:49:24,118
Bubba sat like that

804
00:49:24,225 --> 00:49:27,991
for what seemed like 10 years
before he began to speak.

805
00:49:28,095 --> 00:49:29,892
Finally,
when he opened his mouth...

806
00:49:29,997 --> 00:49:31,021
he talked a blue streak

807
00:49:31,132 --> 00:49:34,431
about the sad ruin
that was his life.

808
00:49:34,535 --> 00:49:36,400
He talked about
how he loved Phil...

809
00:49:36,504 --> 00:49:37,801
and how he loved me...

810
00:49:37,905 --> 00:49:40,465
and how he always wanted
a girlfriend just like me

811
00:49:40,575 --> 00:49:41,175
and to be a guy like Phil

812
00:49:41,175 --> 00:49:42,073
and to be a guy like Phil

813
00:49:42,176 --> 00:49:46,670
to this imaginary girl
like me who he never found.

814
00:49:46,781 --> 00:49:49,341
Then he started on about
giving up your dreams

815
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:51,884
and how it's all a part
of getting older.

816
00:49:51,986 --> 00:49:55,319
Bubba had given up
his dream of being Phil.

817
00:49:55,423 --> 00:49:58,483
He had accepted his fate
of being Bubba...

818
00:49:58,593 --> 00:50:00,925
always and forever.

819
00:50:01,028 --> 00:50:02,655
Then last week...

820
00:50:02,763 --> 00:50:04,355
a door that had
always been shut

821
00:50:04,465 --> 00:50:06,592
swung wide open.

822
00:50:15,776 --> 00:50:19,007
Bubba felt that this
was no chance coincidence.

823
00:50:19,113 --> 00:50:22,879
A cosmic force was at work.

824
00:50:22,984 --> 00:50:25,452
The sounds of me making love
to a man who wasn't Phil

825
00:50:25,553 --> 00:50:27,214
was like
a shout in Bubba's ear

826
00:50:27,321 --> 00:50:29,380
from the Creator himself.

827
00:50:36,998 --> 00:50:38,989
What it meant,
or what to do or why...

828
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:40,965
Bubba didn't know.

829
00:50:41,068 --> 00:50:42,729
All he knew
was that he hated me

830
00:50:42,837 --> 00:50:44,668
for poisoning
the well of idealism

831
00:50:44,772 --> 00:50:47,138
from which he had drunk
for so long.

832
00:50:47,241 --> 00:50:51,041
I was no longer Bubba's image
of perfection.

833
00:50:51,145 --> 00:50:53,773
I was just
a liar and a whore...

834
00:50:53,881 --> 00:50:57,373
and that sickened him.

835
00:50:57,485 --> 00:50:58,543
But on the other hand...

836
00:50:58,653 --> 00:51:00,382
he loved me
for opening his eyes

837
00:51:00,488 --> 00:51:02,752
and releasing him from
the bitter chains of envy

838
00:51:02,857 --> 00:51:05,758
that bound him to Phil.

839
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:07,088
Phil was no Superman...

840
00:51:07,194 --> 00:51:09,128
just a cuckold and a fool...

841
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:11,391
and that was beautiful.

842
00:51:15,603 --> 00:51:16,570
Bubba felt that there was

843
00:51:16,671 --> 00:51:18,798
just one thing
left for us to do...

844
00:51:18,906 --> 00:51:21,033
something that would
solve both of our problems

845
00:51:21,142 --> 00:51:23,736
and end
this whole tragic saga.

846
00:51:23,844 --> 00:51:26,779
Bubba, I'm not going
to sleep with you.

847
00:51:26,881 --> 00:51:28,781
But don't you see?

848
00:51:28,883 --> 00:51:31,283
This is my chance
for liberation.

849
00:51:31,385 --> 00:51:33,287
But one person's...

850
00:51:33,287 --> 00:51:34,652
But one person's...

851
00:51:34,755 --> 00:51:36,347
you know, liberation...

852
00:51:36,457 --> 00:51:38,755
is another person's badness.

853
00:51:38,859 --> 00:51:40,190
There's just no way.

854
00:51:40,294 --> 00:51:41,886
I'm going to have
to tell Phil then.

855
00:51:41,996 --> 00:51:42,963
Why?

856
00:51:43,064 --> 00:51:44,759
He's my best friend.

857
00:51:44,865 --> 00:51:46,162
I can't
keep him in the dark

858
00:51:46,267 --> 00:51:47,825
about something this big.

859
00:51:47,935 --> 00:51:49,197
He's a cuckold.

860
00:51:49,303 --> 00:51:51,203
But you want
to cuckold him yourself.

861
00:51:51,305 --> 00:51:53,637
That's different.
That's not about him.

862
00:51:53,741 --> 00:51:57,233
That's about my salvation.

863
00:51:57,345 --> 00:52:00,371
Look, you've got
your choice to make...

864
00:52:00,481 --> 00:52:02,108
Destroy your marriage

865
00:52:02,216 --> 00:52:04,241
and break
your husband's heart...

866
00:52:04,352 --> 00:52:06,843
or have sex with me
right now.

867
00:52:13,094 --> 00:52:14,083
In your corner, Bits!

868
00:52:14,195 --> 00:52:16,390
Down! In your corner!

869
00:52:21,435 --> 00:52:25,872
Justine! Justine! Justine!

870
00:52:38,285 --> 00:52:39,843
Oh! God!

871
00:52:39,954 --> 00:52:41,512
What?

872
00:52:41,622 --> 00:52:42,520
There was someone
at that window.

873
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,521
Did you not see?

874
00:52:43,624 --> 00:52:46,491
Oh, you're paranoid.

875
00:52:46,594 --> 00:52:47,993
I got to go.

876
00:52:49,263 --> 00:52:50,730
Phil is never
going to find out

877
00:52:50,831 --> 00:52:52,423
about any of this.

878
00:52:52,533 --> 00:52:54,125
Don't fret.

879
00:52:54,235 --> 00:52:56,100
Just get this damn dog
away from me.

880
00:52:57,238 --> 00:52:59,331
You're looking at
a free man, Justine.

881
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,407
A free man.

882
00:53:00,508 --> 00:53:01,668
Great. Good for you.

883
00:53:01,776 --> 00:53:02,800
Thank you.

884
00:53:04,412 --> 00:53:05,310
Bits!

885
00:53:06,981 --> 00:53:09,142
Bits! Bits!

886
00:53:11,485 --> 00:53:13,749
All the tales
of mystical places

887
00:53:13,854 --> 00:53:16,118
began with
"once upon a time..."

888
00:53:17,925 --> 00:53:19,358
I'm nervous.

889
00:53:21,462 --> 00:53:23,987
You're nervous? Why?

890
00:53:24,098 --> 00:53:26,692
Because I got to go
to that doctor tomorrow

891
00:53:26,801 --> 00:53:29,531
and jism into a cup,
that's why.

892
00:53:29,637 --> 00:53:31,935
What if I can't do it?

893
00:53:32,039 --> 00:53:33,267
You can do it.

894
00:53:33,374 --> 00:53:35,274
You know, if you
said you'd help me...

895
00:53:35,376 --> 00:53:38,038
I'd feel
a lot less nervous.

896
00:53:39,914 --> 00:53:43,315
It's going to be on
your lunch hour anyway.

897
00:53:46,053 --> 00:53:48,419
OK.

898
00:53:49,723 --> 00:53:51,156
You didn't even
say nothing

899
00:53:51,258 --> 00:53:53,692
about the TV
being fixed.

900
00:53:53,794 --> 00:53:56,661
Oh. Is it?

901
00:54:00,334 --> 00:54:02,097
Thanks.

902
00:54:02,203 --> 00:54:05,695
You're welcome.

903
00:54:08,175 --> 00:54:10,735
Well, aren't you
a fright?

904
00:54:10,845 --> 00:54:13,177
Justine, have you
heard from Holden?

905
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,178
He didn't show up
for work today.

906
00:54:14,281 --> 00:54:15,179
I want to know
what gives.

907
00:54:15,282 --> 00:54:16,772
I know you two
are friends.

908
00:54:16,884 --> 00:54:18,078
We're not friends.

909
00:54:18,185 --> 00:54:21,586
You eat lunch
together every day.

910
00:54:21,689 --> 00:54:23,384
No, we don't.

911
00:54:24,859 --> 00:54:26,190
Well, if you see him...

912
00:54:26,293 --> 00:54:27,988
tell him Jack Field's
looking for him.

913
00:54:39,907 --> 00:54:40,896
Oh, my God!

914
00:54:42,376 --> 00:54:43,308
What are you doing?

915
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:44,604
You're a hooker.

916
00:54:44,712 --> 00:54:45,610
You hooker!

917
00:54:45,713 --> 00:54:47,112
I saw you.
You followed me.

918
00:54:47,214 --> 00:54:48,613
So how many guys
you gettin' with?

919
00:54:48,716 --> 00:54:50,411
You gettin' with
every guy in the state?

920
00:54:50,518 --> 00:54:53,214
No! Holden, this is
all because of you!

921
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,947
He had me
over a barrel.

922
00:54:55,055 --> 00:54:55,953
If I didn't
sleep with him...

923
00:54:56,056 --> 00:54:57,318
he was going to tell
Phil about us.

924
00:54:57,424 --> 00:54:59,756
I'm so alone!

925
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:01,885
You've got
to get ahold of yourself.

926
00:55:04,598 --> 00:55:05,530
Are you drunk?

927
00:55:05,633 --> 00:55:06,964
Yes, I'm drunk!

928
00:55:07,067 --> 00:55:08,694
And I'll be drunk every day
until the day I die!

929
00:55:08,802 --> 00:55:09,962
What do you care?

930
00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:12,561
You'll jump on any pecker
that's put in front of you!

931
00:55:12,673 --> 00:55:14,538
It's not
what you think.

932
00:55:14,642 --> 00:55:16,371
I saw everything!

933
00:55:16,477 --> 00:55:18,809
Oh, God! Oh, my God!

934
00:55:18,913 --> 00:55:20,938
OK, go home, sober up...

935
00:55:21,048 --> 00:55:21,946
meet me after work...

936
00:55:22,049 --> 00:55:23,277
and we will
talk about this.

937
00:55:23,384 --> 00:55:24,578
Where are you going?

938
00:55:24,685 --> 00:55:26,676
I got to help Phil
with his sperm.

939
00:55:26,787 --> 00:55:27,754
What?

940
00:55:27,855 --> 00:55:28,947
Just go!

941
00:55:29,056 --> 00:55:30,148
- Go on!
- Wait.

942
00:55:30,257 --> 00:55:32,487
I can't share you, Justine!

943
00:55:32,593 --> 00:55:33,491
Maybe with one man...

944
00:55:33,594 --> 00:55:35,459
but not with
a whole bunch of them!

945
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,992
Oh, great.

946
00:55:48,609 --> 00:55:50,702
Mr. Last,
would you come with me?

947
00:55:53,047 --> 00:55:54,309
Wish me luck.

948
00:55:54,415 --> 00:55:55,313
Good luck, honey.

949
00:55:55,416 --> 00:55:56,508
Knock 'em dead, partner.

950
00:56:07,161 --> 00:56:08,458
You look nice.

951
00:56:08,562 --> 00:56:10,393
No, I don't.

952
00:56:10,497 --> 00:56:12,897
I know you're angry,
and I can figure why...

953
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,400
but from where I stand...

954
00:56:15,502 --> 00:56:17,902
what happened yesterday
was a wonderful thing.

955
00:56:18,005 --> 00:56:20,997
Nothing happened yesterday,
so drop it.

956
00:56:24,044 --> 00:56:26,239
Well, I'm awful grateful
to you, Justine. I am.

957
00:56:26,347 --> 00:56:29,339
Bubba, I mean it.

958
00:56:36,991 --> 00:56:41,826
Let me just
ask you one thing.

959
00:56:41,929 --> 00:56:44,261
How do I stack up
against Phil...

960
00:56:44,365 --> 00:56:45,923
you know?

961
00:56:46,033 --> 00:56:48,593
How do I stack up
against him where it counts?

962
00:56:48,702 --> 00:56:50,260
Ma'am?

963
00:56:50,371 --> 00:56:53,306
Your husband has made
a request for your presence.

964
00:56:56,377 --> 00:56:58,174
Who's that?

965
00:56:58,312 --> 00:56:59,939
It's Justine.

966
00:57:02,483 --> 00:57:04,781
Come on.

967
00:57:08,822 --> 00:57:10,881
I can't do this on my own.

968
00:57:10,991 --> 00:57:12,720
I need help.

969
00:57:12,826 --> 00:57:15,727
What? You've never
done it on your own?

970
00:57:15,829 --> 00:57:18,059
Not in a place like this.

971
00:57:18,165 --> 00:57:22,226
Not when I have to
hand over the results.

972
00:57:22,336 --> 00:57:24,736
Just...

973
00:57:24,838 --> 00:57:27,898
let me hold your boob.

974
00:57:28,008 --> 00:57:30,272
Here.

975
00:57:31,779 --> 00:57:34,407
Ow! They're sore.

976
00:57:52,199 --> 00:57:55,066
What's wrong with you?
You look like death.

977
00:57:55,169 --> 00:57:59,105
My stomach's cramping.

978
00:57:59,206 --> 00:58:01,231
I feel sore.

979
00:58:01,342 --> 00:58:02,240
Is it your period?

980
00:58:02,343 --> 00:58:03,901
No, it's just stress.

981
00:58:04,011 --> 00:58:06,275
I know,
this job's stressful.

982
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:08,314
I'm breaking out.

983
00:58:08,415 --> 00:58:09,643
You're breaking out

984
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:11,843
because you put so much makeup
on your face.

985
00:58:13,187 --> 00:58:14,916
Maybe you're pregnant.

986
00:58:15,022 --> 00:58:16,421
What?

987
00:58:16,523 --> 00:58:17,956
No.

988
00:58:34,041 --> 00:58:36,839
You know, sometimes
I think to myself...

989
00:58:36,944 --> 00:58:38,673
"At least it can't
get any worse."

990
00:58:38,779 --> 00:58:40,679
But it can.

991
00:58:40,781 --> 00:58:42,180
It could get worse.

992
00:58:42,282 --> 00:58:44,273
As long as you can say
you hit rock bottom...

993
00:58:44,385 --> 00:58:45,818
you haven't.

994
00:58:47,187 --> 00:58:49,451
Oh, my God...

995
00:58:49,556 --> 00:58:50,454
blackberries.

996
00:58:50,557 --> 00:58:52,582
A blind man could go deaf...

997
00:58:52,693 --> 00:58:54,160
a widow could
lose her children...

998
00:58:54,261 --> 00:58:57,458
babies starve
and they never get food.

999
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:02,125
They never get any food!

1000
00:59:02,236 --> 00:59:05,034
They just come into the world
and they die.

1001
00:59:05,139 --> 00:59:07,300
Holden, calm down,
all right?

1002
00:59:07,408 --> 00:59:09,273
I can't calm down!

1003
00:59:09,376 --> 00:59:10,809
It'd be easy if
I was a hooker like you...

1004
00:59:10,911 --> 00:59:12,640
then I could calm down
all over town.

1005
00:59:12,746 --> 00:59:13,644
Hey!

1006
00:59:14,748 --> 00:59:17,080
I am not a hooker!

1007
00:59:18,185 --> 00:59:21,154
l... I know you're not.

1008
00:59:22,623 --> 00:59:24,648
I'm in agony.

1009
00:59:24,758 --> 00:59:25,918
Why?

1010
00:59:26,026 --> 00:59:27,891
What do you mean why?
I thought you hated your life.

1011
00:59:27,995 --> 00:59:31,431
I do. I mean,
I'm depressed, but...

1012
00:59:32,833 --> 00:59:35,267
but you are
really depressed.

1013
00:59:41,642 --> 00:59:44,543
I'll kill him.
I'll murder him in his sleep.

1014
00:59:44,645 --> 00:59:46,010
I'll kill my parents,
I'll steal their money...

1015
00:59:46,113 --> 00:59:48,013
whatever it takes...
just... just whatever you want.

1016
00:59:48,115 --> 00:59:49,707
Just as long as
it's you and me.

1017
00:59:49,817 --> 00:59:51,045
Please don't
forsake me, Justine.

1018
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:54,914
OK.

1019
00:59:55,022 --> 00:59:56,080
I can't take it!

1020
00:59:56,190 --> 00:59:57,122
All right, I won't.

1021
00:59:57,224 --> 00:59:58,782
I won't, I promise.

1022
00:59:58,892 --> 01:00:00,189
I won't.

1023
01:00:00,294 --> 01:00:02,455
I promise, OK?

1024
01:00:03,897 --> 01:00:05,660
I realized then

1025
01:00:05,766 --> 01:00:07,529
that Holden was at best,
a child...

1026
01:00:07,634 --> 01:00:10,660
and at worst, a demon.

1027
01:00:10,771 --> 01:00:12,170
If I was ever
going to go straight...

1028
01:00:12,272 --> 01:00:14,172
I'd have to ditch him.

1029
01:00:14,274 --> 01:00:17,107
Sometimes to get back
on the road to redemption...

1030
01:00:17,211 --> 01:00:20,009
you have to make
a few pit stops.

1031
01:00:20,113 --> 01:00:21,444
How much are
the blackberries?

1032
01:00:21,548 --> 01:00:24,210
Ah, a tin for $2.00, miss.

1033
01:00:25,819 --> 01:00:27,616
Here you go.

1034
01:00:27,721 --> 01:00:28,688
Thank you.

1035
01:00:30,791 --> 01:00:32,656
Have a blackberry.

1036
01:00:35,863 --> 01:00:37,888
We... We need a plan.

1037
01:00:37,998 --> 01:00:39,625
We can't keep
living day-to-day.

1038
01:00:39,733 --> 01:00:41,667
We got to chart a course,
and we just got to stick...

1039
01:00:41,768 --> 01:00:44,202
Have a blackberry,
Holden!

1040
01:00:44,304 --> 01:00:45,896
They're... They're dirty.

1041
01:00:58,652 --> 01:01:00,620
They're sweet.

1042
01:01:06,894 --> 01:01:10,091
If I could only get
my hands on some money.

1043
01:01:10,197 --> 01:01:12,757
If someone could just
tell me the answer.

1044
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:17,794
I got to do...

1045
01:01:17,905 --> 01:01:19,167
But I never do anything...

1046
01:01:19,273 --> 01:01:21,605
'cause I end up
thinking about it instead.

1047
01:01:21,708 --> 01:01:24,199
I got to do.

1048
01:01:25,846 --> 01:01:27,404
But do what...

1049
01:01:27,514 --> 01:01:29,277
Whoa. What?

1050
01:01:35,255 --> 01:01:37,018
What was that for?

1051
01:01:37,124 --> 01:01:38,250
They looked dirty.

1052
01:01:38,358 --> 01:01:41,122
They... like... I saw a bug
in them or something.

1053
01:01:59,713 --> 01:02:00,941
Son, I understood
your history.

1054
01:02:01,048 --> 01:02:03,516
Your father gave me a call,
I gave you a job.

1055
01:02:03,617 --> 01:02:04,948
I even let you
use that name...

1056
01:02:05,052 --> 01:02:05,950
even though
it isn't yours...

1057
01:02:06,053 --> 01:02:06,985
and I never do that

1058
01:02:07,087 --> 01:02:08,952
with other people
in the store, so...

1059
01:02:17,197 --> 01:02:20,598
I'm worried
about Holden... Tom.

1060
01:02:20,701 --> 01:02:23,534
I'm... I'm
worried about Tom.

1061
01:02:23,637 --> 01:02:27,596
I just befriended
Tom recently...

1062
01:02:27,708 --> 01:02:31,041
and now...

1063
01:02:31,144 --> 01:02:33,374
well...

1064
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:36,506
I think
he's mentally ill.

1065
01:02:36,617 --> 01:02:38,744
He's got this idea
in his head

1066
01:02:38,852 --> 01:02:41,047
that we've had
some sort of affair...

1067
01:02:41,154 --> 01:02:42,519
which is crazy...

1068
01:02:42,623 --> 01:02:44,250
because
I'm... I'm married...

1069
01:02:44,358 --> 01:02:45,723
And... And he said...

1070
01:02:45,826 --> 01:02:48,056
He's been saying
all sorts of strange things

1071
01:02:48,161 --> 01:02:50,629
and making threats...

1072
01:02:50,731 --> 01:02:53,461
and drinkin'...

1073
01:02:53,567 --> 01:02:54,556
and...

1074
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:01,166
and I just think

1075
01:03:01,274 --> 01:03:03,708
he would be better off
someplace where people...

1076
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:05,801
professionals...

1077
01:03:05,912 --> 01:03:08,107
could take care of him.

1078
01:03:08,215 --> 01:03:09,807
Otherwise, l... l... l...

1079
01:03:09,916 --> 01:03:12,544
He's going to get
himself into trouble.

1080
01:03:35,842 --> 01:03:38,572
What are you
doing in there?

1081
01:03:38,679 --> 01:03:40,306
What's that?

1082
01:03:40,414 --> 01:03:43,076
It's a home pregnancy test.

1083
01:03:43,183 --> 01:03:45,174
Why are you taking it?

1084
01:03:45,285 --> 01:03:48,083
Because I still haven't
gotten my period.

1085
01:03:50,190 --> 01:03:51,088
What's it say?

1086
01:03:51,191 --> 01:03:52,590
Well, I haven't
taken it yet.

1087
01:03:52,693 --> 01:03:55,457
Could you give me
a minute, please?

1088
01:03:55,562 --> 01:03:58,463
I want to be here
when you find out, Teeny.

1089
01:04:01,468 --> 01:04:03,060
OK.

1090
01:04:14,448 --> 01:04:17,508
The little plastic
doohickey's turning blue.

1091
01:04:17,617 --> 01:04:19,608
What's that mean?

1092
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:21,483
Blue?

1093
01:04:21,588 --> 01:04:23,613
Bright blue.

1094
01:04:27,894 --> 01:04:30,488
That means I'm pregnant.

1095
01:04:34,468 --> 01:04:36,333
All right!

1096
01:04:36,436 --> 01:04:37,733
I knew it.

1097
01:04:37,838 --> 01:04:40,864
Waste of time going
to that sperm doctor.

1098
01:04:40,974 --> 01:04:42,202
We did it!

1099
01:04:42,309 --> 01:04:44,402
We're going to have
ourselves a baby.

1100
01:04:44,511 --> 01:04:47,139
Maybe.

1101
01:04:47,247 --> 01:04:48,179
Tomorrow...

1102
01:04:48,281 --> 01:04:51,216
we're going to celebrate
at Senor Tuna.

1103
01:04:51,318 --> 01:04:52,444
Yes, we are.

1104
01:04:52,552 --> 01:04:53,917
And I'm going
to bring Bubba...

1105
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:56,614
you can bring some of your
friends from work, or...

1106
01:04:56,723 --> 01:04:58,623
the Bible-study guy...

1107
01:04:58,725 --> 01:05:00,022
whoever.

1108
01:05:01,495 --> 01:05:03,895
Too bad Gwen's dead.

1109
01:05:03,997 --> 01:05:06,192
The test
could be wrong, Phil.

1110
01:05:06,299 --> 01:05:08,358
It's a little early
to be having a party.

1111
01:05:12,539 --> 01:05:14,700
Well, let's do it
mellow then.

1112
01:05:17,277 --> 01:05:19,643
You sure don't
seem too excited.

1113
01:05:19,746 --> 01:05:22,544
Oh, I'm excited.

1114
01:05:22,649 --> 01:05:24,446
It's just...

1115
01:05:24,551 --> 01:05:26,485
you know, a lot of worries
come along with having a baby.

1116
01:05:26,586 --> 01:05:29,885
Now don't think negative.

1117
01:05:29,990 --> 01:05:32,288
Think positive.

1118
01:05:32,392 --> 01:05:36,055
We could have ourselves
a tiny Phil...

1119
01:05:37,264 --> 01:05:39,164
or a tiny Teeny.

1120
01:05:40,734 --> 01:05:44,534
Teeny's going to have
a teeny-weeny Teeny.

1121
01:05:49,476 --> 01:05:51,000
You think anything's
going to change...

1122
01:05:51,111 --> 01:05:52,806
having a baby?

1123
01:05:54,014 --> 01:05:54,912
What do you mean?

1124
01:05:55,015 --> 01:05:58,041
Everything's
going to change.

1125
01:05:59,319 --> 01:06:00,377
Yeah, but I mean...

1126
01:06:00,487 --> 01:06:04,218
do you think anything's
really going to change?

1127
01:06:05,959 --> 01:06:07,426
What do you mean?

1128
01:06:09,229 --> 01:06:10,127
Gentlemen?

1129
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:11,754
Morning.

1130
01:06:11,865 --> 01:06:14,834
We found these
out in the road.

1131
01:06:14,935 --> 01:06:18,063
Belonged to a fellow
named of Burt Evans.

1132
01:06:26,279 --> 01:06:28,179
Tell us
about everything.

1133
01:06:31,685 --> 01:06:32,583
Hello?

1134
01:06:32,686 --> 01:06:34,244
Hi.
This is Dr. Williams

1135
01:06:34,354 --> 01:06:36,652
returning the call
ofJean Worther.

1136
01:06:38,391 --> 01:06:39,790
I'm calling from

1137
01:06:39,893 --> 01:06:42,453
the Halin County
Psychiatric Hospital.

1138
01:06:47,601 --> 01:06:50,069
Who was it, Tom?

1139
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:52,536
It was a wrong number.

1140
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,271
Either of you
seen Holden?

1141
01:07:30,877 --> 01:07:33,778
That boy
is out on his ass!

1142
01:07:41,454 --> 01:07:44,912
Justine,
something's going on.

1143
01:07:55,168 --> 01:07:57,898
Something is
definitely happening.

1144
01:07:59,506 --> 01:08:00,803
OK, go find out.

1145
01:08:18,525 --> 01:08:20,083
What? What is it?
What's happening?

1146
01:08:20,193 --> 01:08:21,091
It's big.

1147
01:08:21,194 --> 01:08:22,092
What?

1148
01:08:22,195 --> 01:08:23,423
It's very big.

1149
01:08:23,530 --> 01:08:25,088
Cheryl, come on.
I'm gonna kill you.

1150
01:08:25,198 --> 01:08:28,133
Somebody stole $15,000
from the safe.

1151
01:08:28,234 --> 01:08:31,431
Yeah. They blew the thing
open with a gun.

1152
01:08:31,538 --> 01:08:32,835
Oh, my God.

1153
01:08:32,939 --> 01:08:34,031
Not only that...

1154
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:35,539
but the cops
know who did it.

1155
01:08:35,642 --> 01:08:36,802
Who?

1156
01:08:36,910 --> 01:08:38,775
Somebody who works here.

1157
01:08:38,878 --> 01:08:40,106
Oh, Cheryl!

1158
01:08:40,213 --> 01:08:41,612
Holden... Holden did it.

1159
01:08:41,715 --> 01:08:44,149
Fool left his cashier key
in the door.

1160
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:45,444
Oh, my God.

1161
01:08:45,552 --> 01:08:46,780
They can't find him,
though.

1162
01:08:46,886 --> 01:08:48,786
They say he robbed
his folks, too...

1163
01:08:48,888 --> 01:08:50,014
Took off.

1164
01:08:50,123 --> 01:08:52,182
You in on it?

1165
01:08:52,292 --> 01:08:53,384
What?!

1166
01:08:53,493 --> 01:08:54,687
No.

1167
01:08:54,794 --> 01:08:56,819
I know you two played hooky
in the storeroom.

1168
01:08:56,930 --> 01:08:58,124
I'll never rat on you.

1169
01:08:58,231 --> 01:08:59,664
I done some things myself.

1170
01:08:59,766 --> 01:09:01,631
Just tell me...
you in on it?

1171
01:09:01,735 --> 01:09:04,033
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1172
01:09:04,137 --> 01:09:05,661
Suit yourself.

1173
01:09:10,510 --> 01:09:11,568
Justine...

1174
01:09:11,678 --> 01:09:13,908
can we talk to you
for a second?

1175
01:09:25,025 --> 01:09:26,424
Come in.

1176
01:09:30,296 --> 01:09:31,854
Hi, Justine.

1177
01:09:31,965 --> 01:09:33,830
Go ahead
and have a seat.

1178
01:09:45,712 --> 01:09:48,112
Justine,
you like working

1179
01:09:48,214 --> 01:09:50,444
at the Retail Rodeo,
don't you?

1180
01:09:50,550 --> 01:09:52,108
You like the company...

1181
01:09:52,218 --> 01:09:54,379
and you like
the people?

1182
01:09:54,487 --> 01:09:56,819
You wouldn't want
to jeopardize all that

1183
01:09:56,923 --> 01:09:58,618
by making some silly
error in judgment...

1184
01:09:58,725 --> 01:10:00,556
would you?

1185
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:04,027
Holden stole $15,000
from the safe last night.

1186
01:10:05,999 --> 01:10:07,967
Did you have anything
to do with it?

1187
01:10:08,068 --> 01:10:09,194
No.

1188
01:10:09,302 --> 01:10:11,930
I don't know anything.

1189
01:10:12,038 --> 01:10:15,474
'Cause we know you're
very tight with Holden.

1190
01:10:15,575 --> 01:10:17,406
I hardly know him.

1191
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:21,738
I've seen you

1192
01:10:21,848 --> 01:10:24,373
in the storeroom
with him, Justine...

1193
01:10:24,484 --> 01:10:26,543
on many an occasion.

1194
01:10:30,557 --> 01:10:32,855
I think you know him
pretty well.

1195
01:10:38,531 --> 01:10:41,295
I don't know anything.

1196
01:10:48,408 --> 01:10:49,898
Justine!

1197
01:10:50,009 --> 01:10:51,306
Justine!

1198
01:10:51,411 --> 01:10:52,935
Justine!

1199
01:10:57,684 --> 01:10:58,708
I did it.

1200
01:10:58,818 --> 01:11:00,046
I finally did something.

1201
01:11:00,153 --> 01:11:01,955
The police are
looking for you.

1202
01:11:02,088 --> 01:11:03,885
Oh, who cares?

1203
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:06,652
I'm proud of myself.

1204
01:11:06,759 --> 01:11:08,556
Fuck them.
Fuck all of'em.

1205
01:11:08,661 --> 01:11:10,891
Hey! They think that
I'm in on it, too, OK?

1206
01:11:10,997 --> 01:11:12,965
Corny has got a camera
in that storage room.

1207
01:11:13,066 --> 01:11:14,397
That Bible-thumping pervert

1208
01:11:14,501 --> 01:11:15,900
has been watching us
the whole time.

1209
01:11:16,002 --> 01:11:17,401
Well, we're out of here!

1210
01:11:17,504 --> 01:11:19,165
Justine... God.

1211
01:11:19,272 --> 01:11:22,070
I got over $20,000.

1212
01:11:22,175 --> 01:11:23,972
I got a gun. What else?

1213
01:11:24,077 --> 01:11:25,601
Oh, God,
I'm getting all goosey.

1214
01:11:25,712 --> 01:11:27,270
I think
I'm gonna crash.

1215
01:11:35,722 --> 01:11:37,314
I'm pregnant, Holden.

1216
01:11:40,393 --> 01:11:41,826
It's my baby.

1217
01:11:41,928 --> 01:11:43,293
Not necessarily.

1218
01:11:43,396 --> 01:11:45,330
Yes, it is.
You know it is.

1219
01:11:46,966 --> 01:11:48,297
Even if it is...

1220
01:11:48,401 --> 01:11:50,869
you cannot raise
a baby on the run.

1221
01:11:50,970 --> 01:11:52,437
Yes, you can.

1222
01:11:52,539 --> 01:11:54,234
I mean, you can't
raise a baby here.

1223
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:55,364
You know that.

1224
01:11:55,475 --> 01:11:57,375
Justine.

1225
01:11:57,477 --> 01:12:00,310
You hate your husband.
You hate your job.

1226
01:12:00,413 --> 01:12:02,381
You love me, let's go.

1227
01:12:02,482 --> 01:12:03,574
I can't go tonight.

1228
01:12:03,683 --> 01:12:05,048
I gotta pack my things...

1229
01:12:05,151 --> 01:12:07,210
and I'd have
to get more money.

1230
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:08,685
Well, then tomorrow.

1231
01:12:08,788 --> 01:12:10,653
I'll go to the motel,
and I'll wait for you.

1232
01:12:10,757 --> 01:12:12,691
Just be there by noon.

1233
01:12:12,792 --> 01:12:16,159
Oh, this is just
all going too fast.

1234
01:12:16,262 --> 01:12:18,457
Justine,
what do you have to lose?

1235
01:12:24,504 --> 01:12:26,665
Nothing.

1236
01:12:26,773 --> 01:12:28,570
Well,
then be there by noon.

1237
01:12:33,947 --> 01:12:34,914
OK.

1238
01:12:36,516 --> 01:12:37,813
I love you, Justine.

1239
01:12:37,917 --> 01:12:39,885
This is all
gonna work out.

1240
01:12:39,986 --> 01:12:41,419
I know it.

1241
01:12:41,521 --> 01:12:43,011
Oh, geez, wait.

1242
01:12:43,122 --> 01:12:44,248
I almost forgot.

1243
01:12:45,858 --> 01:12:47,883
Here's a story
of your life.

1244
01:12:47,994 --> 01:12:49,757
You inspired me.

1245
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:02,371
Hey, Teeny.

1246
01:13:02,475 --> 01:13:03,567
Hey.

1247
01:13:03,676 --> 01:13:05,041
Getting worried about you.

1248
01:13:05,144 --> 01:13:06,042
Oh, I'm sorry.

1249
01:13:06,145 --> 01:13:07,373
Justine,
this is Floberta.

1250
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:09,209
Floberta,
this is Justine.

1251
01:13:09,315 --> 01:13:10,577
- Hi.
- Hi.

1252
01:13:10,683 --> 01:13:13,652
Congratulations
on your expectation.

1253
01:13:13,753 --> 01:13:15,277
Thanks.

1254
01:13:15,388 --> 01:13:16,787
Well, you think
it's a girl or a boy?

1255
01:13:16,889 --> 01:13:18,049
It don't make
no difference

1256
01:13:18,157 --> 01:13:19,215
as long as it
plays quarterback

1257
01:13:19,325 --> 01:13:21,054
for the Cowboys.

1258
01:13:22,895 --> 01:13:24,556
Well, I hear
Senor Tuna calling.

1259
01:13:31,004 --> 01:13:31,902
Yello.

1260
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:34,898
Yeah.

1261
01:13:36,909 --> 01:13:39,070
Well, it's not right.

1262
01:13:39,178 --> 01:13:41,908
What is that
supposed to mean?

1263
01:13:46,019 --> 01:13:47,418
Hey, look... No.

1264
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:48,817
You... No, you look.

1265
01:13:48,921 --> 01:13:51,116
You... You don't know shit, OK?

1266
01:13:54,127 --> 01:13:55,924
Justine's pregnant.

1267
01:13:56,029 --> 01:13:57,257
You got that?

1268
01:13:58,865 --> 01:13:59,957
Yeah, well, look...

1269
01:14:00,066 --> 01:14:01,624
you better check
your records again, pal...

1270
01:14:01,734 --> 01:14:03,292
then you call me.

1271
01:14:10,476 --> 01:14:13,377
Dumb doctor says
my sperm's no good.

1272
01:14:27,493 --> 01:14:29,654
Does that mean
Justine's not pregnant?

1273
01:14:32,332 --> 01:14:33,390
No.

1274
01:14:33,499 --> 01:14:36,525
It just means
they messed up, is all.

1275
01:14:36,636 --> 01:14:38,331
They don't know
everything.

1276
01:14:41,741 --> 01:14:45,177
They just got it wrong,
is all.

1277
01:15:09,369 --> 01:15:10,495
It looks like

1278
01:15:10,603 --> 01:15:12,537
that wind's
picking up again.

1279
01:15:54,414 --> 01:15:58,748
How it all came down
to this, only the devil knows.

1280
01:15:58,851 --> 01:16:02,252
Retail Rodeo was
at the corner on my left.

1281
01:16:02,355 --> 01:16:05,586
The motel was
down the road to my right.

1282
01:16:05,691 --> 01:16:07,181
I closed my eyes

1283
01:16:07,293 --> 01:16:09,625
and tried to peer
into the future.

1284
01:16:12,265 --> 01:16:14,927
On my left,
I saw days upon days

1285
01:16:15,034 --> 01:16:17,935
of lipstick
and ticking clocks...

1286
01:16:18,037 --> 01:16:21,097
dirty looks
and quiet whisperings.

1287
01:16:22,308 --> 01:16:24,538
And burning secrets

1288
01:16:24,644 --> 01:16:27,169
that just won't ever
die away.

1289
01:16:30,316 --> 01:16:34,275
And on my right,
what could I picture?

1290
01:16:34,387 --> 01:16:36,787
The blue sky,
the desert earth...

1291
01:16:36,889 --> 01:16:39,949
stretching out into
the eerie infinity...

1292
01:16:40,059 --> 01:16:42,653
a beautiful,
never-ending nothing.

1293
01:17:24,303 --> 01:17:25,827
Hey, Justine.

1294
01:17:30,276 --> 01:17:32,005
I know where
you can find him.

1295
01:17:32,111 --> 01:17:33,078
Holden?

1296
01:17:33,179 --> 01:17:35,010
He's at
the Motel Glen Capri...

1297
01:17:35,114 --> 01:17:36,775
and he'll be there
till noon.

1298
01:17:38,818 --> 01:17:40,342
You done good.

1299
01:17:40,453 --> 01:17:42,683
You're a good girl.

1300
01:18:26,198 --> 01:18:27,187
Hey.

1301
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:28,324
Hey.

1302
01:18:28,434 --> 01:18:30,163
What's going on
in the bedroom?

1303
01:18:30,269 --> 01:18:31,998
Looks like
a twister hit it.

1304
01:18:32,104 --> 01:18:33,662
Oh, yeah, I was, uh...

1305
01:18:33,773 --> 01:18:35,240
I was doing laundry.

1306
01:18:35,341 --> 01:18:36,740
I thought we'd been robbed.

1307
01:18:36,842 --> 01:18:39,072
A spokesperson
from the sheriff s office

1308
01:18:39,178 --> 01:18:40,202
will be joining me.

1309
01:18:40,313 --> 01:18:41,746
Why aren't you at work?

1310
01:18:41,847 --> 01:18:43,815
They gave me the day off.

1311
01:18:43,916 --> 01:18:46,942
This is Ken Rudolph reporting
from the Glen Capri Motel

1312
01:18:47,053 --> 01:18:49,453
where a standoff between
police and a local man

1313
01:18:49,555 --> 01:18:52,023
has just ended in bloodshed.

1314
01:18:52,124 --> 01:18:53,284
Police had been given a tip

1315
01:18:53,392 --> 01:18:54,950
that a man suspected
of burglarizing

1316
01:18:55,061 --> 01:18:57,222
a local Retail Rodeo
discount store

1317
01:18:57,330 --> 01:18:58,431
had been staying
at the motel.

1318
01:18:58,431 --> 01:18:59,523
had been staying
at the motel.

1319
01:18:59,632 --> 01:19:01,532
The man was
a Retail Rodeo employee

1320
01:19:01,634 --> 01:19:03,124
named Thomas Worther.

1321
01:19:03,235 --> 01:19:05,703
Worther allegedly began
brandishing a handgun.

1322
01:19:05,805 --> 01:19:09,002
He then fired one shot,
taking his own life.

1323
01:19:09,108 --> 01:19:10,973
Inside the motel room...

1324
01:19:11,077 --> 01:19:13,307
police say they found
$15,000 and a handgun...

1325
01:19:13,412 --> 01:19:16,245
Oh, man.
Retail Rodeo...

1326
01:19:16,349 --> 01:19:18,112
You know that guy?

1327
01:19:18,217 --> 01:19:19,912
Thomas Worther
was 22 years old.

1328
01:19:20,019 --> 01:19:21,111
Mm.

1329
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:22,847
That is all the information
we have at this time.

1330
01:19:22,955 --> 01:19:24,820
Of course,
details are rather sketchy.

1331
01:19:24,924 --> 01:19:26,824
We'll continue to monitor
the situation...

1332
01:19:33,165 --> 01:19:35,156
...a spokesperson
from the sheriff s office

1333
01:19:35,267 --> 01:19:37,167
will be joining me
in a few moments with an update.

1334
01:19:37,269 --> 01:19:38,793
But for now, I can tell you
what we know.

1335
01:20:30,089 --> 01:20:32,080
Attention,
Retail Rodeo employees...

1336
01:20:32,191 --> 01:20:34,125
this is Jack Field,
your store manager.

1337
01:20:34,226 --> 01:20:36,660
As most of y'all
know by now...

1338
01:20:36,762 --> 01:20:39,322
we lost another employee
yesterday.

1339
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:43,830
Holden was a thief

1340
01:20:43,936 --> 01:20:45,494
and a disturbed young man...

1341
01:20:45,604 --> 01:20:48,334
and what happened
was a sad thing.

1342
01:20:48,441 --> 01:20:50,671
Perhaps we can learn a lesson
from this tragedy...

1343
01:20:50,776 --> 01:20:53,006
like don't steal
and don't be disturbed.

1344
01:20:53,112 --> 01:20:55,740
The important thing
is to move on.

1345
01:20:55,848 --> 01:20:58,282
Life does, and so should we.

1346
01:20:59,885 --> 01:21:02,012
This one's for you, Holden.

1347
01:21:14,734 --> 01:21:16,463
I thought we were
gonna get a day

1348
01:21:16,569 --> 01:21:18,298
to grieve
and go to the movies.

1349
01:21:26,378 --> 01:21:27,640
What?

1350
01:21:27,747 --> 01:21:28,805
What is it?

1351
01:21:28,914 --> 01:21:31,109
I was just at your house,
and the mail came...

1352
01:21:31,217 --> 01:21:33,117
and Phil was opening letters.

1353
01:21:33,219 --> 01:21:34,652
And he opened this bill

1354
01:21:34,754 --> 01:21:36,654
from a credit card company.

1355
01:21:36,756 --> 01:21:38,917
And, fuck...

1356
01:21:39,024 --> 01:21:41,322
please don't tell him
about us, Justine.

1357
01:21:41,427 --> 01:21:44,123
Please. Please.

1358
01:21:44,230 --> 01:21:45,663
I love Phil.

1359
01:21:45,765 --> 01:21:47,926
I love him
more than myself.

1360
01:21:48,033 --> 01:21:50,661
Please have mercy on me.

1361
01:22:03,182 --> 01:22:04,774
Hey, Phil.

1362
01:22:13,058 --> 01:22:14,958
Have you been
sleeping around

1363
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:16,584
behind my back?

1364
01:22:18,197 --> 01:22:19,289
What?

1365
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:23,527
I said, have you
been sleeping around

1366
01:22:23,636 --> 01:22:25,035
behind my back?

1367
01:22:28,073 --> 01:22:29,267
Yes.

1368
01:22:35,147 --> 01:22:36,512
Why?

1369
01:22:45,257 --> 01:22:46,383
Why?

1370
01:22:49,762 --> 01:22:51,457
I don't know why.

1371
01:22:57,269 --> 01:22:59,601
Don't you love me?

1372
01:22:59,705 --> 01:23:01,468
Don't you love me
at all?

1373
01:23:01,574 --> 01:23:03,235
Yes.

1374
01:23:03,342 --> 01:23:04,934
You're the only
man alive

1375
01:23:05,044 --> 01:23:06,671
that I love.

1376
01:23:13,786 --> 01:23:15,686
Oh, God,
please don't tell me

1377
01:23:15,788 --> 01:23:18,120
it's not my baby.

1378
01:23:18,224 --> 01:23:19,987
It's your baby.

1379
01:23:21,627 --> 01:23:22,958
Are you sure?

1380
01:23:24,630 --> 01:23:27,793
It is. I swear.
I swear to God.

1381
01:23:31,403 --> 01:23:33,234
Who was he?

1382
01:23:33,339 --> 01:23:35,307
Oh, that doesn't matter.

1383
01:23:35,407 --> 01:23:36,806
Yeah, it does.

1384
01:23:39,411 --> 01:23:41,402
Was it someone from work?

1385
01:23:45,918 --> 01:23:47,681
Yeah, I know who it was.

1386
01:23:49,355 --> 01:23:50,913
It was that
Bible-study guy...

1387
01:23:51,023 --> 01:23:52,820
wasn't it?

1388
01:23:52,925 --> 01:23:54,256
That Nazarene.

1389
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:56,260
That's why you're
acting so spooked.

1390
01:23:58,030 --> 01:24:00,692
Yeah. It was him.

1391
01:24:05,804 --> 01:24:07,567
I'm gonna beat his ass.

1392
01:24:07,673 --> 01:24:08,901
Phil, don't.

1393
01:24:11,877 --> 01:24:14,710
Ah, you're getting
all swollen.

1394
01:24:16,949 --> 01:24:19,713
I'm sorry
I hit you, baby.

1395
01:24:24,890 --> 01:24:26,619
I'm sorry, Phil.

1396
01:24:39,238 --> 01:24:41,536
I need to get stoned.

1397
01:24:43,609 --> 01:24:44,769
OK.

1398
01:24:46,412 --> 01:24:47,709
Get stoned.

1399
01:24:49,415 --> 01:24:51,781
I just gotta escape,
you know?

1400
01:24:53,352 --> 01:24:54,250
Yeah.

1401
01:24:56,355 --> 01:24:58,255
Do you ever
feel like that...

1402
01:24:58,357 --> 01:25:00,382
like you gotta escape?

1403
01:25:01,994 --> 01:25:03,256
Yeah.

1404
01:25:03,362 --> 01:25:04,852
Yeah, I do.

1405
01:25:28,387 --> 01:25:30,412
What are those?

1406
01:25:30,522 --> 01:25:33,958
Fake eyelashes,
extra long.

1407
01:25:34,059 --> 01:25:36,118
J-Just do it
normal for once.

1408
01:25:36,228 --> 01:25:38,958
You want me to make
the other cheek purple

1409
01:25:39,064 --> 01:25:40,361
to even it out?

1410
01:25:41,967 --> 01:25:43,298
No.

1411
01:25:46,739 --> 01:25:48,639
Did you
hear about Corny?

1412
01:25:48,741 --> 01:25:49,969
He was going home

1413
01:25:50,075 --> 01:25:52,009
after Bible study
last night...

1414
01:25:52,111 --> 01:25:54,238
and 2 beefy guys
with painted faces

1415
01:25:54,346 --> 01:25:57,747
pulled up in a truck
and jumped him.

1416
01:25:57,850 --> 01:26:00,546
That's terrible.

1417
01:26:02,354 --> 01:26:03,321
Yeah.

1418
01:26:06,525 --> 01:26:08,720
That day, I read the story

1419
01:26:08,827 --> 01:26:10,454
Holden wrote for me.

1420
01:26:12,831 --> 01:26:15,766
It was kind of different
from the other ones

1421
01:26:15,868 --> 01:26:17,426
but kind of the same.

1422
01:26:23,275 --> 01:26:25,766
It was about a girl
who was put upon...

1423
01:26:25,878 --> 01:26:29,746
whose job
is like a prison

1424
01:26:29,848 --> 01:26:33,284
and whose life
has lost all meaning.

1425
01:26:33,385 --> 01:26:35,285
Other people
don't get her...

1426
01:26:35,387 --> 01:26:36,786
...new places
all the time.

1427
01:26:36,889 --> 01:26:38,584
especially her husband.

1428
01:26:43,062 --> 01:26:45,257
One day she meets a boy
who's also put upon...

1429
01:26:45,364 --> 01:26:48,299
and they fall in love.

1430
01:26:53,739 --> 01:26:55,832
After spending
their whole lives

1431
01:26:55,941 --> 01:26:57,806
never getting got...

1432
01:26:57,910 --> 01:26:59,810
with one look...

1433
01:26:59,912 --> 01:27:02,472
they get each other
completely.

1434
01:27:07,753 --> 01:27:09,653
That's my big baby.

1435
01:27:09,755 --> 01:27:12,121
In the end,
the girl and the boy

1436
01:27:12,224 --> 01:27:15,318
run away together
into the wilderness...

1437
01:27:15,427 --> 01:27:18,089
never to be heard from again.


1438
