00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:12,269
<i>I don't know whether you've ever
seen a map of a person's mind.</i>

2
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:17,165
<i>Doctors sometimes draw maps
of other parts of you,</i>

3
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:21,009
<i>and your own map can become
intensely interesting,</i>

4
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,949
<i>but catch them trying to draw
a map of a child's mind,</i>

5
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:29,954
<i>which is not only confused,
but keeps going round all the time.</i>

6
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:36,592
<i>There are zigzag lines on it,
just like your temperature on a card,</i>

7
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,897
<i>and these are probably roads
in the island,</i>

8
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:46,033
<i>for the Neverland is always
more or less an island.</i>

9
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,666
You idiot! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

10
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:52,210
No, it's okay. It's fine.

11
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,508
Get off the beach, you stupid moron!

12
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,081
What's your problem?

13
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:57,912
What do you think you're doing,
you clown?

14
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:00,144
Take it easy. Relax.

15
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:04,745
You're insane! Get that child off there!

16
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:09,320
- Right on!
- Yeah!

17
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:21,266
- Do you want to get wet?
- No! I don't want to!

18
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:23,137
You do. You love it.

19
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:47,523
Get off the windscreen,
you horrible little bug.

20
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,117
<i>I wouldn't be the first to say
that life is a journey</i>

21
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:49,957
<i>that must be traveled
no matter how bad the road.</i>

22
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:55,132
<i>When Artie's mother was alive,
the place didn't look like this.</i>

23
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:58,599
<i>The house was just
so much more welcoming.</i>

24
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,996
<i>Everywhere you turned,
Katy was there,</i>

25
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,702
<i>in the smell of freshly-picked
rosemary in the kitchen,</i>

26
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:08,571
<i>the tomatoes from the garden,
the vase of flowers in the window.</i>

27
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:13,615
<i>We miss that now. We do miss that.</i>

28
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,786
Stop washing your face?
Are you crazy?

29
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,518
<i>"...for Neverland
is always more or less an island,</i>

30
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,619
"with astonishing splashes of color
here and there,

31
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,131
"and coral reefs
and rakish-looking craft in the offing."

32
00:04:27,132 --> 00:04:28,695
Do you want to try reading
some of that yourself?

33
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,167
- Where, Mum?
- Here.

34
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:35,131
"You could say of them

35
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:40,202
"that they have each other's noises..."
Noise...

36
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,614
- Nose.
- "...nose and so forth."

37
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:51,352
- That looks good, Mum.
- I hope I've made enough.

38
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:56,594
- Katy, he's here.
- Look, Artie, it's your long-lost father.

39
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:57,755
Daddy!

40
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,127
- Hello, stranger.
- Hey, you.

41
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:07,964
- Daddy!
- Hey, cheeky bum. Here's your pressie.

42
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,100
- Welcome home, mate.
- Digby.

43
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,375
- Good copy.
- You like the piece on Nadal?

44
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,970
- How was the old country?
- Same old Wimbledon.

45
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,915
Strawberries with lashings
of English rain.

46
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:21,111
- Hi.
- Good to see you.

47
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,248
- Hiya, Barbara.
- Hi.

48
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,755
You shouldn't have gone
to all this trouble just for me.

49
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,689
As if.

50
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,489
- That got my name on it, Tom?
- Branded it myself.

51
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:32,030
All right, kids, let's have
an Olympic race. Line up here.

52
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:34,224
On your markies,
get your car keys. Go!

53
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,131
- Go!
- Come back for sunscreen

54
00:05:36,132 --> 00:05:37,993
...when you're done.
- Go, Eddie!

55
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,835
<i>And so we lived
happily ever after.</i>

56
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,137
- Come on, now.
- Gold, silver...

57
00:05:43,138 --> 00:05:45,409
<i>Now, you know that's not true,
don't you?</i>

58
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,070
Is this okay?

59
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:51,073
- You look great.
- But?

60
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,880
- But what?
- There was a "but" in your voice.

61
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:56,477
- You don't like it?
- I do. It's just...

62
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,888
Just what?

63
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,892
Well, it's a little black number.
What can I say?

64
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:02,460
What does that mean?

65
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,689
- I like this one.
- For God's sake.

66
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,129
Are you saying
you want me to change?

67
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,762
- No.
- Then tell me you like this dress.

68
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:11,827
All right. I'll tell you I love the dress,
but only on the strict understanding

69
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:14,429
that you know
I'm not telling the truth, okay?

70
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,835
Just tell me what you think of the dress.

71
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:20,675
I love that dress. That dress is fantastic.

72
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:24,081
Thank you. At last.

73
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,513
It was very good. Very...

74
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:29,746
Just picture it.

75
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,187
- I just find it does capture it...
- Sounds great.

76
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,060
But, you know,
I think it would be fantastic...

77
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,562
Excuse me. Sorry, sorry. Hi.

78
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,929
Hi. How are you? How are you?
We're just going to grab some air.

79
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,934
Thank you. Nice to meet you.

80
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:44,663
- What was that?
- Oh, my God.

81
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:47,968
You just saved me
from the most boring man ever.

82
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,446
My God, you're beautiful.

83
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,115
In a slightly spooky kind of way.

84
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,553
Katy?

85
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:19,633
These will be safer with you.

86
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,332
I'm so sorry.

87
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,193
Don't be silly.

88
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:00,972
- She'll be fine. I know she'll be fine.
- How do you know?

89
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:02,844
Well, I know
she won't let this defeat her.

90
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:05,645
- What, you know she's immortal?
- No, I'm just saying...

91
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,912
Digby, she's sicker than shit.

92
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,679
The cancer has rooted in her bowel

93
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:12,587
and grown through her body
like Russian vine.

94
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:15,388
She's got two tumors in her intestine,
three in her liver,

95
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,962
which means
it's probably spread to her lungs.

96
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,793
You don't have a clue
what you're talking about.

97
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,236
I'm so sorry.

98
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:04,973
It's okay, sweetheart.
Gently.

99
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:27,563
Hey.

100
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,200
You know how Mummy's been getting
more and more tired

101
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:37,265
because she's been so ill?

102
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:43,347
We think that soon, she's going to go
into a very deep sleep.

103
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:52,054
A sleep so deep that we don't think
she's ever going to wake up again.

104
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,994
We think she's going to die.

105
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,829
When?

106
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,332
Soon.

107
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:09,133
Will Mummy die by dinner time?

108
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:13,035
I don't know.

109
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,243
Will she die by bedtime?

110
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:23,382
I don't know, sweetheart.
None of us knows.

111
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,889
Okay.

112
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,605
Katy?

113
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:58,754
Katy?

114
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:03,958
I'm making Artie's lunch.
The way he likes it.

115
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,995
It's the middle of the night.

116
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,431
What?

117
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:16,132
Artie's in bed, sweetheart. He's asleep.

118
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,370
Oh, no.

119
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:24,104
It's okay.

120
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:05,886
Did Mummy die last night?

121
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,631
Artie...

122
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:18,969
See? See? I told you. I told you.

123
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,937
What did you tell me?

124
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:23,304
I told you Mummy would die last night.

125
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:34,480
Oh, my baby. My baby.

126
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,857
My baby. My baby.

127
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:33,008
<i>If you want to
leave a message for Felicity or Harry,</i>

128
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:34,978
<i>please speak after the tone.</i>

129
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:38,415
Flick, it's Joe.
I guess it's about lunchtime there.

130
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:40,041
Listen, could you call me
as soon as you get the...

131
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,346
<i>Dad?</i>

132
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,349
<i>- Harry?
- Hi.</i>

133
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,323
I thought you'd be away at school.

134
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:53,562
<i>Are you okay?
What is it you wanted to tell Mum?</i>

135
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:59,166
Katy passed away
in the early hours of this morning.

136
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,367
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

137
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,716
Could you tell your mother for me?

138
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,217
<i>Of course.</i>

139
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,516
Harry, can I call you back?

140
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:27,122
<i>- Are you going to be okay?
- Yeah, of course I am.</i>

141
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:31,926
I love you.

142
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,035
<i>I love you, too. I miss you, Daddy.</i>

143
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:16,877
- Daddy?
- Yes, sweetheart?

144
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:18,609
I want to die.

145
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:21,910
Do you?

146
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:26,789
- Why?
- So I can be with Mummy.

147
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:36,091
Don't worry, Daddy.
I'll stay down here with you for now.

148
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:39,368
Thanks.

149
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:44,165
- Take care.
- I'll see you soon, all right?

150
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:52,116
Come on, Artie,
let's get you into your jammies.

151
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:56,053
- Artie...
- Bea, leave him alone.

152
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,055
Let him run around if he wants.

153
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,122
Do you really need that?

154
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,791
Well, at least you should try
and eat something.

155
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,330
I can't do this.

156
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,689
Oh, God.

157
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:21,096
What's that you're drawing?

158
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:25,364
It's a man taking Mummy away
on the tray, and here's a tree.

159
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:34,972
Dada! Guess what?
Grandpa let me sit on the tractor.

160
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,036
Hey.

161
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:40,879
You want to go
and get your things together?

162
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:43,386
- Why?
- I thought we'd go away for a while,

163
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:44,989
...just you and me.
- Where?

164
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,319
I don't know, a road trip.

165
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:49,553
- What will we do?
- What do you want to do?

166
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:53,587
- Go to Splash Planet.
- We'll see. Go and get your stuff.

167
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:02,329
- Is this a good idea?
- I obviously think so.

168
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,177
Thanks for taking him.

169
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,646
- Where will you go?
- I don't know yet.

170
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,420
Running away is never the answer, Joe.

171
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,956
Look, he sees me as someone
who comes home after weeks away,

172
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,854
bringing presents.

173
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,593
We need to spend some time together.

174
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,631
- And afterwards?
- Afterwards what?

175
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:29,758
Well, when you need to work,
will you expect me to have him then?

176
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,269
- Not if you don't want to, no.
- No, that's not what I'm saying.

177
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:36,068
Bea, I left my other boy
when he was six to be with Katy.

178
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,972
I need to know how to talk to him.

179
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:40,068
I need to know how to comfort him
if he needs it.

180
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:41,874
Look, this isn't about a week
on the road, Joe.

181
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:45,212
I mean, this is not about sweets
and treats and God knows what else.

182
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:49,014
This is about structure and routine
and security.

183
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,180
I'm his father. It's my decision.

184
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,949
- I think you're making a big mistake.
- Wouldn't be the first time.

185
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,492
Give Nana a kiss.

186
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,127
- Bye, Nana.
- Bye-bye, darling.

187
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:06,795
Bye.

188
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:19,915
<i>All the wild horses</i>

189
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:29,093
<i>All the wild horses</i>

190
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:39,570
<i>Tethered with tears in their eyes</i>

191
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:50,505
<i>May no man's touch ever tame</i>

192
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:58,116
<i>May no man's reigns ever chain you</i>

193
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:02,718
<i>And may no man's weight...</i>

194
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:04,386
Can we get a car like that?

195
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,761
- A convertible?
- One without a roof.

196
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:08,231
Why?

197
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,996
So Mummy can see me in the car
and drop down messages to me.

198
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:16,435
Can we?

199
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:35,323
Hey. What are you doing? Stop it.

200
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,894
Artie. Stop it.

201
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,631
Artie. Stop it!

202
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:52,375
What is it? What's the matter?
Are you hungry? Do you want a drink?

203
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:55,371
Talk to me, sweetheart. What is it?

204
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:06,914
We'll go to the shop, okay?

205
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:09,858
We'll go to the shop
and I'll get you a juice and some crisps.

206
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:12,396
Yeah? Does that sound good?

207
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:16,966
Are you going to come in
and help me choose?

208
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:29,044
I don't want orange juice.

209
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:30,604
What are you talking about?
You always have orange.

210
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,014
I said
I don't want orange juice.

211
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:38,954
Artie... Artie, it's all right.
Look, there's crisps, okay?

212
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,855
You're hungry. Just eat some crisps.

213
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:45,729
Oh, for God's sake.

214
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:56,197
What can you do?

215
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:01,570
Pick him up. He's upset. Comfort him.

216
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:03,807
- Give him a cuddle.
- He doesn't want me to.

217
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,611
- Rubbish.
- Well, it's like he's having a fit.

218
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:08,084
You don't cuddle people
when they're having a fit, do you?

219
00:23:08,085 --> 00:23:10,352
- You're vile.
- True.

220
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:15,057
I couldn't leave him like that.
Talk to him.

221
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:18,221
The trouble is, it's not me he wants.
It's you.

222
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:38,312
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

223
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,343
That's all right.

224
00:23:58,403 --> 00:23:59,961
What are you up to in there?

225
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:03,638
Artie?

226
00:24:09,069 --> 00:24:11,106
Can I do it again, Daddy?

227
00:24:11,107 --> 00:24:14,418
- Oh, my God.
- Can I, Daddy? Can I?

228
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,984
Please, can I? Can I?

229
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,990
Yes.

230
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:25,023
Here goes!

231
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:27,728
Again! Again!

232
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,324
Hang on. Hang on.
You need some more water.

233
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:34,434
Big splash coming up!

234
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,250
Artie?

235
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:04,860
Sweetheart...

236
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:53,615
I'm the king of the rock!

237
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:07,124
Welcome back, travelers.

238
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,727
I think it's a chocolate...

239
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:12,861
- Here you go, mate.
- Thanks.

240
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:14,438
What's the second number?

241
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:17,373
Eat up, Daniel. Come on.

242
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:19,307
- He won't eat, Mummy.
- Digby.

243
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:22,903
- Thanks, Miriam.
- Okay. Back in a minute.

244
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,005
- Come on, bubby. Oh!
- You're going to love this.

245
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,414
Excuse, darling.

246
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:29,419
It's our little feeding ritual.
Come on, bubba.

247
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:31,978
There's some water in there.

248
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:34,990
Where's Daddy? Where is he?
There he is.

249
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:41,123
Where's Daddy? Look! Open up.
Whoa! Yeah!

250
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,928
Good boy. Good boy.

251
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,837
Oh! Look, Danny! What's Daddy doing?
There he is.

252
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:51,066
Good boy.

253
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:54,373
One more spoonful. Good boy.

254
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,279
I've only got two pairs. I'm here.

255
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:59,214
- How many have you got, Jason?
- Yeah!

256
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:03,082
"They didn't live
in the trees, like we did. They made..."

257
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:05,650
It looks like he's doing okay,
considering.

258
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:10,356
Yeah, but what chance
does he stand now?

259
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:14,121
- He's got you.
- That's what I mean.

260
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:17,131
Shouldn't the State intervene

261
00:27:17,132 --> 00:27:19,596
and make sure a woman looks
after little children?

262
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:22,336
Well, don't look at me.

263
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:26,037
I mean, I've got to do tricks on
my lawnmower to get my child to eat.

264
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:27,772
What do I know?

265
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:33,042
Artie, come on. I can't be late.

266
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,187
Artie.

267
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:42,555
- Great. Let's go.
- But I'm not dressed.

268
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:45,960
- I know. Why not?
- Because I haven't got any clothes.

269
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:47,794
Well, look on the line.

270
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,034
- Can I have a Mars bar?
- No, you bloody can't.

271
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:10,784
All we need now is
to get you to undress

272
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:13,948
straight into the washing machine
and the system will be faultless.

273
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:23,391
- Artie, eat your toast.
- It's got crusts.

274
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:26,403
- What?
- I don't like it when it's got crusts.

275
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:28,996
It's fine. Just eat it, okay?

276
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:31,042
You know what happens
when you don't eat.

277
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:41,042
This is my kangaroo, Nibbles,
and we rescue injured kangaroos,

278
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:44,447
and we keep him at home.

279
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,650
Mr. Warr,
don't forget the parent meeting.

280
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:48,851
Sorry?

281
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,417
In the hall after school
if you can make it.

282
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:55,828
And he eats kangaroo pellets,
carrots,

283
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:58,562
and we sometimes give him treats.

284
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:00,035
And Nibbles sleeps in a pouch.

285
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:01,333
We're talking about
our animals.

286
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,237
- Sit down here.
- And when they are older,

287
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:05,003
they don't need a pouch.

288
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:07,010
- Can he borrow your kitty?
- They go in a big yard.

289
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:11,310
And this one's still in a heated pouch.

290
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:17,448
All right. What about you, Lucy?
You want to talk about Tinker?

291
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:19,147
Well, I learned to swim,

292
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:24,025
and she teached me
and I done the doggy paddle.

293
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:29,022
All right. Your turn, Johnnie.
Who have you got?

294
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:32,160
This is my fish, and I like it

295
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:36,003
because it's looking at me right now,
for some reason,

296
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:39,475
and all my other fishes died.

297
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:44,947
Do you want to say
something about the cat?

298
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,746
Cat food looks better than it tastes.

299
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:57,586
All right, who's next?

300
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:07,927
- It's all there.
- Thanks.

301
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:09,997
It should be self-explanatory.

302
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:12,099
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

303
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:16,037
We might as well start with sport.
Joe, what have you got for me?

304
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,251
- No rush.
- First up, cricket. We're leading...

305
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:23,980
No, no. Not you. Joe.

306
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,782
Yeah, we're...

307
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:30,361
We're leading with

308
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:35,195
the Aussie touring party to India,

309
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:37,962
who were well
and truly stuffed in Jaipur

310
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,663
by the Rajasthan Academy XI.

311
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:43,431
- Good to have you back.
- Good to be back.

312
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:44,907
Okay, what's next?

313
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:02,116
Hi. Joe Warr. Sorry I'm late.

314
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,923
And thanks for sorting him out
this morning.

315
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:07,692
I promise you he doesn't eat cat food.

316
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:11,132
Well, not at home, anyway.
We don't even have a cat.

317
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:17,374
So, how do you think he's doing?

318
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:21,501
I know it's only his first day back,
but how does he seem to you?

319
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:24,478
- I'm...
- I mean, everyone grieves differently,

320
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,643
I suppose. You know, there are
some times where he plays happily

321
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:31,882
and charts his mother's progress
in heaven, and then other times...

322
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:39,721
At some point every day,
he collapses into a sort of coma.

323
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:42,425
Sinks to the floor and just lies there.

324
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:46,025
Half an hour later, he gets up
and carries on like nothing's happened.

325
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:50,598
He has some very weird moods,
but then so do I. So...

326
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:53,610
You do actually know
I'm not Artie's teacher?

327
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:55,001
Hmm?

328
00:31:55,546 --> 00:32:00,084
- I'm Lucy's mum. She's in Artie's class.
- Right.

329
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:02,348
I'm actually just waiting
for Miss West myself.

330
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:05,923
- But this morning, you were...
- I was just helping out.

331
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,981
- Of course you were.
- Yeah.

332
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,394
It's been a good term
and he's making really good...

333
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:13,327
Is that Miss West?

334
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:14,387
Mmm-hmm.

335
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,734
She's a different person altogether.

336
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:19,861
I know. Spooky, isn't it?

337
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:24,266
Right.

338
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:29,171
Well, I'll just join the queue, then.

339
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,684
Thank you very much.
Thank you for coming.

340
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:43,621
They're scribbling.

341
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:47,524
Hey.

342
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:52,130
- Are you sure you're not a teacher?
- Well, I do take them for art.

343
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,596
So, how did it go?

344
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:56,765
He seems to be doing
rather better than I am.

345
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:05,011
You know,
if there's anything I could do,

346
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,244
like, if you ever want me
to take him for you...

347
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:09,343
- Really?
- Yeah. Absolutely.

348
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:14,117
Three mouths are as easy to feed
as two, so... Be a pleasure.

349
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:17,591
- I'm in the buzz book.
- Sorry?

350
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,687
Here, give me your phone.

351
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,441
There we are.
Now we've got each other's.

352
00:33:42,078 --> 00:33:43,954
- Hey! What are you doing?
- That hurt.

353
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:48,149
You must never do that!
You never cross the road without me.

354
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:59,401
Come on, Artie. I said I'm sorry.

355
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:07,971
<i>- He's hungry.
- That's why I'm shopping.</i>

356
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:13,009
<i>It's a bit pathetic, isn't it,
both of you sulking like five-year-olds?</i>

357
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:16,518
<i>How long are you planning on
keeping this up?</i>

358
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:20,045
- I don't have any plans.
- Why don't you take him to Mum?

359
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,087
Why don't you ask for help?

360
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:29,592
We aren't meant to do these things
by ourselves.

361
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:33,862
He's got no one to go to
and say how mean you're being.

362
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:39,107
That's true. That is definitely true.

363
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:51,920
Hey, cheeky bum,
come up here and sit with me.

364
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,183
Come on.

365
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:59,354
- Now, you see that puddle?
- Yeah.

366
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,421
- You drive, okay?
- Okay.

367
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:02,829
- Are you ready?
- Yeah!

368
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,162
- Now, don't miss.
- I won't!

369
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:05,259
Let's go!

370
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:08,338
On your markies,
get your car keys, go!

371
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:18,414
Again! Again!

372
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:27,286
<i>Now, you don't need to
know anything</i>

373
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:29,883
<i>about biology or fluid mechanics</i>

374
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:35,091
<i>to deduce that Michael Fred
Phelps III is built for speed.</i>

375
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,134
<i>He just looks so racy.</i>

376
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:41,236
<i>If you ran your hands
over his naked flanks,</i>

377
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,170
<i>and, let's face it,
you know you want to,</i>

378
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:47,473
<i>his skin would feel
as smooth as his Neoprene wetsuit.</i>

379
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:52,073
<i>With his flipper feet and paddle hands,
his 6'7" wingspan,</i>

380
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,412
<i>he must surely be the result</i>

381
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:57,113
<i>of some devilish American experiment
in bionics.</i>

382
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:18,035
- Oh, hi. How was Sydney?
- Hey. Sorry I'm late.

383
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:19,838
- Hey, look who's here.
- Dada!

384
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:21,674
Give us a cuddle.

385
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:24,945
He's been great. Haven't you?

386
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:29,008
He's eaten really well,
and we washed Mac.

387
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:32,679
Oh! That's where he was.
I was looking for him everywhere.

388
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:35,953
Look, and he did these pictures
at school today.

389
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:40,363
I'll show you a trick.

390
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:45,033
- Thanks, Laura. I really appreciate it.
- Any time.

391
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:01,006
- Can I go and live at Laura's?
- What?

392
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,876
Can I go and live at Laura's?

393
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:07,917
I'll come back and visit you
so you won't be lonely,

394
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:10,426
but I'll live at Laura's and Lucy's.

395
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:18,129
You want to go and live there, do you?

396
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:26,441
Fine, but if you're going to go,
then you have to go tonight.

397
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:29,502
So pack your bag
and I'll take you back there.

398
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:37,652
Daddy, are you all right? Daddy?

399
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:07,416
So, what do you want to do?

400
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:10,078
Whatever you want me to do.

401
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,582
- What?
- Whatever you want me to do.

402
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:19,124
I want you to stay here.
I want you to live with me.

403
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:29,131
It'll get better. I promise.

What? Are you worried
he might not like your nibbles?

I've got nibbles, yeah.

So, this is your little brother.
This is Artie.

Hi, Artie.

- Long.

Well, let's get your bag.

443
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:39,687
- How's your mum?
- She's all right.

00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:41,628
- School?
- It's crap.

Wow!

446
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:46,035

- This is nothing.

muck. Hands up if you like cow pee.

Hands up if you like dog fart.
Hands up if you like me!

- No. I'm all right.

I'll make some lunch.

459

Hands up if you like cow pee.

Hands up if you like me!

461
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:03,843
I run a pretty loose ship.

462
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,745
Basically, I've found
that the more rules there are,

463
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:07,146
the more crimes are created.

464
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:10,845
So, fewer rules. Fewer but bigger rules.

465
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:13,948
- No interrupting adults...
- Why not?

466
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:18,219
- Very good. No swearing.
- Why?

467
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:19,989
- I don't like it.
- Why?

468
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:23,830
It's the mark of a limited vocabulary
and a sign of laziness and egotism,

469
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:26,734
which is why
it's a privilege reserved for adults.

470
00:43:26,804 --> 00:43:28,169
If it's a sign of a small vocabulary,

471
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:31,298
then how come
there are so many swear words?

472
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:36,277
Bloody, bleeding, buggery,
sodding, shitting, bastard,

473
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:38,110
...mother...
- Moving swiftly on,

474
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:40,746
as little lying and stealing as possible,

475
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:44,115
no fighting, except for fun,
no wanton littering.

476
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:45,177
Oh!

477
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:47,119
As far as possible, be polite.

478
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:49,125
Now, screaming insanely,

479
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:51,889
running round the house
making absurd and disgusting noises,

480
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:56,092
throwing water bombs at the windows,
all of these are actively encouraged.

481
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:59,602
Artie! In fact, really,
there's only one rule,

482
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,865
and that is you've got to do as I tell you.

483
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,440
It's just that I'm not going to tell you
to do very much.

484
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:08,672
The aim is something we like to call
hog heaven.

485
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:10,043
Okay.

486
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,274
Shit!

487
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:14,947
It's not funny.

488
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:24,087
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah. It's just so hot.

489
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:27,591
It's quite a shock, isn't it?
I remember when I first arrived,

490
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,633
but it's a great place
when you get used to it.

491
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:31,064
Yeah? Well...

492
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,832
"It has more things that will kill you
than anywhere else.

493
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:40,002
"Out of the world's 10 most poisonous
snakes, all are Australian."

494
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:45,607
You'll be all right.
Hope you manage to sleep.

495
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:17,106
No!

496
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,812
No!

497
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,689
No!

498
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:32,286
- Do you submit? Do you submit?
- No! No!

499
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:40,967
Geronimo!
I'm the king of the bed!

500
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:44,633
- I'm the king of the bed!
- Tag team. You and Artie versus me.

501
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:46,573
- Yeah! Yeah!
- No. I'll pass, thanks. That's fine...

502
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:49,441
Hey, you don't get away that easy,
big boy!

503
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:54,075
- Yeah!
- Don't! Dad, don't! Don't! Jesus!

504
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:15,763
Nice one.

505
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:18,970
Oh, my God. You've got to be kidding.

506
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:22,076
Good, eh?

507
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:25,204
- That is so high.
- I know.

508
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:27,882
- But if the wire breaks...
- Don't worry about the wire.

509
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:29,316
The wire's fine.

510
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,580
I'm trying not to think
of that branch falling on him.

511
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:35,681
- But, seriously, if he let go...
- That's why he's hanging on so tight.

512
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:39,091
- Nice one.
- Be careful!

513
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:41,994
I think you rather enjoy
upsetting mothers.

514
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,225
What gives you that idea?

515
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,432
- Only four weeks out of date.
- You've been eating them.

516
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:52,498
Here, here. Take this.

517
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:57,410
Sweetie, can you go
get the fairy bread?

518
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,881
- Shall I put them here?
- Yes.

519
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:02,510
- Hi. I'm Laura. Hi.
- I'm Barbara.

520
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,520
- Arthur's grandmother.
- Oh! Pleased to meet you.

521
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:08,686
- Is this one yours?
- Yes.

522
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:12,354
- She's very pretty.
- Thank you.

523
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:16,132
- Artie.
- Darling.

524
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,033
- Hi, Nana.
- Happy birthday.

525
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:20,864
Thank you, Nana.

526
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:26,070
Hey. Glad you could come.

527
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,812
He'll put someone's eye out with that.

528
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:31,279
The thing is,
constant warnings are maddening

529
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:34,112
for anyone aspiring to be an overlord.

530
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:38,045
- I would have done this for you.
- It looks good, doesn't it?

531
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:40,385
Well, if they eat this lot,
they'll be climbing the walls.

532
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:42,253
- Tea?
- Yes, thank you.

533
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,399
Where is Harry?

534
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:01,174
Why has he come here now,
do you think?

535
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:02,303
What do you mean?

536
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:05,848
Perhaps your ex-wife thinks
you're back on the market.

537
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:07,144
Thank you.

538
00:48:11,588 --> 00:48:14,557
I remember
Katy's seventh birthday party.

539
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:18,026
We invited the whole class,
30 of them.

540
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:21,130
They ran riot.
It was a complete disaster.

541
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:30,971
I still see her, in the street or...

542
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:35,107
And not like in a dream.

543
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:40,141
- Actually there.
- Me, too.

544
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:51,392
Everyone run around.
You've got to chase everyone, okay?

545
00:48:53,463 --> 00:48:55,624
- Three million!
- Three million?

546
00:48:55,732 --> 00:48:58,257
We'll be here for weeks.

547
00:48:58,368 --> 00:49:00,802
Get ready. I'm counting to 100.

548
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:06,104
One, two, three, four, five...

549
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:27,722
...99, 100!

550
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:31,599
Coming, ready or not.

551
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:36,197
Come on, little children.
Come to Daddy,

552
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:39,071
because I love to play
with the little children

553
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:41,633
and give them lots of lovely pressies.

554
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:45,045
For God's sake. You're going
to get yourself bloody arrested.

555
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:46,104
Aha!

556
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:49,916
I think I see one of the little darlings.

557
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:55,114
- Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.
- No, no, no, no. It's okay.

558
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:59,889
- You can't catch me. No, no.
- Come here, you horrible little goblin!

559
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:05,468
Boys, boys, look what you made me do.

560
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:10,096
You made me angry.
I didn't mean to shout at you.

561
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:16,244
Come
and find me. Come and find me.

562
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:20,273
I'm right here.

563
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:22,884
I think I know that little voice.

564
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,880
Gotcha!

565
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:34,190
Happy birthday, birthday boy.

566
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,743
"Just say yes"?

567
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:54,681
It has the power to change
the way you live.

568
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:57,253
- Really?
- It seems to work for us.

569
00:50:58,288 --> 00:51:02,782
- It's not just an easy way out?
- It's not easy at all. It's really difficult.

570
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:08,020
Our kids ask us to do a whole range of
unsuitable things and we just go, "No."

571
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:12,363
We don't even think about it.
That's the habit I'm trying to control.

572
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:14,996
Artie says,
"Can we go and swim in the river?"

573
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,905
I say, "No. I have to go
and buy some milk."

574
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:20,705
And you don't worry
about spoiling him?

575
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:23,211
No. It's what he needs.

576
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,271
You're a brave man.

577
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:29,150
- Thanks for everything.
- Bye.

578
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:15,595
Yeah?

579
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:18,663
What was that you were playing?

580
00:52:19,035 --> 00:52:20,662
Just something I made up.

581
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:23,068
- It sounded good.
- Thanks.

582
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:30,110
Do you and your mum
ever play together?

583
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,670
Sometimes.

584
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:36,676
I did love your mother very much,
you know.

585
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,057
Then why did you leave?

586
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:48,187
Married couples of my mother
and father's generation

587
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:50,062
stayed together
for the sake of the children.

588
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,397
We divorced for the same reason.

589
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:54,960
Are you saying you divorced
for my sake?

590
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:59,441
I thought it was because you got
another woman pregnant.

591
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,401
Well, there was that, too.

592
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:08,812
We had some dreadful fights,
you know.

593
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:14,889
I was no match for your mother
in combat.

594
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:23,030
It can't have been all bad. You had me.

595
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:26,159
No, of course not.
In the beginning, it was great.

596
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:33,001
Listen, there's something
I want to ask you.

597
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:34,509
Look, if you're imagining that

598
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:37,136
your mother and I would
ever get back together again...

599
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:38,714
Jesus, Dad.

600
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:43,044
Her boyfriend's just moved in,
for Christ's sake.

601
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:46,384
- Really? When?
- I don't know. A few months ago.

602
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:51,592
- How's that for you?
- I'm away at school mostly.

603
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:56,025
What's he like?

604
00:53:58,034 --> 00:53:59,399
He's nice.

605
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:07,169
Anyway, I just wanted to say thanks
for all your help today.

606
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:10,211
You were great.

607
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:51,185
It's a huge goal. It's a wonder-strike.
It's a wonder-strike.

608
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:55,280
- Don't want to play soccer.
- Why not?

609
00:54:56,192 --> 00:55:01,494
<i>Funny thing, isn't it? The minute
you think you're getting things sorted</i>

610
00:55:01,765 --> 00:55:04,563
<i>is the moment it all starts to fall apart.</i>

611
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:16,168
- There it is!
- The ball went the other way!

612
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,047
For God's sake.

613
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:26,479
Guys, guys, can you put your
dirty clothes in the laundry baskets?

614
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:29,319
Jeez! Do I have to do everything
around here?

615
00:55:29,392 --> 00:55:32,725
- Daddy, can I have some Coke?
- "Can I have some Coke," what?

616
00:55:32,796 --> 00:55:34,320
Can I have some Coke now?

617
00:55:34,397 --> 00:55:35,955
Can I teach you some manners, Arthur?

618
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:39,866
- N-O. Mind your own business.
- "Just say yes."

619
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:41,527
Put some bloody clothes on,
both of you.

620
00:55:41,604 --> 00:55:43,435
- Why?
- You know why.

621
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:45,872
- Laura's bringing Lucy round.
- Why are you so angry?

622
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:48,877
I'm not angry.
What makes you think I'm angry?

623
00:55:49,813 --> 00:55:52,247
- Hey, welcome.
- Hi.

624
00:55:52,315 --> 00:55:54,283
Hey, guess what.
One of our chooks had ducklings.

625
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:56,079
- What?
- Chickens that can swim.

626
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,351
- And fly.
- And shit on your head.

627
00:55:59,122 --> 00:56:01,955
- Can I come and see them?
- Of course you can.

628
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:05,517
- Drink? One glass? Family red.
- I've got some things to do.

629
00:56:05,628 --> 00:56:07,118
- I should get back.
- One glass.

630
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:11,790
- Leave those.
- Are you sure?

631
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:16,202
Absolutely. I've discovered
this amazing cupboard in the kitchen,

632
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:19,469
which not only stores the dishes,
it actually cleans them.

633
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:20,804
Really?

634
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:25,310
The housework has come
as a big shock, I have to admit,

635
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:28,681
even though I watched so much of it
over the years.

636
00:56:28,785 --> 00:56:31,982
The cooking, the cleaning,
the ironing, the shopping,

637
00:56:32,122 --> 00:56:33,749
hoovering the carpets
when they change color...

638
00:56:33,823 --> 00:56:35,688
How did you meet Katy?

639
00:56:37,127 --> 00:56:38,924
I interviewed her.

640
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:42,227
She was an equestrian.

641
00:56:45,435 --> 00:56:48,199
I met her at some horse trials
in England.

642
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:50,898
She was with the Aussie team.

643
00:56:51,007 --> 00:56:54,875
I made her pregnant,
she came back to be near her parents.

644
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:57,002
I followed.

645
00:56:58,281 --> 00:57:00,078
What was she like?

646
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:04,144
Uniquely endowed
with intelligence, rowdiness,

647
00:57:05,321 --> 00:57:08,256
sex appeal, energy,

648
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,526
and, as it turned out, cancer.

649
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:39,549
And then one day Lucy asked me,
"Mummy, what is dope?"

650
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:41,957
- And what did you say?
- I said,

651
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:44,186
"Dope is a special name
I like to call Daddy."

652
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:46,285
- What is his name?
- It's Bree.

653
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:48,922
Brie? Like the runny cheese?

654
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:53,162
I haven't heard that one before.
I've got to drive.

655
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:58,166
So, how are things since the divorce?

656
00:57:58,241 --> 00:58:00,971
Fine. He was a terrible husband

657
00:58:01,044 --> 00:58:03,945
but okay dad,
you know, now that he's clean.

658
00:58:06,549 --> 00:58:08,517
So, what is it you want?

659
00:58:09,853 --> 00:58:11,718
Something I can't have.

660
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:18,825
I mean, I've got plenty of people
I can do things with.

661
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:21,726
I've just got no one
I can do nothing with.

662
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:29,432
Hi.

663
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,739
We'd better be going, I think.

664
00:58:46,422 --> 00:58:50,324
- I never want to see Lucy ever again.
- What?

665
00:58:50,426 --> 00:58:51,723
She spoils every game,

666
00:58:51,794 --> 00:58:54,888
and she's always supposed to be
the big sister and boss me around.

667
00:58:54,964 --> 00:58:56,226
I thought you wanted to go
and live with them?

668
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:58,129
I don't anymore.

669
00:58:58,130 --> 00:59:00,868
Well, Laura's my friend. I'm not going
to stop seeing her on your account.

670
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:02,733
We'll see about that.

671
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:08,071
He's not upset because of Lucy.
It's because of you.

672
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:11,942
He had you all to himself,
and then I came along,

673
00:59:12,282 --> 00:59:14,512
...and now Laura.
- Laura?

674
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:18,118
She's a friend. Can I not have friends?

675
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:21,550
God, Dad, anyone can see
how much you fancy her.

676
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:28,188
Don't be so bloody precocious.

677
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:59,623
- You wanted a word?
- Yeah.

678
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:02,562
I see you've assigned coverage
of the Open to Digby.

679
01:00:02,632 --> 01:00:04,395
Yeah, yeah,
I just thought he could bring...

680
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:06,025
I want you there.

681
01:00:06,836 --> 01:00:08,326
I've done it for the last four years.
I just thought...

682
01:00:08,404 --> 01:00:11,669
Look, I cut you a lot of slack
when Katy was ill,

683
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:13,902
you know,
and then after she passed away.

684
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:17,002
- Three months, Joe.
- I know, and I appreciate it.

685
01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:23,746
Artie. Hey, cut that out.

686
01:00:24,821 --> 01:00:27,153
Sorry, he's a bit under the weather.

687
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,724
I want you there, Joe,
from the first point to the last.

688
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:32,283
I need my top sports writer covering
top sporting events.

689
01:00:32,362 --> 01:00:35,195
Otherwise, you're not
my top sports writer, eh?

690
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:40,228
Come on.

691
01:01:16,706 --> 01:01:17,866
I have checked all the airlines.

692
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:21,171
There's absolutely no seats
available for the boys.

693
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:23,940
Well, maybe I could drive.
What is it, seven hours?

694
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:26,345
Ditto hotels. Everything's booked.

695
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:38,356
So, those are done.
Now, what about this one?

696
01:01:42,265 --> 01:01:44,324
- Yeah, sure.
- That one there.

697
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:48,802
Excuse me.

698
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:53,900
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, how are you?

699
01:01:55,011 --> 01:01:57,275
Busy. We've got the winemakers here.

700
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:00,106
Listen, I'm in a bit of a jam.

701
01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:03,108
I was wondering if you might be able
to stay down at the house

702
01:02:03,109 --> 01:02:05,078
...with Harry and Artie.
- Hmm. When?

703
01:02:05,955 --> 01:02:08,446
Next week. I have to go away
to cover the tennis.

704
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,082
- This coming week?
- Yeah.

705
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:12,024
Shouldn't you have
thought of this before?

706
01:02:13,863 --> 01:02:16,195
Well, I've been trying to take them
with me, but it's not possible.

707
01:02:16,265 --> 01:02:18,028
Why don't you ask that girl
you're seeing?

708
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:20,262
- What girl?
- The one at Arthur's party.

709
01:02:20,369 --> 01:02:22,337
She looked perfectly at home to me.

710
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:25,704
One minute, Flick wants me back.
The next, I'm seeing someone.

711
01:02:25,808 --> 01:02:28,572
- Well, aren't you?
- No, I'm not.

712
01:02:28,644 --> 01:02:32,842
Look, we're really stretched here, Joe.
I can't go anywhere right now.

713
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:35,748
Well, is there any chance
they could come here to you?

714
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:37,648
Well, I don't know.
I mean, if it was just Artie...

715
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:38,948
You know what? Forget it.

716
01:02:39,021 --> 01:02:40,386
No, I'm not saying I won't take them.

717
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:43,118
- It's fine. Forget it.
- Joe...

718
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,390
Oh, please. Come on, Joe.

719
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:09,015
Artie, shoes, come on.

720
01:03:12,555 --> 01:03:15,991
- Hey. Listen, I...
- Hi. Hang on, I need the loo. Just wait.

721
01:03:32,074 --> 01:03:33,473
Artie?

722
01:03:38,247 --> 01:03:41,341
Defrosting. There's a dinosaur
in the microwave.

723
01:03:47,123 --> 01:03:48,954
Hog heaven becomes hog hell.

724
01:03:49,091 --> 01:03:52,424
Think of the Seven Dwarfs
before Snow White showed up.

725
01:03:56,032 --> 01:03:58,000
Does Harry never do
any chores around here?

726
01:03:58,067 --> 01:04:01,264
Not as such. Artie, hurry up.

727
01:04:02,205 --> 01:04:05,231
"Oh, please don't do that," he said,
handing her the rubber gloves.

728
01:04:05,308 --> 01:04:07,970
- You've got them on the wrong feet.
- These are the only feet I've got.

729
01:04:08,044 --> 01:04:10,512
Change them round, eat your breakfast
and wipe your mouth.

730
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:13,947
Oh, God. I have to change my shoes,
I have to eat my breakfast,

731
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:16,678
I have to go to the loo.
I have to do everything around here.

732
01:04:16,786 --> 01:04:21,086
Jesus. I'm turning into my mother.
It's not supposed to be like this.

733
01:04:21,157 --> 01:04:23,057
What did you want to ask me?

734
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:28,922
What are your plans for next week?

735
01:04:28,998 --> 01:04:32,161
- Why? What have you got in mind?
- I have to go away.

736
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:39,300
- Where?
- Melbourne. The Open.

737
01:04:39,408 --> 01:04:41,035
You want me to have your kids for you?

738
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:45,137
- The thought had crossed my mind.
- Well, Lucy's with her dad next week.

739
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:47,614
- Great, so you're free.
- Excuse me?

740
01:04:47,683 --> 01:04:50,846
What makes you think
I'm not seeing someone? Hmm?

741
01:04:50,953 --> 01:04:53,513
What makes you think
I'm not spending next week

742
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:55,955
having non-stop sex with my lover?

743
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:58,091
Are you?

744
01:04:59,028 --> 01:05:03,192
We seem to have skipped a couple of
crucial stages in this relationship, Joe.

745
01:05:03,266 --> 01:05:07,965
We haven't even been on a date, and
now we're a couple juggling childcare?

746
01:05:08,037 --> 01:05:11,666
The Seven Dwarfs before
Snow bloody White turned up.

747
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:14,574
- Just a joke.
- Yeah, well, jokes and crappy theories.

748
01:05:14,644 --> 01:05:17,943
All just excuses for laziness
and irresponsibility.

749
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:22,513
You drink too much
and you live like a pig.

750
01:05:23,286 --> 01:05:25,516
Artie, Lucy, we're leaving now.

751
01:05:26,322 --> 01:05:27,755
Bye, Dad.

752
01:05:29,492 --> 01:05:30,720
See you.

753
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:56,644
So, as far as the outside world
is concerned, I'm not here.

754
01:05:56,752 --> 01:05:59,084
I'm in Melbourne, so I don't want
anyone to answer the phone.

755
01:05:59,188 --> 01:06:00,348
Okay.

756
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:03,049
And I'm going to need some help
around here, Harry.

757
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:04,319
Okay.

758
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,447
<i>In Melbourne today,
Venus Williams</i>

759
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:28,005
<i>was comprehensively out-yelped</i>

760
01:06:28,084 --> 01:06:29,881
<i>by her sister Serena.</i>

761
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:33,752
<i>She ramped up the volume
with a series of shrieks, yodels,</i>

762
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:39,125
<i>bellows and bleats
to a record-breaking 103 decibels.</i>

763
01:06:43,866 --> 01:06:46,061
<i>For me, sitting in the Rod Laver Arena</i>

764
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:47,999
<i>with the sun having long since set,
and the heat...</i>

765
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:49,128
<i>Keep it up, Joe.</i>

766
01:06:49,129 --> 01:06:50,438
<i>I'm glad you saw sense
and got yourself there.</i>

767
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:53,031
<i>For a minute, I thought
I was going to have to let you go.</i>

768
01:07:02,985 --> 01:07:06,182
- 30-40.
- Deuce.

769
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:10,952
Can you grab the ketchup?

770
01:07:18,467 --> 01:07:19,525
That's so good.

771
01:07:40,089 --> 01:07:41,886
Don't answer it.

772
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:46,221
Hello?

773
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:50,127
- I said don't answer it.
- It's Digby.

774
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:53,457
<i>- Hey.
- Yeah, mate,</i>

775
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:55,434
<i>I thought you should know,
our esteemed editor</i>

776
01:07:55,504 --> 01:07:57,301
<i>has tickets for the men's final.</i>

777
01:07:57,406 --> 01:08:00,068
<i>- You'd better get your arse over there.
- Oh, shit.</i>

778
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:18,351
- Have you taken the rubbish out?
- Not yet. I will.

779
01:08:20,062 --> 01:08:22,189
Harry, you rarely get asked to do
things in this house,

780
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:24,129
but when you do, I want you to do them.

781
01:08:24,130 --> 01:08:26,024
Why can't it wait till morning?
It's dark out there.

782
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:29,071
- Forget it. I'll do it myself.
- I'll do it.

783
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:33,208
Here, I'll do it,
if it means so much to you.

784
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:36,005
Just leave it. I've got it. Christ!

785
01:08:37,379 --> 01:08:39,939
- Where do you think you're going?
- You said leave it. Make up your mind.

786
01:08:40,049 --> 01:08:43,075
Could you come back here
and help me clear this up, please?

787
01:08:44,887 --> 01:08:46,980
And take that stupid bloody hat off.

788
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:54,228
Oh, Jesus. Don't start crying.

789
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:56,560
You're such a bullying shit!

790
01:08:56,632 --> 01:08:59,123
Brilliant. Terrific. Well done.

791
01:09:02,004 --> 01:09:06,407
- You're a bullying shit!
- Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

792
01:09:45,047 --> 01:09:46,480
I'm really sorry.

793
01:09:49,084 --> 01:09:53,077
Someone said something about chores
and I fell for it. Stupid.

794
01:09:55,991 --> 01:09:58,551
I've been a bit stressed about work.

795
01:10:02,665 --> 01:10:04,064
I'm sorry.

796
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:24,708
You have to go, Dad.
You'll never get away with it. It's crazy.

797
01:10:25,721 --> 01:10:27,951
- I'll look after Artie.
- No, no, no, no.

798
01:10:28,023 --> 01:10:30,958
It's just a couple of nights. I can do it.

799
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,494
- No. Harry...
- Trust me. I can do it.

800
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:36,497
I promise.

801
01:10:40,202 --> 01:10:42,329
Remember, don't answer the door
to anybody.

802
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:44,838
You've got all the relevant numbers.
I'll have my mobile with me

803
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:46,397
...all the time.
- We'll be fine.

804
01:10:46,475 --> 01:10:47,806
Yeah, but call me
if there's any problem at all.

805
01:10:47,876 --> 01:10:49,241
We'll be fine.

806
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:51,669
Okay.

807
01:10:53,382 --> 01:10:55,714
- Bye, then.
- Bye, Dad.

808
01:10:55,851 --> 01:10:57,148
- Look after him.
- Go.

809
01:10:57,219 --> 01:10:58,743
Go, Daddy.

810
01:11:09,064 --> 01:11:10,998
- Thanks.
- Yeah. Cheers, mate.

811
01:11:26,649 --> 01:11:28,116
<i>So everything's fine?</i>

812
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:29,280
Everything's great.

813
01:11:29,385 --> 01:11:31,114
We're just having dinner,
and then Artie's going to bed.

814
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:34,348
- Good.
- Don't worry. Enjoy yourself.

815
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:36,048
<i>Make sure you lock up properly.</i>

816
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:36,954
<i>I will.</i>

817
01:11:37,059 --> 01:11:40,324
<i>- Okay. I'll call you in the morning.
- Night.</i>

818
01:11:42,598 --> 01:11:45,863
<i>From the United States
of America, Serena Williams.</i>

819
01:11:47,269 --> 01:11:48,736
Hey, Joe.

820
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:50,966
Hello, stranger.

821
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,905
I only get wheeled out
for the finals these days.

822
01:11:53,008 --> 01:11:55,772
- Oh, yeah.
- I don't know who to root for,

823
01:11:55,844 --> 01:11:57,835
long legs or big breasts.

824
01:11:58,314 --> 01:11:59,679
I suppose you could make a decision

825
01:11:59,748 --> 01:12:02,911
based on the relative strengths
of two extraordinary athletes.

826
01:12:03,752 --> 01:12:05,982
Breasts, isn't it? Got to be.

827
01:12:49,965 --> 01:12:51,523
<i>What's all that noise? Where are you?</i>

828
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,864
We're just down the beach
with some other kids.

829
01:12:53,969 --> 01:12:56,199
So, let me say goodbye to Artie.

830
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:58,468
<i>Hello?</i>

831
01:12:58,540 --> 01:12:59,973
See you later, alligator.

832
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:01,509
Don't forget your toilet paper.

833
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:03,805
<i>- Don't be too late. Night.
- Bye.</i>

834
01:13:10,285 --> 01:13:12,185
Shouldn't you be in bed?

835
01:13:12,755 --> 01:13:14,245
My dad's away.

836
01:13:25,267 --> 01:13:27,030
You want to hear my favorite joke?

837
01:13:27,102 --> 01:13:29,036
Why? Do I look like
I need cheering up?

838
01:13:29,104 --> 01:13:30,662
Maybe.

839
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:40,510
- You okay?
- Can I get in bed with you?

840
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:42,874
If you want.

841
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:49,958
There we go.

842
01:13:50,659 --> 01:13:51,990
What you got there?

843
01:13:56,031 --> 01:13:58,124
So, what are you saying?
Beers all round?

844
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:04,470
Hey, beautiful. Excuse me.
Excuse me, beautiful. Listen to this.

845
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:08,101
Do you know why you should
masturbate with these two fingers?

846
01:14:10,078 --> 01:14:11,602
Because they're mine.

847
01:14:14,316 --> 01:14:16,944
And they say
the age of chivalry is dead.

848
01:14:18,187 --> 01:14:21,088
- What's your problem?
- Never mind.

849
01:14:21,156 --> 01:14:24,125
- Who asked you anyway?
- No. Please don't make a...

850
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:29,822
It's all right. I'm sorry.

851
01:14:30,065 --> 01:14:33,125
"The boys on the island vary,
of course, in numbers,

852
01:14:33,202 --> 01:14:36,000
"according as they get killed
and so on, and when..."

853
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:40,406
Don't stop.

854
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:53,751
- What is it?
- Back in a sec. Just stay there.

855
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:02,995
Hey, let us in! Harry!

856
01:15:03,065 --> 01:15:07,024
Oh, God. I think
I've lost my bloody phone.

857
01:15:07,102 --> 01:15:09,127
- Does it hurt?
- Yeah, it hurts.

858
01:15:09,128 --> 01:15:09,993
Aw.

859
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,375
- I don't even know your name.
- Mia.

860
01:15:14,443 --> 01:15:19,142
- Hey, Mia. I'm Joe.
- Hello, Doe.

861
01:15:25,988 --> 01:15:29,856
beer in the fridge.
There's none in the fridge.

862
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:34,224
Hey, guys, I've found the booze.

863
01:15:37,232 --> 01:15:39,996
I don't like them being here.
Make them go.

864
01:15:40,068 --> 01:15:41,330
I'm going to try and do that.

865
01:15:41,403 --> 01:15:43,963
- Call Daddy. Call the police.
- That's what I'm going to do.

866
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:47,167
Go down to my room and shut the door.

867
01:15:47,242 --> 01:15:49,233
Hey, don't want you calling Daddy.

868
01:15:49,311 --> 01:15:52,007
Hey, I need...
Give me my phone back. Oh, no.

869
01:15:58,921 --> 01:16:00,946
Did you look on the floor
at the end of the bar?

870
01:16:01,089 --> 01:16:03,683
Okay. Thanks. No, there's no sign of it.

871
01:16:03,759 --> 01:16:06,751
Shit. My whole bloody life's
in that phone.

872
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:26,071
Come on.

873
01:16:32,554 --> 01:16:33,578
<i>Reception.</i>

874
01:16:33,722 --> 01:16:36,190
Yeah, are there any messages for me?

875
01:16:36,725 --> 01:16:38,886
<i>No, nothing, sir.
Can I help with anything else?</i>

876
01:16:38,961 --> 01:16:39,950
No. Thank you.

877
01:16:40,996 --> 01:16:42,623
I'll just get you to sign that one for me.

878
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:44,665
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

879
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:47,394
So, are you here for the men's final,
Mr. Walker?

880
01:16:48,904 --> 01:16:50,235
Joe? Joe!

881
01:16:53,141 --> 01:16:53,835
Airport, please.

882
01:16:56,945 --> 01:16:58,936
Oh, my God.

883
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:04,746
Artie? Harry?

884
01:17:12,594 --> 01:17:14,926
<i>Joe,
it's Barbara. Artie's here with me.</i>

885
01:17:14,997 --> 01:17:16,089
<i>Barbara, what's going on?</i>

886
01:17:16,164 --> 01:17:17,995
- Where have you been?
- Where are they?

887
01:17:18,066 --> 01:17:19,124
- What have you done to your face?
- Are they safe?

888
01:17:19,201 --> 01:17:20,964
Are they all right?
What the hell happened?

889
01:17:21,036 --> 01:17:22,401
I don't think
Artie should see you like that.

890
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:24,496
I mean, where were you last night?
We tried to get a hold of you.

891
01:17:24,606 --> 01:17:26,801
- Where's Harry? I need to speak to him.
- Well, Harry isn't here.

892
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:28,103
- Where is he?
- He's at the airport.

893
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:30,041
- What are you talking about?
- Well, he wanted to go home.

894
01:17:30,112 --> 01:17:31,670
He wanted to go back to England.
He was very upset.

895
01:17:31,747 --> 01:17:33,112
What do you mean,
"Go back to England"?

896
01:17:33,113 --> 01:17:34,846
Well, he had a return ticket
and he insisted.

897
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:36,941
I had a long talk with his mother,
and Tom's taken him.

898
01:17:37,085 --> 01:17:39,952
I mean, what the hell were you doing
leaving them alone in that house?

899
01:17:40,022 --> 01:17:41,683
Whatever possessed you?

900
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:43,883
Goodness knows what would have
happened if Artie hadn't called me.

901
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:45,960
Those kids from the beach
had overrun that place.

902
01:17:46,028 --> 01:17:49,395
I had to turn them out,
and thank God Tom was there.

903
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:52,360
Can you fetch Artie for me, please?

904
01:17:52,434 --> 01:17:54,527
No. I think
Artie should stay here with us.

905
01:17:54,603 --> 01:17:56,969
- Fetch him, please.
- Look, I could have called the police

906
01:17:57,039 --> 01:17:59,030
...and I could have called child welfare.
- I want my son.

907
01:17:59,107 --> 01:18:01,405
- Do you think they'd let you keep him...
- Artie.

908
01:18:01,476 --> 01:18:03,671
- No! Get out of that house!
- Artie!

909
01:18:03,745 --> 01:18:05,474
No, not in front of the boy! No!

910
01:18:05,547 --> 01:18:07,947
- Come on, we're going. We're going.
- No, get out! Get out of my house!

911
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:10,951
- You're not fit to be his father...
- He's my son, Bea!

912
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:14,854
You can't replace your daughter
with my son.

913
01:18:24,433 --> 01:18:26,993
- Did you hurt yourself?
- A little bit.

914
01:18:33,008 --> 01:18:35,772
- You all right?
- Walked into a door.

915
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:40,808
Pretty big one by the looks of it.

916
01:18:42,884 --> 01:18:45,375
Your boy got off all right.
It's what he wanted to do.

917
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:47,545
- How was he?
- Quiet.

918
01:18:47,689 --> 01:18:50,715
He said to tell you
he's sorry he let you down.

919
01:18:53,628 --> 01:18:55,926
Thanks for sorting things out
over there.

920
01:18:55,997 --> 01:18:59,228
It was Tigerwoman.
I just stood by the ute with the shotgun.

921
01:19:04,673 --> 01:19:08,803
- Nana was very upset.
- She misses Mummy.

922
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:11,878
We all do.

923
01:19:24,526 --> 01:19:25,686
Oh, no.

924
01:19:28,797 --> 01:19:29,991
Harry left his bear.

925
01:19:32,567 --> 01:19:35,866
- Is this bothering you, Daddy?
- No, sweetheart.

926
01:19:36,738 --> 01:19:39,070
Is this bothering you, Daddy?

927
01:19:40,809 --> 01:19:42,470
<i>- Hello?
- It's Joe.</i>

928
01:19:44,246 --> 01:19:47,044
<i>- You are unbelievable.
- Is Harry there?</i>

929
01:19:47,549 --> 01:19:50,040
<i>- He doesn't want to talk to you, Joe.
- Flick, I...</i>

930
01:19:56,424 --> 01:20:00,019
Artie, bedtime. Artie?

931
01:20:12,073 --> 01:20:13,370
Artie?

932
01:20:24,085 --> 01:20:25,484
I miss him, too.

933
01:20:32,594 --> 01:20:35,119
- Yeah, sure.
- I do my bit, all right?

934
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:37,926
Okay. Look after her,
and you know what,

935
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:41,526
...just make sure it's in the week, okay?
- All right. Okay.

936
01:20:41,603 --> 01:20:43,230
Come on, Lucy. Let's go.

937
01:20:43,305 --> 01:20:45,705
- Bye, Lucy.
- See you, Mum.

938
01:20:46,308 --> 01:20:47,798
- How was your day, sweetie?
- It was okay, Dad.

939
01:20:47,876 --> 01:20:49,241
That's good.

940
01:20:49,311 --> 01:20:50,471
Hey.

941
01:20:50,545 --> 01:20:51,534
Ouch.

942
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:56,041
- Is that the boyfriend?
- No, that's runny cheese.

943
01:20:57,152 --> 01:21:01,452
- Artie tells me he's going to England.
- It seems like the right thing to do.

944
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:04,356
- Maybe.
- What do you want me to say?

945
01:21:06,194 --> 01:21:08,958
Personally, I find nothing is often best.

946
01:21:09,464 --> 01:21:12,160
Oh, and, by the way,
there's another thing.

947
01:21:12,234 --> 01:21:15,431
- Sorry?
- There is no boyfriend.

948
01:22:10,992 --> 01:22:16,123
Artie. Can you see which one's me?

949
01:22:17,666 --> 01:22:20,931
- The one with the football, that's me.
- No, it isn't.

950
01:22:21,303 --> 01:22:23,066
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

951
01:22:24,039 --> 01:22:27,975
Mr. Warr? I've spoken to Harry.

952
01:22:29,511 --> 01:22:31,103
I'm really sorry.

953
01:22:32,047 --> 01:22:35,642
This is really rather awkward.
He doesn't want to see you.

954
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,779
- I see.
- He has games.

955
01:22:42,824 --> 01:22:44,416
- Right.
- We can certainly talk.

956
01:22:44,526 --> 01:22:48,121
- I have a few minutes.
- Not just at the minute, thank you.

957
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:50,856
Sweetheart?

958
01:23:06,281 --> 01:23:08,545
Where are you going? Artie.

959
01:23:08,917 --> 01:23:11,886
Harry! Harry!

960
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:14,046
- Artie, come back.
- Harry! Harry!

961
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:19,717
Harry! Harry! Harry!

962
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:26,432
- What are you doing here?
- We've come to see you.

963
01:23:26,501 --> 01:23:28,332
We want you to be with us again.

964
01:23:28,403 --> 01:23:30,871
- Look, I'm really sorry.
- I don't want to see you.

965
01:23:30,939 --> 01:23:32,099
Harry.

966
01:23:48,089 --> 01:23:49,681
Come on.

967
01:24:04,305 --> 01:24:05,465
Hi, lads.
What are you having?

968
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:06,871
Coke and a squash, please.

969
01:24:06,941 --> 01:24:08,238
Did you boys see Jones' tackle,
then?

970
01:24:08,309 --> 01:24:09,901
Yeah. He didn't get up
for a while.

971
01:24:09,978 --> 01:24:12,310
- What do you expect?
- Same as always, thanks.

972
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:15,547
I wasn't going to take on the fullback.
He looked like 30.

973
01:24:15,683 --> 01:24:17,947
You can't tell the difference
between him and their coach.

974
01:24:18,086 --> 01:24:19,485
I'll get these.

975
01:24:22,223 --> 01:24:24,157
We used to come in here
after games, too.

976
01:24:24,225 --> 01:24:25,988
That's 5.50, please.

977
01:24:28,163 --> 01:24:29,960
- Can we talk?
- Thanks.

978
01:24:30,999 --> 01:24:32,864
I'll see you in a sec.

979
01:24:36,004 --> 01:24:38,302
- Where's Artie?
- He's just there.

980
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:47,705
I'm really sorry about what happened.

981
01:24:47,782 --> 01:24:51,115
I should never have left you guys alone.
It was wrong.

982
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:55,280
And I'm sorry
that you didn't enjoy Australia more.

983
01:24:55,390 --> 01:24:57,085
I loved Australia.

984
01:24:58,993 --> 01:25:02,190
Well, that it wasn't everything
you wanted it to be.

985
01:25:04,199 --> 01:25:06,963
I need to ask you something

986
01:25:07,035 --> 01:25:10,971
...and I want you to listen to me.
- Of course.

987
01:25:11,506 --> 01:25:13,599
I mean, really listen to me.

988
01:25:13,675 --> 01:25:15,506
- I do.
- No, you don't.

989
01:25:17,745 --> 01:25:20,009
Okay, well, I'm listening now.

990
01:25:21,349 --> 01:25:23,283
Why did you leave me?

991
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:28,180
- When you went with Katy.
- You know why.

992
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:34,595
I fell in love with someone else.
She was pregnant.

993
01:25:34,662 --> 01:25:37,028
No. Why did you leave me?

994
01:25:38,299 --> 01:25:41,962
I mean,
why didn't you take me with you?

995
01:25:42,203 --> 01:25:46,003
I wanted you to take me with you.
I wanted to be with you.

996
01:25:47,242 --> 01:25:50,700
I can honestly say
the thought never crossed my mind.

997
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:57,975
You were so young, I thought
a child should be with his mother.

998
01:25:58,119 --> 01:26:00,314
- Didn't you miss me?
- God, yeah.

999
01:26:03,424 --> 01:26:05,085
But, you know,
there was this new baby.

1000
01:26:05,086 --> 01:26:08,121
- I was trying to get it right.
- So you just left me with her.

1001
01:26:08,122 --> 01:26:10,123
- With your mother.
- With my mother who hates me.

1002
01:26:10,198 --> 01:26:11,995
Don't be ridiculous.
Your mother adores you.

1003
01:26:12,066 --> 01:26:14,193
See? You don't listen.

1004
01:26:14,769 --> 01:26:18,261
I try and tell you how I feel
and you say I'm ridiculous.

1005
01:26:20,074 --> 01:26:21,268
I'm sorry.

1006
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:30,374
- I had no idea.
- How could you?

1007
01:26:30,985 --> 01:26:34,284
You were playing happy families
on the other side of the world.

1008
01:26:37,825 --> 01:26:40,726
- You never wanted me.
- No. That's not true.

1009
01:26:46,067 --> 01:26:50,003
- I'm sorry you feel like this.
- Yeah, well, deal with it.

1010
01:27:05,753 --> 01:27:09,086
- Harry's bear.
- We'll give it to him another time.

1011
01:27:09,190 --> 01:27:11,215
No, he's with his friends.
You'll embarrass him.

1012
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:13,589
But I want to give it to him!

1013
01:27:50,498 --> 01:27:54,025
Daddy, there's a car here
without a roof.

1014
01:27:57,405 --> 01:28:00,636
A convertible, like the one we need.

1015
01:28:01,409 --> 01:28:04,537
I must have been
awful to live with sometimes.

1016
01:28:04,646 --> 01:28:09,606
Daddy, I'm trying to read,
but I can't do all the words.

1017
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:14,111
Katy? Don't abandon us now.

1018
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:19,287
Daddy, I'm begging you.
I'm begging you with all my mouth.

1019
01:28:20,161 --> 01:28:21,890
Coming, sweetheart.

1020
01:28:26,167 --> 01:28:27,998
Where's that car?

1021
01:28:41,983 --> 01:28:43,314
Hi.

1022
01:28:46,187 --> 01:28:47,848
What are you doing here?

1023
01:28:47,955 --> 01:28:51,322
- We've been to see Harry.
- Yeah? How was that?

1024
01:28:52,026 --> 01:28:55,018
- Not too good.
- I'm not surprised.

1025
01:28:56,030 --> 01:28:58,624
- Why do you do things like this?
- Things like what?

1026
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:00,429
Well, who just turns up at the door?

1027
01:29:00,501 --> 01:29:04,062
- Have you got a baby in your tummy?
- Yes, I have.

1028
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:08,867
- My mummy's dead.
- I know.

1029
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:13,477
- Congratulations.
- Harry didn't tell you?

1030
01:29:14,148 --> 01:29:15,410
Not a word.

1031
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:20,444
Would you like
something to drink, Arthur?

1032
01:29:20,555 --> 01:29:22,079
What have you got?

1033
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:23,422
Why don't you come in
and we'll have a look?

1034
01:29:23,524 --> 01:29:26,721
- Don't you have a lesson?
- Just come in, for God's sake.

1035
01:29:26,794 --> 01:29:29,092
- Is Jason home?
- Just come in.

1036
01:29:46,114 --> 01:29:48,105
Thanks for seeing me.

1037
01:29:49,317 --> 01:29:51,046
You want some tea?

1038
01:29:56,290 --> 01:30:00,954
- God, I hated this school.
- Really? I never knew.

1039
01:30:02,130 --> 01:30:05,827
- Your name's on every board.
- It was awful here then.

1040
01:30:06,367 --> 01:30:09,063
- It's pretty awful here now.
- Really?

1041
01:30:13,007 --> 01:30:17,103
So, your mum's pregnant?
You didn't tell me.

1042
01:30:18,045 --> 01:30:21,139
- It's going to be a girl.
- That's nice.

1043
01:30:21,983 --> 01:30:24,952
It'll be cool to have a sister, won't it?

1044
01:30:30,057 --> 01:30:32,890
So, where do you fit in, do you think?

1045
01:30:35,196 --> 01:30:36,993
I'm not sure I do.

1046
01:30:40,601 --> 01:30:45,402
Okay, look, I'm going to take
Artie back to Australia,

1047
01:30:48,075 --> 01:30:53,308
but what we want, both of us,
is for you to come with us.

1048
01:30:57,018 --> 01:30:59,077
Come and live with us.

1049
01:31:01,989 --> 01:31:04,082
I saw your mum yesterday.
We had a long talk,

1050
01:31:04,158 --> 01:31:06,490
and she wants what's best for you.
She really does.

1051
01:31:06,594 --> 01:31:11,031
So, if you did want to come,
she will support that.

1052
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:16,027
Artie and I have talked about it a lot,
and it's definitely what we want.

1053
01:31:17,004 --> 01:31:19,029
He just adores you.

1054
01:31:22,877 --> 01:31:27,211
Obviously, it's a huge decision, so
you don't have to decide this second.

1055
01:31:27,648 --> 01:31:29,707
I didn't feel safe there.

1056
01:31:31,085 --> 01:31:35,078
- What, the 10 most poisonous snakes?
- No, Dad. You.

1057
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:38,921
You scared me.

1058
01:31:41,329 --> 01:31:43,263
That won't happen again.

1059
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:50,767
Whatever you decide, I promise, I'll be
a better father to you from now on.

1060
01:31:56,077 --> 01:31:58,068
I can't, Dad...

1061
01:31:59,981 --> 01:32:01,312
I can't.

1062
01:32:03,618 --> 01:32:05,085
All my friends are here.

1063
01:32:09,390 --> 01:32:11,221
It's not fair on Mum.

1064
01:32:17,164 --> 01:32:18,358
I'm sorry.

1065
01:32:30,511 --> 01:32:33,742
- So, when are we going?
- Tomorrow morning.

1066
01:32:34,348 --> 01:32:38,284
When is Harry coming? Daddy?

1067
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:43,122
He's not coming with us, sweetheart.
He's going to stay here.

1068
01:32:43,958 --> 01:32:46,290
He'll come for holidays and stuff.

1069
01:32:50,598 --> 01:32:52,122
It's your fault!

1070
01:33:35,042 --> 01:33:38,910
<i>Please do not leave
your luggage unattended at the station.</i>

1071
01:33:38,980 --> 01:33:42,074
<i>Luggage left unattended
may be removed without warning</i>

1072
01:33:42,149 --> 01:33:45,175
<i>or destroyed or damaged
by the security services.</i>

1073
01:33:45,319 --> 01:33:46,843
Artie.

1074
01:33:56,797 --> 01:33:58,025
Artie?

1075
01:34:03,804 --> 01:34:05,465
- Artie?
- Daddy!

1076
01:34:19,754 --> 01:34:22,279
Don't you ever check your messages?

1077
01:34:23,391 --> 01:34:24,915
We don't have much time.

1078
01:34:43,077 --> 01:34:45,136
You won't lose him. I promise.

1079
01:34:45,246 --> 01:34:49,080
The saving on school fees alone is
like five trips back here a year.

1080
01:34:49,150 --> 01:34:50,981
Thank you for saying that.

1081
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:54,181
Good luck with the baby.
Keep us posted.

1082
01:35:28,322 --> 01:35:32,122
<i>So, here we are,
a father and two sons,</i>

1083
01:35:32,123 --> 01:35:34,893
<i>surviving in a household
without women.</i>

1084
01:35:36,464 --> 01:35:39,024
<i>Like a year-long experiment
in a satellite,</i>

1085
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:41,398
<i>free from earthly influences.</i>

1086
01:35:46,540 --> 01:35:49,805
Harry, did you just wipe your face
with a dog?

1087
01:35:50,778 --> 01:35:53,338
Hey, wipe your face with your own dog!

1088
01:35:56,317 --> 01:36:00,344
<i>See the pyramids along the Nile</i>

1089
01:36:01,989 --> 01:36:03,354
<i>Watch the sunrise on a tropic isle</i>

1090
01:36:03,424 --> 01:36:06,882
<i>Given its inadequacies
as a child-rearing unit,</i>

1091
01:36:08,362 --> 01:36:11,126
<i>I like it.</i>

1092
01:36:11,565 --> 01:36:15,968
<i>It's Home Alone,
except there's three of us.</i>

1093
01:36:22,743 --> 01:36:23,937
- Gosh!
- Yes!

1094
01:36:24,044 --> 01:36:25,705
- I'm off.
- Take that, chuckles.

1095
01:36:25,780 --> 01:36:27,077
- I'll be back by 6:00.
- Out!

1096
01:36:27,148 --> 01:36:28,809
- No, it was in. It was in.
- Out.

1097
01:36:28,883 --> 01:36:30,851
- Referee?
- Six-five to Artie.

1098
01:36:30,918 --> 01:36:34,684
- Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
- Bye, then.

1099
01:36:35,122 --> 01:36:36,316
Bye, Daddy.

1100
01:36:36,557 --> 01:36:39,754
<i>You belong to me</i>

1101
01:36:40,995 --> 01:36:44,954
<i>I'd be so alone without you</i>

1102
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:50,994
<i>Maybe you'll be lonesome too...</i>

1103
01:36:52,673 --> 01:36:55,164
Come on.
Come on, Vegemite. Liquorice.

1104
01:37:00,648 --> 01:37:03,481
<i>I don't think
he brushes his teeth enough.</i>

1105
01:37:03,584 --> 01:37:05,745
I agree with you about that.

1106
01:37:06,287 --> 01:37:08,983
<i>Can't you get him to do it twice a day?</i>

1107
01:37:09,123 --> 01:37:11,557
Once a week would be an advance.

1108
01:37:11,659 --> 01:37:14,992
I can't understand
why they're so white, though.

1109
01:37:16,430 --> 01:37:19,365
Is he brushing them in secret,
do you think?

1110
01:37:21,402 --> 01:37:24,963
What about his hair?
When did he last wash his hair?

1111
01:37:25,039 --> 01:37:29,100
Well, they wash it when he gets it cut.
And I'm rigid about that.

1112
01:37:29,844 --> 01:37:33,336
He gets it cut twice a year,
whether he needs it or not.

1113
01:37:39,153 --> 01:37:43,055
- He seems happy.
- I'd say he is, usually.

1114
01:37:46,527 --> 01:37:48,222
God, he misses you.

1115
01:37:51,198 --> 01:37:54,395
- He still remembers me?
- Of course.

1116
01:37:55,970 --> 01:37:58,803
Don't ever think that we'll forget you.

1117
01:38:00,274 --> 01:38:02,504
You'll always be his mother.

1118
01:38:05,713 --> 01:38:08,147
- One more thing.
- What's that?

1119
01:38:08,249 --> 01:38:10,444
Will you do
one more thing for me, Joe?

1120
01:38:10,551 --> 01:38:11,882
Anything.

1121
01:38:12,820 --> 01:38:14,754
Buy that convertible.

1122
01:38:19,860 --> 01:38:20,986
I will.

1123
01:38:22,329 --> 01:38:24,524
And if anyone asks, I'll tell them why.
