1
00:00:36,262 --> 00:00:39,459
<i>If you're troubled
by something mysterious</i>

2
00:00:39,565 --> 00:00:41,965
<i>or a problem that's hard to solve,</i>

3
00:00:42,068 --> 00:00:45,504
<i>there's a place you can go
where you always find help.</i>

4
00:00:45,571 --> 00:00:47,630
<i>You just need to look for it.</i>

5
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:07,986
Not again.

6
00:01:09,055 --> 00:01:11,751
- Aren't you up yet?
- I'm up. I'm up.

7
00:01:20,967 --> 00:01:21,991
Whatever.

8
00:01:25,171 --> 00:01:26,229
Hey, Mom.

9
00:01:26,305 --> 00:01:29,502
Really, why do you bother
setting an alarm clock?

10
00:01:30,643 --> 00:01:31,974
Gotta go.

11
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:34,774
Too bad you don't have time to eat.

12
00:01:34,847 --> 00:01:38,977
Mmm, mmm. It's delicious.

13
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:43,755
- That's just mean.
- Have a nice day.

14
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:56,025
Oh!

15
00:02:06,445 --> 00:02:08,413
Oh, my shoe.

16
00:02:10,483 --> 00:02:12,576
Oh. Excuse me?

17
00:02:18,591 --> 00:02:24,860
The kingdom is gone,
yet the mountains and rivers remain.

18
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,128
And the castle is draped
in the vivid green of spring.

19
00:02:29,201 --> 00:02:33,137
Haru, we can see you sneaking in,
so just get to your seat, please.

20
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,298
Yes, sir.

21
00:02:36,475 --> 00:02:38,568
Busted.

22
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:05,695
Sorry.

23
00:03:12,307 --> 00:03:15,071
It's not fair.
First I have a bad morning,

24
00:03:15,143 --> 00:03:17,304
then everyone laughs at me in class.

25
00:03:17,412 --> 00:03:21,007
- Even Machida was laughing, wasn't he?
- Yeah, pretty hard.

26
00:03:21,082 --> 00:03:25,451
Why me? Why are all these bad things
happening to me?

27
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,047
Hm, maybe it's some kind
of weird omen, Haru.

28
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,455
Like your life is
gonna get a whole lot worse real soon.

29
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,619
Thanks. That helps a lot.

30
00:03:43,038 --> 00:03:44,801
That's odd. Never seen him.

31
00:03:47,642 --> 00:03:51,874
- Why worry about what Machida thinks?
- I just think he's so cool.

32
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,847
- Tell him.
- What if he has a girlfriend?

33
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:57,577
He does. A freshman. Really cute.

34
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:59,880
Then why tell me to flirt with him?

35
00:03:59,988 --> 00:04:02,752
I want a good laugh
when he blows you off.

36
00:04:02,824 --> 00:04:05,520
- You are terrible.
- Machida's not that cool.

37
00:04:05,593 --> 00:04:08,494
- My Tsuge is much cooler and...
- Careful.

38
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,237
- What was that?
- Cat burglar.

39
00:04:26,348 --> 00:04:28,179
Where's he going?

40
00:04:28,249 --> 00:04:30,740
Hey, dumb cat! You'll get killed!

41
00:04:35,323 --> 00:04:39,282
- Oh well, it's just a cat.
- This doesn't look so good.

42
00:04:46,534 --> 00:04:48,399
Ah! What is he doing?

43
00:04:48,503 --> 00:04:50,767
Haru, don't!

44
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,306
I should be there in...

45
00:04:57,545 --> 00:04:58,944
No way. What a catch!

46
00:05:06,621 --> 00:05:08,714
Hey, you stupid jerk!

47
00:05:15,163 --> 00:05:17,256
Oh, cat, that was close.

48
00:05:31,946 --> 00:05:36,974
That was quite a brave act
you performed. I am extremely grateful.

49
00:05:37,051 --> 00:05:39,281
I hope you are not injured.

50
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:45,417
I don't mean to be rude,
but I'm in a hurry.

51
00:05:45,527 --> 00:05:49,588
- I'll return to thank you properly.
- Uh, that's okay.

52
00:05:53,168 --> 00:05:55,261
Haru!

53
00:06:00,742 --> 00:06:02,801
Well, so much for your stick,

54
00:06:02,877 --> 00:06:06,176
but at least
you rescued that stupid cat.

55
00:06:06,314 --> 00:06:08,009
- It talked.
- What?

56
00:06:08,082 --> 00:06:10,016
That cat spoke to me.

57
00:06:11,686 --> 00:06:14,348
Hey, did you hit your head?

58
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:24,189
Mom, I'm home.

59
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:27,533
Watch it! Quilt on the floor.

60
00:06:27,602 --> 00:06:31,129
Oh my, this pattern's a disaster.

61
00:06:31,206 --> 00:06:34,300
Could you make dinner tonight?

62
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:36,070
- Hey, Mom?
- Hm-mm.

63
00:06:36,144 --> 00:06:37,907
Do you think cats can talk?

64
00:06:40,348 --> 00:06:42,612
Sure. Why not?

65
00:06:46,788 --> 00:06:48,380
What?

66
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:53,621
You've asked me that question before
when you were a little girl.

67
00:06:53,728 --> 00:06:56,788
You said, "Mommy,
did you know I can talk to cats?"

68
00:06:56,898 --> 00:07:00,493
- I said that?
- Yes. You don't remember?

69
00:07:20,188 --> 00:07:22,281
Hmm?

70
00:07:23,324 --> 00:07:25,019
Hey, what's wrong?

71
00:07:27,128 --> 00:07:29,722
Oh, you're pretty hungry, huh?

72
00:07:29,831 --> 00:07:32,231
Do you like fish?

73
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:35,393
They're really good. Here, try some.

74
00:07:36,971 --> 00:07:40,168
You're really dirty, kitty.

75
00:07:40,241 --> 00:07:43,301
Do you like the fish?

76
00:07:43,378 --> 00:07:45,437
See. I told you.

77
00:07:46,247 --> 00:07:48,408
You want some more?

78
00:07:48,516 --> 00:07:50,609
Okay, you can have them all.

79
00:07:57,525 --> 00:07:59,925
No, you don't need to
do anything for me.

80
00:08:00,028 --> 00:08:01,825
- Haru.
- Mommy!

81
00:08:03,264 --> 00:08:07,598
- What were you doing over there?
- I was talking with the kitten.

82
00:08:09,103 --> 00:08:11,765
So I asked you
what the kitten said to you.

83
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:13,636
And do you know what you said?

84
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:17,667
You said the kitten told you
that life is tough.

85
00:08:17,745 --> 00:08:19,838
I thought it was so adorable.

86
00:08:27,388 --> 00:08:30,585
So it looks like that actually happened.

87
00:08:30,692 --> 00:08:34,628
Let's forget about it, go to sleep,
and get up in time for breakfast.

88
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,413
Huh?

89
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,436
Uh...

90
00:10:34,148 --> 00:10:36,173
Uh, come over here.

91
00:10:39,887 --> 00:10:43,015
- Hm?
- Mm-mm. A bit closer.

92
00:10:49,697 --> 00:10:54,634
Please allow me to present our wise
and incredibly magnificent ruler,

93
00:10:54,702 --> 00:10:58,138
King of Cat Kingdom, the Cat King.

94
00:11:03,044 --> 00:11:05,137
That's me, babe.

95
00:11:06,114 --> 00:11:09,345
The cat whose life
you saved today was none other

96
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:12,511
than the king's only son Prince Lune.

97
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,679
Given the magnitude of the matter,

98
00:11:14,756 --> 00:11:19,193
the king would like to express
his gratitude to you in his own words.

99
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,455
Oh.

100
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:28,393
Thanks a lot, babe.

101
00:11:30,505 --> 00:11:33,633
A list of what you shall receive.

102
00:11:38,946 --> 00:11:42,313
Starting tomorrow,
that marvelous array of gifts

103
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,907
will be showered upon you.

104
00:11:47,655 --> 00:11:49,987
- Thank you.
- Mmmm.

105
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:52,317
<i>Ciao, babe.</i>

106
00:12:27,395 --> 00:12:29,295
Just a dream.

107
00:12:32,266 --> 00:12:36,168
No way. You don't know
anything about this at all?

108
00:12:37,705 --> 00:12:40,003
I have no idea. I just woke up.

109
00:12:40,107 --> 00:12:42,200
Then where did these come from?

110
00:12:49,016 --> 00:12:51,143
Haru, get down here!

111
00:12:51,252 --> 00:12:54,847
Look at this.
What has happened to our yard?

112
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:58,217
Those look like cat tails.

113
00:12:58,359 --> 00:13:02,125
Okay. I must be working too hard.
I'm going back to bed.

114
00:13:15,376 --> 00:13:18,072
Leave me alone!
Stupid cats!

115
00:13:18,713 --> 00:13:19,771
Huh?

116
00:13:19,847 --> 00:13:22,543
Hey, what do I do
with all the lacrosse sticks?

117
00:13:22,617 --> 00:13:24,710
Hi, guys. Gotta run.

118
00:13:28,422 --> 00:13:31,949
- What is that about?
- Does she have catnip on her?

119
00:13:32,026 --> 00:13:34,859
- Catnip? What for?
- Beats me.

120
00:13:36,397 --> 00:13:38,922
No pets on school property, young lady.

121
00:13:39,066 --> 00:13:41,296
No! They're not mine!

122
00:13:43,905 --> 00:13:45,770
What's going on?

123
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:49,601
Huh?

124
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:16,431
So it wasn't a dream. Those cats
from last night must be behind this.

125
00:14:16,504 --> 00:14:20,099
I'm starting to think
it was a big mistake to save that cat.

126
00:14:20,207 --> 00:14:21,731
Huh?

127
00:14:23,911 --> 00:14:26,937
Stick, cat tails, catnip, mice...

128
00:14:29,183 --> 00:14:31,617
- Haru?
- What?

129
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:34,085
Did you get the catnip off you?

130
00:14:34,155 --> 00:14:38,489
Oh, yes. Someone stuck some
in my pockets but it's gone now.

131
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:40,959
Wow, that's weird.

132
00:14:42,396 --> 00:14:44,990
Okay, I've got a big favor to ask you.

133
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:47,159
Can you do my cleanup duty today?

134
00:14:47,268 --> 00:14:51,762
Tsuge's got a big game and if
I don't leave after class, I'll miss it.

135
00:14:51,872 --> 00:14:53,339
Please, please, please.

136
00:14:53,407 --> 00:14:56,171
Oh, Tsuge.

137
00:14:56,277 --> 00:14:57,801
Yeah, sure, I'll do it.

138
00:14:57,878 --> 00:15:00,176
Thanks, Haru. You're a lifesaver.

139
00:15:09,957 --> 00:15:12,323
Come on, Tsuge. Go!

140
00:15:13,494 --> 00:15:15,257
Yeah!

141
00:15:15,363 --> 00:15:17,661
Yes! He's so cool!

142
00:15:43,324 --> 00:15:45,258
Careful. Watch your step.

143
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:46,724
Thanks.

144
00:15:47,495 --> 00:15:49,588
Ah... Hurt...

145
00:15:51,265 --> 00:15:53,358
Oh, look at the mess I made.

146
00:15:55,102 --> 00:15:56,797
Oh, I missed.

147
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,618
Who do I think I'm fooling anyway?

148
00:16:11,685 --> 00:16:13,778
There she is. Miss Haru! Miss Haru!

149
00:16:23,064 --> 00:16:24,429
Oh...

150
00:16:24,498 --> 00:16:27,365
You cats just never let up!

151
00:16:27,435 --> 00:16:29,903
Well, we're so glad that you're pleased.

152
00:16:30,004 --> 00:16:31,130
No, I'm not.

153
00:16:31,205 --> 00:16:35,198
How can that be? The whole kingdom
is working to make you happy.

154
00:16:35,309 --> 00:16:38,244
And we all agreed
that the gifts were fabulous.

155
00:16:38,312 --> 00:16:41,247
Don't you cats know anything?
I hate mice.

156
00:16:41,382 --> 00:16:44,840
I'm allergic to cat tails
and catnip does nothing for me.

157
00:16:44,952 --> 00:16:47,318
Oh, my my my my my.

158
00:16:47,388 --> 00:16:49,822
I guess we made a little mistake.

159
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:52,290
Well, this is embarrassing.

160
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:55,487
The king will not be happy
when he hears about this.

161
00:16:55,563 --> 00:16:58,054
I'm sorry. Did I hurt your feelings?

162
00:16:58,165 --> 00:17:00,793
I overreacted, didn't I?

163
00:17:00,935 --> 00:17:06,168
I've just been on edge recently.
Things have not been going well for me.

164
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,768
- What kind of things?
- I don't know. Everything, you name it.

165
00:17:10,845 --> 00:17:12,540
I'm shocked to hear this.

166
00:17:12,646 --> 00:17:17,208
But I suppose even pretty girls like you
have problems like everyone else.

167
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:22,085
- What? Stop. That's enough.
- It is nowhere near enough.

168
00:17:22,156 --> 00:17:26,786
The Kingdom of Cats has vowed not to
rest until you are completely satisfied.

169
00:17:26,894 --> 00:17:30,091
- There's more?
- Yes.

170
00:17:30,164 --> 00:17:34,760
How would you like to have a private
tour of the spectacular Kingdom of Cats?

171
00:17:34,869 --> 00:17:36,564
Are you serious?

172
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:39,798
I'm sure you'll love it there.
It's a marvelous place.

173
00:17:39,907 --> 00:17:41,898
Great food, fabulous scenery

174
00:17:42,009 --> 00:17:47,106
and the entire cat kingdom
is ready to welcome you.

175
00:17:47,181 --> 00:17:51,083
And that's not all.
The king is so taken with you,

176
00:17:51,152 --> 00:17:54,918
he has awarded you the most
valuable gift in the cat kingdom.

177
00:17:55,022 --> 00:17:59,118
You will become his daughter-in-law
and marry Prince Lune.

178
00:17:59,226 --> 00:18:00,989
Huh?

179
00:18:01,095 --> 00:18:03,962
Don't think
about trying to pull that one on me.

180
00:18:04,064 --> 00:18:06,498
There is no way I can marry a cat.

181
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,831
The royal family
thinks you're good enough

182
00:18:09,937 --> 00:18:12,701
and the prince is so cool.

183
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:16,066
- He's cool?
- Hm-mm.

184
00:18:25,753 --> 00:18:26,777
Hmm...

185
00:18:26,854 --> 00:18:31,018
Who knows? Maybe I'd fit in better
with a bunch of cats.

186
00:18:32,092 --> 00:18:34,583
You get to lie around all day,
don't you?

187
00:18:34,695 --> 00:18:38,893
- But of course.
- Eat all the food you want,

188
00:18:38,966 --> 00:18:43,494
take naps in the sun,
forget about all your problems.

189
00:18:43,571 --> 00:18:47,632
But me getting married to a cat prince,
that's just ridiculous.

190
00:18:47,741 --> 00:18:49,675
Right, cat?

191
00:18:49,777 --> 00:18:52,507
Fantastic.
We'll collect you tonight, then.

192
00:18:53,781 --> 00:18:56,306
No, I didn't agree to that.
Hey, wait!

193
00:18:58,586 --> 00:19:00,679
Ow!

194
00:19:00,788 --> 00:19:02,847
Oh, I hurt.

195
00:19:03,524 --> 00:19:05,617
Okay, think, Haru.

196
00:19:06,227 --> 00:19:08,320
You gotta do something about this.

197
00:19:08,562 --> 00:19:11,395
What can I do?
Those cats are relentless.

198
00:19:11,465 --> 00:19:15,458
They'll find a way to kidnap me
and I'll have to marry a cat.

199
00:19:15,536 --> 00:19:18,403
I now pronounce you cat and wife.

200
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:20,598
You may kiss the bride.

201
00:19:21,275 --> 00:19:23,334
No, no, I don't want to marry a cat!

202
00:19:26,146 --> 00:19:28,205
<i>Haru. Haru.</i>

203
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,049
What was that?

204
00:19:31,151 --> 00:19:34,814
<i>Haru, go to the Cat Bureau.
Find the Cat Bureau.</i>

205
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:40,950
Hey, come on. Who's there?
Who's messing with me now?

206
00:19:41,028 --> 00:19:45,089
<i>They will help you there. Look for
a large, white cat at the crossroads.</i>

207
00:19:45,466 --> 00:19:48,162
<i>He will show you the way.</i>

208
00:19:48,235 --> 00:19:50,328
A cat at a crossroad?

209
00:19:50,437 --> 00:19:54,032
<i>Find the white cat
and go to the Cat Bureau, Haru.</i>

210
00:19:54,174 --> 00:19:56,267
<i>You'll need their help.</i>

211
00:20:12,893 --> 00:20:14,861
Find the Cat Bureau.

212
00:20:17,031 --> 00:20:18,896
Never heard of a Cat Bureau.

213
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:23,035
Look for a large, white cat...

214
00:20:24,505 --> 00:20:29,101
At least it was a pleasant voice.
Maybe the white cat will be nice, too.

215
00:20:30,311 --> 00:20:34,577
That was one long, weird day.
I definitely need a break.

216
00:20:37,685 --> 00:20:39,744
What in the heck was that?

217
00:20:41,088 --> 00:20:45,024
Hey, you big fatso.
You cats keep freaking me out.

218
00:20:45,726 --> 00:20:48,524
Are you the big, white cat? Are you?

219
00:20:49,897 --> 00:20:53,424
Listen, cat.
I need to know where the Cat Bureau is.

220
00:20:56,503 --> 00:20:58,437
A voice told me to ask you.

221
00:21:04,144 --> 00:21:08,171
Must have the wrong person.
I mean cat. I have the wrong cat.

222
00:21:08,282 --> 00:21:10,182
Sorry I sat on you.

223
00:21:11,852 --> 00:21:14,446
- Wait. I'll show you.
- It's him!

224
00:21:17,124 --> 00:21:19,251
Wait a minute. Slow down.

225
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,875
Isn't there an easier way?

226
00:21:47,388 --> 00:21:49,515
Hey. Hey, come on.

227
00:21:49,623 --> 00:21:52,558
Guess I shouldn't have called him Fatso.

228
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:45,069
Huh?

229
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:59,551
Oh...

230
00:23:14,274 --> 00:23:16,367
Wow, this is one weird place.

231
00:23:42,169 --> 00:23:44,364
Excuse me, where's the Cat Bureau?

232
00:23:47,774 --> 00:23:51,107
Hello?
I need some help right now.

233
00:23:51,178 --> 00:23:54,113
I'm gonna get dragged off
to the cat kingdom.

234
00:24:09,997 --> 00:24:12,227
Could this be it?

235
00:24:32,252 --> 00:24:34,345
Enough, Baron. Turn it off.

236
00:24:34,488 --> 00:24:37,480
No one's impressed
with your cheesy light show, okay?

237
00:25:03,116 --> 00:25:05,584
Good evening. Welcome to the Bureau

238
00:25:08,989 --> 00:25:11,082
Wow, you're cool.

239
00:25:11,158 --> 00:25:15,288
Thank you. You're now in a world
quite different from your own.

240
00:25:15,395 --> 00:25:17,590
This is a refuge for creations.

241
00:25:17,664 --> 00:25:21,293
Whenever someone creates something
with all of their heart,

242
00:25:21,368 --> 00:25:24,235
then that creation is given a soul.

243
00:25:24,304 --> 00:25:26,738
Like me and Toto there.

244
00:25:38,552 --> 00:25:39,780
That's... That's...

245
00:25:39,853 --> 00:25:42,947
That is Toto.
A stone statue with a soul.

246
00:25:43,023 --> 00:25:46,322
I see you have a visitor today, Baron.
How unusual.

247
00:25:46,393 --> 00:25:49,089
Indeed. She's quite a fetching one, too.

248
00:25:49,196 --> 00:25:51,562
Did he say Baron?

249
00:25:51,632 --> 00:25:54,100
I am Baron Humbert von Gikkingen.

250
00:25:54,234 --> 00:25:57,203
The artisan who created me
gave me that title.

251
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,204
I'll just call you Baron.

252
00:25:59,306 --> 00:26:04,744
So, you say you're having trouble
with those cats from the cat kingdom.

253
00:26:04,845 --> 00:26:08,679
Yes. Yesterday I saved their prince
from getting hit by a truck,

254
00:26:08,749 --> 00:26:11,547
and now they won't stop
trying to repay me.

255
00:26:11,652 --> 00:26:13,381
- I see.
- Huh!

256
00:26:13,453 --> 00:26:17,753
Serves you right. Thought you'd help
the poor kitty, did you?

257
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,858
You should've minded your own business.

258
00:26:22,963 --> 00:26:25,090
Muta, what's your problem?

259
00:26:25,198 --> 00:26:28,929
This girl saved one of your own kind.
You should be grateful.

260
00:26:29,036 --> 00:26:32,233
Now she's in trouble for it, isn't she?

261
00:26:32,305 --> 00:26:35,433
So she was stupid,
that's all I'm saying.

262
00:26:36,943 --> 00:26:38,934
Where did you find her, Muta?

263
00:26:39,046 --> 00:26:42,709
At the crossroads.
She knew about the Cat Bureau.

264
00:26:42,783 --> 00:26:44,444
Hmm.

265
00:26:44,551 --> 00:26:49,079
A voice told me about it. I don't know
whose voice it was, though.

266
00:26:49,189 --> 00:26:51,214
- A voice?
- You're hearing voices?

267
00:26:51,324 --> 00:26:54,487
Check into a loony bin.
Don't bother us with...

268
00:26:55,362 --> 00:26:58,729
- Knock it off!
- You knock it off. Quit being so catty.

269
00:26:58,832 --> 00:27:00,356
Don't try that again.

270
00:27:00,434 --> 00:27:03,961
You guys, I'll just leave.
I don't want to cause any trouble.

271
00:27:04,071 --> 00:27:05,902
I didn't get your name.

272
00:27:06,006 --> 00:27:08,634
Haru. It's Haru.

273
00:27:08,742 --> 00:27:11,336
Well, Miss Haru,
please step into the Bureau.

274
00:27:12,979 --> 00:27:16,107
- Come along. Don't worry about them.
- Chicken wings!

275
00:27:16,183 --> 00:27:19,641
Can't you tell the difference
between chickens and crows?

276
00:27:19,753 --> 00:27:24,520
- Yes, I'm not the birdbrain here.
- I don't look like a giant marshmallow.

277
00:27:24,658 --> 00:27:28,094
- At least I don't have a bird brain.
- You already said that.

278
00:27:28,195 --> 00:27:33,292
- Go fry yourself, you big chicken.
- You already called me a chicken!

279
00:27:37,337 --> 00:27:39,430
This looks close.

280
00:27:40,941 --> 00:27:44,206
Wow, this place is beautiful.

281
00:27:44,277 --> 00:27:47,405
- Make yourself at home.
- Thanks.

282
00:27:49,015 --> 00:27:50,983
Milk with your tea, or lemon?

283
00:27:51,084 --> 00:27:53,177
- Milk, please.
- Good choice.

284
00:28:01,294 --> 00:28:03,990
You have great taste, Baron.

285
00:28:04,097 --> 00:28:06,327
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

286
00:28:09,536 --> 00:28:10,867
How cute.

287
00:28:10,937 --> 00:28:13,735
That's my own personal blend of tea.

288
00:28:13,807 --> 00:28:18,073
It's a little different each time,
so I can't guarantee the taste.

289
00:28:19,613 --> 00:28:22,047
Wow, that's the best tea
I've ever tasted.

290
00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:23,673
Then you're lucky.

291
00:28:23,784 --> 00:28:26,981
Just tastes like boiled grass to me.

292
00:28:28,455 --> 00:28:31,151
Tea is too refined
for your crude taste buds.

293
00:28:31,224 --> 00:28:33,124
At least I don't eat worms.

294
00:28:33,193 --> 00:28:38,859
Muta, have a seat and tell us
what you know about the Kingdom of Cats.

295
00:28:38,965 --> 00:28:41,024
It's a dangerous place.

296
00:28:41,134 --> 00:28:44,626
You shouldn't go there
if you don't believe in yourself.

297
00:28:44,704 --> 00:28:46,137
Good point.

298
00:28:46,206 --> 00:28:48,470
They said not only will they kidnap me,

299
00:28:48,575 --> 00:28:52,136
they're going to force me
to marry Prince Lune.

300
00:28:52,212 --> 00:28:54,544
So, do it. You'll be set for life.

301
00:28:54,648 --> 00:28:57,515
- Are you crazy?
- It might not be all that bad.

302
00:28:57,617 --> 00:28:59,141
That's ridiculous.

303
00:28:59,219 --> 00:29:03,178
- She won't know until she tries it.
- Now, then...

304
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:08,591
I've always entertained the idea of
paying a visit to the Kingdom of Cats.

305
00:29:08,695 --> 00:29:11,664
- Now is the time.
- Have a nice trip.

306
00:29:11,731 --> 00:29:15,132
- Hope you make it back some day.
- You're coming with me.

307
00:29:15,235 --> 00:29:18,261
Nah, I'll pass.
But thanks for thinking of me.

308
00:29:18,371 --> 00:29:21,306
Baron, you're not going to
take her there, are you?

309
00:29:21,374 --> 00:29:23,399
We can't leave her unprotected.

310
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:27,810
But if Muta wants to stay here,
he can keep an eye on her.

311
00:29:27,881 --> 00:29:31,817
No way. You can't leave her here.
I'm not baby-sitting.

312
00:29:31,885 --> 00:29:34,854
- Why? Are you busy at the moment?
- Not really.

313
00:29:34,955 --> 00:29:36,422
I'll just go home.

314
00:29:36,523 --> 00:29:39,014
- Hmm?
- What?

315
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:42,686
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
cause you so much trouble.

316
00:29:42,762 --> 00:29:47,392
Muta's right. It's my fault
for getting involved with those cats.

317
00:29:47,467 --> 00:29:49,867
I'll figure something out.

318
00:29:50,737 --> 00:29:55,231
Well, then, so sorry the Cat Bureau
couldn't be of any help to you.

319
00:29:57,077 --> 00:30:00,240
Ah... All right, all right.

320
00:30:01,381 --> 00:30:03,781
I'll watch the little baby.

321
00:30:03,884 --> 00:30:05,749
Good kitty.

322
00:30:05,852 --> 00:30:08,912
Then it's settled.
You can stay here with Muta.

323
00:30:08,989 --> 00:30:10,183
You sure?

324
00:30:10,257 --> 00:30:15,092
Don't worry about Muta. He complains
a lot but he has a heart of gold.

325
00:30:15,195 --> 00:30:16,184
Hmph!

326
00:30:16,763 --> 00:30:19,425
Hm... I see.

327
00:30:19,499 --> 00:30:21,592
So he's just a big softie.

328
00:30:21,701 --> 00:30:23,430
You could say that.

329
00:30:23,503 --> 00:30:25,562
And this is the thanks I get.

330
00:30:25,639 --> 00:30:29,166
Thank you for your help, Moo-ta.

331
00:30:29,276 --> 00:30:32,939
What? Moo?
Are you saying that I'm a fat cow?

332
00:30:33,046 --> 00:30:36,777
- No, you're just fat.
- I like this girl better every minute.

333
00:30:36,883 --> 00:30:38,282
I'm outta here.

334
00:30:38,385 --> 00:30:42,617
That's too bad. I was just going to
get out some angel fruit cake.

335
00:30:42,722 --> 00:30:46,055
- Where is it?
- It's in the upper-right shelf.

336
00:30:46,126 --> 00:30:47,923
Why didn't you say so?

337
00:30:47,994 --> 00:30:50,827
Our guest
deserves a proper afternoon tea.

338
00:30:51,932 --> 00:30:54,526
This calls
for some of my special mulberries.

339
00:30:58,038 --> 00:31:01,030
You're too much, Baron.
A tea party and everything?

340
00:31:01,174 --> 00:31:05,770
- Anything I can do to help?
- Yes, there is something.

341
00:31:06,246 --> 00:31:10,239
I need you to learn just one thing.
Always believe in yourself.

342
00:31:10,317 --> 00:31:14,720
Do this, and no matter where you are,
you will have nothing to fear.

343
00:31:15,855 --> 00:31:19,256
Baron, give me a hand
with this whipped cream.

344
00:31:19,326 --> 00:31:23,023
- You're going all out.
- Better believe it.

345
00:31:25,031 --> 00:31:27,693
Who knows?
Maybe this is the world I belong in.

346
00:31:29,369 --> 00:31:31,462
Hey, is that Toto?

347
00:31:36,443 --> 00:31:39,674
It's time to go to our kingdom,
Miss Haru.

348
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:44,580
You again!
No! Hey! Get away from me!

349
00:31:48,488 --> 00:31:50,547
Skip the tea.

350
00:31:52,826 --> 00:31:55,317
Don't let them take me away, please!

351
00:31:55,929 --> 00:31:59,160
Baron,
a bunch of cats are headed this way.

352
00:31:59,265 --> 00:32:01,165
- Oh no.
- A little late, birdbrain.

353
00:32:01,234 --> 00:32:03,998
Toto, give me a lift.

354
00:32:07,941 --> 00:32:09,602
Ouch!

355
00:32:10,276 --> 00:32:12,267
We had a hard time finding you.

356
00:32:12,345 --> 00:32:14,472
- Let me off.
- What?

357
00:32:14,547 --> 00:32:17,015
Careful, Miss Haru.

358
00:32:17,117 --> 00:32:19,950
Stop these cats.
I want off this thing now.

359
00:32:20,053 --> 00:32:24,353
Don't worry. You're just having
pre-wedding jitters, that's all.

360
00:32:24,457 --> 00:32:25,788
No, I'm not!

361
00:32:30,163 --> 00:32:32,723
She could've waited
until after we had cake.

362
00:32:32,832 --> 00:32:34,595
Ow! Quit that!

363
00:32:35,068 --> 00:32:37,263
Let me go. Stop it. It hurts.

364
00:32:38,004 --> 00:32:39,562
They're coming for me.

365
00:32:39,639 --> 00:32:43,336
- I said let me go.
- Okay, Toto. Now!

366
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:45,310
Wait. I take it back!

367
00:32:48,314 --> 00:32:51,249
Why did you let him fall?
You cats are terrible.

368
00:32:51,351 --> 00:32:53,376
You're gonna regret that.

369
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,448
Muta!

370
00:32:55,555 --> 00:32:57,750
We're over the weight limit.

371
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,753
- Toto.
- I see it.

372
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,278
Let me off this thing!

373
00:33:28,888 --> 00:33:30,412
Outmaneuvered.

374
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:35,186
- Get above the trees.
- Right.

375
00:33:45,305 --> 00:33:47,398
Now what?

376
00:33:52,078 --> 00:33:54,774
They're riding the wind.
Follow the lights.

377
00:33:54,881 --> 00:33:56,246
Got it.

378
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:11,488
Oh, that hurt.

379
00:34:11,564 --> 00:34:15,091
Where am I anyway?
I can't see a thing.

380
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:26,711
Muta. What happened? You're enormous.

381
00:34:26,813 --> 00:34:29,646
No, kiddo. You got smaller.

382
00:34:29,749 --> 00:34:30,773
Hm?

383
00:34:32,051 --> 00:34:33,848
Why's that?

384
00:34:33,953 --> 00:34:36,012
Because we're here, that's why.

385
00:34:46,766 --> 00:34:49,564
That's the Kingdom of Cats?

386
00:35:07,487 --> 00:35:08,977
That's it.

387
00:35:32,845 --> 00:35:35,109
Wow, there are cats all over the place.

388
00:35:35,215 --> 00:35:38,582
What did you expect?
It is their kingdom.

389
00:35:38,651 --> 00:35:40,744
Hey, you!

390
00:35:48,228 --> 00:35:51,061
Ah, it's so relaxing here.

391
00:35:51,164 --> 00:35:54,133
Hey, we have to find
a way out of here fast.

392
00:35:54,234 --> 00:35:56,429
- Relax.
- Listen, kid...

393
00:35:56,502 --> 00:35:59,494
I've never felt so at home in my life.

394
00:35:59,572 --> 00:36:02,973
Hurry.
You've got to get out of here.

395
00:36:04,877 --> 00:36:08,142
You must leave.
You don't belong here.

396
00:36:08,214 --> 00:36:10,341
Wow! You're beautiful.

397
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:12,850
Everything's better here.
Even the cats.

398
00:36:12,952 --> 00:36:17,548
Quickly. You don't have much time.
Please, Miss Haru, before it's too late.

399
00:36:17,624 --> 00:36:20,616
Wait a minute.
How do you know my name?

400
00:36:20,727 --> 00:36:22,820
Miss Haru! Miss Haru!

401
00:36:23,663 --> 00:36:26,689
- Huh?
- Oh, not him again.

402
00:36:26,799 --> 00:36:29,529
There you are.
I finally found you.

403
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:34,164
We seemed to have accidentally
dropped you upon entry.

404
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,300
Your fat servant
exceeded our weight limit.

405
00:36:37,377 --> 00:36:39,607
Fat servant?

406
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:42,307
No, this is Muta. He's a friend.

407
00:36:42,382 --> 00:36:46,842
That's nice. Come on. Everyone's
dying to meet their new princess.

408
00:36:46,953 --> 00:36:49,319
Fat friend, you can come, too.

409
00:36:50,123 --> 00:36:53,889
- I don't know about this.
- The king is waiting in your castle.

410
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,225
- My castle?
- The royal palace.

411
00:36:58,164 --> 00:37:01,327
- My castle?
- Well, soon enough.

412
00:37:01,434 --> 00:37:02,458
Hmm.

413
00:37:02,535 --> 00:37:04,833
Hey, where do you think you're going?

414
00:37:04,937 --> 00:37:08,373
The king's waiting for me.
It's rude not to say hi.

415
00:37:08,441 --> 00:37:11,035
Have you completely lost your mind?

416
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,635
- This way.
- Wait a minute.

417
00:37:13,713 --> 00:37:15,806
Can she come with us?

418
00:37:17,483 --> 00:37:21,180
- Who are you?
- I'm Yuki. I serve at the royal table.

419
00:37:21,254 --> 00:37:24,087
Oh, so you're employed by the king?

420
00:37:24,157 --> 00:37:26,990
She works at the castle.
You'll see her there.

421
00:37:27,093 --> 00:37:29,152
- Come.
- See you soon, Yuki.

422
00:37:29,862 --> 00:37:31,853
Ow, ow, ow! Hey!

423
00:37:38,237 --> 00:37:40,330
Poor Haru.

424
00:38:05,665 --> 00:38:07,997
Ugh, look at that. Creepy.

425
00:38:14,073 --> 00:38:17,804
Mmm, looks good.
My future daughter-in-law.

426
00:38:21,547 --> 00:38:23,708
Hmm.

427
00:38:23,783 --> 00:38:27,617
All right! Think I'll go
and have a look in person.

428
00:38:29,989 --> 00:38:32,981
Hm. Why does that fatso
seem so familiar?

429
00:38:46,706 --> 00:38:49,800
You'll need to change
before meeting the king.

430
00:38:49,909 --> 00:38:51,774
I get new clothes?

431
00:38:51,844 --> 00:38:54,574
- Please wait here, sir.
- I'm the baby-sitter.

432
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,944
- Back off.
- What's your problem?

433
00:38:57,049 --> 00:39:00,177
Help yourself to refreshments
while you wait.

434
00:39:00,253 --> 00:39:02,312
Yeah, okay, I'll wait.

435
00:39:08,161 --> 00:39:09,355
Oh...

436
00:39:09,429 --> 00:39:11,795
Hey, not bad.

437
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,532
Miss Haru, you're so lucky.

438
00:39:16,602 --> 00:39:19,799
Every girl in the cat kingdom
has a crush on Prince Lune.

439
00:39:19,906 --> 00:39:22,636
I'm sure you'll be very happy together.

440
00:39:22,742 --> 00:39:26,803
You think?
No, wait. I don't think I wanna do this.

441
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,681
Wow, don't you look good.

442
00:39:30,783 --> 00:39:33,752
Welcome to the royal family, babe.

443
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:39,883
Hmm.

444
00:39:44,096 --> 00:39:45,529
Mmm.

445
00:39:55,441 --> 00:39:59,377
- Tell me, who is that cat?
- I believe his name is Muta.

446
00:39:59,445 --> 00:40:01,504
Muta?

447
00:40:02,315 --> 00:40:04,408
Never heard that name.

448
00:40:07,186 --> 00:40:10,053
No match for my stomach.

449
00:40:11,324 --> 00:40:13,417
Hmm...

450
00:40:14,861 --> 00:40:19,992
King, I'm really flattered by all this
but I don't want to get married.

451
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:24,058
You what? I was told
you had already consented.

452
00:40:24,136 --> 00:40:27,128
She has consented.
That's what I was told.

453
00:40:27,441 --> 00:40:32,174
- What does the prince say?
- He is away on official business.

454
00:40:34,281 --> 00:40:37,478
Look, first of all,
we don't really know each other

455
00:40:37,551 --> 00:40:39,712
and second of all, he's a cat, right?

456
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:42,254
And I'm not.
So, clearly, I can't marry him.

457
00:40:42,355 --> 00:40:44,448
- Huh?
- Huh?

458
00:40:47,327 --> 00:40:49,591
That has already been taken care of.

459
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:52,523
You're half cat already.

460
00:40:58,038 --> 00:40:59,699
Oh...

461
00:40:59,806 --> 00:41:02,331
See, Miss Haru?

462
00:41:04,644 --> 00:41:06,737
Look at that. I'm a cat.

463
00:41:16,456 --> 00:41:18,287
Muta!

464
00:41:21,394 --> 00:41:23,487
Muta, what happened?

465
00:41:25,132 --> 00:41:29,762
He had a weakness for catnip jelly.
He saw the bowl and dove right in.

466
00:41:29,836 --> 00:41:34,364
Muta, you weren't supposed to die.
It's all my fault.

467
00:41:34,441 --> 00:41:37,137
Don't leave me like this, Muta.

468
00:41:38,178 --> 00:41:40,408
Time for the celebration.

469
00:41:40,514 --> 00:41:42,448
No, I won't leave him!

470
00:41:42,549 --> 00:41:44,642
Then we'll bring him with us.

471
00:41:57,197 --> 00:42:00,792
- That's Prince Lune's bride.
- She has lovely fur.

472
00:42:00,901 --> 00:42:03,131
And such delicate paws.

473
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,404
I hear you don't care for mice

474
00:42:09,476 --> 00:42:13,674
but I bet you can't resist
my juicy, raw fish, huh?

475
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:16,408
I'm not sure she's enjoying herself.

476
00:42:16,516 --> 00:42:20,452
- How about some entertainment?
- Excellent suggestion.

477
00:42:49,516 --> 00:42:51,984
- Not entertaining enough.
- Yes, sire.

478
00:43:27,254 --> 00:43:28,744
Next.

479
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:59,447
Whoever's next better not stink. Got it?

480
00:44:18,138 --> 00:44:21,835
Your Majesty, I promise that I will
make the young lady smile.

481
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:26,873
- Shall we try him?
- Sure. Why not?

482
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:32,551
Huh?

483
00:44:32,619 --> 00:44:35,645
Excuse me.
Would you care to dance?

484
00:44:36,222 --> 00:44:38,281
Oh no, I'm a meow-sy dancer.

485
00:44:39,492 --> 00:44:41,585
Now I'm starting to talk like a cat.

486
00:44:43,663 --> 00:44:45,528
Just trust me.

487
00:45:30,276 --> 00:45:33,211
Well, she seems to be entertained now.

488
00:45:45,692 --> 00:45:47,717
<i>What's happening to me?</i>

489
00:45:48,561 --> 00:45:50,791
<i>I've never felt like this before.</i>

490
00:45:51,631 --> 00:45:53,758
<i>Maybe life as a cat wouldn't be so bad.</i>

491
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:59,772
Careful, Haru. Don't lose yourself.

492
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:00,999
Huh?

493
00:46:01,107 --> 00:46:03,166
Believe in who you are.

494
00:46:10,717 --> 00:46:13,151
I said so before, didn't I?

495
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:15,920
Then you must be...

496
00:46:19,592 --> 00:46:21,685
Stop right there, pal!

497
00:46:31,271 --> 00:46:34,035
You're not from my kingdom, are you?

498
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:36,665
Exactly who are you?

499
00:46:38,178 --> 00:46:41,204
How rude of me.
I should have introduced myself.

500
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:46,010
I am exactly who I appear to be.

501
00:46:52,826 --> 00:46:56,956
I am Baron Humbert von Gikkingen
and I have come for Haru.

502
00:46:57,063 --> 00:46:58,291
Baron!

503
00:46:58,364 --> 00:47:01,492
- He's so cool.
- He is handsome.

504
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:03,968
He can't have her. Seize them!

505
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:20,052
I'm stuffed.

506
00:47:22,088 --> 00:47:24,181
Muta? You're still alive!

507
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:29,323
- Oh no!
- Give me back my daughter-in-law.

508
00:47:29,896 --> 00:47:32,330
Quickly,
get His Majesty to a safe place.

509
00:47:36,536 --> 00:47:40,495
Emergency exit for all guests
right here, please. Enjoy your day.

510
00:47:48,882 --> 00:47:51,442
Great technique, Muta.

511
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:53,610
I just lost my balance.

512
00:47:55,155 --> 00:47:57,214
Over here.

513
00:47:58,958 --> 00:48:00,585
Yuki, you're here.

514
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:04,027
I'm so thankful
you were able to help Miss Haru, Baron.

515
00:48:04,097 --> 00:48:05,587
Do we know each other?

516
00:48:05,698 --> 00:48:08,360
Many of us here
know of you and your bureau.

517
00:48:08,434 --> 00:48:12,996
Yuki, I'm an idiot. I should've left
when you told me to. Now look at me.

518
00:48:13,072 --> 00:48:17,406
If you leave here by dawn,
you can still turn back into a human.

519
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:18,671
I will?

520
00:48:18,745 --> 00:48:21,111
This will get you outside the castle.

521
00:48:21,214 --> 00:48:24,411
- Perfect.
- Wait. Where's Muta?

522
00:48:31,891 --> 00:48:33,415
Hmm.

523
00:48:33,526 --> 00:48:36,689
He'll be fine.
We just need to get you home.

524
00:48:46,773 --> 00:48:48,502
The back of the castle.

525
00:48:48,575 --> 00:48:51,669
The door to your world
is at the top of that tower.

526
00:48:51,778 --> 00:48:53,905
You've got to be kidding me?

527
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:57,677
And the only way to get to the tower
is through the king's maze.

528
00:48:57,784 --> 00:48:59,684
Naturally.

529
00:48:59,786 --> 00:49:03,586
Good luck.
And, Baron, take good care of Haru.

530
00:49:03,656 --> 00:49:05,453
Hey, wait.

531
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:09,052
She's already gone.
I didn't have a chance to thank her.

532
00:49:09,162 --> 00:49:11,858
Haru, does her voice
sound familiar to you?

533
00:49:11,965 --> 00:49:15,958
Is it possible that she told you
to seek help at the Cat Bureau?

534
00:49:16,035 --> 00:49:20,768
<i>Haru, go to the Cat Bureau.
You must find the Cat Bureau.</i>

535
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:23,536
You're right.
That was her voice.

536
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:26,044
But why help me?

537
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:32,481
Ah! Ah! Ah!

538
00:49:37,223 --> 00:49:40,750
Whose idea was it to leave without me?
I nearly got killed.

539
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:43,488
This is no time for finger pointing.

540
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:47,825
You're leaving me again?

541
00:49:52,538 --> 00:49:55,871
- Are they going in?
- Yes, they've just begun.

542
00:49:55,975 --> 00:49:57,408
Purr-fect.

543
00:49:57,510 --> 00:50:00,206
No one's ever come out alive,
have they?

544
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:03,215
We can watch them go nuts
from over here.

545
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:09,745
- Hurry, we don't have much time.
- It's still noon.

546
00:50:09,856 --> 00:50:14,122
- It's always noon here.
- What do you mean?

547
00:50:14,227 --> 00:50:19,426
- At home, it's already after midnight.
- What? We've got to go faster.

548
00:50:21,734 --> 00:50:22,928
Where do we go?

549
00:50:25,571 --> 00:50:27,038
They're lost already?

550
00:50:27,106 --> 00:50:30,075
They're doing worse
than most of our victims.

551
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:31,741
Pleased, Your Majesty?

552
00:50:32,812 --> 00:50:34,871
Feeling good, babe.

553
00:50:34,947 --> 00:50:37,177
- Where are the guards?
- Right there.

554
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:39,309
Hut, hut, hut, hut...

555
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:44,055
Let's start with this path. If we're
methodical, we'll find our way.

556
00:50:44,123 --> 00:50:47,684
Keep your eye on the tower.
That will allow us to stay oriented.

557
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,591
Good idea.

558
00:50:49,696 --> 00:50:51,186
Muta, you're cheating.

559
00:50:51,264 --> 00:50:54,233
Gimme a break.
You think I'll get in trouble?

560
00:50:55,568 --> 00:50:57,536
He's cheating.

561
00:50:57,603 --> 00:51:00,470
She's gonna rub this in my face,
isn't she?

562
00:51:02,542 --> 00:51:05,511
Let's get out of here
while Muta keeps them occupied.

563
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:08,239
Again, I'm tricked into being bait.

564
00:51:22,261 --> 00:51:24,354
Stay behind me, Haru.

565
00:51:39,445 --> 00:51:41,003
Wow!

566
00:51:41,114 --> 00:51:42,843
Oh, how's your cane?

567
00:51:42,915 --> 00:51:46,351
Bent, but it's about time
for a new one anyway.

568
00:51:46,419 --> 00:51:48,478
I never knew they were so useful.

569
00:51:55,928 --> 00:51:58,021
Nice shot, sire.

570
00:52:02,835 --> 00:52:05,235
- Oh no, you hit one of ours.
- I did?

571
00:52:05,304 --> 00:52:09,434
- Your Majesty, how could you?
- Let's keep that between us.

572
00:52:09,509 --> 00:52:13,104
Excuse me,
but I think there's a bit of a problem.

573
00:52:13,246 --> 00:52:16,977
- Our guards are scattered.
- Don't tell me they're lost, too?

574
00:52:17,183 --> 00:52:19,276
Where's my princess?

575
00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:22,315
She's already halfway through.

576
00:52:24,357 --> 00:52:26,257
- Hey!
- You found us.

577
00:52:26,325 --> 00:52:29,488
- What's that way like?
- Just dead ends.

578
00:52:46,179 --> 00:52:48,306
Now this is more like it, babe.

579
00:52:50,049 --> 00:52:53,951
Hm, another dead end.
My, my, this is getting interesting.

580
00:52:54,987 --> 00:52:57,353
Two rights and a left...

581
00:52:57,457 --> 00:53:00,255
Wait a minute,
I know there wasn't a wall here.

582
00:53:00,326 --> 00:53:04,490
- Your brain's overheating.
- We just walked through here, Muta.

583
00:53:04,597 --> 00:53:07,327
What, walls have legs?

584
00:53:11,571 --> 00:53:14,335
She's right, Muta.
This wall is fake.

585
00:53:25,818 --> 00:53:27,877
- Told you.
- Good work, Haru.

586
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:29,854
All right, fine, good work.

587
00:53:31,224 --> 00:53:35,490
How stupid do you have to be
to line up like dominoes?

588
00:53:39,098 --> 00:53:43,228
- Princess!
- Wait. It's not safe, Your Majesty.

589
00:53:51,244 --> 00:53:53,474
Go ahead. I'll catch up to you.

590
00:53:55,448 --> 00:53:57,541
Oh!

591
00:53:58,384 --> 00:53:59,612
What a show-off.

592
00:54:01,254 --> 00:54:03,188
- I can walk.
- Don't worry.

593
00:54:18,337 --> 00:54:20,430
Hmm?

594
00:54:22,475 --> 00:54:24,807
Your Majesty!
This is very dangerous.

595
00:54:24,877 --> 00:54:26,344
I can't let them escape.

596
00:54:26,779 --> 00:54:31,614
You'll never reach them in time.
Besides, we have guards in the tower.

597
00:54:33,653 --> 00:54:35,382
Why didn't you say so?

598
00:54:42,428 --> 00:54:44,794
Toast.

599
00:54:48,734 --> 00:54:49,962
Whoa!

600
00:54:56,576 --> 00:55:01,036
- I'll have a word with the contractors.
- It's too late for that.

601
00:55:02,014 --> 00:55:04,847
We'll have to use the detonator.

602
00:55:04,917 --> 00:55:07,442
Not that, I beg of you, sire.

603
00:55:07,553 --> 00:55:10,351
Think of what it will do
to your approval ratings.

604
00:55:10,489 --> 00:55:13,424
- Button.
- I must have left it in the castle.

605
00:55:13,492 --> 00:55:14,652
Look what I found.

606
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,819
No! Oh! No!

607
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:21,662
Hey, we made it to the top.

608
00:55:21,734 --> 00:55:23,827
Not much further now.

609
00:55:25,638 --> 00:55:27,697
Bye-bye, tower.

610
00:55:33,012 --> 00:55:34,877
- Baron!
- Brace yourselves.

611
00:55:51,397 --> 00:55:54,161
Excellent explosion, Your Majesty.

612
00:55:54,767 --> 00:55:56,826
Let's go.

613
00:55:59,505 --> 00:56:02,599
You've got to be kidding.
We're back where we started.

614
00:56:02,708 --> 00:56:05,472
Now what do we do?
Just stand here?

615
00:56:05,544 --> 00:56:07,034
Nothing else we can do.

616
00:56:07,213 --> 00:56:09,579
Hut, hut, hut, hut...

617
00:56:09,682 --> 00:56:11,946
Quick, quick! Get 'em! Get 'em!

618
00:56:13,719 --> 00:56:17,052
Baron, nice to see you again.

619
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:20,581
Princess, would you please
accompany me back to the castle?

620
00:56:22,261 --> 00:56:24,354
Being a cat's not so bad.

621
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:27,331
Do I have to learn to eat mice?

622
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:30,096
Perhaps you shouldn't give up
quite yet, Haru.

623
00:56:46,552 --> 00:56:49,521
What in the world has Father done now?

624
00:56:49,588 --> 00:56:51,681
Father!

625
00:56:52,591 --> 00:56:55,754
Lune? You're back already?

626
00:56:56,462 --> 00:56:58,726
The prince is here. Line up!

627
00:56:58,798 --> 00:57:00,493
It's the prince?

628
00:57:06,138 --> 00:57:09,039
Yuki sent a message
saying it was urgent I return.

629
00:57:09,108 --> 00:57:11,736
Perhaps you'd like to tell me
what's going on?

630
00:57:12,244 --> 00:57:14,542
Miss Haru!

631
00:57:14,613 --> 00:57:17,446
- Yuki, you're here.
- I'm glad Lune made it in time.

632
00:57:17,516 --> 00:57:20,178
I just wanted to repay
the girl who rescued you.

633
00:57:20,252 --> 00:57:23,085
And I thought, just maybe,
you would be happy

634
00:57:23,155 --> 00:57:26,784
to have a good-looking girl like Haru
for a bride.

635
00:57:26,892 --> 00:57:31,158
I have already chosen my bride.
I have decided to marry Yuki.

636
00:57:33,699 --> 00:57:35,360
That thing?

637
00:57:35,468 --> 00:57:38,631
- Guess it was a surprise.
- I like this prince.

638
00:57:43,943 --> 00:57:48,175
This is for you. I traveled
to your old home to get these.

639
00:57:54,453 --> 00:57:57,183
I haven't had these in years.

640
00:57:57,289 --> 00:58:00,747
Wow.
I used to love those when I was a kid.

641
00:58:00,893 --> 00:58:06,729
I know. You fed me a whole box of these
when I was just a stray.

642
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:09,359
That filthy little kitten was you?

643
00:58:09,468 --> 00:58:12,904
You're so beautiful now,
I never would have recognized you.

644
00:58:13,038 --> 00:58:17,407
Yuki, will you accept these crackers
as a symbol of my love for you

645
00:58:17,476 --> 00:58:19,774
for as long
as our nine lives shall last?

646
00:58:21,714 --> 00:58:24,114
So these crackers mean that

647
00:58:24,183 --> 00:58:26,913
you can marry the prince instead of me!

648
00:58:28,821 --> 00:58:31,915
I'm so happy for you.

649
00:58:31,991 --> 00:58:33,856
Thank you, Haru.

650
00:58:33,926 --> 00:58:36,486
Thank you for feeding me
when I was a kitten.

651
00:58:36,562 --> 00:58:38,928
Without you
I might not be alive today.

652
00:58:39,031 --> 00:58:42,467
You're the girl with the fish crackers
Yuki told me about.

653
00:58:42,535 --> 00:58:46,062
And you also rescued me
when I nearly got killed by a truck.

654
00:58:46,172 --> 00:58:50,370
We both owe you our lives, Haru.
What can we do to repay you?

655
00:58:50,442 --> 00:58:54,401
You don't have to repay me.
I'm just glad things turned out so well.

656
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,108
I guess I did the right thing after all.

657
00:59:01,987 --> 00:59:04,251
This is all very moving.

658
00:59:04,356 --> 00:59:07,382
I had no idea
you had a bride in mind already.

659
00:59:07,459 --> 00:59:10,121
You should've told me.

660
00:59:10,196 --> 00:59:13,393
Poor Haru.
You must feel like such a loser.

661
00:59:13,499 --> 00:59:15,763
- Not really.
- I'm sure you do.

662
00:59:15,835 --> 00:59:19,362
So, I have a great idea.
You should marry me instead.

663
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:25,869
I'll get you some fish, too, as a symbol
of my undying love and all that.

664
00:59:25,945 --> 00:59:26,969
So?

665
00:59:27,079 --> 00:59:30,480
That's very generous,
but I just want to be myself.

666
00:59:30,549 --> 00:59:33,450
I'll change you back if you marry me.

667
00:59:33,552 --> 00:59:34,576
Hm?

668
00:59:34,687 --> 00:59:37,087
I've had just about enough of you.

669
00:59:39,258 --> 00:59:44,218
Nobody who decided who I am but me,
and there's no way I'd ever marry you.

670
00:59:47,399 --> 00:59:48,593
Was that a no?

671
00:59:51,136 --> 00:59:54,128
So you're not ready
to get hitched then, huh, kid?

672
00:59:55,774 --> 00:59:56,798
Not a chance.

673
00:59:56,909 --> 00:59:59,901
I respect a woman
who stands up for herself.

674
01:00:00,012 --> 01:00:03,470
Even if she does stick her nose
in other people's business.

675
01:00:03,582 --> 01:00:06,346
So I, Renaldo Moon, will defend her.

676
01:00:06,418 --> 01:00:08,886
- Renaldo?
- Renaldo Moon?

677
01:00:08,954 --> 01:00:12,446
- The Renaldo Moon?
- So that's who he is.

678
01:00:12,524 --> 01:00:14,754
- Who?
- How could you have forgotten?

679
01:00:14,827 --> 01:00:19,127
He's such a notorious criminal,
his story is written on our walls.

680
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:22,133
Years back,
an enormous white cat appeared,

681
01:00:22,234 --> 01:00:25,260
devoured all the fish in the lake
and then ran off.

682
01:00:25,337 --> 01:00:29,068
He called himself Renaldo Moon.

683
01:00:29,174 --> 01:00:32,575
Did you really do that, Muta?
That's disgusting.

684
01:00:32,645 --> 01:00:35,478
And this time
I'll eat the entire castle.

685
01:00:36,548 --> 01:00:39,540
Hurry! Get His Majesty to safety, now!

686
01:00:44,723 --> 01:00:46,782
Protect Haru from the king.

687
01:00:47,159 --> 01:00:49,957
Yes, sir.
Cat guard, advance.

688
01:00:52,097 --> 01:00:54,463
Oh, you traitor.

689
01:00:54,566 --> 01:00:56,557
Please, sire, it's not safe.

690
01:00:56,702 --> 01:01:00,365
Take Miss Haru to the exit. I'll hold
back the king as long as I can.

691
01:01:00,506 --> 01:01:01,973
The tower collapsed.

692
01:01:02,041 --> 01:01:04,771
It's all right, the exit is still there.

693
01:01:11,383 --> 01:01:13,681
- The sky.
- Oh no, the sun's rising.

694
01:01:13,752 --> 01:01:15,845
I'll get her to the exit.

695
01:01:21,293 --> 01:01:23,420
- Nice.
- Run, Haru. Hurry.

696
01:01:23,562 --> 01:01:25,257
Good luck, and thank you.

697
01:01:25,965 --> 01:01:28,058
Mm-hm.

698
01:01:32,104 --> 01:01:34,470
<i>Goodbye, Yuki.</i>

699
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:36,804
<i>I wasn't wrong to save a cat.</i>

700
01:01:36,875 --> 01:01:40,242
<i>No matter what happens,
I believe in my decision.</i>

701
01:01:40,346 --> 01:01:41,813
<i>I believe.</i>

702
01:01:42,614 --> 01:01:44,081
<i>I believe.</i>

703
01:01:48,487 --> 01:01:50,580
- I'll hold them off.
- Thanks, Muta.

704
01:01:51,757 --> 01:01:55,090
- Where's the king?
- Up there.

705
01:01:55,194 --> 01:01:57,526
Father, you'll hurt yourself.
Get down.

706
01:01:57,796 --> 01:02:01,493
- Has he lost his mind?
- I'll find a way to get him down.

707
01:02:15,914 --> 01:02:18,508
Fight like a cat, you chicken!

708
01:02:18,817 --> 01:02:20,284
With pleasure.

709
01:02:20,386 --> 01:02:22,752
- Need help?
- Take care of Haru.

710
01:02:22,821 --> 01:02:23,879
You got it.

711
01:03:10,536 --> 01:03:12,595
I win, King.

712
01:03:13,372 --> 01:03:15,806
How embarrassing.

713
01:03:25,918 --> 01:03:29,183
I heard rumors
about a nosy cat figurine

714
01:03:29,254 --> 01:03:31,814
who likes to help others
with their problems.

715
01:03:31,924 --> 01:03:36,020
I assumed you'd just be a kitschy
knick-knack that collected dust.

716
01:03:36,128 --> 01:03:41,031
Had I known you were this good, I would
have asked you to come and work for me.

717
01:03:43,469 --> 01:03:46,870
I prefer a life of sticking my nose
in other's problems.

718
01:03:49,141 --> 01:03:51,234
Where am I?

719
01:03:55,147 --> 01:03:57,206
What have you done?

720
01:03:58,984 --> 01:04:01,316
I didn't do anything.

721
01:04:01,386 --> 01:04:04,048
The tower
is hundreds of feet shorter now.

722
01:04:04,123 --> 01:04:07,820
I wouldn't be surprised
if the exit had moved as well.

723
01:04:14,633 --> 01:04:17,693
- Oh no, the exit moved!
- We should have foreseen this.

724
01:04:17,803 --> 01:04:20,897
But, look, she's not a cat any more.

725
01:04:29,481 --> 01:04:30,880
Help me!

726
01:04:31,550 --> 01:04:33,643
I'm going to fall.

727
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:37,413
I'm going!

728
01:04:37,723 --> 01:04:39,588
Haru!

729
01:04:47,866 --> 01:04:50,858
Muta, I hope I'm not too heavy.

730
01:04:50,936 --> 01:04:55,703
From now on,
you're not allowed to make...

731
01:04:55,774 --> 01:04:58,902
...any more fat jokes.

732
01:05:10,055 --> 01:05:12,114
I'm sorry, Muta.

733
01:05:15,494 --> 01:05:17,519
Hold on!

734
01:05:22,134 --> 01:05:24,364
I don't wanna die.

735
01:05:24,436 --> 01:05:27,098
You're not dead yet. Open your eyes.

736
01:05:27,172 --> 01:05:30,505
- Baron?
- Spread your arms and look down.

737
01:05:30,576 --> 01:05:33,238
I can't. I'm scared.

738
01:05:33,312 --> 01:05:35,542
Just trust me.

739
01:05:46,725 --> 01:05:51,219
- Are you sure we're still alive?
- Yes. For now.

740
01:06:02,908 --> 01:06:05,399
I think I could learn to like this.

741
01:06:17,222 --> 01:06:19,884
What are all these chickens doing here?

742
01:06:22,261 --> 01:06:24,889
- A flock of crows?
- Perfect timing.

743
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:35,836
So, Muta, how does it feel to be saved
by a bunch of birdbrains?

744
01:06:35,941 --> 01:06:36,965
Toto!

745
01:06:37,075 --> 01:06:40,602
- It sure took you long enough.
- Nice work, Toto.

746
01:06:40,679 --> 01:06:44,137
I'm just glad I had enough friends
hanging out in the area.

747
01:06:44,216 --> 01:06:46,912
Are you sure we're not too heavy?

748
01:06:46,985 --> 01:06:49,681
- You're light as a feather, Haru.
- Thanks.

749
01:06:49,788 --> 01:06:51,551
I beg to differ.

750
01:06:51,690 --> 01:06:53,351
Haru, look.

751
01:06:54,259 --> 01:06:56,386
That's my school.

752
01:06:56,495 --> 01:06:59,726
I don't believe it.
I'm gonna make it home.

753
01:06:59,865 --> 01:07:01,799
Thank you, everyone.

754
01:07:10,342 --> 01:07:12,503
Unbelievable.

755
01:07:12,611 --> 01:07:14,408
We won't forget you, Miss Haru.

756
01:07:15,681 --> 01:07:17,774
Your Majesty?

757
01:07:23,155 --> 01:07:26,886
I've been thinking.
It may be time for me to retire.

758
01:07:27,793 --> 01:07:30,728
I think I shall accompany you, sire.

759
01:07:40,238 --> 01:07:41,899
Thanks, Toto.

760
01:07:43,508 --> 01:07:46,875
Oh boy, my heart is still pounding.

761
01:07:46,945 --> 01:07:50,346
- Scared, were you?
- Yes. But I had fun, too.

762
01:07:50,449 --> 01:07:51,939
Really? I didn't.

763
01:07:52,017 --> 01:07:55,783
Well then,
now that Haru's problem is solved,

764
01:07:55,887 --> 01:07:59,345
we should let her go home
and get some rest.

765
01:07:59,458 --> 01:08:00,948
Catnap.

766
01:08:01,026 --> 01:08:03,620
I guess this is goodbye?

767
01:08:03,695 --> 01:08:05,788
One last chore to do.

768
01:08:18,844 --> 01:08:23,713
Baron, just for the record, I think
I may have a little crush on you.

769
01:08:23,815 --> 01:08:28,013
Just for the record, I admire a young
woman who speaks from the heart.

770
01:08:31,189 --> 01:08:35,717
If you ever need us, you will always
know how to find us again.

771
01:08:35,794 --> 01:08:40,197
And the Bureau's doors will be open
to you, be it day or night.

772
01:08:40,265 --> 01:08:43,063
Until then, trust yourself.

773
01:08:49,374 --> 01:08:50,841
Goodbye.

774
01:08:58,183 --> 01:09:00,242
I'll miss you!

775
01:09:01,153 --> 01:09:02,211
Toto.

776
01:09:02,287 --> 01:09:03,379
Baron.

777
01:09:03,455 --> 01:09:05,548
And Fatso!

778
01:09:05,624 --> 01:09:09,060
- Fatso? I heard that.
- She's only telling the truth.

779
01:09:09,127 --> 01:09:10,526
Shut up, birdbrain.

780
01:09:10,595 --> 01:09:13,826
Don't give me that again
or I might drop you.

781
01:09:13,932 --> 01:09:15,559
Shut up, you birdbrain.

782
01:09:46,431 --> 01:09:48,456
Oh! I've got to get up.

783
01:09:56,341 --> 01:09:57,831
Morning.

784
01:09:57,943 --> 01:10:00,810
Haru? What are you doing up so early?

785
01:10:00,912 --> 01:10:02,709
It's not even a school day.

786
01:10:02,814 --> 01:10:05,942
I'm going out with Hiromi.
Don't want to waste the day.

787
01:10:06,117 --> 01:10:07,243
Huh?

788
01:10:07,319 --> 01:10:09,378
So...

789
01:10:09,855 --> 01:10:11,914
I made some breakfast for both of us.

790
01:10:12,123 --> 01:10:14,489
- What?
- I'm done so help yourself.

791
01:10:14,593 --> 01:10:16,891
And I made some tea, too.

792
01:10:16,962 --> 01:10:19,021
Oh, by the way...

793
01:10:19,965 --> 01:10:22,297
...that's my own special blend of tea.

794
01:10:22,367 --> 01:10:26,133
It's a bit different every time
so I can't guarantee the flavor.

795
01:10:28,206 --> 01:10:30,299
Oh, okay.

796
01:10:34,179 --> 01:10:36,579
What do you know? Smells good.

797
01:10:36,648 --> 01:10:38,707
That's a great outfit.

798
01:10:39,184 --> 01:10:42,017
I got some big news
you'll be excited about.

799
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:44,315
Yeah? What is it?

800
01:10:44,389 --> 01:10:47,881
Machida broke up with his girlfriend.

801
01:10:51,963 --> 01:10:55,592
- Oh, that's too bad.
- What? Are you kidding?

802
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:58,897
- What do you mean?
- I thought you'd be ecstatic.

803
01:10:59,004 --> 01:11:02,201
Not really. Doesn't matter any more.

804
01:11:14,185 --> 01:11:16,483
- Hey, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

805
01:11:16,555 --> 01:11:19,285
- Liar.
- I'm better than ever.

806
01:11:20,458 --> 01:11:23,894
What's going on with you and Tsuge?

807
01:11:23,995 --> 01:11:25,394
Nothing new.

808
01:11:25,497 --> 01:11:28,057
- Come on.
- Nothing's happening.
