BURNT MONEY

2
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,400
<i>They called them The Twins.</i>
<i>They were always together.</i>

3
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,440
<i>But they weren't brothers.</i>
<i>They didn't even look alike.</i>

4
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,120
<i>All they had in common</i>
<i>was the way of looking,</i>

5
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,080
<i>the still eyes,</i>
<i>the lost glare.</i>

6
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,640
<i>El Nene was a renegade</i>
<i>of family and class,</i>

7
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,640
<i>the stray black sheep.</i>

8
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,800
<i>He was pale</i>

9
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,800
<i>as if he'd been in jail</i>
<i>longer than he had really been.</i>

10
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,720
<i>Angel wasn't even from here.</i>

11
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,680
<i>He was heavy, quiet,</i>
<i>very superstitious.</i>

12
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,640
<i>He always saw bad signs</i>

13
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,160
<i>that got in his way.</i>

14
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,560
<i>They bumped into each other</i>
the first time

15
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,040
<i>in the station toilets where</i>
<i>Nene used to go for sex.</i>

16
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,720
<i>Angel was wandering.</i>

17
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,960
<i>He'd run out of money</i>
<i>and had nowhere to go.</i>

18
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,000
<i>Nene offered him refuge</i>
<i>in his flat.</i>

19
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,360
<i>Moved, almost as a warning,</i>
<i>Angel confessed his secret.</i>

20
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,840
I hear voices...

21
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,520
all the time...

22
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,160
inside here.

23
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,720
Coming or not?

24
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,800
<i>That night Nene and Angel</i>
<i>slept together.</i>

25
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,600
<i>They were never apart since.</i>
<i>They're The Twins to everyone.</i>

26
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,040
<i>Everybody knows:</i>
<i>They work together or not at all.</i>

27
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,760
<i>"Life of mine, far away</i>
<i>I love you more.</i>

28
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,040
<i>Life of mine,</i>

29
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,360
<i>think of my return</i>

30
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,280
<i>I know gold</i>
won<i>'</i>t have your kisses

31
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,880
<i>and that's why</i>

32
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,640
<i>I love you more.</i>

33
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,360
<i>Life of mine,</i>

34
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,320
<i>I even hurry the breath</i>

35
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,600
<i>bringing near the moment</i>

36
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,360
<i>of the happy caress.</i>

37
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,320
<i>You're my life</i>

38
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,600
<i>and I want you</i>

39
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,560
<i>by my side</i>

40
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,000
<i>and this way drown</i>
<i>my solitude..."</i>

41
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,480
<i>Lady Luck is strange,</i>
<i>she comes when least expected.</i>

42
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,400
Seven million.

43
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,120
You don<i>'</i>t see that dough
everyday.

44
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,480
Lots of money.
Are you sure?

45
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,640
Seven million at least.

46
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,160
All the wages of...

47
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,120
<i>Florian Barrios was</i>
<i>a tango singer.</i>

48
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,320
<i>He'd been on radio and TV</i>
<i>and even made a record.</i>

49
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,800
<i>He soon fell into drugs</i>

50
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,320
<i>and lost his voice.</i>

51
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,840
<i>His cousin was big</i>
<i>in the Peronist party.</i>

52
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,480
<i>As a city administrator,</i>

53
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,640
<i>he found out all about the money</i>
<i>at a finance meeting.</i>

54
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,240
<i>Florian needed</i>
<i>a gang he could trust,</i>

55
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,520
<i>some professionals</i>
<i>to take care of everything.</i>

56
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,680
The operation must be safe.
If the information isn<i>'</i>t right...

57
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,480
I checked it myself.

58
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,520
<i>Fontana was the invisible man,</i>
<i>the magic mind.</i>

59
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,040
<i>He kept his distance.</i>

60
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,280
<i>Only he could have set up</i>
the pay truck robbery in two days.

61
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,720
<i>Once, by mistake,</i>
<i>Fontana went to prison</i>

62
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,360
<i>with the political prisoners.</i>

63
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,200
<i>He met Fernando Aguilera there.</i>
<i>Nando, a lawyer</i>

64
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,400
<i>and a dedicated nationalist.</i>

65
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,320
Recruit new ones.

66
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,800
Guys who<i>'</i>ve never met.
With no time to know each other.

67
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,640
I can<i>'</i>t do it without Cuervo.

68
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,400
Take Bazan off then.

69
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,040
They know each other too well.

70
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,200
<i>Nando provided the contacts</i>
<i>with weapon dealers, hideouts</i>

71
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,320
<i>and the deals with the police.</i>

72
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,800
Have you ever heard
of The Twins?

73
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,440
<i>Among crooks</i>
<i>to bury yourself</i>

74
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,200
<i>means to hide</i>
<i>until it's time to strike.</i>

75
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:42,280
<i>To bury, disappear</i>
<i>until it's time.</i>

76
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,640
You must wait till they
leave the bank.

77
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,040
Don<i>'</i>t mind the guards.

78
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,320
They are two old guys
ready to retire.

79
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,840
You get them here.

80
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,960
No other choice. Got it?

81
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,840
The idea is for it
to look like an accident,

82
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,720
so we can surprise them.
Am I right?

83
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,000
<i>Oscar Di Pasquo, alias Cuervo,</i>
<i>was chosen as a driver.</i>

84
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,840
<i>On an operation like this</i>
<i>the man at the wheel</i>

85
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,280
<i>makes the difference</i>
<i>between life and death,</i>

86
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,120
<i>between escaping</i>
<i>or being trapped.</i>

87
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,200
<i>Cuervo got a Chevrolet</i>
<i>in Lanús,</i>

88
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,640
<i>from a guy who bought</i>
<i>stolen cars off the police.</i>

89
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,800
<i>Cuervo was a sedative addict.</i>
<i>He took almost a jar a day.</i>

90
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,160
<i>It gave him</i>
<i>a quiet vision of life,</i>

91
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,920
<i>and turned him</i>
<i>into an excellent driver,</i>

92
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,080
<i>Blank mind. Cold blooded.</i>
<i>Equal to none.</i>

93
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,200
<i>Those days Cuervo also had</i>
<i>an extra advantage:</i>

94
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,920
<i>A flat he shared with Vivi,</i>
<i>his girlfriend.</i>

95
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,280
<i>It could be a hide out.</i>

96
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,480
<i>Cuervo said the flat</i>
<i>wasn't watched by the police.</i>

97
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,960
<i>Fontana was definite about it:</i>

98
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:03,560
<i>He asked them all to be there,</i>
<i>even Vivi who knew everything.</i>

99
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,320
Want some?

100
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,280
<i>The worst is the day before,</i>

101
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,840
<i>when everything's set</i>
<i>and all that's left is to do it.</i>

102
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,680
I want a bigger bill.

103
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,440
<i>Cuervo knows he should</i>

104
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,360
<i>sleep to be rested up.</i>

105
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,800
<i>He should check the car,</i>

106
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,440
<i>study the roads,</i>
<i>alternative routes,</i>

107
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,040
<i>short cuts.</i>

108
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,160
<i>They try to sleep some hours</i>
<i>but they can't,</i>

109
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,120
<i>their bodies squeak</i>
and they feel ill.

110
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,360
<i>The worst is the day before,</i>
<i>Fontana thinks.</i>

111
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,640
<i>And he starts seeing things,</i>
<i>visions.</i>

112
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,680
<i>He isn't sure</i>
<i>about the gang he's hired.</i>

113
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,760
<i>But it's too late for doubts.</i>

114
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,200
<i>They're buried in the flat.</i>
<i>There can be no leaks.</i>

115
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,200
<i>From the beginning,</i>
<i>Angel and Nene slept together.</i>

116
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,680
<i>But in the last months</i>

117
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,040
<i>Angel has avoided any contact</i>
<i>with no explanation.</i>

118
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,760
<i>Something has broken</i>
<i>between them.</i>

119
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,080
<i>So now they're looking</i>
<i>forward to the heist.</i>

120
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,600
<i>When they work, they know</i>
<i>they're The Twins again.</i>

121
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:35,760
THE FACTS

122
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,720
Amigdala: Tonsil
Amigo-ga: Friend

123
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,960
Right on time.

124
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,840
Reverse! Reverse!

125
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,400
Get out.

126
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,560
The key!

127
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,160
Angel.

128
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,080
Angel!

129
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,560
Nene!

130
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,160
Angel!

131
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,160
Nene!

132
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,200
Cuervo!

133
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,960
- The dough?
- Help me!

134
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,040
The money, kid!
Drop him and get the money!

135
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,760
Shut up.

136
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,640
You crazy?

137
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,920
Motherfucker!

138
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,160
Wanna get us all killed?
Motherfucker!

139
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,040
Ever seen anything like this?

140
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,960
Cuervo!

141
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,800
Coming!

142
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,680
Stop it.

143
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,680
Brother, mind the carpet!

144
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,680
There must be over 7 million.

145
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,800
We came in through the garage.
Nobody saw us.

146
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,480
What did you want? To leave
a trail of blood for the police?

147
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,040
- I<i>'</i>ll tell Vivi.
- Why did you bring him?

148
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,160
A wounded man
is a danger for all of us.

149
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,160
You know what must be done.
Nene knows.

150
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,200
Even Angel knows.
What were you thinking?

151
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,000
Nene left me no choice.

152
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,920
Who gives you choices here?
Me or a couple of fags?

153
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,360
- What<i>'</i>s that?
- It<i>'</i>s for the pain.

154
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,760
What are you doing?

155
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,760
Kid,

156
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,800
there<i>'</i>s a bottle of whisky
in the room, bring it.

157
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,560
Be still.

158
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,760
- Want to do it yourself?
- No.

159
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,640
- Then scram.
- Well, I...

160
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,040
Scram!
Are you deaf?

161
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,280
Sure you don<i>'</i>t want a hit?

162
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,080
I prefer the pain.

163
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,480
Because of the voices.

164
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,840
It keeps them away.

165
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,720
You didn<i>'</i>t do it.
So why are you cleaning up?

166
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,520
You said you had to study.

167
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:13,040
What would we do in New York?
I don<i>'</i>t know a word of English.

168
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,920
You<i>'</i>ll have to help me.

169
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,720
I can<i>'</i>t even go to the toilet
without you...

170
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,160
How do you say
Twins in English?

171
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,000
There it is.

172
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,720
Quiet!

173
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,640
Just a bit more!

174
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,680
Please!

175
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,600
Just a little bit more!

176
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,160
Hold on a little! Hold on!

177
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,800
Here we go!

178
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,720
I got it!

179
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,320
A little bit more!

180
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,080
Look.

181
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,440
What did I tell you?

182
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,920
Stay put. When the worst comes,
I<i>'</i>ll tell you.

183
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,240
Try to sleep now,
you need it.

184
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,160
Try to sleep.

185
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,920
Competent as a doctor, too...

186
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,040
It was nothing.
Just a patch. He<i>'</i>s O.K. now.

187
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,200
What are you two,
husband and wife?

188
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,200
Are we famous yet?

189
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,040
Yes, in bold print.

190
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,640
'<i>'</i>Two officers killed
in the line of duty.

191
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,680
Aldo Racco and Sebastian Ponce.

192
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,680
Sleazy trio...
chaos, destruction and death.'<i>'</i>

193
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,840
They were expecting us.

194
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,440
As I got to the van
they were pointing at me.

195
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,240
If it wasn<i>'</i>t for Angel...

196
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,400
It<i>'</i>s pretty obvious.

197
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,840
They kill us, let Cuervo go,
and say he split with the money.

198
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,160
Who wouldn<i>'</i>t believe it?

199
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,560
They wanted to screw us.
That simple.

200
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,880
Nando is coming. Let him in.

201
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,600
<i>I like that.</i>

202
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,680
The name of the trio:

203
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,800
Chaos, Destruction and Death.

204
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,640
I<i>'</i>m Chaos.

205
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,640
Nene was there, staring.

206
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,960
Just now?

207
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,040
At me?
I told you he was a fag.

208
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,280
You think
all good-looking guys are fags.

209
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,560
Wait a minute.
Don<i>'</i>t underestimate me.

210
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,000
I have a good ass too,
remember that.

211
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,360
Go on, call him.

212
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,720
You<i>'</i>d like a threesome,
you little slut.

213
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,640
Yes, yes...

214
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,920
Easy, easy.

215
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,720
Did I say something?

216
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,320
You want to know the latest?

217
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,640
We<i>'</i>re terrorists.

218
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,960
Says who?

219
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,360
Chancho Aguirre,
on the radio.

220
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,520
<i>This gang acts</i>
<i>like a secret</i>

221
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,440
<i>organization,</i>
<i>my dear journalist.</i>

222
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,840
Everyone is interviewing him!
Commissioner this,

223
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,040
Commissioner that...

224
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,840
Nene says they were set up,

225
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,400
that they nearly got killed.

226
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,920
He<i>'</i>s covering up.

227
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,200
We<i>'</i>ll have trouble
because of him, he knows it.

228
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,040
He<i>'</i>s screwed it,
he<i>'</i>s scared of us.

229
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,240
- He should pay.
- You suggest we turn them in?

230
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,120
We can also kill them.

231
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,120
Who<i>'</i>s going to kill them? You?

232
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,760
It<i>'</i>s no good.

233
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,000
It<i>'</i>s out of Aguirre<i>'</i>s hands.

234
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,840
He<i>'</i>ll have to kill us.
All of us.

235
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,640
He has a lot more to lose
than his share of the money.

236
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,760
If they find he was in,
he<i>'</i>ll kill us all.

237
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,480
And that includes you, Nando.

238
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,080
We<i>'</i>re lepers,
police murderers.

239
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,120
To Uruguay. As soon as possible,

240
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,120
with all the money.

241
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,840
<i>For the Police, the robbery</i>
<i>turned into an obsession.</i>

242
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,520
<i>The death of the officers</i>
<i>was a red ember in their hands.</i>

243
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,880
Any croissants, Elsa?

244
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,200
There aren<i>'</i>t any left.
It<i>'</i>s been busy today.

245
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,760
<i>They moved fast,</i>
<i>with all their might.</i>

246
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,200
<i>The usual suspects</i>
<i>were the first ones down.</i>

247
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,760
<i>They wanted results.</i>

248
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,600
No, not now.

249
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,720
<i>Pressed by the situation,</i>
<i>the corrupt officers</i>

250
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,640
<i>dropped Fontana's name.</i>

251
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,320
<i>They had no way out.</i>
<i>But they couldn't reach him.</i>

252
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,120
- Is Chancho in today?
- He<i>'</i>s in his office.

253
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,440
<i>All the evidence they had</i>
<i>was the military machine gun,</i>

254
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,160
<i>the one Angel left behind.</i>

255
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,480
<i>Florian Barrios was seen</i>
<i>by a witness</i>

256
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,680
<i>testing a similar gun</i>
<i>at a shooting range.</i>

257
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,720
<i>Florian was the one</i>
<i>who could take them to Fontana.</i>

258
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,720
<i>Florian was the key.</i>

259
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:31,080
<i>Vivi knows now why Cuervo</i>
<i>didn't want to mention Uruguay.</i>

260
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,200
<i>But she doesn't repent</i>
<i>making him tell her.</i>

261
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,120
<i>She wanted him to resist</i>
<i>and say nothing.</i>

262
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,600
<i>He should have protected her.</i>

263
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,480
<i>She always knew</i>
<i>truth was dangerous.</i>

264
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,640
<i>If she knew nothing,</i>
<i>she'd have said nothing.</i>

265
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,880
<i>"Whose fault is it, then?"</i>
<i>Vivi thinks.</i>

266
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,040
<i>But she doesn't feel guilty.</i>
<i>She doesn't feel anything.</i>

267
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,440
<i>Even if Cuervo kissed her, now,</i>
<i>she would feel nothing.</i>

268
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,680
THE VOICES

269
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,560
<i>Buenos Aires.</i>
<i>It's shit.</i>

270
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,680
<i>Worse than Bilbao,</i>
<i>worse than Marseille.</i>

271
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,760
<i>Buenos Aires is a prison.</i>

272
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,080
<i>The streets</i>
<i>are like a prison yard.</i>

273
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,040
<i>People move quietly, dryly,</i>

274
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,000
<i>Iooking cautiously</i>
<i>as if to avoid being wiped out.</i>

275
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,640
<i>I wish I never come back.</i>

276
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,160
<i>In English "I wish"</i>
<i>is said "I wish".</i>

277
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,600
<i>"I wish" means "I desire".</i>

278
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:39,600
<i>I desire Nene.</i>
<i>I wish he leaves Buenos Aires.</i>

279
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,960
<i>He's like his city.</i>
<i>He hates himself, he feeds on hate.</i>

280
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,640
<i>I want to save him.</i>
<i>I can save him.</i>

281
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,920
<i>Somewhere else.</i>

282
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,720
You shouldn<i>'</i>t smoke here.

283
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:11,880
It<i>'</i>s not advisable. The light.
Spirits can spot you. The spirits?

284
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,920
- Yes.
- Do these spirits swim?

285
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,240
They float.

286
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,320
They<i>'</i>re lighter than water,
and they shine,

287
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,040
they follow you,
as if you were one of them.

288
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,760
Since when
do you believe in ghosts?

289
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,960
<i>Angel's fingers</i>
<i>always smell the same.</i>

290
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,000
<i>They smell like saw dust,</i>

291
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,000
<i>like gunpowder.</i>
<i>Like blood, like sex,</i>

292
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:58,160
<i>they remind me of things.</i>
<i>The toilets at Constitucion,</i>

293
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,360
<i>the jobs, the road,</i>

294
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,240
<i>cheap hotels,</i>

296
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,840
Thank you.

297
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,680
This is Mr. Losardo,
my friend Fontana.

298
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,240
What are you looking at?

299
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,240
Don<i>'</i>t you know
the cold makes it smaller?

300
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,640
What?
Want to keep on looking?

301
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,120
More?

302
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,240
Saw the pictures?

303
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,160
You saw them?

304
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,440
They<i>'</i>re everywhere.

305
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,800
Remember I<i>'</i>m
doing this for you.

306
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,240
Any problems and I<i>'</i>ll know
who<i>'</i>s to blame.

307
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,720
You stare because you<i>'</i>re dumb
or because you<i>'</i>re a fag?

308
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,360
Or both?
Tell me.

309
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,080
I<i>'</i>m curious.
Scientific interest.

310
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,000
Got it from the old man.

311
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,560
Stop!

312
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,640
Is being queer
and retarded connected?

313
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,360
Or just the luck of the draw?

314
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,760
Because it<i>'</i>s really bad luck.

315
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,480
Angel! Cut it out...

316
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,120
Stop it!

317
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:11,160
Stop, you can<i>'</i>t, Angel!

318
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,960
So, were you born like that,
or did it grow on you?

319
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,040
- That<i>'</i>s it!
- I<i>'</i>m just telling him...

320
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,360
Did you hear him?
I<i>'</i>m no retard!

321
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,600
- He called me...
- A fag!

322
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,440
I called you a fag!
That<i>'</i>s it! A fag!

323
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,040
A fag!

324
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,920
I<i>'</i>d kill you if it
weren<i>'</i>t for the old man.

325
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,840
I<i>'</i>ll stick this
up your ass, fucker!

326
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,440
Stay out of sight
five days, at least.

327
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,680
I need time to get the I. Ds.

328
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,320
So be still.

329
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,920
You can<i>'</i>t be too careful.

330
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,760
We<i>'</i>ll keep in touch
through Nando,

331
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,200
it<i>'</i>s best.

332
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,120
If you see this face again,

333
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,760
- it<i>'</i>s a bad sign.
- We can<i>'</i>t wait that long.

334
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,480
Five days. Ten. A hundred.

335
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,280
It<i>'</i>s the same for you.

336
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,800
You<i>'</i>re moles.
I want you under cover

337
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,280
<i>and out of the light.</i>

338
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,640
Cuervo, what is there
to do here?

339
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,640
What<i>'</i>s good here?

340
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,800
Whores.

341
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,680
Hold on...

342
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,640
- You write their numbers?
- What else is a phone book for?

343
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:48,120
Gabriela, Gladys, Gloria.

344
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,960
They<i>'</i>re all whores!

345
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,800
The fullest address book
in Latin America.

346
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,880
So weren<i>'</i>t you so in love?

347
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,600
Vivi has my heart
but I have my cock with me.

348
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,480
Not all of it, for what I saw.

349
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,680
<i>"The search goes on</i>
<i>for the bloodthirsty gang.</i>

350
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,040
It is assumed... '<i>'</i>

351
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,200
This is an Argentine paper.

352
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,400
This one on the other hand...

353
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,600
'<i>'</i>Argentine gang
searched for in... '<i>'</i>

354
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,640
This paper is Uruguayan.

355
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:28,920
See!

356
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,720
See for yourselves?

357
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,800
Fuck.

358
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,160
So, they know where we are

359
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,720
and anyone can recognize us.

360
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,360
They<i>'</i>ve got Vivi!

361
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,720
Anybody.
On the street,

362
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,640
in this building,

363
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,080
even going out to the balcony
is dangerous.

364
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,480
I must do something.

365
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,440
- That means...
- Are you deaf?

366
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,440
That means the girl told them
what I ordered you...

367
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,360
What I ordered you
not to tell her!

368
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,640
She should never have known
we were coming to Uruguay.

369
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,440
Under the circumstances,

370
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,680
our discretion is crucial.

371
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,640
If you want to leave
this country alive

372
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,200
you must do exactly what I say.

373
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:26,480
They aren<i>'</i>t formalities.
It<i>'</i>s a matter of life or death.

374
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,280
1 st rule: We<i>'</i>re invisible.

375
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,440
We can<i>'</i>t be seen, not at all.
Don<i>'</i>t show yourselves.

376
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,920
2nd rule: We<i>'</i>re mute.
None must hear us.

377
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:44,480
The world must think
the flat is still empty.

378
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
3rd and final rule: We<i>'</i>re alone.

379
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,120
There<i>'</i>s no world outside for us.

380
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,080
Let me look at the wound.

381
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,680
Let<i>'</i>s see.

382
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,520
It<i>'</i>s better.

383
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,080
You<i>'</i>re not studying at all.
You should.

384
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,840
Study what?

385
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,680
English.

386
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:35,200
When we get to New York,
we<i>'</i>re going to need it.

387
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,120
We must speak it perfectly.
Pass off as...

388
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,840
Our new papers will have
other names, right?

389
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,400
I want to choose my own name,

390
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,520
to confuse the voices.

391
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,040
Who, me? <i>Wrong, wrong.</i>

392
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,800
You<i>'</i>ve got the wrong guy.

393
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,600
Angel? <i>What Angel?</i>

394
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,120
<i>I don't want to hurt him</i>

395
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,160
<i>but I can't help it.</i>

396
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,840
<i>I also feel like it. I want to.</i>

397
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,440
<i>But I mustn't.</i>

398
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,400
<i>The voices are not to blame.</i>

399
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,360
<i>They say I should,</i>
<i>they say I shouldn't.</i>

400
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,920
<i>They call me "fag",</i>
<i>"fairy", "saint".</i>

401
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,520
<i>They want to confuse me.</i>
<i>But I know what to do.</i>

402
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:50,720
<i>The semen. You have to save it.</i>
It<i>'</i>s sacred.

403
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,040
<i>Nene doesn't get it,</i>
<i>I'm trying to save him.</i>

404
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,560
<i>No semen, no God.</i>
<i>Semen is sacred.</i>

405
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:44,120
<i>Waiting.</i>
<i>Most of the time it's waiting.</i>

406
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,160
<i>Waiting for the hit.</i>

407
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,280
<i>Waiting</i>
<i>until the heat's cooled off.</i>

408
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,720
<i>Waiting to move the money.</i>

409
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,480
<i>Time is exhausting,</i>

410
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,920
<i>a lost battle.</i>

411
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:19,560
<i>Like in jail, you wonder</i>
<i>how to fill the time.</i>

412
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,960
What are you staring at?

413
00:41:52,680 --> 00:42:02,960
You have a cop<i>'</i>s soul.
<i>You can't count on your body:</i>

414
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:07,800
<i>You can't fuck, you can't cry,</i>
<i>they're above you,</i>

415
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,000
<i>you only have your head.</i>

416
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:18,360
<i>And you think crap</i>
<i>but you think.</i>

417
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:52,320
<i>If I had to explain all I thought</i>
<i>while I was inside</i>

418
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,040
<i>it'd take the same time</i>
<i>I was locked away.</i>

419
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,200
<i>You start imagining things:</i>

420
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,960
<i>What you lost,</i>

421
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:18,800
<i>what you left behind</i>
<i>when you put your life on hold.</i>

422
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,600
<i>A robbery,</i>

423
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,520
<i>step by step,</i>

424
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,400
<i>1 and 1000 times, like a movie.</i>

425
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,200
<i>The building of a house,</i>
<i>brick by brick.</i>

426
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:54,680
<i>A woman,</i>
<i>every detail of the encounter:</i>

427
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,960
<i>Words, movements, colours.</i>

428
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,080
<i>You live in your head.</i>

429
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,240
<i>That's what you become,</i>

430
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,120
<i>a head,</i>

431
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,560
<i>a skull.</i>

432
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:22,600
<i>In jail I went queer,</i>
<i>drug addict, gambler, peronist.</i>

433
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,400
<i>I learned</i>
<i>to fight to death,</i>

434
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,360
<i>to play chess,</i>

435
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,840
<i>to smash the face of anyone</i>
<i>who looked at me the wrong way.</i>

436
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,480
<i>To make little figures</i>
<i>out of cigarette paper.</i>

437
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,240
<i>To fuck standing up.</i>

438
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,120
<i>To lose myself in a book</i>
<i>and never come back.</i>

439
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,160
<i>And I built houses in my mind</i>

440
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,560
<i>only to blow them up again.</i>

441
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,160
We came to Uruguay
with no papers,

442
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,720
we can leave without them.

443
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,760
It<i>'</i>s not just the papers.

444
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,440
It<i>'</i>s the whole structure
in Brazil... housing,

445
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,800
you<i>'</i>ll be dogs.

446
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,360
Who<i>'</i>ll give you asylum?

447
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,400
What<i>'</i>s the fuss?
It<i>'</i>s just a few more days.

448
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,880
Do you think they can handle
two more days here?

449
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,480
Guess who<i>'</i>s here now,

450
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,280
in Uruguay.

451
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,360
Chancho Aguirre!

452
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,040
What do you say?

453
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,440
He<i>'</i>s here in Montevideo,
with Interpol.

454
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,120
I told you, didn<i>'</i>t I?

455
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,120
Don<i>'</i>t fuck
with Chancho Aguirre.

456
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,360
He wants... all the money!

457
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:58,400
Talk to Losardo.
Put pressure on him.

458
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,840
That<i>'</i>s why I pay you.

459
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,880
The sooner we leave the better.

460
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,680
- Nervous.
- What?

461
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,600
The cough. It<i>'</i>s nervous.

462
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:18,400
I had it as a kid.
Steam baths.

463
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,400
- It opens up the chest.
- Where are you going?

464
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,880
- To get some air.
- Are you nuts?

465
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,680
You said two days.

466
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,480
That turned into five.
Now it<i>'</i>ll be 7 or 10 or 20.

467
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,160
I<i>'</i>m surprised at you.

468
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,520
What surprises me
is that we<i>'</i>re still waiting.

469
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,680
Why do we need passports?

470
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:48,400
Our faces
are all over the country.

471
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,200
Policemen of all kinds
are after us. They<i>'</i>re pissed off.

472
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,720
They want to charge us
for the two dead cops...

473
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,640
They want the money. Need I go on?
What<i>'</i>s wrong with you?

474
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,600
You aren<i>'</i>t like the others.

475
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,840
You use your head.

476
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,280
Want to know
what my head tells me?

477
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,920
At any time they could
break down the door and kill us.

478
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:21,000
What keeps the Uruguayan
from handing us in and keeping

479
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,680
- a bigger share?
- There are codes.

480
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,080
Only 1:

481
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,480
Save your skin
whatever the price.

482
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,320
I want to see the streets
a while.

483
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,720
Now that I can.

484
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,360
Do you like it?

485
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:54,600
I don<i>'</i>t know. I can<i>'</i>t see
shit with these glasses.

486
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,240
Fucker! Asshole!
Son of a bitch!

487
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,680
Son of a bitch!

488
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,440
Let<i>'</i>s go.

489
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,920
What<i>'</i>ll you have?

490
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,560
- Here?
- Sure. Where else?

491
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,440
Beer?

492
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:55,880
Something stronger.

493
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,120
Whisky?

494
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,080
Stronger!

495
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,880
- Raw alcohol?
- And a match!

496
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,080
Buy some tokens
for the shooting game!

497
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,000
Loser pays!

498
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,520
Don<i>'</i>t take too long.

499
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:51,000
Come in, ladies and gentlemen.
Come and see.

500
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,680
How much would you pay
to know your fate?

501
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:02,320
Pay what you like. The gypsy
will tell you what you want to know.

502
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,440
Anything!

503
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,840
About love, life...

504
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,280
No. This one.

505
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:15,480
Whatever...

506
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,160
What do you see here?

507
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,040
What does it say?

508
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,240
Two Pesos.

509
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,200
The blood of Christ!

510
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,720
WHAT IF YOU DIE TONIGHT?

511
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,520
What are you looking at?

512
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,960
Queer.

513
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:39,680
Faggot.

514
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:42,800
Do you hear me?

515
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,520
Pervert, fag!

516
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,440
Sodomite!

517
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,320
Scum.

518
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,440
Are you going to cry?

519
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:15,880
Well?

520
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,640
You left me alone.

521
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,520
I looked for you...

522
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,160
I ended up in a cinema.

523
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,720
Let me fix your wound,
it<i>'</i>s bleeding.

524
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,120
Hey, it<i>'</i>s me!

525
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,680
You know,

526
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:14,400
in Africa they use
a simple technique to trap monkeys.

527
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:19,640
They make a hole in a wooden
box and put a banana in it.

528
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,320
The monkeys put their hand in
and take the banana.

529
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,040
When they want to take it out,
they can<i>'</i>t.

530
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,720
Their fist gets stuck.

531
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:34,880
Getting free is simple,
just drop the banana.

532
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:40,480
But they don<i>'</i>t,
they stay in the trap.

533
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,200
Got it?

534
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,960
Sometimes letting things go
is smart.

535
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,200
Strange.

536
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,600
I thought it was a story
about human nature.

537
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,000
The way it always
betrays us.

538
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:13,840
Have it as you will,
but think it over.

539
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,960
Chancho Aguirre
is pressing ferociously.

540
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:18,880
Now,

541
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,280
if you give him the money...

542
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,720
Would that be the end?

543
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:28,480
- If it wouldn<i>'</i>t...
- Why me?

544
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,200
Why not tell this to Nando,
our contact.

545
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:35,800
He<i>'</i>s a good guy, Nando,
but he<i>'</i>s broken.

546
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:41,920
If they break once
they<i>'</i>re lost for good.

547
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,840
People who can<i>'</i>t take the pressure.

548
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,280
If Nando falls
don<i>'</i>t wait a second longer.

549
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,200
Pack your things and scram.

550
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,000
God forbid.

551
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,720
He<i>'</i>s Chancho<i>'</i>s only chance
to get to you.

552
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:32,080
So? What do you say?
Ken Brown. <i>Hi- Fi.</i>

553
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,880
Diamond needle.

554
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:38,840
Stereo sound. It comes
in this ear and this one too.

555
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,480
Listen.

556
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:46,440
You know how
I learnt to speak Italian?

557
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:49,720
These guys taught me:
Bobby Solo, Luigi Tenco, Modugno,

558
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:52,200
Vianello.

559
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:56,360
Don<i>'</i>t you ever
forget this, Nene.

560
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,120
Gassman.
Lots of Gassman!

561
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,520
You play Gassman
and babes get...

562
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,280
It<i>'</i>s 211 for the police.

563
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,680
Want me to dial?

564
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,240
<i>Central Police Department...</i>

565
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:36,000
Angel.

566
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,720
Let me in.

567
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:41,480
Are you better?
Cleaning the wound?

568
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,680
Will you go on with this?

569
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:55,200
What do you want me to do?
Tell me. What?

570
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:04,440
Talk to me, Angel.
Say something.

571
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,600
Say something.

572
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:50,120
Lots of queers in this bar.

573
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,040
Do they bother you?

574
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,120
Just an observation.

575
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,320
It<i>'</i>s not the first time
I see you here.

576
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,400
Just an observation.

577
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:06,560
You are not from here.

578
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:09,480
You<i>'</i>re from Argentina.
It<i>'</i>s obvious.

579
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:13,800
Your accent with words like:
Want, can, kiss...

580
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:19,680
- What brings you here?
- I<i>'</i>m passing through with fabrics.

581
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:21,320
Cashmere.

582
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,920
What are you doing here?

583
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:29,560
I live here.
This is my home,

584
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,560
my bed,

585
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,280
my pillow...

586
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:36,640
Let<i>'</i>s sleep together.

587
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,600
You<i>'</i>re handsome, <i>porteòo.</i>

588
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:53,160
If I like a man I think
what our children would be like.

589
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,240
Pale. Clear eyes,

590
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:02,080
like the sun.

591
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:16,360
What<i>'</i>s your name?

592
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:19,440
Giselle, around here.

593
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:23,800
But not for you.
You can make up a name.

594
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:30,880
I<i>'</i>ve got two kids.

595
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:35,240
They don<i>'</i>t look like me.
They look like her.

596
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,280
My wife.

597
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:40,960
I like the way you lie to me.

598
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,360
Most men

599
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,560
Say they<i>'</i>re single

600
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,720
as if I were stupid,

601
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,400
and didn<i>'</i>t know
they were escaping.

602
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:01,520
You like men, don<i>'</i>t you?

603
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:07,400
Sometimes. So what?

604
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:12,520
Are you alone?

605
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:17,480
With my twin brother.

606
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:22,560
<i>Angel. My only family.</i>

607
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,040
He<i>'</i>s always after me.

608
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:33,880
He says I look after him.
Funny.

609
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:39,320
He knows me, the bastard,
as if he<i>'</i>d given birth to me.

610
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:46,080
He knows what I want before I do.
He knows what I<i>'</i>m going to do...

611
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:50,360
Now...

612
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:55,120
It<i>'</i>s hard for me.

613
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:00,000
He<i>'</i>s not an easy guy.

614
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,520
Suddenly...

615
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:08,000
Now he<i>'</i>s not well.

616
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,680
If you talk to him
he won<i>'</i>t answer.

617
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:16,960
He hears voices,

618
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:23,520
but he<i>'</i>s not crazy.

619
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,200
The voices talk normally.

620
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:33,480
They guide him.

621
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:37,840
Sometimes I think

622
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:41,200
I<i>'</i>m one of the voices

623
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:44,840
inside him.

624
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:54,440
I<i>'</i>m the asshole,
I don<i>'</i>t get him.

625
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,800
What more could I want?

626
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:12,160
I<i>'</i>d do anything for him.

627
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:15,720
Anything.

628
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,320
I<i>'</i>d get myself killed.

629
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,480
You<i>'</i>re in love, then.

630
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:50,840
Open them.

631
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:53,920
That<i>'</i>s it, that<i>'</i>s it...

632
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:56,280
That<i>'</i>s it.

633
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:58,600
I<i>'</i>m here, I<i>'</i>m here.

634
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,600
Yes, I<i>'</i>m here.

635
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:12,280
I<i>'</i>m here with you.

636
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:23,560
At 21, he set up a kiosk.
At 22, he got married.

637
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:26,520
At 23, came the baby.
Disgusting, that kid.

638
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:30,160
You know
those garden sprinklers?

639
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:32,440
He was like that
but with vomit.

640
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:35,560
Then the kiosk burned and
he came begging with his baby.

641
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:37,800
Disgusting.
Give me a drink.

642
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:43,560
I said:

643
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:46,720
I have no cash,
but I can give you work.

644
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:50,200
No, he had
his morals and principles...

645
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:52,600
Fuck principles!

646
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:56,080
You must feed the kid, I said,
so he can vomit.

647
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:57,880
Easy on the speed,
there must be cops.

648
01:09:58,040 --> 01:09:58,760
Don<i>'</i>t listen to him.

649
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:01,200
- Step on it.
- You crazy?

650
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,600
Step on it
and let<i>'</i>s get out of here.

651
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,720
No stopping until New York.

652
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:08,240
How far is it? 12,000 km?

653
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,520
12,000! Let<i>'</i>s do it!

654
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:15,000
Wooh! Listen to it.
It<i>'</i>s like the one in <i>Sorpasso!</i>

655
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,640
I always wanted one like this.

656
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,840
Ah, Nene! Gassman!
Nene,

657
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:25,920
Vittorio!

658
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:27,680
What are you doing?

659
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:32,920
I love you but not enough
to let you kill me.

660
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:34,880
You speak Spanish?

661
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:38,720
Next time you fuck up,
I<i>'</i>ll drop you in a ditch.

662
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:00,200
Where<i>'</i>s Cuervo?

663
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:05,240
We have to follow him
around like...

664
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:21,520
And you<i>'</i>re winding him up.
Are you going out tonight?

665
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,960
What do you do at night,
when you go out?

666
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,440
I went to the cinema
the other night.

667
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:36,800
Did you meet people?

668
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:40,760
Do you want mine?

669
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:43,040
Here.

670
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:52,960
I think that...

671
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:55,320
What?

672
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:58,920
Nothing.

673
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,600
Last night...

674
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,360
- Was it tough?
- No.

675
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,440
The usual.

676
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:15,160
Your voices.

677
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:19,080
My voices?

678
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:21,320
Am I the only one
who hears them?

679
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:23,800
What about you?

680
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Don<i>'</i>t you hear voices
making fun of you?

681
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:31,560
Voices that criticize you?
That confuse you? '<i>'</i>That<i>'</i>s wrong.'<i>'</i>

682
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,960
'<i>'</i>lf you carry on like this
you<i>'</i>ll lose him.'<i>'</i>

683
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:36,960
'<i>'</i>He<i>'</i>ll find someone better,
you<i>'</i>ll see.'<i>'</i>

684
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:32,880
Go and get him.
I<i>'</i>ll get the car.

685
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:05,040
...Get out, kid!

686
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,160
It looks different from here.

687
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:20,640
It<i>'</i>s like a Martini ad on TV.

688
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:22,880
I once got drunk on Martini.

689
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:25,640
I thought I<i>'</i>d have blondes
in bikinis

690
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:29,040
coming at me,
and I ended up in a hospital.

691
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:34,560
Oh! I fucked the nurse,

692
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:38,760
she was gorgeous
and had a huge ass.

693
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:40,560
Shall we make a move, guys?

694
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,200
Want me to choke?

695
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:47,640
I don<i>'</i>t see the old man. And I<i>'</i>m sick
of everyone giving me orders.

696
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,440
We<i>'</i>re going.

697
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:54,440
Fuck me, right?

698
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,600
Am I just the driver?

699
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:02,040
I may be untimely, brother,
but I feel it all in here.

700
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:04,680
Do you think
it doesn<i>'</i>t hurt?

701
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,040
That I don<i>'</i>t miss Vivi?
Seeing you on a honeymoon.

702
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,320
I<i>'</i>m not blind.

703
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:14,360
I have to take you for a drive...
to the beach...

704
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:17,040
Look, that lovebite...

705
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,800
You don<i>'</i>t get those marks
carrying heavy bags.

706
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:35,920
I really screwed up.

707
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:39,080
I can only guarantee, Angel,
that I didn<i>'</i>t do it.

708
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:42,960
I may be a lot of things but I don<i>'</i>t
fuck asses that belong to my friends.

709
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:44,280
Or is it his?

710
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:47,440
Who fucks who, here?

711
01:15:58,880 --> 01:15:59,920
Look at me.

712
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:13,440
Why don<i>'</i>t you look at me?

713
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,200
Shit!

714
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:02,240
Put that away.
You<i>'</i>ll fuck everything up.

715
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:06,720
Talk about me but you two
are worse than me.

716
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:10,520
Come on, don<i>'</i>t be an asshole.
Please.

717
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:15,800
Let go. Let go.

718
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:17,600
Good.

719
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,720
Everyone to the floor!
Everyone!

720
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:27,360
To the floor!
Nobody move!

721
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:18,720
May I help you, Sir?

722
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:25,960
Excuse me, Sir!

723
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:02,000
So much history in your skin.

724
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:04,760
Like a book I can read.

725
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:07,120
An open book.

726
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:09,160
With no end.

727
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:12,800
- You think so?
- I don<i>'</i>t know yet, it<i>'</i>s still blank.

728
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:17,040
- It<i>'</i>s uncomfortable to write on.
- I can help you.

729
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:18,760
How?

730
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:22,040
I write on you.
You write on me.

731
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,640
Is that an offer?

732
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:28,640
I have nothing to give you.

733
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,440
How do you know?

734
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,680
I better go.

735
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:38,840
- This isn<i>'</i>t good for you.
- Scared? So?

736
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,600
You<i>'</i>re not the only one.
Fear has us all like this.

737
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:45,160
And you love
someone on top.

738
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:48,840
Hit me. You won<i>'</i>t be the first
or the last...

739
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:52,440
Hit me. Think I care?

740
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:55,040
Pain wears off. It vanishes!

741
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:01,800
Now it<i>'</i>s my turn. Let<i>'</i>s play
your game. Hit me.

742
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,520
Leave me alone.

743
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:26,160
- Come on.
- Leave me alone!

744
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:29,280
I wasn<i>'</i>t going to hit you,
I swear.

745
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,560
You don<i>'</i>t get it,
go away.

746
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:34,040
I don<i>'</i>t know what happened to me.

747
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:37,440
It<i>'</i>s not about you,
leave me alone.

748
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:42,360
I want to die.

749
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:46,520
- Nobody dies here.
- Shut up, stop lying!

750
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:49,880
Nobody<i>'</i>s going to die.

751
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:53,600
What do you care if I die?
Leave me alone.

752
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:54,920
Stop it!

753
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:57,840
Don<i>'</i>t you get it, asshole!
I want to die,

754
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,120
go away!

755
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:34,400
Don<i>'</i>t lie to me, please.
I<i>'</i>ll be left alone and it<i>'</i>s worse.

756
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:42,000
I have a lot of money.

757
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:45,320
I have to get out of here.

758
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:47,800
I don<i>'</i>t have much time.

759
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,600
My brother<i>'</i>s gone.

760
01:21:58,040 --> 01:21:59,800
Come with me.

761
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:16,360
I want you to come.

762
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:22,720
What do we have to lose?

763
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,240
Is it very early,
or very late?

764
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,040
I was waiting for you.

765
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:10,400
Me?

766
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:13,560
I<i>'</i>m leaving,

767
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:16,480
they<i>'</i>ve got Nando.

768
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,360
This place has had it.

769
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:46,720
It<i>'</i>s just my share.

770
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:52,320
The guys?

771
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:55,840
Sleeping.
I was waiting for you.

772
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:57,440
Why me?

773
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:01,360
I can<i>'</i>t talk to the others.

774
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:03,600
They<i>'</i>re grown ups.

775
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:06,680
- They<i>'</i>ll manage.
- They don<i>'</i>t know a soul here.

776
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:08,080
They know Tabare,

777
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:12,640
he<i>'</i>ll be more help than me.
The old man,

778
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:15,360
Losardo,
the Uruguayan,

779
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,280
says if we hand the money over
we can negotiate.

780
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:22,200
I don<i>'</i>t know, and between
the doubt and the money...

781
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,120
You surprise me.

782
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:27,000
Honestly.

783
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:31,320
- I expected more from you.
- What else can I do?

784
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:36,600
To stay is suicide for me
and for you, you know it.

785
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:40,360
Each one must mind
his own ass.

786
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:42,560
It<i>'</i>s for the best.

787
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:49,040
Are we going to kill each other?

788
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:18,280
Don<i>'</i>t get yourself killed,
it<i>'</i>s not worth it.

789
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:30,440
BURNT MONEY

790
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:10,440
Good morning, gentlemen,
Your I. Ds, please?

791
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:14,720
What are you doing?
Tell me, what are you doing?

792
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:16,800
Stop! Police!

793
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:34,760
Step on it!

794
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:37,720
Hang on or I<i>'</i>ll kill you!

795
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:44,560
What are you doing?
Are you crazy? Goddamn you to hell!

796
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:48,240
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

797
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:51,800
I<i>'</i>m the asshole
for trusting you!

798
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:54,880
Fucking retard!
You motherfucker!

799
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:22,920
Coming.

800
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:26,040
Coming!

801
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:31,480
I thought
you weren<i>'</i>t coming.

802
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:41,400
Relax. Everything<i>'</i>s fine.

803
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:44,080
Nothing<i>'</i>s changed.
It<i>'</i>s just a last favour.

804
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:02,560
I wouldn<i>'</i>t do it
if I had a choice.

805
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:11,880
It<i>'</i>s alright.

806
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:14,360
She<i>'</i>ll go out to buy
some things.

807
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:29,440
You<i>'</i>re going soft,

808
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:34,000
you let Tabare go,
he must be talking now.

809
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:38,680
You shoot an LP,

810
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:41,920
now, you let her go!

811
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:44,480
As soon as she sees a cop...

812
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:06,720
Is it you, Nene?

813
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:11,280
It<i>'</i>s me.

814
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:13,960
Angel.

815
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:19,560
I<i>'</i>ll go psychotic,

816
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:23,480
I<i>'</i>ll lose my mind.

817
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,480
Are you listening?

818
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:42,400
ARGENTINE GANG STRIKES
AT THE BEACH

819
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,280
I was going to tell you.

820
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:48,200
You<i>'</i>d better stay
elsewhere a few days.

821
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:50,720
- Got somewhere to go?
- Who cares?

822
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,480
You got me in this, now.

823
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:55,880
- It<i>'</i>s only for two days.
- The police won<i>'</i>t care.

824
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:58,480
Then we<i>'</i>ll go as planned.

825
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:02,800
- I<i>'</i>ll give you money for a hotel.
- Just what I expected.

826
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:06,520
It<i>'</i>s all the whore needs.
As long as there<i>'</i>s money...

827
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:10,240
Why did you lie to me?
All you wanted was a house.

828
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:13,520
O.K. I<i>'</i>ll go.

829
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:17,640
Where?
Where will you go?

830
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:21,960
You don<i>'</i>t get it. With those two,
you wouldn<i>'</i>t get past the corner.

831
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:26,720
My cousin has a house
in Rio Branco

832
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:30,640
close to the Brazilian border,
it<i>'</i>s safe.

833
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:35,560
I know how to cross
avoiding any controls.

834
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:39,360
We could go...
but not all of us.

835
01:31:40,360 --> 01:31:44,480
The cops are looking for 4 men,
a couple has a chance.

836
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:47,080
Man, woman, you and I...

837
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:50,880
- Would you do that for me?
- Yes.

838
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:54,000
- You could get killed.
- Yes.

839
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:58,000
What<i>'</i>s up, Angel?

840
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,680
Is that Angel?
Your twin brother?

841
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:11,440
I<i>'</i>m Giselle.
Did he tell you about me?

842
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:16,680
No, I see he hasn<i>'</i>t.
Giselle is a secret,

843
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:21,560
but he told me about you.

844
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:25,120
Is it true you hear voices?

845
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:28,640
What do they say?
I<i>'</i>m curious.

846
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,080
Shut up.

847
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:33,880
He suffers for you.
Did you know?

848
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:36,360
He says he can<i>'</i>t understand you,

849
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:38,880
that<i>'</i>s why he wanted
to leave with me.

850
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:41,000
He<i>'</i>d had enough.
We were...

851
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:42,360
Shut up!

852
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:45,800
Let her talk...

853
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:04,760
Angel!

854
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:06,600
Wait for me.

855
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:09,480
You have to choose.

856
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,280
Fag!

857
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:39,360
Fucking fag!

858
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:44,240
Go, it<i>'</i>s better for you.

859
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:46,800
Fag!

860
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:52,240
Be careful who you talk to.

861
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:56,720
If you talk,
I<i>'</i>ll find you wherever you go.

862
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:58,200
Fag!

863
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:02,200
If you talk, I<i>'</i>ll find you.

864
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:22,040
It<i>'</i>s me.

865
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:26,800
Forgive me.

866
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:32,920
Forgive me, please.

867
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:48,440
Has she gone?

868
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:50,720
Yes.

869
01:34:56,240 --> 01:34:58,120
- Is she coming back?
- No.

870
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:09,640
- Did you care for her?
- No.

871
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,960
She was just a place to hide,
that<i>'</i>s all.

872
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:25,520
<i>Truco, goddamn it!</i>

873
01:35:29,120 --> 01:35:33,440
Candy from a baby...
We<i>'</i>ve got to teach the kid.

874
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:35,040
Hey, can you play <i>Truco,</i>

875
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:37,520
it<i>'</i>s our national card game.

876
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:40,400
You<i>'</i>ll never understand
Argentines if you don<i>'</i>t learn.

877
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:43,920
First you must learn a few rules.
The strong cards

878
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:48,160
are the ace of swords,
the ace of clubs...

879
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:50,680
- The 7 of swords.
- Aren<i>'</i>t we going?

880
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:52,600
Wait up. It<i>'</i>s still early!

881
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:56,000
This is how you count <i>envido,</i>

882
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:57,440
like this, you see,

883
01:35:58,400 --> 01:35:59,840
this would be 27.

884
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:03,160
When you<i>'</i>ve learnt the rules,
the different bets

885
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:04,960
and hands...

886
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:08,080
Then you shove all the rules

887
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:10,600
up your ass.
You have to lie!

888
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:14,360
The one who lies best wins.

889
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:15,960
<i>That is the question.</i>

890
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:36,680
Nobody there.

891
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:42,640
Don<i>'</i>t answer it.

892
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:44,680
It may be a client
of your friend<i>'</i>s.

893
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:46,480
We can rob him.

894
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,120
Who is it?

895
01:36:54,760 --> 01:36:57,200
- They say it<i>'</i>s the police.
- Are they selling raffles?

896
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:03,000
The lights!
Turn off the lights!

897
01:37:38,160 --> 01:37:41,920
<i>Fontana, Salvo, Di Pasquo,</i>
<i>Brizuela.</i>

898
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:45,680
<i>I repeat: We know</i>
<i>you're in apartment 9,</i>

899
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:49,920
<i>you're completely surrounded,</i>

900
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:52,880
<i>you've got no escape.</i>

901
01:37:58,400 --> 01:37:59,720
- The hall?
- Full of cops.

902
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:01,360
- The roof too.
- Thousands.

903
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:02,280
This is it.

904
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:05,800
A bullet for each cop.

905
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,040
World War III.
About time.

906
01:38:10,040 --> 01:38:11,040
Take it easy.

907
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:13,040
They can<i>'</i>t touch us
while we have the money.

908
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:34,720
They<i>'</i>re like ants.

909
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:37,080
All Montevideo<i>'</i>s police
must be out there...

910
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:39,480
Go to work!
You bullies!

911
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:43,800
Give me a drink.

912
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:50,320
Let<i>'</i>s shoot!

913
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:52,120
Wait! I<i>'</i>ll tell you when.

914
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:55,080
Chancho!

915
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:59,400
We<i>'</i>ve got your money!

916
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:15,440
<i>I repeat, you can let us</i>
<i>know your decision</i>

917
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:18,440
<i>by waving a handkerchief</i>

918
01:39:19,640 --> 01:39:23,640
<i>or picking up the phone.</i>

919
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:29,680
<i>If we have no answer</i>
<i>in five minutes...</i>

920
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:31,240
Shut up! Christ!

921
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:53,000
Give me stuff to burn,

922
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:55,000
so the gases go upwards.

923
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:43,920
Bravo!

924
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:46,560
Bravo!

925
01:43:33,720 --> 01:43:35,600
You<i>'</i>re like
the last of the Mohicans.

926
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:27,080
Police Station 22...

927
01:44:28,040 --> 01:44:31,200
She<i>'</i>s here. Perfectly...

928
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:41,680
You can go now.

929
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:16,600
I can<i>'</i>t hear anything.

930
01:45:22,040 --> 01:45:25,040
The voices, they<i>'</i>ve gone.

931
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:32,320
Perfect silence.

932
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:37,520
Why whisper?

933
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:40,800
So I don<i>'</i>t wake them.

934
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:13,320
What is it?

935
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:18,320
You just lean on me
and I get a hard one.

936
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:20,640
It<i>'</i>s mathematical!

937
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:38,240
Me too.

938
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:46,840
It<i>'</i>s not the best time.

939
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:08,840
We were close.

940
01:47:11,360 --> 01:47:12,920
'<i>'</i>Were'<i>'</i>?

941
01:47:14,440 --> 01:47:17,080
We<i>'</i>re not through yet.

942
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:20,080
We still have the money.

943
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:37,200
Now, come on!

944
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:39,120
You first, I<i>'</i>ll cover you.

945
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:57,000
Angel!

946
01:47:59,160 --> 01:48:00,160
Angel!

947
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:02,080
I<i>'</i>m fine!

948
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:04,560
Come back!

949
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:07,600
We<i>'</i>re coming!

950
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:11,440
Are you crazy?

951

Are you deaf?

960
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:45,320
Finish me off and go.

961
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:50,480
I don<i>'</i>t want to be patched up
and end up in jail again.

962
01:48:51,920 --> 01:48:52,680
Angel!

963
01:48:53,720 --> 01:48:56,480
Give me the gun then.
This one.

964

I<i>'</i>m rich!

965

<i>The gang has displayed</i>

Is that what you want?

Sons of a bitch!

988
01:51:42,360 --> 01:51:44,720
You want the money?
Is that what you wanted?

989
01:52:10,720 --> 01:52:11,640
Careful!

990
01:52:34,640 --> 01:52:35,520
Nene...

991
01:52:36,760 --> 01:52:38,000
are you alright?

992
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:42,960
Yeah...

and you?

994
01:52:46,680 --> 01:52:47,640
Yes.

995
01:52:58,560 --> 01:52:59,600
Move away from there.

996
01:53:13,240 --> 01:53:14,680
Nene, listen to me.

997
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:17,240
Can you hear me?

998
01:53:22,160 --> 01:53:24,080
I<i>'</i>ll get you out of here.

999
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:27,760
Do you think
I<i>'</i>d leave without you?

1000
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:34,360
Can you imagine Chancho<i>'</i>s face
when he sees just ashes?

1001
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:37,360
Nene...

1002
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:48,120

1003
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:51,480
voices...

1004
01:53:53,320 --> 01:53:54,720
Shut up!

1005
01:53:58,120 --> 01:53:59,040
There.

1006
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:02,600
There are no voices,
not any more.

1007
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:06,040
You can<i>'</i>t hear them anymore,
can you?

1008
01:54:10,840 --> 01:54:14,640
Hail Mary, full of grace
the Lord is with thee.

1009
01:54:15,160 --> 01:54:17,560
Blessed art thou
amongst women

1010
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:20,040
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

1011
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:22,520
Holy Mary, Mother of God,

1012
01:54:22,680 --> 01:54:26,960
pray for us sinners now
and at the hour of our death...

1013
01:54:39,320 --> 01:54:41,920
Yes, of course.

1014
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:46,640
Always, what did you expect?

1015
01:54:47,800 --> 01:54:49,360
We<i>'</i>re nearly there,

1016
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:51,480
we<i>'</i>re almost there.

1017
01:54:52,280 --> 01:54:54,520
In a few minutes
we<i>'</i>ll be far away from here.

1018

You<i>'</i>ll see.
You<i>'</i>ll see

1019

You<i>'</i>ll see how far we<i>'</i>ll be.
