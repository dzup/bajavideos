1
00:02:03,127 --> 00:02:04,879
Can I help you, ma'am?

2
00:02:05,527 --> 00:02:08,997
Well, they told me to take
a streetcar named Desire...

3
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:11,556
...and then transfer
to one called Cemeteries...

4
00:02:11,727 --> 00:02:15,606
...and ride six blocks
and get off at Elysian Fields.

5
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:16,882
There's your car now.

6
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:28,880
Thank you.

7
00:03:05,007 --> 00:03:07,043
When he got home, she was waiting.

8
00:03:07,207 --> 00:03:09,960
Boy, you never heard nothing like that.

9
00:03:15,607 --> 00:03:17,325
What's the matter, honey?
You lost?

10
00:03:17,487 --> 00:03:19,478
I'm looking for Elysian Fields.

11
00:03:19,647 --> 00:03:22,161
This is Elysian Fields.
What number you looking for?

12
00:03:22,407 --> 00:03:24,125
Six forty-two.

13
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,482
You don't need to look no further.

14
00:03:27,127 --> 00:03:31,200
I'm looking for my sister, Stella DuBois.
I mean, Mrs. Stanley Kowalski.

15
00:03:31,407 --> 00:03:35,525
Yeah, that's the party, all right.
You just did miss her, though.

16
00:03:35,927 --> 00:03:37,360
Yes?

17
00:03:38,447 --> 00:03:42,599
- Can this be her home?
- She got the downstairs. I got the up.

18
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:44,723
Oh, she's out?

19
00:03:44,887 --> 00:03:47,117
You notice that bowling alley
up the street?

20
00:03:47,287 --> 00:03:49,801
- I'm not sure I did.
- Well, that's where she's at, honey.

21
00:03:49,967 --> 00:03:52,003
She's watching her husband bowl.

22
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:03,205
Blanche!

23
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:08,085
Blanche, honey!

24
00:04:08,367 --> 00:04:11,677
- Stella. Oh, Stella for star!
- Blanche!

25
00:04:11,847 --> 00:04:15,965
Oh, my darling. Now, let me look at you.
But don't you look at me, Stella. No, no!

26
00:04:16,127 --> 00:04:19,164
- I won't be seen in this merciless glare.
- Did you find our place?

27
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,079
What are you doing in a place like that?

28
00:04:21,247 --> 00:04:23,761
Never, never, never
in my worst dreams did I picture...

29
00:04:23,927 --> 00:04:27,363
Only Poe. Only Mr. Edgar Allan Poe
could do justice to it.

30
00:04:27,527 --> 00:04:29,404
What are you doing
in that horrible place?

31
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,637
Oh, what am I saying?
I didn't mean to say that.

32
00:04:31,807 --> 00:04:34,924
I meant to be nice and say,
"What a convenient location," and such.

33
00:04:35,087 --> 00:04:37,920
- You haven't said a word to me.
- You haven't given me a chance to.

34
00:04:38,087 --> 00:04:41,477
- Open your pretty mouth and talk.
- Come say hello to Stanley first.

35
00:04:41,647 --> 00:04:43,922
- No, not now. Not now.
- Just say hello.

36
00:04:44,087 --> 00:04:47,124
Oh, which is he?
Which one is he?

37
00:04:52,287 --> 00:04:55,916
- Is he the one that's...
- The one that's making all the rhubarb.

38
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,237
Isn't he wonderful-looking?

39
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:06,716
Stella, I can't meet him now.
Not till I've bathed and rested.

40
00:05:06,887 --> 00:05:10,323
- Would you like a cold drink?
- Oh, bless you for that lovely inspiration.

41
00:05:14,887 --> 00:05:17,037
Oh, my baby, my baby.

42
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:19,766
Would you like some pop?

43
00:05:19,927 --> 00:05:22,043
Honey. Pop?

44
00:05:22,207 --> 00:05:24,437
Not with my nerves tonight.
Scotch for me, please.

45
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,165
Grape.

46
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:31,242
You haven't asked me how I got away
from school before the spring term ended.

47
00:05:31,407 --> 00:05:34,843
I thought you'd volunteer that
information if you want to tell me.

48
00:05:35,007 --> 00:05:39,125
- You thought I'd been fired?
- No. I thought you might have resigned.

49
00:05:39,287 --> 00:05:43,485
Oh, I was so exhausted
by all I'd been through, my nerves broke.

50
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:47,560
I was on the verge of lunacy, almost.

51
00:05:47,727 --> 00:05:48,921
So Mr. Graves...

52
00:05:49,087 --> 00:05:50,998
Mr. Graves is the high school
superintendent.

53
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:52,725
Thank you. He suggested l...

54
00:05:54,207 --> 00:05:55,606
I take a leave of absence.

55
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:57,758
I couldn't put all those
details into the wire.

56
00:05:57,927 --> 00:05:59,918
This buzzes right through me
and feels so good.

57
00:06:00,087 --> 00:06:02,920
- Would you like another?
- One's my limit.

58
00:06:03,087 --> 00:06:04,918
You haven't said a word
about my appearance.

59
00:06:05,087 --> 00:06:07,840
- You look just fine.
- God love you for a liar.

60
00:06:08,007 --> 00:06:10,475
Daylight never exposed so total a ruin.

61
00:06:10,647 --> 00:06:12,797
But you...
You put on some weight. Yes.

62
00:06:12,967 --> 00:06:16,277
You're just as plump as a little partridge.
It's so becoming to you too.

63
00:06:16,447 --> 00:06:19,439
- Oh, Blanche.
- Yes, it is. Or I wouldn't say it. You...

64
00:06:19,607 --> 00:06:22,326
...just have to
watch around the hips a little.

65
00:06:22,487 --> 00:06:24,239
I want you to look at my
figure, you know?

66
00:06:24,407 --> 00:06:26,398
I haven't put on one ounce
in 10 years, Stella.

67
00:06:26,567 --> 00:06:29,559
I weigh now what I weighed
the summer you left Belle Reve.

68
00:06:29,727 --> 00:06:31,604
The summer Dad died...

69
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,519
...and you left us.

70
00:06:38,487 --> 00:06:41,877
It's just incredible, Blanche,
how well you look.

71
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:47,759
- Sure you wouldn't like another?
- Well...

72
00:06:47,927 --> 00:06:50,395
Well, maybe I will just
take one tiny nip more.

73
00:06:50,567 --> 00:06:53,365
Just to put the stopper on,
so to speak. Now, don't get worried.

74
00:06:53,527 --> 00:06:56,599
Your sister hasn't turned into a drunkard.
She's just all shaken up...

75
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:00,077
...and hot and dirty and tired.

76
00:07:00,647 --> 00:07:02,126
Waiter.

77
00:07:02,447 --> 00:07:03,926
Waiter.

78
00:07:07,287 --> 00:07:10,040
- You want it hot?
- Scalding.

79
00:07:13,287 --> 00:07:15,676
- Stella.
- What is it, hon?

80
00:07:15,847 --> 00:07:18,884
There's only two rooms.
I don't see where you're gonna put me.

81
00:07:19,047 --> 00:07:20,719
We'll put you right here.

82
00:07:20,887 --> 00:07:24,562
What kind of a bed's this?
One of those collapsible beds?

83
00:07:24,727 --> 00:07:26,922
- Feel all right?
- Wonderful, honey.

84
00:07:27,087 --> 00:07:29,078
I don't like a bed that gives much.

85
00:07:29,687 --> 00:07:32,520
Stella, there's no door between
the two rooms, and Stanley...

86
00:07:32,687 --> 00:07:35,485
- Will it be decent?
- Oh, Stanley's Polish, you know.

87
00:07:35,647 --> 00:07:37,717
Oh, yeah.
Something like Irish, isn't it?

88
00:07:37,887 --> 00:07:39,286
Well...

89
00:07:39,447 --> 00:07:42,757
I bought some nice clothes
to meet all your lovely friends in.

90
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:44,520
Well...

91
00:07:44,687 --> 00:07:46,484
I'm afraid
you won't think they're lovely.

92
00:07:46,647 --> 00:07:49,605
Well, anyway, I bought nice clothes
and I'll wear them.

93
00:07:50,407 --> 00:07:53,046
I guess you're hoping I'll say
I'll put up at a hotel.

94
00:07:53,207 --> 00:07:56,358
I'm not going to put up at a hotel.
I've got to be near you, Stella.

95
00:07:56,527 --> 00:07:59,758
I've got to be with people.
I can't be alone because...

96
00:08:00,127 --> 00:08:02,436
Because as you must have noticed, l...

97
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,359
I'm not very well.

98
00:08:05,127 --> 00:08:07,163
You do seem a little...

99
00:08:07,727 --> 00:08:09,445
Will Stanley like me...

100
00:08:09,607 --> 00:08:12,724
...or will I just be a visiting in-law?
I couldn't stand that, Stella.

101
00:08:13,087 --> 00:08:16,557
You'll get along fine together.
If you just try not to compare him...

102
00:08:16,727 --> 00:08:18,877
- Oh, he was an officer?
- He was master sergeant...

103
00:08:19,047 --> 00:08:21,766
...in the Engineers Corps,
decorated four times.

104
00:08:21,927 --> 00:08:23,679
He had those on when you met him?

105
00:08:23,847 --> 00:08:26,441
I assure you I wasn't just blinded
by all the brass.

106
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:28,518
- Oh, that's not what l...
- Of course, there...

107
00:08:28,687 --> 00:08:31,406
There were things
to adjust myself to later on.

108
00:08:31,807 --> 00:08:34,685
Such as his civilian background.

109
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,803
How did he take it
when you said I was coming?

110
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:39,765
- Oh, he's on the road a good deal.
- Oh, he travels?

111
00:08:40,247 --> 00:08:42,363
Good. I mean, isn't it?

112
00:08:42,527 --> 00:08:45,280
I can hardly stand it
when he's away for a night.

113
00:08:45,447 --> 00:08:46,641
Oh, Stella.

114
00:08:46,807 --> 00:08:49,037
When he's away for a week,
I nearly go wild.

115
00:08:49,207 --> 00:08:51,357
- Gracious.
- When he comes back...

116
00:08:51,527 --> 00:08:54,360
...I cry in his lap like a baby.

117
00:08:55,447 --> 00:08:57,881
I guess that's what's meant
by being in love.

118
00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:03,125
Stella.

119
00:09:05,327 --> 00:09:08,763
I haven't asked you the things you
probably thought I was going to ask...

120
00:09:08,927 --> 00:09:13,443
...so I'll expect you to be understanding
about what I have to tell you.

121
00:09:13,607 --> 00:09:14,835
What, Blanche?

122
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:19,364
You'll reproach me. I know you're bound
to reproach me, but before you do...

123
00:09:19,527 --> 00:09:22,644
...take into consideration you left.
I stayed and struggled.

124
00:09:22,807 --> 00:09:25,082
You came to New Orleans
and looked out for yourself.

125
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,602
I stayed at Belle Reve
and tried to hold it together.

126
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:30,122
Oh, I'm not meaning this
in any reproachful way.

127
00:09:30,287 --> 00:09:34,246
- But the burden fell on my shoulders.
- Best I could do was make my own living.

128
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,716
But you were the one
that abandoned Belle Reve, not I.

129
00:09:36,887 --> 00:09:38,957
I fought for it,
bled for it, almost died for it.

130
00:09:39,127 --> 00:09:40,879
Stop this outburst.
Tell me what happened.

131
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:44,881
- I knew you'd take this attitude about it.
- About what? Please!

132
00:09:46,047 --> 00:09:47,639
The loss.

133
00:09:49,287 --> 00:09:50,720
The loss.

134
00:09:51,087 --> 00:09:53,999
Belle Reve? Lost, is it?

135
00:09:56,407 --> 00:09:57,681
Yes, Stella.

136
00:09:58,687 --> 00:10:01,042
But how did it go? What happened?

137
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:04,321
- You're a fine one to ask me how it went.
- Blanche.

138
00:10:04,487 --> 00:10:06,762
You're a fine one to stand there
accusing me of it.

139
00:10:06,927 --> 00:10:09,395
- I won't stay in this house.
- Blanche!

140
00:10:14,727 --> 00:10:17,241
- Blanche.
- I, I, I took the blows...

141
00:10:17,407 --> 00:10:19,238
...on my face and my body.

142
00:10:19,407 --> 00:10:23,480
All of those deaths,
the long parade to the graveyard.

143
00:10:23,647 --> 00:10:27,560
Father, Mother,
Margaret, that dreadful way...

144
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,161
You just came home
in time for funerals, Stella.

145
00:10:30,327 --> 00:10:32,887
And funerals are pretty
compared to deaths.

146
00:10:33,047 --> 00:10:36,323
How do you think all that sickness
and dying was paid for?

147
00:10:36,487 --> 00:10:38,557
Death is expensive, Miss Stella.

148
00:10:38,727 --> 00:10:42,163
And I, with my pitiful salary
at the school...

149
00:10:42,647 --> 00:10:44,000
Yes, accuse me.

150
00:10:44,167 --> 00:10:47,079
Stand there and stare at me,
thinking I let the place go.

151
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:49,522
I let the place go? Where were you?

152
00:10:49,687 --> 00:10:52,804
- In there with your Polack.
- Blanche, be still. That's enough.

153
00:10:52,967 --> 00:10:56,482
- Stella. Stella, you're crying?
- Does that surprise you?

154
00:10:58,207 --> 00:11:00,163
Mitch, we gonna play
at your house tomorrow?

155
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,283
No, not at my house.
My mother's still sick.

156
00:11:02,447 --> 00:11:04,961
- All right, you bring the beer.
- Break it up down there.

157
00:11:05,127 --> 00:11:08,403
- I made that spaghetti and ate it myself.
- Now, honey, I told you...

158
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,956
...and told you
we were playing Jack's beer.

159
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:14,642
What's so funny?
You never phoned me once.

160
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,763
I told you at breakfast.
I phoned you at lunch.

161
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,519
Why don't you get yourself in here!

162
00:11:18,687 --> 00:11:21,997
- Do you want it in the newspapers?
- I'm sick and tired of chasing you.

163
00:11:38,007 --> 00:11:39,918
You must be Stanley.

164
00:11:40,087 --> 00:11:41,645
I'm Blanche.

165
00:11:42,087 --> 00:11:43,805
Oh, you're Stella's sister.

166
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:45,486
Yes.

167
00:11:46,007 --> 00:11:47,486
Oh, hiya.

168
00:11:47,647 --> 00:11:49,319
Yeah, where's the little woman?

169
00:11:50,487 --> 00:11:52,239
In the bathroom.

170
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,841
- Well, where you from, Blanche?
- Why, I...

171
00:11:58,007 --> 00:11:59,326
I live in Auriol.

172
00:11:59,767 --> 00:12:01,883
In Auriol. Auriol, huh?

173
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:05,477
Oh, yeah, that's right. Auriol.
That's not my territory.

174
00:12:06,007 --> 00:12:08,726
Man, liquor goes fast
in the hot weather.

175
00:12:09,047 --> 00:12:12,119
- You want a shot?
- No, I rarely touch it.

176
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:17,205
Well, there's some people that rarely
touch it, but it touches them often.

177
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:23,755
Mind if I make myself comfortable?
My shirt is sticking...

178
00:12:23,927 --> 00:12:25,645
Please. Please do.

179
00:12:25,807 --> 00:12:28,082
"Be comfortable." That's my motto,
where I come from.

180
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,796
It's mine too. It's hard to stay
looking fresh in hot weather.

181
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:34,117
Why, I haven't washed
or even powdered...

182
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:36,084
...and here you are.

183
00:12:36,647 --> 00:12:40,356
You gotta be careful. You sitting around
in a damp thing, you catch a cold.

184
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:43,599
Especially when you been
exercising hard, like bowling is.

185
00:12:44,887 --> 00:12:48,084
- Well, you're the teacher, aren't you?
- Yes.

186
00:12:48,247 --> 00:12:51,444
- What do you teach?
- English.

187
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:53,956
Well, I never was a very good
English student.

188
00:12:55,607 --> 00:12:58,679
- How long you here for?
- Why, I don't know yet.

189
00:12:58,967 --> 00:13:00,286
You gonna shack up here?

190
00:13:01,127 --> 00:13:04,085
I thought I would,
if it's not inconvenient for you all.

191
00:13:04,887 --> 00:13:06,240
Good.

192
00:13:09,407 --> 00:13:11,159
Traveling wears me out.

193
00:13:11,927 --> 00:13:14,680
- Well, take it easy.
- What was that?

194
00:13:16,887 --> 00:13:18,718
Oh, those cats.

195
00:13:23,287 --> 00:13:27,678
Hey, Stella.
What did you do, fall asleep in there?

196
00:13:31,287 --> 00:13:34,518
Well, I guess I'm gonna strike you
as being the unrefined type, huh?

197
00:13:36,407 --> 00:13:39,922
You know,
Stella spoke a good deal about you.

198
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:43,078
She said you were married once,
weren't you?

199
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:49,520
Yes.

200
00:13:50,327 --> 00:13:52,204
When I was quite young.

201
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:53,766
Yeah? What happened?

202
00:13:53,927 --> 00:13:56,395
- <i>Yeah? What happened?</i>
- The boy...

203
00:13:57,167 --> 00:13:58,919
The boy died.

204
00:14:14,607 --> 00:14:16,245
I'm afraid l...

205
00:14:17,447 --> 00:14:19,278
I'm going to be sick.

206
00:14:20,887 --> 00:14:26,280
Fresh fish! Fresh fish! Fresh fish!

207
00:14:36,727 --> 00:14:38,957
- Looks like she's fixing to stay a while.
- Yeah.

208
00:14:39,127 --> 00:14:40,879
- Hey, Stan, are we playing tonight?
- Yeah.

209
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,321
Well, I figured maybe we...

210
00:14:42,487 --> 00:14:44,557
- Forget about maybe. It's the same.
- Stanley!

211
00:14:44,727 --> 00:14:46,080
- Oh, hi, Steve.
- Put it down.

212
00:14:46,247 --> 00:14:48,238
- Now I'll go get the other one?
- Yes.

213
00:14:48,407 --> 00:14:50,363
- Thanks, darling.
- Stella?

214
00:14:50,527 --> 00:14:52,882
- Yes?
- Is that Stanley back with my trunk?

215
00:14:53,047 --> 00:14:54,685
- Yes, Blanche.
- Honey...

216
00:14:54,847 --> 00:14:58,317
...will you get my blue net out for me?
- All right, Blanche.

217
00:14:58,487 --> 00:15:00,762
It was so good of Stanley
to call for my trunk.

218
00:15:00,927 --> 00:15:03,122
He was glad to do it.

219
00:15:03,287 --> 00:15:05,676
- I'll see you later.
- All right. Listen, don't forget.

220
00:15:05,847 --> 00:15:08,520
Honey, I'm taking Blanche
to Galatoire's for supper tonight...

221
00:15:08,687 --> 00:15:10,996
...and then to a show
because it's your poker night.

222
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:13,840
How about my supper?
I'm not going to Galatoire's tonight.

223
00:15:14,007 --> 00:15:15,918
I put you a cold plate on ice.

224
00:15:16,087 --> 00:15:18,965
I'm gonna try to keep Blanche
out until the party breaks up.

225
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:22,039
- I don't know how she'll take it.
- Isn't that just dandy?

226
00:15:22,207 --> 00:15:24,084
So you'd better give me some money.

227
00:15:24,247 --> 00:15:25,441
Hey, where is she now?

228
00:15:25,607 --> 00:15:28,565
She's soaking in a hot tub
to quiet her nerves.

229
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:30,285
She's terribly upset.

230
00:15:30,447 --> 00:15:31,766
Over what?

231
00:15:31,927 --> 00:15:35,158
She's been through such an ordeal.
We lost Belle Reve.

232
00:15:35,607 --> 00:15:37,996
What, the place in the country?

233
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:40,727
- Well, how?
- It had to be sacrificed or something.

234
00:15:40,887 --> 00:15:44,482
Honey, look. When she comes in, say
something nice about her appearance.

235
00:15:44,647 --> 00:15:47,241
And, oh, don't mention the baby.

236
00:15:47,407 --> 00:15:51,002
I haven't said anything yet. I'm waiting
until she gets in a quieter condition.

237
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:54,477
- Try to understand her and be nice to her.
- All right.

238
00:15:54,647 --> 00:15:56,683
She wasn't expecting
to find us in such a place.

239
00:15:56,847 --> 00:15:59,077
- All right.
- I tried to gloss things over a little...

240
00:15:59,247 --> 00:16:00,316
...in my letters.

241
00:16:00,487 --> 00:16:03,479
Admire her dress.
Tell her she's looking wonderful.

242
00:16:03,647 --> 00:16:06,286
It's important to Blanche.
Her little weakness.

243
00:16:06,447 --> 00:16:08,915
Okay, honey, I get the idea, but...

244
00:16:09,087 --> 00:16:12,477
Now, let's just skip back a little, the way
you said the place was disposed of.

245
00:16:12,647 --> 00:16:13,841
Oh, yeah.

246
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:16,601
Well, how about
a few more details on that subject?

247
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:20,601
Honey, look, it's best not to talk much
about it until she's calmed down.

248
00:16:20,767 --> 00:16:24,806
Is that gonna be the deal? Sister Blanche
can't be annoyed with details right now?

249
00:16:24,967 --> 00:16:27,037
Well, you saw how she was last night.

250
00:16:27,207 --> 00:16:30,438
I saw how she was. Now, let's
cop a gander at the bill of sale.

251
00:16:30,607 --> 00:16:32,484
I haven't seen any.

252
00:16:32,647 --> 00:16:36,003
What do you mean? She didn't show you
papers, deed of sale, nothing like that?

253
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:37,998
Seemed like it wasn't sold.

254
00:16:38,167 --> 00:16:40,522
Well, now, what was it, then?
Giveaway to charity?

255
00:16:40,687 --> 00:16:42,803
- She'll hear you.
- I don't care if she hears me.

256
00:16:42,967 --> 00:16:45,720
- Now, let's see the papers.
- Honey, there weren't any papers.

257
00:16:45,887 --> 00:16:49,004
She didn't show any papers.
I don't care about papers.

258
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:52,477
Wait. Now, listen, did you ever hear
of the Napoleonic Code, Stella?

259
00:16:52,647 --> 00:16:55,798
- I haven't heard of the Napoleonic Code.
- All right. Okay, then.

260
00:16:55,967 --> 00:16:58,720
- Let me enlighten you on a point or two.
- Yes?

261
00:16:58,887 --> 00:17:02,482
We got here in the state of Louisiana
what's known as the Napoleonic Code.

262
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:05,844
According to which, what belongs to
the wife belongs to the husband also...

263
00:17:06,007 --> 00:17:07,360
...and vice versa.

264
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,040
Will you listen.

265
00:17:09,207 --> 00:17:11,323
Take, for instance, I had
that piece of property...

266
00:17:11,487 --> 00:17:13,842
My head is swimming.

267
00:17:14,887 --> 00:17:17,276
Oh, well, all right, dear.

268
00:17:17,447 --> 00:17:18,721
Okay.

269
00:17:19,207 --> 00:17:21,596
We'll wait till she's through
soaking in the hot tub...

270
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:25,237
...then I'm gonna inquire if she's
acquainted with the Napoleonic Code.

271
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:27,364
Oh, Stanley, don't be so silly.

272
00:17:27,527 --> 00:17:30,405
It looks to me like you been swindled.
And when you get swindled...

273
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:33,798
...under Napoleonic Code, I get swindled
too. I don't like to get swindled.

274
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:35,161
Oh, Stanley...

275
00:17:35,327 --> 00:17:37,841
...you've no idea how ridiculous
you're being...

276
00:17:38,007 --> 00:17:39,645
...when you suggest that my sister...

277
00:17:39,807 --> 00:17:43,436
...or I or anyone else of our family could
have perpetrated a swindle on anyone.

278
00:17:43,607 --> 00:17:46,724
Oh, come on, now. Where's the money
if the place was sold?

279
00:17:46,887 --> 00:17:48,878
Not sold. Lost!

280
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:50,275
- Lost.
- Come here.

281
00:17:50,447 --> 00:17:53,837
- Stanley.
- Will you open your eyes to this stuff?

282
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:56,726
- What, she got this out of teacher's pay?
- Oh, hush.

283
00:17:56,887 --> 00:18:00,562
Look at these fine feathers and furs
that she comes to preen herself in here?

284
00:18:00,727 --> 00:18:03,560
What is this article?
That's a solid-gold dress, I believe.

285
00:18:03,727 --> 00:18:06,958
- Oh, honest.
- This one here. What is that, a fox piece?

286
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,595
- Stanley!
- A genuine fur fox a half a mile long.

287
00:18:09,767 --> 00:18:11,883
Where are your fox pieces?

288
00:18:12,047 --> 00:18:15,323
This is bushy snow-white ones, no less.
Where are your white fox furs?

289
00:18:15,487 --> 00:18:19,116
Those are inexpensive summer furs
that Blanche has had a long time.

290
00:18:19,287 --> 00:18:22,085
I have an acquaintance who deals
in this sort of merchandise.

291
00:18:22,247 --> 00:18:25,523
- He's coming to make an appraisal.
- Don't be such an idiot, Stanley.

292
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:29,600
Listen, I'm gonna bet you there's
a thousand dollars invested in this stuff.

293
00:18:29,767 --> 00:18:32,565
Well, now, what is that?
That's the treasure chest of a pirate?

294
00:18:32,727 --> 00:18:35,844
- Oh, Stanley. Would you...?
- That's pearls, Stella. Ropes of them.

295
00:18:36,287 --> 00:18:38,596
What is this sister of yours,
a deep-sea diver?

296
00:18:38,767 --> 00:18:41,679
Bracelets, solid gold. Where are
your pearls and gold bracelets?

297
00:18:41,847 --> 00:18:43,166
Be still, Stanley.

298
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,318
And here. Diamonds.
A crown for an empress.

299
00:18:45,487 --> 00:18:48,923
A rhinestone tiara
she wore to a costume ball.

300
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:51,601
- What is rhinestone?
- Next door to glass.

301
00:18:51,767 --> 00:18:52,995
Yeah.

302
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:56,125
I have an acquaintance who works in
a jewelry store and he's coming...

303
00:18:56,287 --> 00:18:57,959
...to make an appraisal of that stuff.

304
00:18:58,127 --> 00:19:03,076
- Here's your plantation fella, right here.
- You know l... Stupid and horrid.

305
00:19:03,247 --> 00:19:06,284
You stay away from these things
before she comes out of the bathroom.

306
00:19:06,447 --> 00:19:09,166
The Kowalskis and the DuBois
got a different notion on this.

307
00:19:09,327 --> 00:19:12,876
Indeed they have, thank heavens.
I'm going outside.

308
00:19:13,767 --> 00:19:15,200
Go ahead.

309
00:19:17,687 --> 00:19:20,485
You come on out with me
while Blanche is getting dressed.

310
00:19:20,647 --> 00:19:23,161
Now, since when
are you giving me orders?

311
00:19:23,327 --> 00:19:26,319
Are you gonna stay here
and insult her?

312
00:19:26,487 --> 00:19:28,717
You bet your life I'm gonna stay here.

313
00:19:44,447 --> 00:19:45,675
Hello, Stanley.

314
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:51,559
Here I am, all freshly bathed and scented
and feeling like a brand-new human being.

315
00:19:51,727 --> 00:19:53,080
Oh, that's good.

316
00:19:53,687 --> 00:19:58,283
Will you excuse me
while I put on my pretty new dress?

317
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,039
Go ahead.

318
00:20:18,727 --> 00:20:20,319
Thank you.

319
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,519
I understand there's to be
a little card party here tonight...

320
00:20:36,687 --> 00:20:39,804
...to which we ladies
are cordially not invited.

321
00:20:39,967 --> 00:20:41,195
That's right.

322
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:43,961
Where...? Where is Stella?

323
00:20:44,887 --> 00:20:47,117
She's out there on the porch.

324
00:20:53,607 --> 00:20:55,916
I'm going to ask a favor of you
in a moment.

325
00:20:57,287 --> 00:20:59,596
Well, now, what's that gonna be,
I wonder.

326
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:01,918
Some buttons in back.

327
00:21:02,807 --> 00:21:04,559
You may enter.

328
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:09,366
How do I look?

329
00:21:09,527 --> 00:21:11,040
You look okay.

330
00:21:11,207 --> 00:21:13,437
Well, thanks. Now the button.

331
00:21:18,647 --> 00:21:20,603
Well, I can't do no more with them.

332
00:21:20,767 --> 00:21:22,678
You men with your big, clumsy fingers.

333
00:21:22,847 --> 00:21:25,725
- May I have a drag on your cig?
- Yeah, have one for yourself.

334
00:21:25,887 --> 00:21:27,684
Why, thank you. It...

335
00:21:27,847 --> 00:21:30,361
It looks like my trunk has exploded.

336
00:21:30,527 --> 00:21:32,916
Me and Stella was helping you unpack.

337
00:21:33,647 --> 00:21:36,115
You certainly did a fast
and thorough job of it.

338
00:21:36,287 --> 00:21:39,518
Well, certainly looks like you raided
some stylish shops in Paris, Blanche.

339
00:21:39,687 --> 00:21:41,359
Clothes are my passion.

340
00:21:41,527 --> 00:21:43,757
How much does it cost
for a string of furs like that?

341
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,997
Why, these were a tribute
from an admirer of mine.

342
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:47,885
He must have had a lot of admiration.

343
00:21:48,047 --> 00:21:50,766
In my youth I excited some admiration,
but look at me now.

344
00:21:50,927 --> 00:21:54,636
Would you think it possible that I
was once considered to be attractive?

345
00:21:55,887 --> 00:21:57,240
Your looks are okay.

346
00:21:57,687 --> 00:22:00,281
- I was fishing for a compliment.
- I don't go for that stuff.

347
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,563
- What stuff?
- Compliments to women about looks.

348
00:22:02,727 --> 00:22:06,436
I never met a dame didn't know she was
good-looking or not without being told.

349
00:22:06,607 --> 00:22:09,599
And some of them give themselves
credit for more than they've got.

350
00:22:09,767 --> 00:22:12,725
I once went out with a dame
who told me, "I'm the glamorous type."

351
00:22:13,047 --> 00:22:15,925
She says, "I am the glamorous type."
I says, "So what?"

352
00:22:16,087 --> 00:22:18,760
- And what did she say then?
- She didn't say nothing.

353
00:22:18,927 --> 00:22:21,725
- That shut her up like a clam.
- Did it end the romance?

354
00:22:21,887 --> 00:22:24,685
Well, it ended the conversation,
that was all.

355
00:22:24,847 --> 00:22:27,759
There's some men that are took in
by this Hollywood glamour stuff...

356
00:22:27,927 --> 00:22:31,283
...and there's some men that aren't.
- You belong in the second category.

357
00:22:31,447 --> 00:22:33,836
- That's right.
- I can't imagine any witch of a woman...

358
00:22:34,007 --> 00:22:35,918
...casting a spell over you.
- That's right.

359
00:22:36,087 --> 00:22:38,317
You're simple,
straightforward and honest.

360
00:22:38,487 --> 00:22:41,365
A little bit on the primitive side,
I should think.

361
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:44,724
- To interest you a woman would have to...
- To lay her cards on the table.

362
00:22:44,887 --> 00:22:47,447
Well, I never did care
for wishy-washy people.

363
00:22:47,607 --> 00:22:50,326
That was why when you walked
in last night, I said to myself:

364
00:22:50,487 --> 00:22:52,603
"My sister has married a man."
Of course.

365
00:22:52,767 --> 00:22:55,361
- That was all I could tell...
- How about cutting the rebop!

366
00:22:55,527 --> 00:22:56,676
Stanley!

367
00:22:58,327 --> 00:23:00,716
Come on outside with me
and let Blanche finish dressing.

368
00:23:00,887 --> 00:23:02,718
- I'm finished dressing.
- Then come on out.

369
00:23:02,887 --> 00:23:04,878
- Your sister and I are having a talk.
- Honey...

370
00:23:05,047 --> 00:23:07,880
...run to the drugstore and get me
a lemon Coke with chipped ice.

371
00:23:08,047 --> 00:23:10,720
Will you do that for me,
sweetie, please? Please.

372
00:23:12,287 --> 00:23:13,845
All right.

373
00:23:18,807 --> 00:23:20,638
Poor thing was out there listening to us.

374
00:23:20,807 --> 00:23:24,243
And I have an idea she doesn't
understand you as well as I do.

375
00:23:25,847 --> 00:23:29,157
All right now, Mr. Kowalski, let us
proceed without any more digression.

376
00:23:29,327 --> 00:23:32,956
I'm ready to answer all questions.
I have nothing to hide.

377
00:23:33,127 --> 00:23:34,640
What is it?

378
00:23:35,767 --> 00:23:40,477
In the state of Louisiana we got here
what's known as the Napoleonic Code.

379
00:23:40,647 --> 00:23:44,686
Which says, what belongs to the wife
belongs to the husband and vice versa.

380
00:23:44,847 --> 00:23:47,077
My, but you have
an impressive judicial air.

381
00:23:47,247 --> 00:23:50,956
If I didn't know that you was my wife's
sister, I would get ideas about you.

382
00:23:52,767 --> 00:23:56,726
- Such as what?
- Don't play so dumb. You know what.

383
00:23:57,967 --> 00:24:00,561
All right. Cards on the table.

384
00:24:00,727 --> 00:24:06,120
I know I fib a good deal. After all,
a woman's charm is 50 percent illusion.

385
00:24:06,927 --> 00:24:09,725
But when a thing is important
I tell the truth.

386
00:24:09,887 --> 00:24:11,320
And this is the truth:

387
00:24:11,487 --> 00:24:16,561
I never cheated my sister, or you, or
anyone else on earth as long as I lived.

388
00:24:16,727 --> 00:24:20,879
- Where are the papers, in your trunk?
- Everything I own is in that trunk.

389
00:24:23,567 --> 00:24:27,242
What are you thinking of? What's in the
back of that little boy's mind of yours?

390
00:24:27,407 --> 00:24:29,363
Let me do that.
It'll be faster and simple.

391
00:24:29,527 --> 00:24:34,078
- I keep my papers mostly in this tin box.
- What are those underneath?

392
00:24:36,047 --> 00:24:37,958
Those are love letters...

393
00:24:38,127 --> 00:24:40,277
...yellowing with antiquity...

394
00:24:40,447 --> 00:24:43,519
...all from one boy. Give those back.
- I'm just gonna have a look.

395
00:24:43,687 --> 00:24:46,645
- The touch of your hands insults them.
- Now, don't pull that stuff.

396
00:24:46,807 --> 00:24:50,402
Now that you've touched them,
I'll burn them.

397
00:24:51,007 --> 00:24:52,725
What are they?

398
00:24:53,927 --> 00:24:56,964
Poems the dead boy wrote.

399
00:24:57,127 --> 00:25:00,881
I hurt him the way that you would
like to hurt me. But you can't.

400
00:25:01,047 --> 00:25:05,916
I'm not young and vulnerable anymore,
but my young husband was, and I...

401
00:25:07,087 --> 00:25:08,839
Never mind about that.

402
00:25:09,887 --> 00:25:11,445
Just give them back to me.

403
00:25:14,727 --> 00:25:16,399
Thank you.

404
00:25:17,047 --> 00:25:19,766
What'd you mean by saying
you have to burn them up?

405
00:25:20,087 --> 00:25:21,884
I'm sorry.

406
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:25,036
I must have lost my head for a moment.

407
00:25:25,207 --> 00:25:29,280
Everyone has something they won't
let others touch because of their...

408
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:31,677
Their intimate nature.

409
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:39,919
Ambler and Ambler.

410
00:25:40,087 --> 00:25:41,839
Crabtree.

411
00:25:42,647 --> 00:25:45,036
- More Ambler and Ambler.
- What's Ambler and Ambler?

412
00:25:45,207 --> 00:25:46,765
A firm that made loans on the place.

413
00:25:46,927 --> 00:25:49,600
- It was lost on a mortgage.
- That must have been what happened.

414
00:25:49,767 --> 00:25:52,406
I don't want if, ands or buts.
What's the rest of the papers?

415
00:25:52,567 --> 00:25:55,923
There are thousands of papers
stretching back over hundreds of years...

416
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:57,315
...affecting Belle Reve...

417
00:25:57,487 --> 00:26:00,160
...as piece by piece,
our improvident grandfathers...

418
00:26:00,327 --> 00:26:02,636
...exchanged the land
for their epic debauches...

419
00:26:02,807 --> 00:26:04,206
...to put it mildly.

420
00:26:04,367 --> 00:26:07,279
Until finally, all that was left...
And Stella can verify that.

421
00:26:07,447 --> 00:26:08,721
- was the house itself.

422
00:26:08,887 --> 00:26:12,323
And about 20 acres of ground,
including a graveyard...

423
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:16,275
...to which now all but Stella
and I have retreated.

424
00:26:16,447 --> 00:26:19,644
Here they are, all of them.
All papers.

425
00:26:19,807 --> 00:26:23,925
I endow you with them. Take them,
peruse them, commit them to memory.

426
00:26:24,087 --> 00:26:26,317
I think it's wonderfully fitting
that Belle Reve...

427
00:26:26,487 --> 00:26:30,162
...should finally be this bunch of old
papers in your big, capable hands.

428
00:26:33,207 --> 00:26:36,040
I wonder if Stella's come back
with my lemon Coke.

429
00:26:37,047 --> 00:26:39,925
I got a lawyer acquaintance,
we'll study this out.

430
00:26:40,567 --> 00:26:43,798
Present them to him
with a box of aspirin tablets.

431
00:26:45,407 --> 00:26:50,640
Under the Napoleonic Code a man has got
to take an interest in his wife's affairs.

432
00:26:50,807 --> 00:26:53,196
And I mean especially now
that she's gonna have a baby.

433
00:26:56,567 --> 00:26:58,000
Stella?

434
00:26:59,087 --> 00:27:01,282
Stella, going to have a baby?

435
00:27:05,367 --> 00:27:08,518
I didn't know
she was going to have a baby.

436
00:27:13,367 --> 00:27:15,164
Stella.

437
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:21,205
Oh, Stella for star,
how lovely to have a baby.

438
00:27:22,127 --> 00:27:23,719
Honey, everything's all right.

439
00:27:23,887 --> 00:27:25,286
We thrashed it out.

440
00:27:25,447 --> 00:27:27,642
I feel a bit shaky,
but I think I handled it nicely.

441
00:27:27,807 --> 00:27:29,763
I laughed and treated it all as a joke.

442
00:27:29,927 --> 00:27:32,487
I laughed and called him a little boy
and flirted. Here.

443
00:27:32,647 --> 00:27:34,797
I was flirting with your husband, Stella.

444
00:27:34,967 --> 00:27:37,037
The guests are gathering
for the poker party.

445
00:27:40,407 --> 00:27:42,796
- Hi, Stella.
- Hi, Steve.

446
00:27:45,207 --> 00:27:46,640
I'm sorry he did that to you.

447
00:27:46,807 --> 00:27:51,642
Why, I guess he's just not the type
that goes for jasmine perfume.

448
00:27:51,807 --> 00:27:55,482
Maybe he's what we need to mix with
our blood now we've lost Belle Reve...

449
00:27:55,647 --> 00:27:59,242
...and have to go on
without Belle Reve to protect us.

450
00:28:00,287 --> 00:28:03,677
Oh, how pretty the sky is.

451
00:28:03,847 --> 00:28:05,644
I ought to go there on a rocket...

452
00:28:05,807 --> 00:28:07,399
...that never comes down.

453
00:28:07,567 --> 00:28:09,603
Which way do we go now, Stella?

454
00:28:09,767 --> 00:28:11,166
This way?

455
00:28:11,327 --> 00:28:13,283
No, hon, this way.

456
00:28:13,447 --> 00:28:16,405
The blind are leading the blind.

457
00:28:16,567 --> 00:28:18,717
Red hots!

458
00:28:36,847 --> 00:28:39,042
Are you going upstairs
and tell her to cut that out?

459
00:28:39,207 --> 00:28:41,562
If I go up, I won't come down.
Let's just forget it.

460
00:28:42,607 --> 00:28:46,122
Remember that night she poured boiling
water through them cracks in the floor?

461
00:28:57,687 --> 00:28:58,961
I gotta go home pretty soon.

462
00:28:59,127 --> 00:29:00,924
- Come on, what do you say?
- No, I'm out.

463
00:29:01,087 --> 00:29:03,555
Every time you win a big pot,
you're out like stout.

464
00:29:03,727 --> 00:29:05,763
I got a sick mother
and she don't go to sleep...

465
00:29:05,927 --> 00:29:07,758
...until I get in.
- What do you say?

466
00:29:07,927 --> 00:29:09,360
I'm gonna wash up.

467
00:29:11,767 --> 00:29:14,440
- Stella?
- Yes, Eunice?

468
00:29:14,607 --> 00:29:17,644
You tell them guys
the kettle's on the stove.

469
00:29:17,807 --> 00:29:19,923
I'm gonna break up the game.

470
00:29:20,127 --> 00:29:23,802
- What did she mean by that?
- She'll pour it straight through the cracks.

471
00:29:24,007 --> 00:29:26,441
Stella, wait. Wait till I powder.

472
00:29:26,607 --> 00:29:28,086
I feel so hot and frazzled.

473
00:29:28,247 --> 00:29:30,636
- Do I look done in?
- You look as fresh as a daisy.

474
00:29:31,247 --> 00:29:33,317
One that's been picked a few days.

475
00:29:34,167 --> 00:29:37,682
Why don't someone go to the Chinaman's
and bring back a load of chop suey?

476
00:29:37,847 --> 00:29:41,362
- I'm losing and you want to eat.
- Well, I see you boys are still at it.

477
00:29:41,527 --> 00:29:43,518
- Where you been?
- Blanche and I took in a show.

478
00:29:43,687 --> 00:29:46,201
Blanche, honey, this is Mr. Gonzalez
and Mr. Hubbell.

479
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:48,278
How do you do?
Please don't get up.

480
00:29:48,447 --> 00:29:50,517
Nobody's getting up here,
so don't get worried.

481
00:29:50,687 --> 00:29:53,997
- Poker is so fascinating. Could I kibitz?
- You could not.

482
00:29:54,247 --> 00:29:56,238
Why don't you women
go on up to Eunice's?

483
00:29:56,407 --> 00:29:59,444
- How long's this game going to continue?
- Till we get ready to quit.

484
00:29:59,607 --> 00:30:01,518
You should call it quits
after one more hand.

485
00:30:01,687 --> 00:30:04,406
- Go up to Eunice's.
- Hey, that's my coat.

486
00:30:05,687 --> 00:30:08,440
That's not fun, Stanley.

487
00:30:09,887 --> 00:30:13,163
It makes me so mad
when he does that in front of people.

488
00:30:13,327 --> 00:30:15,443
- I think I'll go bathe.
- Again?

489
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:17,837
My nerves are in knots.
Is the bathroom occupied?

490
00:30:18,007 --> 00:30:19,281
I don't know.

491
00:30:19,447 --> 00:30:21,642
- Oh, good evening.
- Oh, hello.

492
00:30:22,847 --> 00:30:24,644
Blanche, this is Harold Mitchell.

493
00:30:24,807 --> 00:30:27,002
- This is my sister, Blanche DuBois.
- How do you do.

494
00:30:27,167 --> 00:30:29,965
- How do you do, Miss DuBois.
- How's your mother now, Mitch?

495
00:30:30,127 --> 00:30:31,606
Oh, she's about the same, thanks.

496
00:30:31,767 --> 00:30:34,327
She appreciated your
sending over that custard.

497
00:30:35,287 --> 00:30:37,084
Oh, excuse me, please.

498
00:30:37,887 --> 00:30:39,525
Excuse me.

499
00:30:49,207 --> 00:30:52,563
- That one seems superior to the others.
- Does he?

500
00:30:52,727 --> 00:30:56,436
- I thought he had a sort of sensitive look.
- His mother's sick.

501
00:30:56,607 --> 00:30:59,041
- Is he married?
- No.

502
00:30:59,247 --> 00:31:02,478
- Is he a wolf?
- Why, Blanche.

503
00:31:02,647 --> 00:31:05,684
- Well, no, I don't think he would be.
- What does he do?

504
00:31:05,847 --> 00:31:09,044
He's on the Precision Bench
in the Spare Parts Department.

505
00:31:09,207 --> 00:31:11,163
The plant that Stanley travels for.

506
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:13,363
- Is that something much?
- No.

507
00:31:13,527 --> 00:31:16,325
Stanley's the only one in his crowd
likely to get any work.

508
00:31:20,127 --> 00:31:22,687
Hey, Blanche,
you're standing in the light.

509
00:31:23,767 --> 00:31:25,519
Am I? Gracious.

510
00:31:27,127 --> 00:31:28,640
You ought to see their wives.

511
00:31:28,807 --> 00:31:31,275
Oh, I can imagine.
Big, beefy things, I suppose.

512
00:31:31,447 --> 00:31:33,483
- Do you know that one upstairs?
- Oh, yes.

513
00:31:33,647 --> 00:31:36,241
Well, one night...

514
00:31:37,047 --> 00:31:38,480
And the plaster...!

515
00:31:38,687 --> 00:31:40,006
Hey, you hens!

516
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:43,045
- Cut out that cackling in there.
- You can't hear us.

517
00:31:43,207 --> 00:31:46,358
Well, you can hear me,
and I told you to hush up.

518
00:31:47,087 --> 00:31:48,281
Stella.

519
00:31:48,447 --> 00:31:51,917
Look, this is my house
and I'll talk as much as I want to.

520
00:31:52,767 --> 00:31:55,964
- Stella, don't start a row.
- Oh, he's half-drunk.

521
00:31:56,287 --> 00:31:58,084
I'll be out in a minute.

522
00:32:22,327 --> 00:32:24,079
What do you say, Mitch?

523
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:26,801
Come on, Mitch, are you in?

524
00:32:27,927 --> 00:32:29,246
No, I'm out.

525
00:32:29,407 --> 00:32:30,999
Who turned that on in there?

526
00:32:32,207 --> 00:32:34,641
- I did. Do you mind?
- Well, turn it off!

527
00:32:34,807 --> 00:32:37,685
Come on, will you?
Let the girls have their music?

528
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:39,486
Stanley!

529
00:32:45,967 --> 00:32:48,606
There you are.
I didn't hear you name it!

530
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:50,564
- Didn't I name it?
- I wasn't listening.

531
00:32:50,727 --> 00:32:51,716
What were you doing?

532
00:32:52,047 --> 00:32:53,366
Looking through the drapes.

533
00:32:53,527 --> 00:32:55,757
- I was looking through no drapes.
- We're gonna play.

534
00:32:55,927 --> 00:32:58,157
We're gonna deal this hand again,
play cards or quit.

535
00:32:58,327 --> 00:32:59,396
Deal me out.

536
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:02,326
All right, this game's gonna be
Spit in the Ocean.

537
00:33:10,887 --> 00:33:12,240
Yes?

538
00:33:13,527 --> 00:33:14,960
Hello.

539
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,680
Excuse me.

540
00:33:21,047 --> 00:33:24,039
The little boy's room
is occupied right now.

541
00:33:24,247 --> 00:33:25,839
Oh, excuse me.

542
00:33:26,007 --> 00:33:29,204
- Have you got any cigs?
- Oh, sure.

543
00:33:30,887 --> 00:33:33,196
Oh, what a... What a pretty case.

544
00:33:33,367 --> 00:33:35,085
- Silver?
- Yes.

545
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:36,760
Yes, read the inscription.

546
00:33:36,927 --> 00:33:38,963
Oh, there is an inscription.

547
00:33:39,127 --> 00:33:41,277
Why, I can't make it out.

548
00:33:45,087 --> 00:33:48,159
"And if God choose...

549
00:33:48,967 --> 00:33:52,243
...I shall but love thee better
after death."

550
00:33:52,407 --> 00:33:55,126
Why, that's from my
favorite sonnet by Mrs. Browning.

551
00:33:55,287 --> 00:33:57,198
- Why, you know it.
- Certainly, I do.

552
00:33:57,367 --> 00:34:00,040
Well, there's a story connected
with this inscription.

553
00:34:00,207 --> 00:34:01,606
It sounds like a romance.

554
00:34:01,767 --> 00:34:04,884
No, no, it's a pretty sad one.
The girl's dead now.

555
00:34:05,407 --> 00:34:09,320
She knew she was dying when she give
me this. A very strange girl, very sweet.

556
00:34:09,487 --> 00:34:12,684
- Very...
- She must have been very fond of you.

557
00:34:12,847 --> 00:34:15,600
Sick people have such
deep, sincere attachments.

558
00:34:15,767 --> 00:34:18,998
- That's right. They certainly do.
- Sorrow makes for sincerity, I think.

559
00:34:19,167 --> 00:34:20,680
It sure brings it out in people.

560
00:34:20,847 --> 00:34:23,759
The little there is belongs to people
who have known some sorrow.

561
00:34:23,927 --> 00:34:26,646
- I believe you're right about that.
- Oh, I'm positive I am.

562
00:34:26,807 --> 00:34:30,720
- Hey, Mitch!
- Deal me out. I'm talking to Miss...?

563
00:34:32,407 --> 00:34:33,840
DuBois.

564
00:34:34,367 --> 00:34:35,561
DuBois.

565
00:34:35,727 --> 00:34:37,365
It's a French name.

566
00:34:37,527 --> 00:34:39,563
It means "woods,"
and Blanche means "white"...

567
00:34:39,727 --> 00:34:41,638
...so the two together mean
"white woods"...

568
00:34:41,807 --> 00:34:43,365
...like an orchard in spring.

569
00:34:43,527 --> 00:34:45,404
You can remember it by that...

570
00:34:45,567 --> 00:34:46,920
...if you care to.

571
00:34:47,487 --> 00:34:49,205
You are Stella's sister, are you not?

572
00:34:49,367 --> 00:34:51,801
Yes. Stella is my precious little sister.

573
00:34:52,087 --> 00:34:55,284
I call her little in spite of the fact
that she's somewhat older than I am.

574
00:34:57,047 --> 00:35:00,517
Oh, just slightly. Less than a year.
Will you do something for me?

575
00:35:00,687 --> 00:35:01,836
Sure. Yes, what?

576
00:35:02,007 --> 00:35:05,522
I bought this adorable little paper lantern
at a Chinese shop on Bourbon.

577
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,643
Put it over the light bulb.
Will you, please?

578
00:35:07,807 --> 00:35:09,160
I'd be glad to.

579
00:35:09,327 --> 00:35:13,206
I can't stand a naked light bulb
any more than I can a rude remark...

580
00:35:13,367 --> 00:35:15,005
...or a vulgar action.

581
00:35:15,167 --> 00:35:18,842
Well, I guess we strike you as being
a pretty rough bunch.

582
00:35:19,767 --> 00:35:22,406
I'm very adaptable to circumstances.

583
00:35:22,567 --> 00:35:24,558
Well, that's a good way to be.

584
00:35:26,847 --> 00:35:28,405
- You're not...?
- Married?

585
00:35:28,567 --> 00:35:31,604
Oh, no.
No, I'm an old maid schoolteacher.

586
00:35:31,967 --> 00:35:35,164
You may be a schoolteacher,
but you're certainly not an old maid.

587
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:38,239
Why, thank you, sir.

588
00:35:38,407 --> 00:35:40,875
I appreciate your gallantry.

589
00:35:42,967 --> 00:35:45,037
So you're in the teaching profession.

590
00:35:45,367 --> 00:35:46,766
Yes.

591
00:35:47,447 --> 00:35:49,085
- Yes.
- Grade school or high school...?

592
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:51,522
- Hey, Mitch!
- Coming!

593
00:35:51,687 --> 00:35:53,518
Gracious, what lung power.

594
00:35:53,687 --> 00:35:55,279
I teach high school in Auriol.

595
00:35:56,367 --> 00:35:57,959
Well, what do you teach?
What subject?

596
00:35:58,127 --> 00:36:02,040
- You guess.
- Well, I bet you teach art or music.

597
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:05,036
Well, of course, I could be wrong.

598
00:36:05,207 --> 00:36:06,640
You might teach arithmetic.

599
00:36:06,807 --> 00:36:09,162
Never arithmetic, sir.
Never arithmetic.

600
00:36:09,327 --> 00:36:11,443
I don't know
my multiplication tables. Nope.

601
00:36:11,607 --> 00:36:13,916
I have the misfortune
of being an English instructor.

602
00:36:14,087 --> 00:36:16,396
I attempt to instill
a bunch of bobbysoxers...

603
00:36:16,567 --> 00:36:19,639
...and drugstore Romeos
with a reverence for Hawthorne...

604
00:36:19,807 --> 00:36:21,365
...and Whitman and Poe.

605
00:36:21,527 --> 00:36:24,087
Well, I bet some of them
are more interested in other things.

606
00:36:24,247 --> 00:36:26,044
How very right you are.

607
00:36:26,207 --> 00:36:29,995
Their literary heritage is not
what they treasure above all else.

608
00:36:30,167 --> 00:36:31,566
But they're sweet things...

609
00:36:31,727 --> 00:36:36,801
...and in the spring it's touching to see
them making their first discovery of love...

610
00:36:36,967 --> 00:36:41,040
...as if nobody had ever known it before.

611
00:36:43,807 --> 00:36:48,164
- Sorry. Oh, excuse me, excuse me.
- Have you finished?

612
00:36:48,327 --> 00:36:52,605
- Oh, yes. Yes, I have.
- Wait, wait. I'll turn on the radio.

613
00:36:54,527 --> 00:36:56,722
Turn on the light above now.

614
00:36:57,727 --> 00:36:59,285
Oh, look.

615
00:36:59,447 --> 00:37:02,007
We've made enchantment.

616
00:37:12,327 --> 00:37:16,286
- Three bullets, mustache.
- Straight! I gotcha!

617
00:37:17,807 --> 00:37:21,038
Stanley! Stanley!
What are you doing with the radio?

618
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:24,404
Drunk! Drunk animal thing!

619
00:37:24,967 --> 00:37:26,161
- Get out!
- Hey!

620
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,397
- Go on, get out!
- Hey!

621
00:37:29,207 --> 00:37:30,845
Let go of her!

622
00:37:31,007 --> 00:37:33,202
My sister is gonna have a baby!

623
00:37:38,127 --> 00:37:39,958
You come on up to my place, honey.

624
00:37:40,127 --> 00:37:42,482
Sister, did he hurt you, darling?

625
00:37:42,687 --> 00:37:45,997
Poker should not be played
in a house with women.

626
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:48,917
- All right, take it easy, will you?
- Look out.

627
00:37:50,407 --> 00:37:52,796
Get him in that shower.

628
00:37:53,327 --> 00:37:55,921
- Look out.
- Get him in that shower, I said!

629
00:37:56,087 --> 00:37:58,521
Come on, all right.
Get his feet, will you? Get his feet!

630
00:37:58,687 --> 00:38:00,757
Grab his feet, come on, take it easy.

631
00:38:00,927 --> 00:38:02,724
Come on, boy. Get under there.

632
00:38:02,887 --> 00:38:04,400
Come on.

633
00:38:04,727 --> 00:38:06,524
Get under there. There you go.

634
00:38:08,567 --> 00:38:10,478
How do you feel, Stan?

635
00:38:10,967 --> 00:38:13,527
Stanley, wake up!
Hey, Stanley!

636
00:38:13,687 --> 00:38:18,078
- We ought to get his clothes off and...
- Hey! What do you think...!

637
00:38:23,807 --> 00:38:26,526
Poker should not be played
in a house with women!

638
00:38:26,687 --> 00:38:28,405
Come on!

639
00:38:30,167 --> 00:38:31,919
- Hey!
- Where's Steve? Come on.

640
00:38:32,087 --> 00:38:33,918
Wait. Come here. Take it easy.

641
00:38:46,247 --> 00:38:47,646
Stella.

642
00:38:52,007 --> 00:38:53,520
Stella.

643
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:58,000
Honey?

644
00:38:59,447 --> 00:39:01,244
Hey, Stella?

645
00:39:03,887 --> 00:39:05,798
Honey, where are you?

646
00:39:08,407 --> 00:39:09,886
Stella?

647
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:20,558
Hey, baby...

648
00:39:31,127 --> 00:39:34,244
Look, you can sleep over here, Stella.
Blanche can have Steve's place.

649
00:39:34,407 --> 00:39:37,046
He ain't coming home tonight
if he knows what's good for him.

650
00:39:37,647 --> 00:39:40,081
<i>Is my baby up there?</i>
<i>I want her...</i>

651
00:39:40,247 --> 00:39:43,205
Look, she ain't coming down
and she ain't gonna talk to you neither...

652
00:39:43,367 --> 00:39:45,597
...so you might just as well
not call her!

653
00:39:52,727 --> 00:39:55,480
Hey, Stella!

654
00:39:55,647 --> 00:39:57,638
You quit that howling down there
and go to bed!

655
00:39:57,807 --> 00:40:00,526
- Eunice, I want my girl down here!
- You shut up!

656
00:40:00,687 --> 00:40:02,439
- You're gonna get the law on you.
- Stella!

657
00:40:02,607 --> 00:40:04,916
You can't beat on a woman
and then call her back.

658
00:40:05,087 --> 00:40:06,156
You're gonna have a baby.

659
00:40:06,327 --> 00:40:09,285
I hope they haul you in, turn a fire hose
on you like the last time!

660
00:40:09,447 --> 00:40:11,642
- I want my girl down here!
- You stinker!

661
00:40:16,327 --> 00:40:19,717
Hey, Stella!

662
00:40:21,327 --> 00:40:24,319
Hey, Stella!

663
00:40:33,767 --> 00:40:35,962
I wouldn't mix in this.

664
00:41:34,647 --> 00:41:37,081
Don't ever leave me, baby.

665
00:41:52,727 --> 00:41:54,604
Blanche, come back!

666
00:42:19,847 --> 00:42:21,405
Miss DuBois?

667
00:42:22,007 --> 00:42:23,599
Miss DuBois?

668
00:42:27,047 --> 00:42:29,197
All quiet along the Potomac now?

669
00:42:29,447 --> 00:42:31,642
She ran down here
and went back in there with him.

670
00:42:31,887 --> 00:42:33,286
- Sure she did.
- I'm terrified.

671
00:42:33,447 --> 00:42:36,041
Nothing to be scared of.
They're crazy about each other.

672
00:42:36,207 --> 00:42:38,323
It's a shame this had to happen
when you got here.

673
00:42:38,487 --> 00:42:40,239
- Violence is so...
- Sit down on the steps...

674
00:42:40,407 --> 00:42:42,477
...and have a cigarette with me.
- Why...

675
00:42:42,647 --> 00:42:44,046
...I'm not properly dressed.

676
00:42:44,207 --> 00:42:46,596
Well, that don't make no difference
in the Quarter.

677
00:42:47,487 --> 00:42:50,638
Such a pretty silver case.

678
00:42:50,807 --> 00:42:53,082
I showed you the inscription, didn't I?

679
00:42:53,247 --> 00:42:54,475
Yes.

680
00:43:00,007 --> 00:43:01,679
So much...

681
00:43:01,847 --> 00:43:04,998
So much confusion in the world.

682
00:43:06,647 --> 00:43:09,036
Thank you for being so kind.

683
00:43:09,207 --> 00:43:11,926
I need kindness now.

684
00:43:18,567 --> 00:43:21,764
Bananas!

685
00:43:22,447 --> 00:43:25,962
Bananas!

686
00:43:33,127 --> 00:43:34,606
Stella?

687
00:43:38,967 --> 00:43:42,164
Stella. Oh, my baby.
My baby sister.

688
00:43:42,327 --> 00:43:44,283
Why, angel,
what's the matter with you?

689
00:43:44,487 --> 00:43:46,603
- He left?
- Stan?

690
00:43:46,767 --> 00:43:47,961
Will he be back?

691
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,283
- He's gone to get the car greased, why?
- Why?

692
00:43:50,487 --> 00:43:53,923
I've been half-crazy, Stella. How could
you come back to this place last night?

693
00:43:54,087 --> 00:43:57,602
Please, Blanche. He was as good
as a lamb when I came back.

694
00:43:57,767 --> 00:44:01,043
- He's really very ashamed of himself.
- And that...

695
00:44:01,247 --> 00:44:03,442
- That makes it all right?
- No.

696
00:44:04,087 --> 00:44:06,760
Stanley's always smashed things.

697
00:44:07,247 --> 00:44:10,523
On our wedding night,
as soon as we came in here...

698
00:44:10,727 --> 00:44:12,445
...he snatched off one of my slippers...

699
00:44:12,607 --> 00:44:15,360
...and rushed about the place smashing
the light bulbs with it.

700
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:17,324
He did what?

701
00:44:18,567 --> 00:44:21,525
He smashed all the light bulbs
with the heel of my slipper.

702
00:44:21,767 --> 00:44:23,962
And you let him?
Didn't run, didn't scream?

703
00:44:25,447 --> 00:44:28,405
I was sort of thrilled by it.

704
00:44:29,447 --> 00:44:31,244
Eunice and you had breakfast?

705
00:44:31,607 --> 00:44:34,326
Oh, do you suppose
I wanted any breakfast?

706
00:44:34,487 --> 00:44:37,126
You're so matter-of-fact
about it all, Stella.

707
00:44:37,647 --> 00:44:39,763
What other can I be?

708
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:42,361
He's taken the radio to get it fixed.

709
00:44:42,527 --> 00:44:46,042
It didn't land on the pavement,
so only one tube was smashed.

710
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:48,243
And you standing there smiling.

711
00:44:48,407 --> 00:44:49,726
What do you want me to do?

712
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:51,684
Pull yourself together. Face the facts.

713
00:44:51,847 --> 00:44:53,166
What are they in your opinion?

714
00:44:53,327 --> 00:44:55,887
In my opinion,
you're married to a madman.

715
00:44:56,247 --> 00:44:58,602
I've got a plan for us both,
to get us both out of here.

716
00:44:58,767 --> 00:45:02,043
I wish you'd stop taking it for granted
I'm in something I wanna get out of.

717
00:45:02,207 --> 00:45:05,324
I take it you have sufficient memory
of Belle Reve to find this place...

718
00:45:05,527 --> 00:45:07,643
...and these poker players impossible
to live with.

719
00:45:07,847 --> 00:45:10,566
- You take too much for granted.
- I can't believe you're in earnest.

720
00:45:10,727 --> 00:45:12,763
- No?
- I understand what happened a little.

721
00:45:12,967 --> 00:45:15,527
You saw him first in uniform,
an officer, not here.

722
00:45:15,687 --> 00:45:18,121
I'm not sure it makes any difference
where I saw him.

723
00:45:18,287 --> 00:45:21,643
What you're talking about is desire,
just brutal desire.

724
00:45:21,847 --> 00:45:25,044
The name of that rattletrap streetcar
that bangs through the Quarter.

725
00:45:25,207 --> 00:45:27,243
Up one old, narrow street
and down another.

726
00:45:27,447 --> 00:45:30,245
Haven't you ever ridden
on that streetcar?

727
00:45:32,887 --> 00:45:34,764
It brought me here.

728
00:45:35,447 --> 00:45:37,119
Where I'm not wanted...

729
00:45:37,287 --> 00:45:38,879
...and where I'm ashamed to be.

730
00:45:39,047 --> 00:45:42,164
Don't you think your superior attitude's
a little out of place?

731
00:45:42,327 --> 00:45:44,283
- A man like that...
- I told you I love him.

732
00:45:44,487 --> 00:45:46,000
I tremble for you, I just tremble!

733
00:45:46,167 --> 00:45:48,044
- Hi, Stanley.
- Hi.

734
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:01,522
May I speak plainly?

735
00:46:02,247 --> 00:46:05,762
Yes, do. Go ahead, as plainly
as you want to.

736
00:46:06,807 --> 00:46:08,604
Well, if you'll forgive me...

737
00:46:09,127 --> 00:46:10,799
...he's common.

738
00:46:14,367 --> 00:46:16,483
Yes, I suppose he is.

739
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,486
Suppose?

740
00:46:18,647 --> 00:46:21,844
Surely you can't have forgotten
that much of our upbringing, Stella...

741
00:46:22,007 --> 00:46:25,443
...that you just suppose there's
any part of a gentleman in his nature.

742
00:46:25,647 --> 00:46:28,241
Oh, you're hating me saying this,
aren't you?

743
00:46:29,087 --> 00:46:31,601
Go on and say it all, Blanche.

744
00:46:34,967 --> 00:46:36,719
He's like an animal.

745
00:46:37,087 --> 00:46:38,839
Has an animal's habits.

746
00:46:39,007 --> 00:46:41,840
There's even something
subhuman about him.

747
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:45,363
Thousands of years have passed him
right by and there he is...

748
00:46:45,527 --> 00:46:48,246
...Stanley Kowalski,
survivor of the Stone Age.

749
00:46:48,407 --> 00:46:51,399
Bearing the raw meat home
from the kill in the jungle. And you...

750
00:46:51,607 --> 00:46:52,881
...you here waiting for him.

751
00:46:53,047 --> 00:46:55,607
Maybe he'll strike you
or maybe grunt and kiss you.

752
00:46:55,767 --> 00:46:58,964
That's if kisses have been discovered
yet. His "poker night," you call it.

753
00:46:59,127 --> 00:47:00,401
His party of apes?

754
00:47:01,047 --> 00:47:04,562
Maybe we are a long way
from being made in God's image.

755
00:47:05,247 --> 00:47:07,124
But, Stella, my sister...

756
00:47:07,287 --> 00:47:09,642
...there's been some progress
since then.

757
00:47:09,847 --> 00:47:12,725
Such things as art, as poetry,
as music.

758
00:47:12,887 --> 00:47:14,843
In some kinds of people...

759
00:47:15,047 --> 00:47:18,005
...some tenderer feelings have had
some little beginning...

760
00:47:18,167 --> 00:47:20,806
...that we have got to make grow
and to cling to...

761
00:47:20,967 --> 00:47:25,404
...as our flag in this dark march
toward whatever it is we're approaching.

762
00:47:25,567 --> 00:47:29,162
Don't, don't hang back
with the brutes.

763
00:48:06,207 --> 00:48:08,004
Hey, Stell?

764
00:48:14,487 --> 00:48:16,159
Hey, Stell?

765
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:24,000
- Hiya.
- Hi.

766
00:48:28,407 --> 00:48:30,159
Is Blanche back yet?

767
00:48:33,047 --> 00:48:35,003
Yeah, she's back.

768
00:48:35,927 --> 00:48:37,599
Oh, hi there, Blanche.

769
00:48:38,607 --> 00:48:40,484
You look like you got under the car.

770
00:48:41,327 --> 00:48:46,003
That mechanic down at Fritz's doesn't
know his axle grease from third base.

771
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:00,285
Hey!

772
00:49:05,127 --> 00:49:06,924
Don't throw that thing at me!
Eunice!

773
00:49:07,127 --> 00:49:08,924
You brick redhead,
I'll play with you!

774
00:49:09,127 --> 00:49:11,163
You wanna play with me,
I'll play games with you!

775
00:49:11,367 --> 00:49:14,803
That's just what I gave your
brother, you big redhead!

776
00:49:15,887 --> 00:49:18,640
He hit me!
And I'm gonna call the police!

777
00:49:19,567 --> 00:49:22,684
Some of your sister's friends
have stayed in the city.

778
00:49:26,887 --> 00:49:29,845
- Did Eunice get the police?
- No, she's getting a drink...

779
00:49:30,007 --> 00:49:32,726
...at the Four Deuces.
- That's much more practical.

780
00:49:33,407 --> 00:49:36,285
Blanche is making us
some new slipcovers, honey.

781
00:49:37,527 --> 00:49:38,721
Hey, is she here?

782
00:49:38,887 --> 00:49:40,764
She went to the Four Deuces.

783
00:49:41,007 --> 00:49:43,521
That no-good, rotten...

784
00:49:47,127 --> 00:49:49,482
Hey, Stella, I can't find
my other pair of shoes.

785
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:52,159
We cleaned in there.

786
00:49:52,327 --> 00:49:53,521
I'll get them.

787
00:49:55,007 --> 00:49:58,079
I can't find nothing
around this dump anymore.

788
00:50:00,847 --> 00:50:02,724
Oh, Stanley!

789
00:50:02,927 --> 00:50:04,883
What sign were you born under?

790
00:50:05,567 --> 00:50:08,240
- What sign?
- Astrological sign.

791
00:50:08,407 --> 00:50:09,999
I bet you were born under Aries.

792
00:50:10,167 --> 00:50:13,079
Aries people are forceful, dynamic,
they dote on noise.

793
00:50:13,247 --> 00:50:14,839
They love to bang things around.

794
00:50:15,007 --> 00:50:17,680
Stanley was born just five minutes
after Christmas.

795
00:50:18,447 --> 00:50:20,324
Capricorn, the goat!

796
00:50:32,207 --> 00:50:33,526
Say...

797
00:50:33,687 --> 00:50:36,121
...do you happen to know
somebody named Shaw?

798
00:50:37,647 --> 00:50:41,322
Why... Why, everybody knows
someone by the name of Shaw.

799
00:50:41,887 --> 00:50:46,165
This somebody named Shaw is under
the impression that he met you in Auriol.

800
00:50:46,487 --> 00:50:49,285
I figure he must have got you
mixed up with some other party...

801
00:50:49,447 --> 00:50:51,403
...because this other party
is somebody...

802
00:50:51,607 --> 00:50:53,723
...that he met at a hotel
called the Flamingo.

803
00:50:53,927 --> 00:50:57,681
Why, I guess he does have me
mixed up with this other party.

804
00:50:57,847 --> 00:51:01,726
The Hotel Flamingo is not a place
that I would dare to be seen in.

805
00:51:02,447 --> 00:51:04,039
Oh, you know it then?

806
00:51:04,207 --> 00:51:07,324
I've seen it and smelled it.

807
00:51:07,527 --> 00:51:09,722
You must've got pretty close
if you could smell it.

808
00:51:09,887 --> 00:51:13,084
The odor of cheap perfume
is penetrating.

809
00:51:13,647 --> 00:51:15,842
Is that stuff you use expensive?

810
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:18,363
Twelve dollars an ounce. I'm nearly out.

811
00:51:18,567 --> 00:51:21,206
That's just a hint if you want to
remember my birthday.

812
00:51:24,567 --> 00:51:27,320
I figure that he must have
got you mixed up...

813
00:51:27,487 --> 00:51:30,684
...but he goes in and out
of Auriol all the time...

814
00:51:30,847 --> 00:51:33,520
...so he can check and clear up
any mistake.

815
00:51:38,127 --> 00:51:41,324
- I'll see you at the Four Deuces.
- Hey, don't I rate a kiss?

816
00:51:41,487 --> 00:51:43,842
No, not in front of your sister.

817
00:51:52,687 --> 00:51:57,044
Don't cry. I only do that with other girls
because I love you, baby.

818
00:51:57,207 --> 00:51:58,606
Don't cry.

819
00:52:06,487 --> 00:52:07,681
Stella.

820
00:52:07,847 --> 00:52:09,883
You still scared of thunder?

821
00:52:10,607 --> 00:52:12,325
What have you heard about me?

822
00:52:13,887 --> 00:52:17,402
What have people been
telling you about me?

823
00:52:19,127 --> 00:52:22,324
- Telling?
- You haven't heard...

824
00:52:22,527 --> 00:52:25,360
...any unkind gossip about me?

825
00:52:26,167 --> 00:52:28,681
Why, no, Blanche. Of course not.

826
00:52:28,847 --> 00:52:33,443
Honey, there was
quite a lot of talk in Auriol.

827
00:52:33,647 --> 00:52:36,400
People talk, who cares?

828
00:52:36,567 --> 00:52:39,445
I haven't been so awfully good
the last year or so, since...

829
00:52:39,607 --> 00:52:42,246
Since Belle Reve started to slip
through my fingers.

830
00:52:42,407 --> 00:52:43,726
Honey, all of us do things...

831
00:52:43,887 --> 00:52:46,481
I never was hard
or self-sufficient enough.

832
00:52:46,647 --> 00:52:47,841
Soft people...

833
00:52:48,007 --> 00:52:51,283
Soft people have got to
court the favor of hard ones, Stella.

834
00:52:51,687 --> 00:52:53,484
You've got to shimmer and glow.

835
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:56,321
I don't know how much longer
I can turn the trick.

836
00:52:56,487 --> 00:52:58,443
It isn't enough to be soft.

837
00:52:58,647 --> 00:53:01,923
You've got to be soft and attractive.

838
00:53:02,127 --> 00:53:03,560
And I...

839
00:53:04,087 --> 00:53:05,839
I'm fading now.

840
00:53:11,567 --> 00:53:14,001
Have you been listening to me?

841
00:53:14,167 --> 00:53:16,965
I never listen to you
when you're being morbid.

842
00:53:26,607 --> 00:53:27,926
Is that Coke for me?

843
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:31,842
- Not for anyone else.
- You precious lamb. Is it just a Coke?

844
00:53:32,007 --> 00:53:35,761
- You mean you want a shot in it?
- A shot never did a Coke any harm.

845
00:53:35,927 --> 00:53:37,121
Oh, let me.

846
00:53:37,287 --> 00:53:38,686
You mustn't wait on me.

847
00:53:38,847 --> 00:53:42,840
I like to wait on you, Blanche.
It makes it seem more like home.

848
00:53:44,407 --> 00:53:46,443
I have to admit, l...

849
00:53:47,127 --> 00:53:49,402
I love to be waited on.

850
00:53:50,647 --> 00:53:52,205
Blanche.

851
00:53:53,807 --> 00:53:57,402
- Blanche, honey, what is it?
- Oh, you're so good to me, and l...

852
00:53:57,607 --> 00:54:00,041
- Now, Blanche.
- I know you hate me to talk sentimental...

853
00:54:00,207 --> 00:54:02,482
...but believe me, honey,
I feel more than I tell you.

854
00:54:02,647 --> 00:54:04,683
I won't stay long, I won't.
I promise.

855
00:54:04,887 --> 00:54:07,321
- Now, Blanche.
- I'll go. I'll go soon.

856
00:54:07,487 --> 00:54:10,524
I won't hang around
till he throws me out.

857
00:54:11,207 --> 00:54:13,084
- Now, will you stop talking foolish?
- Yes.

858
00:54:13,287 --> 00:54:15,164
Only watch how you pour it!

859
00:54:15,567 --> 00:54:16,761
Heavens.

860
00:54:17,007 --> 00:54:18,281
Right on my...

861
00:54:18,447 --> 00:54:19,641
...pretty...

862
00:54:19,847 --> 00:54:21,724
...pink skirt.
- Here. Use my hankie.

863
00:54:21,927 --> 00:54:24,202
- Blot gently.
- I know.

864
00:54:24,407 --> 00:54:25,681
Gently...

865
00:54:25,847 --> 00:54:27,326
...gently...

866
00:54:27,487 --> 00:54:28,681
...gently.

867
00:54:29,167 --> 00:54:30,361
Did it stain?

868
00:54:31,447 --> 00:54:32,960
No.

869
00:54:33,127 --> 00:54:35,004
No, not a bit.

870
00:54:35,887 --> 00:54:38,003
Isn't that lucky?

871
00:54:38,167 --> 00:54:40,806
Why did you scream like that?

872
00:54:43,127 --> 00:54:44,560
I don't know why I screamed.

873
00:54:46,647 --> 00:54:47,841
Mitch...

874
00:54:48,047 --> 00:54:49,685
Mitch is coming at 7.

875
00:54:49,847 --> 00:54:52,042
I guess I'm a little nervous
about our relations.

876
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:55,683
He hasn't gotten anything more than a
good-night kiss. That's all I've given him.

877
00:54:55,847 --> 00:54:58,839
I want his respect. And men don't want
anything they get too easy.

878
00:54:59,007 --> 00:55:02,522
On the other hand, men lose interest
quickly, especially when a girl is over...

879
00:55:02,687 --> 00:55:03,881
Over 30.

880
00:55:04,087 --> 00:55:07,443
When I mentioned marriage
they even forgot where I lived, so...

881
00:55:07,607 --> 00:55:10,963
So, you see, I haven't informed him
of my real age.

882
00:55:11,127 --> 00:55:14,802
Honey, why are you so sensitive
about your age?

883
00:55:14,967 --> 00:55:18,880
Because of hard knocks
my vanity has been given.

884
00:55:19,047 --> 00:55:21,242
What I mean is, he thinks I'm sort of...

885
00:55:21,447 --> 00:55:23,244
...prim and proper, you know.

886
00:55:23,407 --> 00:55:25,045
I want to deceive him...

887
00:55:25,207 --> 00:55:27,926
...just enough to make him want me.

888
00:55:28,887 --> 00:55:30,240
Darling...

889
00:55:30,687 --> 00:55:32,279
...do you want him?

890
00:55:36,407 --> 00:55:38,204
I want to rest.

891
00:55:38,967 --> 00:55:42,403
I want to breathe quietly again.

892
00:55:43,127 --> 00:55:44,719
Yes, I want Mitch.

893
00:55:44,887 --> 00:55:46,479
Very badly.

894
00:55:46,647 --> 00:55:48,842
Just think, if it happens...

895
00:55:49,047 --> 00:55:53,199
...I can go away from here
and not be anyone's problem.

896
00:55:54,807 --> 00:55:56,843
Blanche, it will happen.

897
00:55:59,207 --> 00:56:00,606
It will?

898
00:56:01,807 --> 00:56:04,719
It will, honey, it will.

899
00:56:06,847 --> 00:56:09,520
Only, don't take another drink.

900
00:56:12,127 --> 00:56:15,039
Hey, Steve! Eunice!

901
00:56:15,327 --> 00:56:16,726
Stell!

902
00:56:22,327 --> 00:56:25,524
Oh, get away! Get away!

903
00:56:26,567 --> 00:56:29,081
- Put me down!
- Oh, you...!

904
00:56:33,607 --> 00:56:36,599
- Hiya, honey!
- Let go!

905
00:56:44,687 --> 00:56:46,723
Oh, me.

906
00:56:48,207 --> 00:56:49,845
Oh, me.

907
00:56:52,447 --> 00:56:54,324
Oh, me.

908
00:57:00,047 --> 00:57:01,560
Come in.

909
00:57:04,527 --> 00:57:06,040
Evening, ma'am.

910
00:57:07,447 --> 00:57:09,039
Well, well.

911
00:57:10,007 --> 00:57:14,364
- What can I do for you?
- Well, I'm collecting for the <i>Evening Star.</i>

912
00:57:16,127 --> 00:57:18,402
I didn't know that stars
took up collections.

913
00:57:18,567 --> 00:57:20,364
No, it's a paper, ma'am.

914
00:57:20,567 --> 00:57:21,841
I know.

915
00:57:22,007 --> 00:57:23,804
I was joking. Feebly.

916
00:57:24,567 --> 00:57:26,319
Will you...? Will you have a drink?

917
00:57:26,887 --> 00:57:28,400
No, ma'am.

918
00:57:28,847 --> 00:57:31,645
No, thank you.
I can't drink on the job.

919
00:57:49,487 --> 00:57:51,443
Well, now, let me see.

920
00:57:55,607 --> 00:57:58,565
No, no. I don't have a dime.

921
00:57:58,727 --> 00:58:02,242
I'm not the lady of the house.
I'm her sister from Mississippi.

922
00:58:02,407 --> 00:58:06,559
I'm one of those poor relations
you've heard tell about.

923
00:58:06,807 --> 00:58:09,002
Oh, that's all right, ma'am.
I'll come back later.

924
00:58:09,807 --> 00:58:11,365
Hey.

925
00:58:11,527 --> 00:58:13,199
Have you...?

926
00:58:13,727 --> 00:58:16,287
- Have you got a light?
- Sure.

927
00:58:23,927 --> 00:58:27,442
- This doesn't always work.
- It's temperamental.

928
00:58:34,567 --> 00:58:35,761
Why, thanks.

929
00:58:36,607 --> 00:58:38,120
Thank you.

930
00:58:39,607 --> 00:58:41,006
Hey.

931
00:58:41,487 --> 00:58:43,284
What...?

932
00:58:44,047 --> 00:58:45,685
What time is it?

933
00:58:47,247 --> 00:58:48,760
Fifteen of 7.

934
00:58:48,927 --> 00:58:50,326
So late?

935
00:58:50,487 --> 00:58:54,241
Don't you love these long,
rainy afternoons in New Orleans...

936
00:58:54,407 --> 00:58:56,284
...when an hour isn't just an hour...

937
00:58:56,487 --> 00:59:00,002
...but a little piece of eternity
dropped in our hands...

938
00:59:00,567 --> 00:59:03,684
...and who knows what to do with it?

939
00:59:04,607 --> 00:59:06,086
You...

940
00:59:06,247 --> 00:59:09,045
You didn't get caught in the rain?

941
00:59:09,567 --> 00:59:12,286
No, ma'am. I stepped inside.

942
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:15,440
In a drugstore and had a soda.

943
00:59:15,607 --> 00:59:17,279
- Chocolate?
- No, ma'am. Cherry.

944
00:59:17,447 --> 00:59:19,244
- Cherry.
- Cherry.

945
00:59:19,967 --> 00:59:22,686
You make my mouth water.

946
00:59:24,767 --> 00:59:26,166
I guess I...

947
00:59:26,327 --> 00:59:28,079
Young man.

948
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:30,006
Young...

949
00:59:30,327 --> 00:59:31,760
...young...

950
00:59:32,447 --> 00:59:33,721
...young man.

951
00:59:34,247 --> 00:59:39,162
Did anyone ever tell you, you look like a
young prince out of the <i>Arabian Nights?</i>

952
00:59:41,247 --> 00:59:42,999
You do, honey lamb.

953
00:59:44,487 --> 00:59:46,239
Come here.

954
00:59:47,567 --> 00:59:49,523
Come on over here, like I told you.

955
00:59:55,447 --> 00:59:57,722
I want to kiss you just once...

956
00:59:57,887 --> 00:59:59,445
...softly...

957
00:59:59,607 --> 01:00:01,563
...and sweetly on your mouth.

958
01:00:13,207 --> 01:00:14,640
Run away now, quickly.

959
01:00:15,047 --> 01:00:17,402
It'd be nice to keep you
but I've got to be good...

960
01:00:17,567 --> 01:00:19,444
...and keep my hands off children.

961
01:00:31,167 --> 01:00:32,600
Why, look who's here.

962
01:00:32,887 --> 01:00:34,923
My <i>Rosenkavalier.</i>

963
01:00:36,407 --> 01:00:38,967
Oh, bow to me first.

964
01:00:41,367 --> 01:00:43,801
Now, <i>prsentez.</i>

965
01:01:04,807 --> 01:01:06,399
Hiya, Mitch.

966
01:01:13,487 --> 01:01:16,763
I'm afraid you haven't had much
fun out of this evening, Blanche.

967
01:01:16,967 --> 01:01:19,879
- I spoiled it for you.
- No, you didn't.

968
01:01:20,047 --> 01:01:23,244
I simply couldn't rise
to the occasion, that was all.

969
01:01:23,407 --> 01:01:27,286
I don't think I've ever tried so hard to be
gay and made such a dismal mess of it.

970
01:01:27,447 --> 01:01:30,883
I get ten points for trying.
I did try.

971
01:01:34,487 --> 01:01:36,079
Hello, moon.

972
01:01:37,767 --> 01:01:39,325
I'm looking for the Pleiades...

973
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:40,761
...the Seven Sisters...

974
01:01:40,927 --> 01:01:42,804
...but these girls aren't out tonight.

975
01:01:43,007 --> 01:01:44,406
Oh, yes, they are.

976
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:46,159
There they are, God bless them.

977
01:01:46,327 --> 01:01:48,887
All in a bunch, going home
from their little bridge party.

978
01:01:49,047 --> 01:01:50,719
May I kiss you?

979
01:01:50,887 --> 01:01:52,843
Why do you always ask me if you may?

980
01:01:53,007 --> 01:01:56,204
- I don't know if you want me to or not.
- Why should you be so doubtful?

981
01:01:56,407 --> 01:01:58,159
We parked by the lake,
and I kissed you...

982
01:01:58,327 --> 01:02:01,319
Honey, it wasn't the kiss I objected to.
I liked the kiss very much.

983
01:02:01,487 --> 01:02:04,559
It was the other little familiarity
that I felt obliged to discourage.

984
01:02:04,727 --> 01:02:06,683
Not that I resented it,
not a bit in the world.

985
01:02:06,887 --> 01:02:10,163
In fact, I was somewhat flattered
that you desired me.

986
01:02:10,367 --> 01:02:14,042
But you know as well as I do that
a single girl, a girl alone in the world...

987
01:02:14,247 --> 01:02:16,363
...has got to keep a firm hold
on her emotions...

988
01:02:16,527 --> 01:02:19,360
...or she'll be lost.
- Lost?

989
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:23,042
I guess you're used to the type of girl
that likes to be lost.

990
01:02:23,767 --> 01:02:26,964
I like you to be exactly
the way that you are...

991
01:02:27,447 --> 01:02:30,564
...because in all my experience,
I have never known anyone like you.

992
01:02:36,327 --> 01:02:38,124
Are you laughing at me?

993
01:02:40,407 --> 01:02:41,760
No.

994
01:02:41,967 --> 01:02:43,559
No, honey.

995
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:45,923
I'm not laughing at you.

996
01:02:47,447 --> 01:02:50,723
Well, come on,
let's finish our nightcap.

997
01:02:50,887 --> 01:02:52,923
You've been so anxious and solemn
all evening.

998
01:02:53,087 --> 01:02:54,964
We've both been anxious and solemn.

999
01:02:55,127 --> 01:02:58,244
And now for these last few remaining
moments of our lives together...

1000
01:02:58,407 --> 01:03:00,363
...I want to create <i>joie de vivre.</i>

1001
01:03:03,567 --> 01:03:05,523
I'm lighting this candle.

1002
01:03:06,807 --> 01:03:08,001
That's good.

1003
01:03:08,167 --> 01:03:10,123
We're going to be very bohemian.

1004
01:03:10,327 --> 01:03:14,923
We are gonna pretend we're sitting in an
artists' cafe on the Left Bank in Paris.

1005
01:03:18,767 --> 01:03:21,884
- Understand French?
- No, no, I don't understand French.

1006
01:03:22,607 --> 01:03:26,202
Well, why don't you sit down.
Take off your coat. Loosen your collar.

1007
01:03:26,407 --> 01:03:29,524
- No, I better leave it on.
- No. I want you to be comfortable.

1008
01:03:29,687 --> 01:03:32,804
No, I'm ashamed of the way I perspire.
My shirt is sticking to me.

1009
01:03:33,007 --> 01:03:37,603
Perspiration is healthy. If people didn't
perspire, they would die in five minutes.

1010
01:03:37,767 --> 01:03:40,042
Oh, this is a nice coat.
What...?

1011
01:03:40,247 --> 01:03:43,159
- What material is it?
- They call this stuff alpaca.

1012
01:03:43,327 --> 01:03:46,160
- Oh, alpaca.
- It's very lightweight alpaca.

1013
01:03:46,447 --> 01:03:49,041
- Oh, lightweight alpaca.
- Yes.

1014
01:03:49,207 --> 01:03:52,722
I don't like to wear a watch coat even in
the summer because I sweat through it.

1015
01:03:52,887 --> 01:03:54,320
And it don't look neat on me.

1016
01:03:54,487 --> 01:03:58,321
A man with a heavy build is careful of
what he wears so he don't look clumsy.

1017
01:03:58,487 --> 01:04:01,445
- Why, you're not too heavy.
- You don't think I am?

1018
01:04:01,607 --> 01:04:03,359
You're not the delicate type.

1019
01:04:03,527 --> 01:04:07,759
You have a massive bone structure
and a very imposing physique.

1020
01:04:08,767 --> 01:04:10,405
I thank you.

1021
01:04:11,127 --> 01:04:14,244
At Christmas, I was given a membership
to the New Orleans Sports Club.

1022
01:04:14,447 --> 01:04:17,564
- Oh, good.
- It's the finest present I was ever given.

1023
01:04:18,127 --> 01:04:22,166
I work out there with the weights
and I swim. I keep myself fit.

1024
01:04:22,327 --> 01:04:25,603
When I started there I was soft
in the belly, but now my belly is hard.

1025
01:04:25,767 --> 01:04:29,282
It's so hard now a man can punch me
in the belly and it don't hurt me.

1026
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:33,324
Punch me.
Go ahead. Go on. Punch.

1027
01:04:33,527 --> 01:04:34,846
Come on.

1028
01:04:35,767 --> 01:04:38,486
- Gracious.
- See?

1029
01:04:38,647 --> 01:04:39,966
Blanche.

1030
01:04:40,127 --> 01:04:41,685
Blanche.

1031
01:04:42,007 --> 01:04:43,406
Guess how much I weigh?

1032
01:04:43,927 --> 01:04:49,126
- I'd say in the vicinity of 180 pounds.
- No, guess again.

1033
01:04:49,287 --> 01:04:50,686
- Not so much?
- No, more.

1034
01:04:50,847 --> 01:04:53,486
- Well?
- I weigh 207 pounds.

1035
01:04:53,647 --> 01:04:55,842
I'm 6' 1 " and one-half inches tall
in my bare feet...

1036
01:04:56,047 --> 01:04:58,322
...without shoes on,
and that's what I weigh stripped.

1037
01:04:58,647 --> 01:05:02,322
Oh, my goodness, it's awe-inspiring.

1038
01:05:03,447 --> 01:05:06,166
Well, my weight's not a very
interesting subject to talk about.

1039
01:05:06,327 --> 01:05:07,919
What's yours?

1040
01:05:08,727 --> 01:05:10,001
- My weight?
- Yes.

1041
01:05:10,167 --> 01:05:12,362
- You guess.
- Let me lift you.

1042
01:05:12,647 --> 01:05:16,322
Samson. Go on, lift me!

1043
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:21,683
- Why, you're light as a feather.
- You may release me now.

1044
01:05:22,007 --> 01:05:24,680
I said unhand me, sir.

1045
01:05:24,847 --> 01:05:28,442
Mitch, Mitch, we're in public.
You must behave like a gentleman.

1046
01:05:28,607 --> 01:05:30,723
Just give me a slap
whenever I step out of bounds.

1047
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:35,523
It won't be necessary. You're a natural
gentleman. One of the few left.

1048
01:05:35,687 --> 01:05:39,282
I don't want you to think that I'm
severe or old-maid schoolteacherish...

1049
01:05:39,447 --> 01:05:41,244
...or anything. It's just, well, l...

1050
01:05:41,447 --> 01:05:45,679
I guess I have old-fashioned ideals.

1051
01:05:58,967 --> 01:06:01,083
Where's Stanley and Stella tonight?

1052
01:06:01,247 --> 01:06:04,284
I think they were planning
to take in a midnight preview.

1053
01:06:04,447 --> 01:06:06,722
We all ought to go out together
some night.

1054
01:06:08,207 --> 01:06:10,243
That wouldn't be a good plan.

1055
01:06:10,447 --> 01:06:11,800
Why not?

1056
01:06:12,167 --> 01:06:14,442
You are an old friend of Stanley's?

1057
01:06:14,647 --> 01:06:16,524
We was together in the 241 st.

1058
01:06:16,727 --> 01:06:19,924
- I guess he talks to you pretty frankly.
- Sure.

1059
01:06:20,127 --> 01:06:22,243
Has he talked to you about me?

1060
01:06:23,927 --> 01:06:25,565
- No, not much.
- The way you say that...

1061
01:06:25,727 --> 01:06:27,763
...I suspect that he has.
- He hasn't said much.

1062
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:31,721
Well, what he has said, what would
you say his attitude toward me was?

1063
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:33,525
- What makes you ask that?
- Well...

1064
01:06:33,687 --> 01:06:35,643
Don't you get along with him?

1065
01:06:36,087 --> 01:06:37,600
What do you think?

1066
01:06:37,767 --> 01:06:39,723
I think he don't understand you.

1067
01:06:40,247 --> 01:06:44,843
That's putting it mildly. Surely he must
have told you how much he hates me.

1068
01:06:49,207 --> 01:06:50,845
I don't think he hates you.

1069
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:54,124
He hates me,
or why would he insult me?

1070
01:06:54,447 --> 01:06:55,641
Of course...

1071
01:06:55,807 --> 01:06:58,560
...there is such a thing as
the hostility of...

1072
01:06:58,727 --> 01:07:03,243
Perhaps in some strange
kind of way, he...

1073
01:07:05,847 --> 01:07:07,485
To think of it makes me...

1074
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:10,286
- Blanche.
- Yes, honey?

1075
01:07:10,447 --> 01:07:14,201
- Blanche, can I ask you a question?
- Yes, what?

1076
01:07:14,767 --> 01:07:16,280
How old are you?

1077
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:21,004
What do you want to know that for?

1078
01:07:21,167 --> 01:07:25,285
I talked to my mother about you
and she said, "How old is Blanche?"

1079
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:29,603
- You talked to your mother about me?
- Yes.

1080
01:07:29,767 --> 01:07:31,246
Why?

1081
01:07:31,607 --> 01:07:34,804
Because I told her how nice
you were, and I liked you.

1082
01:07:35,687 --> 01:07:38,679
Were you sincere about that?

1083
01:07:39,687 --> 01:07:42,121
You know I was.

1084
01:07:42,647 --> 01:07:46,162
Why did your mother
want to know my age?

1085
01:07:46,367 --> 01:07:50,565
- My mother is sick, and...
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear it. Badly?

1086
01:07:50,887 --> 01:07:52,684
She won't live long...

1087
01:07:52,887 --> 01:07:56,323
...maybe just a few months,
and she worries because I'm not settled.

1088
01:07:56,487 --> 01:07:59,285
She wants to see me
settled down before she...

1089
01:08:02,647 --> 01:08:05,639
You love her very much, don't you?

1090
01:08:07,927 --> 01:08:11,203
You'll be lonely when she passes on,
won't you?

1091
01:08:15,127 --> 01:08:17,402
I know what that means.

1092
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:21,559
To be lonely?

1093
01:08:22,687 --> 01:08:24,882
I loved someone once.

1094
01:08:25,047 --> 01:08:27,800
And the person I loved, I lost.

1095
01:08:29,007 --> 01:08:30,326
Dead?

1096
01:08:34,007 --> 01:08:35,804
He was a boy.

1097
01:08:36,567 --> 01:08:39,684
Just a boy,
when I was a very young girl.

1098
01:08:40,367 --> 01:08:43,120
When I was 16, I made the discovery:

1099
01:08:43,287 --> 01:08:44,845
Love.

1100
01:08:45,327 --> 01:08:47,124
All at once, and much...

1101
01:08:47,287 --> 01:08:49,562
...much too completely.

1102
01:08:49,847 --> 01:08:53,123
It was like you suddenly turned
a blinding light...

1103
01:08:53,327 --> 01:08:56,922
...on something that had
always been half in shadow.

1104
01:08:57,327 --> 01:09:00,285
That's how it struck the world for me.

1105
01:09:00,607 --> 01:09:02,484
But I was unlucky.

1106
01:09:02,687 --> 01:09:04,279
Deluded.

1107
01:09:05,247 --> 01:09:07,761
There was something about the boy.

1108
01:09:07,927 --> 01:09:10,487
A nervousness, a tenderness...

1109
01:09:10,647 --> 01:09:12,319
...an uncertainty.

1110
01:09:12,487 --> 01:09:14,523
And I didn't understand.

1111
01:09:15,007 --> 01:09:19,000
I didn't understand why this boy,
who wrote poetry...

1112
01:09:19,167 --> 01:09:21,522
...didn't seem able to do anything else.

1113
01:09:21,727 --> 01:09:23,683
He lost every job.

1114
01:09:24,567 --> 01:09:26,603
He came to me for help.

1115
01:09:26,767 --> 01:09:28,439
I didn't know that.

1116
01:09:29,007 --> 01:09:30,963
I didn't know anything...

1117
01:09:31,127 --> 01:09:33,243
...except that I loved him...

1118
01:09:33,527 --> 01:09:35,279
...unendurably.

1119
01:09:36,167 --> 01:09:38,522
At night I pretended to sleep.

1120
01:09:39,127 --> 01:09:40,719
I heard him crying.

1121
01:09:41,687 --> 01:09:43,120
Crying.

1122
01:09:45,847 --> 01:09:48,725
Crying the way a lost child cries.

1123
01:09:49,527 --> 01:09:50,801
I don't understand.

1124
01:09:51,767 --> 01:09:53,200
No.

1125
01:09:54,967 --> 01:09:57,083
No, neither did I.

1126
01:09:58,127 --> 01:10:00,083
And that's why I...

1127
01:10:01,367 --> 01:10:03,403
I killed him.

1128
01:10:04,887 --> 01:10:06,206
You...?

1129
01:10:15,607 --> 01:10:17,165
One night...

1130
01:10:17,567 --> 01:10:21,082
...we drove out to a place
called Moon Lake Casino.

1131
01:10:21,687 --> 01:10:24,360
We danced the Varsouviana.

1132
01:10:24,567 --> 01:10:28,560
Suddenly, in the middle of the dance,
the boy I married broke away from me...

1133
01:10:28,727 --> 01:10:30,399
...and ran out of the casino.

1134
01:10:30,607 --> 01:10:32,165
A few minutes later...

1135
01:10:32,327 --> 01:10:33,885
...a shot.

1136
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:36,046
I ran.

1137
01:10:36,207 --> 01:10:37,560
All did.

1138
01:10:37,727 --> 01:10:41,322
All ran and gathered about
the terrible thing at the edge of the lake.

1139
01:10:48,887 --> 01:10:51,560
He'd stuck a revolver into his mouth...

1140
01:10:51,727 --> 01:10:53,206
...and fired.

1141
01:10:58,567 --> 01:11:00,603
It was because...

1142
01:11:00,847 --> 01:11:02,803
...on the dance floor...

1143
01:11:03,047 --> 01:11:06,084
...unable to stop myself, I'd said:

1144
01:11:06,647 --> 01:11:08,319
"You're weak.

1145
01:11:08,567 --> 01:11:11,001
I've lost respect for you.

1146
01:11:11,727 --> 01:11:14,161
I despise you."

1147
01:11:19,327 --> 01:11:20,726
And then...

1148
01:11:22,167 --> 01:11:25,523
...the searchlight
which had been turned on the world...

1149
01:11:25,727 --> 01:11:27,843
...was turned off again.

1150
01:11:28,167 --> 01:11:29,566
And never...

1151
01:11:29,727 --> 01:11:34,243
...for one moment since,
has there been any light stronger than...

1152
01:11:35,087 --> 01:11:36,566
Than this...

1153
01:11:37,127 --> 01:11:39,004
...yellow lantern.

1154
01:11:54,407 --> 01:11:56,363
You need somebody.

1155
01:11:57,127 --> 01:11:59,322
And I need somebody too.

1156
01:12:05,767 --> 01:12:08,122
Could it be you and me, Blanche?

1157
01:12:23,767 --> 01:12:25,644
Sometimes...

1158
01:12:26,447 --> 01:12:28,403
...there's God...

1159
01:12:29,527 --> 01:12:31,643
...so quickly.

1160
01:12:35,487 --> 01:12:39,844
You wanna mess with me, sonny boy,
come on! All right, turn him loose!

1161
01:12:40,047 --> 01:12:43,244
You're gonna kill who? You don't even
know when you're getting wised up.

1162
01:12:43,607 --> 01:12:45,165
You don't have to wise me up!

1163
01:12:45,327 --> 01:12:48,683
Come on, here. Come on,
get to work here. We gotta get going.

1164
01:12:48,847 --> 01:12:50,485
We got some bucks
to make around here.

1165
01:12:50,647 --> 01:12:52,524
Go ahead and marry her,
but hurry it up.

1166
01:12:52,687 --> 01:12:55,281
She's been in my house
five months and her time is up.

1167
01:13:26,647 --> 01:13:28,444
Hello, Stanley.

1168
01:13:36,127 --> 01:13:38,243
Some canary bird.

1169
01:13:39,527 --> 01:13:41,040
All right.

1170
01:13:41,207 --> 01:13:45,246
Please tell me quietly just what you think
you found out about my sister.

1171
01:13:45,407 --> 01:13:48,080
You know your sister Blanche
is no lily, don't you?

1172
01:13:48,247 --> 01:13:50,283
What have you heard,
and who from?

1173
01:13:50,487 --> 01:13:53,001
You should know the line
that she's been feeding to Mitch.

1174
01:13:53,167 --> 01:13:56,079
Our supply man at the plant's
been going through Auriol for years.

1175
01:13:56,247 --> 01:13:57,760
He knows all about her.

1176
01:13:57,927 --> 01:14:01,442
And everybody else in the town
of Auriol knows all about her.

1177
01:14:01,647 --> 01:14:05,162
She's as famous in Auriol as if she was
the president of the United States...

1178
01:14:05,367 --> 01:14:08,245
...only she's not respected by any party.

1179
01:14:16,527 --> 01:14:19,280
So she moved to a hotel
called the Flamingo...

1180
01:14:19,447 --> 01:14:21,642
...which is a second-class hotel...

1181
01:14:21,847 --> 01:14:23,599
...and has the advantages...

1182
01:14:23,767 --> 01:14:27,601
...of not interfering with the private
and social life of the personalities there.

1183
01:14:27,767 --> 01:14:30,645
Now, the Flamingo is used to
all kinds of goings on.

1184
01:14:30,807 --> 01:14:35,119
But the management of the Flamingo
was impressed by Dame Blanche.

1185
01:14:35,287 --> 01:14:37,721
In fact, they were so impressed
that they requested her...

1186
01:14:37,887 --> 01:14:40,003
...to turn in her room key
for permanently.

1187
01:14:40,167 --> 01:14:43,842
And this happened a couple of weeks
before she showed here.

1188
01:14:50,647 --> 01:14:53,639
Honey, I know how
this is gonna upset you.

1189
01:14:53,807 --> 01:14:57,163
But listen, she pulled the wool
over your eyes just as much as Mitch's.

1190
01:14:57,367 --> 01:14:59,164
Pure invention.
Not a word of truth in it.

1191
01:14:59,367 --> 01:15:01,801
Baby, listen. I checked on every story.

1192
01:15:01,967 --> 01:15:05,482
The trouble was she couldn't
put on her act anymore in Auriol...

1193
01:15:05,647 --> 01:15:06,921
...because they wised up.

1194
01:15:07,087 --> 01:15:09,965
And after two, three days they quit,
so she goes on to another one.

1195
01:15:10,127 --> 01:15:12,641
The same old line, the same old act
and the same old hooey.

1196
01:15:12,807 --> 01:15:15,082
And as time went by,
she became the town character...

1197
01:15:15,287 --> 01:15:18,199
...regarded not just as different,
but downright loco and nuts.

1198
01:15:18,367 --> 01:15:20,722
Which brings us to lie number two...

1199
01:15:22,487 --> 01:15:24,045
Stella.

1200
01:15:25,207 --> 01:15:26,401
Baby, now...

1201
01:15:26,567 --> 01:15:30,003
She didn't resign temporarily because
of her nerves. She was kicked out...

1202
01:15:30,207 --> 01:15:32,163
...before the spring term ended.

1203
01:15:36,007 --> 01:15:38,680
And, now, I hate to tell you the reason
that step was taken.

1204
01:15:38,847 --> 01:15:41,202
A 17-year-old kid
she got mixed up with.

1205
01:15:41,367 --> 01:15:42,959
The boy's dad learned about it...

1206
01:15:43,127 --> 01:15:45,641
...and he got in touch
with the high school superintendent.

1207
01:15:45,807 --> 01:15:48,401
And it was practically a town ordinance
passed against her.

1208
01:15:48,567 --> 01:15:51,161
- Stella!
- Yes, Blanche?

1209
01:15:51,327 --> 01:15:54,285
Can I have another bath towel
to dry my hair with? I just washed it.

1210
01:15:54,447 --> 01:15:55,926
Yes, honey.

1211
01:16:00,327 --> 01:16:02,761
- What's the matter, honey?
- Matter, what?

1212
01:16:03,287 --> 01:16:05,642
You have such a strange
expression on your face.

1213
01:16:05,847 --> 01:16:08,441
- I guess I'm a little tired, is...
- Well...

1214
01:16:08,607 --> 01:16:10,962
...why don't you take a hot bath
as soon as I get out?

1215
01:16:11,447 --> 01:16:13,244
How soon is that gonna be, Blanche?

1216
01:16:13,407 --> 01:16:16,160
Not so terribly long,
possess your soul in patience.

1217
01:16:16,327 --> 01:16:18,363
It's not my soul I'm worried about.

1218
01:16:22,807 --> 01:16:24,240
Well?

1219
01:16:29,767 --> 01:16:31,564
How many candles
you sticking in the cake?

1220
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:34,760
I stopped at 25.

1221
01:16:35,647 --> 01:16:37,399
You got company expected?

1222
01:16:37,567 --> 01:16:39,444
We asked Mitch to come over.

1223
01:16:39,607 --> 01:16:42,167
Well, don't expect Mitch
over here tonight.

1224
01:16:42,807 --> 01:16:44,081
Why?

1225
01:16:45,487 --> 01:16:49,446
Mitch is a buddy of mine.
We was together in the 241 st Engineers.

1226
01:16:49,607 --> 01:16:52,360
We work in the same plant,
we're on the same bowling team!

1227
01:16:52,527 --> 01:16:54,722
Stanley Kowalski, did you repeat
what that...?

1228
01:16:54,927 --> 01:16:57,441
You bet I told him.
I would have that on my conscience...

1229
01:16:57,607 --> 01:16:59,962
...if I knew all that
and let my best friend get caught.

1230
01:17:00,127 --> 01:17:02,163
- Is Mitch through with her?
- I don't know...

1231
01:17:02,367 --> 01:17:04,801
...but he's wised up.
- Mitch was gonna marry her!

1232
01:17:04,967 --> 01:17:06,719
He's not gonna marry her now!

1233
01:17:06,887 --> 01:17:09,242
He's not gonna jump into a tank
with a school of sharks.

1234
01:17:09,407 --> 01:17:13,844
- What'll she do? What will she do?
- Oh, her future is mapped out for her.

1235
01:17:14,647 --> 01:17:16,399
What do you mean?

1236
01:17:16,567 --> 01:17:21,163
Hey, toots! Canary bird,
will you get out of the bathroom!

1237
01:17:23,927 --> 01:17:26,441
I feel so good after a long, hot bath.

1238
01:17:26,607 --> 01:17:29,041
I feel so good and cool and rested.

1239
01:17:30,167 --> 01:17:33,045
- Do you, Blanche?
- Yes, I do. So refreshed.

1240
01:17:33,207 --> 01:17:35,402
Why, a hot bath
and a long, cold drink...

1241
01:17:35,607 --> 01:17:38,724
...always gives me
a brand-new outlook on life.

1242
01:17:40,327 --> 01:17:41,840
What's the matter?

1243
01:17:42,087 --> 01:17:43,884
What's happened.

1244
01:17:44,127 --> 01:17:47,881
- What is it?
- Nothing's happened, Blanche.

1245
01:17:48,327 --> 01:17:50,045
You're lying.

1246
01:17:50,607 --> 01:17:52,404
Something has.

1247
01:18:00,367 --> 01:18:01,925
Stanley?

1248
01:18:02,087 --> 01:18:03,600
Stanley, tell us a joke.

1249
01:18:03,767 --> 01:18:05,962
Tell us a funny little story
to make us all laugh.

1250
01:18:06,167 --> 01:18:08,362
I don't know what's the matter,
we're all so solemn.

1251
01:18:08,567 --> 01:18:10,444
Is it because I've been
stood up by my beau?

1252
01:18:10,647 --> 01:18:14,162
First time in my experience with men...
And I've had a good deal of all sorts.

1253
01:18:14,327 --> 01:18:15,999
- that I've been stood up by anyone.

1254
01:18:16,167 --> 01:18:17,680
I don't know how to take it.

1255
01:18:19,327 --> 01:18:21,124
Tell us a funny little story, Stanley.

1256
01:18:21,327 --> 01:18:23,522
Something to help us out.

1257
01:18:23,727 --> 01:18:25,922
I didn't think you liked
my stories, Blanche.

1258
01:18:26,087 --> 01:18:28,806
I like them when they're amusing,
but not indecent.

1259
01:18:28,967 --> 01:18:32,004
I don't know any refined enough
for your taste.

1260
01:18:33,327 --> 01:18:35,283
Well, then. Let me tell one.

1261
01:18:35,447 --> 01:18:38,200
Yes, tell one, Blanche.
You used to know a lot of good stories.

1262
01:18:38,967 --> 01:18:41,322
Now, let me see. I have to run
through my repertoire.

1263
01:18:41,527 --> 01:18:43,404
Oh, yes, I love parrot stories.

1264
01:18:43,567 --> 01:18:46,639
You all like parrot stories? This is about
the old maid and the parrot.

1265
01:18:46,807 --> 01:18:49,446
This old maid, she had a parrot
that cursed a blue streak...

1266
01:18:49,607 --> 01:18:52,724
...and knew more vulgar expressions
than Mr. Kowalski.

1267
01:18:53,327 --> 01:18:56,683
Well, the only way to hush the parrot up
was to put the cover...

1268
01:19:03,927 --> 01:19:05,724
Must be upstairs.

1269
01:19:06,887 --> 01:19:09,845
Well, the only way
to hush the parrot up was to put...

1270
01:19:10,407 --> 01:19:11,760
Go on, Blanche.

1271
01:19:13,047 --> 01:19:14,366
No.

1272
01:19:14,647 --> 01:19:16,842
I don't think
Mr. Kowalski will be amused.

1273
01:19:19,767 --> 01:19:23,442
Mr. Kowalski is too busy making
a pig of himself to think of anything else.

1274
01:19:24,127 --> 01:19:26,322
Your face and your fingers
are disgustingly greasy.

1275
01:19:26,527 --> 01:19:28,643
Go wash up
and then help me clear the table.

1276
01:19:38,287 --> 01:19:41,199
Now, that's how
I'm gonna clear the table.

1277
01:19:42,207 --> 01:19:45,324
Don't you ever talk that way to me.

1278
01:19:47,327 --> 01:19:51,240
Pig, Polack, disgusting, vulgar, greasy.

1279
01:19:51,927 --> 01:19:54,646
Those words have been on your tongue
and your sister's tongue...

1280
01:19:54,807 --> 01:19:56,559
...just too much around here.

1281
01:19:58,167 --> 01:20:00,522
Who do you think you are,
a pair of queens?

1282
01:20:00,687 --> 01:20:04,600
Remember Huey Long said: Every man's
a king, and I'm the king around here.

1283
01:20:04,767 --> 01:20:06,723
And don't you forget it.

1284
01:20:13,967 --> 01:20:17,403
My place is all cleared up now.
You want me to clear yours?

1285
01:20:26,487 --> 01:20:27,761
Stella...

1286
01:20:27,927 --> 01:20:29,724
...what happened while I was bathing?

1287
01:20:29,927 --> 01:20:34,079
- What did he tell you?
- Nothing. Nothing, nothing, Blanche.

1288
01:20:34,247 --> 01:20:36,920
- I think he told you about Mitch and me.
- No.

1289
01:20:37,087 --> 01:20:39,282
You know why Mitch didn't come,
but you won't tell.

1290
01:20:39,447 --> 01:20:41,483
- No.
- I'm gonna call him.

1291
01:20:41,687 --> 01:20:44,759
- Don't call him!
- Yes, I am. I'll call him on the phone.

1292
01:20:45,487 --> 01:20:46,840
Blanche, I wouldn't call him.

1293
01:20:47,007 --> 01:20:49,805
Got to be given some explanation
from someone.

1294
01:20:54,687 --> 01:20:56,962
Well, I hope you're pleased
with your doings.

1295
01:20:57,887 --> 01:21:01,323
I never had so much trouble
swallowing food in my life...

1296
01:21:01,767 --> 01:21:04,600
...Iooking at that girl's face
and that empty chair.

1297
01:21:04,767 --> 01:21:08,521
Hello? I want to talk
to Mr. Mitchell, please.

1298
01:21:10,887 --> 01:21:12,684
I'd like to leave a number, if I may.

1299
01:21:12,887 --> 01:21:15,606
- Honey.
- Tulane-4947.

1300
01:21:15,767 --> 01:21:18,201
And say it's important to call, please.

1301
01:21:18,407 --> 01:21:23,083
Honey, it's gonna be all right after
she goes and after you have the baby.

1302
01:21:23,367 --> 01:21:26,484
It's gonna be all right again
between you and me, the way it was.

1303
01:21:26,687 --> 01:21:28,564
Remember how it was?

1304
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:32,084
It's gonna be so sweet when we can
get them colored lights going...

1305
01:21:32,247 --> 01:21:35,205
...with nobody's sister
behind the curtains to hear us.

1306
01:21:46,367 --> 01:21:48,722
Steve and Eunice.

1307
01:21:50,927 --> 01:21:53,521
Come on back in.

1308
01:21:55,607 --> 01:21:57,199
Blanche?

1309
01:21:58,127 --> 01:21:59,685
Blanche!

1310
01:21:59,847 --> 01:22:03,442
- Yes?
- Oh, come on, hon.

1311
01:22:04,367 --> 01:22:07,120
Oh, what pretty, pretty candles.
Don't burn them, Stella.

1312
01:22:07,287 --> 01:22:09,721
- I certainly will.
- No.

1313
01:22:09,887 --> 01:22:11,923
You ought to save them
for baby's birthdays.

1314
01:22:12,087 --> 01:22:14,521
Oh, I hope candles are gonna
glow in his life.

1315
01:22:14,687 --> 01:22:16,882
I hope his eyes are gonna be
like candles...

1316
01:22:17,047 --> 01:22:19,845
...like two blue candles...

1317
01:22:20,087 --> 01:22:21,805
Lining a white cake.

1318
01:22:21,967 --> 01:22:23,161
What poetry.

1319
01:22:28,407 --> 01:22:29,726
I shouldn't have called him.

1320
01:22:29,887 --> 01:22:33,402
Blanche! You know, it's hot in there
with the steam from that bathroom!

1321
01:22:34,967 --> 01:22:38,323
I said I was sorry three times!

1322
01:22:41,607 --> 01:22:43,404
I take hot baths for my nerves.

1323
01:22:43,607 --> 01:22:45,404
Hydrotherapy, they call it.

1324
01:22:45,567 --> 01:22:47,842
You healthy Polack,
without a nerve in your body.

1325
01:22:48,007 --> 01:22:50,760
How can you possibly know
what anxiety feels like?

1326
01:22:50,927 --> 01:22:53,043
I am not a Polack!

1327
01:22:53,207 --> 01:22:56,279
People from Poland are Poles,
they are not Polacks!

1328
01:22:56,447 --> 01:22:58,802
But what I am
is 100 percent American!

1329
01:22:58,967 --> 01:23:02,084
I'm born and raised in the greatest
country on earth and I'm proud of it!

1330
01:23:02,247 --> 01:23:05,239
- And don't you ever call me a Polack!
- That's for me, I'm sure!

1331
01:23:05,407 --> 01:23:07,762
Just keep your seat.
I'm not so sure.

1332
01:23:09,487 --> 01:23:10,966
- Hello.
- <i>Stanley?</i>

1333
01:23:11,247 --> 01:23:13,283
- Yeah, Mac.
- <i>Listen, Stanley...</i>

1334
01:23:14,167 --> 01:23:16,840
Take your hands off me, Stella.
What's the matter with you?

1335
01:23:17,007 --> 01:23:20,522
- Why do you give me that pitying look?
- Will you shut up!

1336
01:23:22,167 --> 01:23:25,204
No, we got a noisy woman in the place.

1337
01:23:25,847 --> 01:23:30,523
I told you I don't want to bowl at Riley's.
I had a little trouble with Riley last week.

1338
01:23:30,687 --> 01:23:34,726
I'm the team captain, ain't I? All right.
Then we're not gonna bowl at Riley's.

1339
01:23:34,887 --> 01:23:37,720
We're gonna bowl at the West Side
or at the Gate, and I'll see you.

1340
01:23:37,887 --> 01:23:39,366
Sister Blanche...

1341
01:23:39,527 --> 01:23:42,519
...I got a little birthday
remembrance for you.

1342
01:23:45,247 --> 01:23:47,363
I hope that you like it.

1343
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:58,962
- Why, it's a...
- That's a bus ticket back to Auriol.

1344
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:00,725
Tuesday.

1345
01:24:09,927 --> 01:24:11,565
Blanche.

1346
01:24:17,807 --> 01:24:20,401
You didn't need to do that.

1347
01:24:20,567 --> 01:24:22,922
Don't forget all that I took off of her.

1348
01:24:23,127 --> 01:24:25,721
You didn't need to be so cruel
to someone as alone as she is.

1349
01:24:25,887 --> 01:24:28,526
- A delicate article, she is.
- She is. She was.

1350
01:24:28,687 --> 01:24:30,166
You didn't know Blanche as a girl.

1351
01:24:30,327 --> 01:24:33,125
Nobody, nobody was as tender
and as trusting as she was.

1352
01:24:33,287 --> 01:24:36,563
But people like you abused her
and forced her to change.

1353
01:24:37,007 --> 01:24:39,965
- Do you think you're going bowling now?
- That's right.

1354
01:24:40,487 --> 01:24:42,842
You're not going bowling.
Why did you do this to her?

1355
01:24:43,007 --> 01:24:45,043
- Let go of me.
- I want to know why! Tell me why!

1356
01:24:45,247 --> 01:24:46,441
Hey, cool it!

1357
01:24:46,647 --> 01:24:50,401
Listen, baby, when we first met,
you and me, you thought I was common.

1358
01:24:50,607 --> 01:24:53,201
Well, how right you was.
I was common as dirt.

1359
01:24:53,367 --> 01:24:55,483
You showed me a snapshot
of a place with columns...

1360
01:24:55,687 --> 01:24:58,360
...and I pulled you down off them
columns and you loved it.

1361
01:24:58,527 --> 01:25:00,165
Having them colored lights going.

1362
01:25:00,327 --> 01:25:03,444
And wasn't we happy together?
Wasn't it all okay till she showed here?

1363
01:25:04,607 --> 01:25:08,600
Huh? Wasn't we happy together?
Wasn't it all okay till she showed here?

1364
01:25:08,767 --> 01:25:11,839
Hoity-toity, describing me like a ape.

1365
01:25:17,687 --> 01:25:18,881
Stella?

1366
01:25:23,487 --> 01:25:25,364
What's the matter with you?

1367
01:25:30,007 --> 01:25:32,362
Honey, what's the matter with you?

1368
01:25:39,567 --> 01:25:41,523
Honey, did I hurt you?

1369
01:25:42,847 --> 01:25:44,803
Baby, what is it?

1370
01:25:47,647 --> 01:25:50,207
Take me to the hospital.

1371
01:26:18,127 --> 01:26:20,163
Who is it, please?

1372
01:26:20,367 --> 01:26:23,120
Me. Me, Mitch.

1373
01:26:24,767 --> 01:26:26,280
Mitch.

1374
01:26:35,687 --> 01:26:37,484
Just a minute, please.

1375
01:26:44,847 --> 01:26:47,566
Coming. Coming.

1376
01:26:55,607 --> 01:26:56,801
Hello, Mitch.

1377
01:26:56,967 --> 01:27:00,642
You know, I really shouldn't let you in
after the treatment I received from you.

1378
01:27:01,007 --> 01:27:03,760
So utterly uncavalier.
But, hello, beautiful.

1379
01:27:03,927 --> 01:27:07,044
Oh, my, my, what a cold shoulder.
And what uncouth apparel.

1380
01:27:07,247 --> 01:27:08,566
Why, you haven't even shaved.

1381
01:27:08,727 --> 01:27:11,002
But I forgive you,
because it's a relief to see you.

1382
01:27:11,207 --> 01:27:13,084
You stopped that polka tune
I had in my head.

1383
01:27:13,287 --> 01:27:14,959
Ever get anything caught in your head?

1384
01:27:15,127 --> 01:27:17,846
Of course not, you never get
anything awful caught in your head.

1385
01:27:18,007 --> 01:27:19,599
- We have to have that fan on?
- No.

1386
01:27:19,767 --> 01:27:22,327
- I don't like fans.
- Well, let's turn it off, honey.

1387
01:27:22,487 --> 01:27:23,761
I'm not partial to them.

1388
01:27:23,927 --> 01:27:26,521
I don't know what there is to drink,
I haven't investigated.

1389
01:27:26,687 --> 01:27:29,042
- I don't want Stan's liquor.
- It isn't Stan's!

1390
01:27:29,247 --> 01:27:32,205
Some things on the premises
are actually mine.

1391
01:27:32,447 --> 01:27:33,641
How's your mother?

1392
01:27:34,047 --> 01:27:36,607
- Is your mother well?
- Why?

1393
01:27:37,167 --> 01:27:39,123
Something the matter with you.
But never mind.

1394
01:27:39,287 --> 01:27:43,439
I won't cross-examine the witness, I'll just
pretend I didn't notice anything different.

1395
01:27:44,247 --> 01:27:46,283
It's that music again.

1396
01:27:48,727 --> 01:27:50,365
What music?

1397
01:27:51,727 --> 01:27:54,241
The polka tune they were playing
when Allan...

1398
01:27:55,967 --> 01:27:57,480
Wait.

1399
01:27:58,007 --> 01:27:59,201
There...

1400
01:27:59,567 --> 01:28:01,080
...the shot.

1401
01:28:04,087 --> 01:28:06,521
It always stops after that.

1402
01:28:10,007 --> 01:28:11,360
Yes.

1403
01:28:12,367 --> 01:28:14,164
Now it's stopped.

1404
01:28:16,527 --> 01:28:18,199
Are you boxed out of your mind?

1405
01:28:24,847 --> 01:28:27,566
Oh, I'll go and see what I can
find in the way of...

1406
01:28:27,727 --> 01:28:31,481
By the way, forgive me not being
dressed. I'd practically given you up.

1407
01:28:31,647 --> 01:28:35,003
- Had you forgotten your invitation?
- I wasn't going to see you anymore.

1408
01:28:35,167 --> 01:28:36,839
Wait, I can't hear what you're saying.

1409
01:28:37,007 --> 01:28:38,963
You talk so seldom,
when you do say anything...

1410
01:28:39,127 --> 01:28:41,163
...I don't want to miss
a single syllable of it.

1411
01:28:41,407 --> 01:28:44,126
What am I looking for around here?
Oh, yes. The liquor.

1412
01:28:44,287 --> 01:28:47,279
We've had so much excitement,
I am boxed out of my mind.

1413
01:28:47,447 --> 01:28:48,846
Here's something.

1414
01:28:49,007 --> 01:28:51,123
"Southern Cheer."

1415
01:28:51,287 --> 01:28:53,164
What can that be, I wonder?

1416
01:28:53,807 --> 01:28:56,082
Take your foot off the bed.
It has a clean cover on it.

1417
01:28:56,287 --> 01:28:58,164
You boys wouldn't notice
a thing like that.

1418
01:28:58,327 --> 01:29:02,286
- I've done so much to this place since l...
- Aren't you leaving here pretty soon?

1419
01:29:02,647 --> 01:29:05,081
I wonder if this ought to be
mixed with something.

1420
01:29:06,487 --> 01:29:09,524
It's sweet, terribly sweet.
Why, I believe it's a liqueur.

1421
01:29:09,687 --> 01:29:12,963
Yes, that's what it is, a liqueur.
I don't think you'll like it, but try it.

1422
01:29:13,167 --> 01:29:14,805
- Maybe you will.
- I told you before...

1423
01:29:14,967 --> 01:29:17,003
...I don't want any of his liquor,
and I mean it.

1424
01:29:17,167 --> 01:29:19,601
He says you been lapping it up
all summer like a wildcat.

1425
01:29:19,807 --> 01:29:22,924
I won't descend to the level
of such a cheap accusation to answer...

1426
01:29:23,447 --> 01:29:25,199
What's in your mind?

1427
01:29:25,607 --> 01:29:27,962
- I see something in your eyes.
- It's dark in here.

1428
01:29:28,167 --> 01:29:30,806
I like the dark.
The dark is comforting to me.

1429
01:29:31,087 --> 01:29:33,681
I've never seen you in the light.
That's a fact.

1430
01:29:33,847 --> 01:29:35,724
I've never seen you in the afternoon.

1431
01:29:36,327 --> 01:29:40,161
- I met you at the plant in the afternoon.
- Not on Sunday afternoon!

1432
01:29:40,327 --> 01:29:43,842
You never wanna go out till after 6, then
it's always someplace not lighted much.

1433
01:29:44,007 --> 01:29:46,043
Some obscure meaning in this
I fail to catch.

1434
01:29:46,207 --> 01:29:48,721
What it means is I've never had
a real good look at you.

1435
01:29:48,887 --> 01:29:50,764
- Let's turn the light on.
- Light? What for?

1436
01:29:50,967 --> 01:29:53,162
This one here with
this paper thing on it.

1437
01:29:54,007 --> 01:29:57,886
- What did you want to do that for?
- So I can see you, good and plain.

1438
01:29:58,047 --> 01:30:01,084
- You don't really mean to be insulting.
- No, just realistic.

1439
01:30:01,247 --> 01:30:03,602
- I don't want realism. I want magic.
- Magic.

1440
01:30:03,767 --> 01:30:05,803
Yes, yes, magic.

1441
01:30:06,007 --> 01:30:09,443
I try to give that to people. I do
misrepresent things, I don't tell truth.

1442
01:30:09,607 --> 01:30:13,282
I tell what ought to be truth and if that
is sinful, then let me be punished for it.

1443
01:30:13,447 --> 01:30:15,642
Don't turn the light on!

1444
01:30:23,847 --> 01:30:27,123
Oh, I don't mind you
being older than what I thought...

1445
01:30:28,607 --> 01:30:30,643
...but all the rest of it.

1446
01:30:32,487 --> 01:30:36,719
Why, that pitch about your ideals
being so old-fashioned...

1447
01:30:36,887 --> 01:30:39,606
...and all the malarkey that
you've been dishing out all summer.

1448
01:30:39,767 --> 01:30:43,646
I knew you weren't 16, but I was
fool enough to believe you was straight!

1449
01:30:44,327 --> 01:30:46,841
Who told you I wasn't straight?
My loving brother-in-law?

1450
01:30:47,007 --> 01:30:48,406
- And you believed him?
- No!

1451
01:30:48,727 --> 01:30:52,800
No, I called him a liar at first
and then I checked on the story.

1452
01:30:52,967 --> 01:30:55,481
I talked over long distance
to this merchant in Auriol.

1453
01:30:55,647 --> 01:30:57,603
- Who is this merchant?
- Kiefaber.

1454
01:30:57,767 --> 01:31:00,725
The merchant Kiefaber of Auriol.
I know the man. He whistled at me.

1455
01:31:00,887 --> 01:31:03,321
I put him in his place.
Now he makes up stories about me.

1456
01:31:03,487 --> 01:31:05,443
Didn't you stay at a hotel
called the Flamingo?

1457
01:31:05,647 --> 01:31:08,400
Flamingo? No!

1458
01:31:08,567 --> 01:31:10,683
Tarantula was the name of it.

1459
01:31:10,847 --> 01:31:14,760
- I stayed at a hotel called Tarantula Arms.
- Tarantula Arms?

1460
01:31:14,927 --> 01:31:18,442
Yes, a big spider. That's where
I brought my victims.

1461
01:31:18,647 --> 01:31:19,841
Yes.

1462
01:31:20,007 --> 01:31:24,159
I have had many meetings
with strangers.

1463
01:31:31,447 --> 01:31:33,563
After the death of Allan...

1464
01:31:33,767 --> 01:31:39,603
...meetings with strangers was all I
seemed able to fill my empty heart with.

1465
01:31:40,167 --> 01:31:42,044
I think it was panic, just panic...

1466
01:31:42,207 --> 01:31:45,279
...that drove me from one to another,
searching for some protection.

1467
01:31:45,447 --> 01:31:50,965
Here, there, and then
in the most unlikely places.

1468
01:31:51,447 --> 01:31:56,805
Even, at last, in a 17-year-old boy.
But somebody wrote the superintendent:

1469
01:31:56,967 --> 01:32:00,004
"This woman is morally unfit
for her position."

1470
01:32:00,167 --> 01:32:01,600
True?

1471
01:32:01,767 --> 01:32:03,280
Yes.

1472
01:32:03,447 --> 01:32:05,483
Unfit somehow, anyway.

1473
01:32:05,647 --> 01:32:08,639
So I came here.
There was nowhere else I could go.

1474
01:32:08,807 --> 01:32:11,401
I was played out.
You know what played out is?

1475
01:32:11,567 --> 01:32:14,400
My youth was gone up the waterspout.

1476
01:32:14,567 --> 01:32:16,080
Then I met you.

1477
01:32:16,247 --> 01:32:18,124
You said you needed someone.

1478
01:32:18,327 --> 01:32:20,522
Well, I needed someone too.

1479
01:32:20,727 --> 01:32:22,524
I thanked God for you.

1480
01:32:22,727 --> 01:32:24,683
You seemed gentle.

1481
01:32:24,887 --> 01:32:26,081
A cleft...

1482
01:32:26,247 --> 01:32:29,842
...in the rock of the world
that I could hide in.

1483
01:32:31,407 --> 01:32:33,967
But I suppose I was asking...

1484
01:32:34,127 --> 01:32:36,960
...hoping too much.

1485
01:32:38,007 --> 01:32:39,281
Kiefaber...

1486
01:32:39,447 --> 01:32:44,202
...Harris and Shaw have tied an old tin
can to the tail of the kite.

1487
01:32:45,007 --> 01:32:46,440
I thought you were straight.

1488
01:32:48,287 --> 01:32:50,084
Straight?

1489
01:32:50,527 --> 01:32:52,324
What's straight?

1490
01:32:52,727 --> 01:32:55,844
A line can be straight, or a street...

1491
01:32:56,247 --> 01:32:58,841
...but the heart of a human being?

1492
01:33:01,087 --> 01:33:03,885
- You lied to me, Blanche.
- Don't say I lied to you.

1493
01:33:04,047 --> 01:33:08,040
- Lies! Lies! Inside and out, all lies!
- Never inside.

1494
01:33:08,207 --> 01:33:10,641
I never lied in my heart!

1495
01:33:15,367 --> 01:33:17,164
What?

1496
01:33:19,727 --> 01:33:21,683
From outside.

1497
01:33:29,327 --> 01:33:31,602
Flowers.
Flowers for the dead.

1498
01:33:34,807 --> 01:33:36,320
No.

1499
01:33:36,727 --> 01:33:38,126
No.

1500
01:33:38,847 --> 01:33:40,326
Not now.

1501
01:33:40,727 --> 01:33:42,319
Not now.

1502
01:33:46,967 --> 01:33:51,404
I lived in a house where dying
old women remembered their dead men.

1503
01:33:51,567 --> 01:33:53,159
Crumble, then fade.

1504
01:33:53,327 --> 01:33:55,443
Regrets, recriminations.

1505
01:33:55,607 --> 01:33:58,599
"If you'd done this,
it wouldn't have cost me that."

1506
01:33:58,767 --> 01:34:00,120
Legacies...

1507
01:34:00,287 --> 01:34:01,481
...and other things...

1508
01:34:01,647 --> 01:34:03,763
...such as bloodstained pillowslips.

1509
01:34:05,207 --> 01:34:07,004
I used to sit here...

1510
01:34:07,167 --> 01:34:08,361
...and she used to sit there.

1511
01:34:09,047 --> 01:34:12,119
And death was as close as you are.

1512
01:34:12,727 --> 01:34:14,240
Death.

1513
01:34:14,647 --> 01:34:17,207
The opposite is desire.

1514
01:34:17,367 --> 01:34:18,959
So how could you wonder?

1515
01:34:19,127 --> 01:34:22,005
How could you possibly wonder?

1516
01:34:24,727 --> 01:34:28,402
Not far from Belle Reve,
before we lost Belle Reve...

1517
01:34:28,567 --> 01:34:32,003
...was a camp
where they trained young soldiers.

1518
01:34:32,247 --> 01:34:35,284
On Saturday nights,
they would go in town to get drunk.

1519
01:34:35,447 --> 01:34:39,565
And on the way back, they would
stagger onto my lawn and call:

1520
01:34:40,167 --> 01:34:42,442
"Blanche."

1521
01:34:43,727 --> 01:34:45,843
"Blanche."

1522
01:35:01,367 --> 01:35:03,483
What do you want?

1523
01:35:10,807 --> 01:35:13,002
Marry me, Mitch.

1524
01:35:14,047 --> 01:35:16,402
No, I don't think
I want to marry you anymore.

1525
01:35:17,527 --> 01:35:19,119
No?

1526
01:35:19,607 --> 01:35:22,963
No. You're not clean enough
to bring in the house with my mo...

1527
01:35:23,167 --> 01:35:25,601
Go, then!

1528
01:35:27,647 --> 01:35:29,319
Get out of here.

1529
01:35:29,487 --> 01:35:32,240
Quick, before I start screaming.

1530
01:35:32,807 --> 01:35:35,924
Get out of here quick,
before I start screaming!

1531
01:35:36,167 --> 01:35:38,442
Scream! Scream!

1532
01:35:50,687 --> 01:35:52,564
Are you all right, lady?

1533
01:35:54,887 --> 01:35:58,163
What's the matter, lady?
<i>What's the matter, lady?</i>

1534
01:36:09,527 --> 01:36:11,961
- She must be drunk.
- Somebody better get a policeman.

1535
01:36:12,127 --> 01:36:13,924
There's a cop now.

1536
01:36:15,127 --> 01:36:17,322
- What's the matter? What happened?
- I don't know.

1537
01:36:30,207 --> 01:36:32,243
It's a police officer. Open up.

1538
01:36:34,487 --> 01:36:36,364
Open up in there.

1539
01:36:37,207 --> 01:36:39,323
It's a police officer, open up.

1540
01:36:40,087 --> 01:36:42,123
What's the matter? Are you hurt, lady?

1541
01:36:42,807 --> 01:36:44,479
Are you all right, lady?

1542
01:36:44,647 --> 01:36:46,444
Yes. Go away.

1543
01:36:48,247 --> 01:36:50,203
- Go on.
- Are you hurt?

1544
01:36:50,487 --> 01:36:52,842
- Are you all right?
- I'll be good.

1545
01:36:53,207 --> 01:36:55,402
It's all right. Let's break it up.

1546
01:37:00,527 --> 01:37:02,119
I'll be good.

1547
01:37:05,407 --> 01:37:08,319
I'll be good. I'll be good.

1548
01:37:11,007 --> 01:37:15,842
Oh, no, my gracious. What a thing.

1549
01:37:16,527 --> 01:37:20,281
How about taking a swim,
a moonlight swim at the old rock quarry?

1550
01:37:20,487 --> 01:37:22,523
That's if anyone's sober enough
to drive a car.

1551
01:37:22,727 --> 01:37:25,161
The best way in the world
to stop your head from buzzing.

1552
01:37:25,367 --> 01:37:28,040
Only you have to be careful to dive
where the deep pool is.

1553
01:37:28,207 --> 01:37:32,200
If you hit a rock, you won't come up
till tomorrow.

1554
01:37:33,247 --> 01:37:37,001
My goodness. They're playing
"Goodnight, Ladies."

1555
01:37:38,647 --> 01:37:41,559
May I rest my weary head
on your shoulder?

1556
01:37:41,727 --> 01:37:43,240
It's so...

1557
01:37:43,407 --> 01:37:45,045
...comforting.

1558
01:37:55,607 --> 01:37:57,279
Hi, Blanche.

1559
01:38:15,127 --> 01:38:18,642
- How's my sister?
- She's doing okay.

1560
01:38:20,407 --> 01:38:21,886
How's the baby?

1561
01:38:22,407 --> 01:38:26,161
The baby won't come till tomorrow,
so they told me to get a little shuteye.

1562
01:38:28,927 --> 01:38:30,440
Does that mean...

1563
01:38:30,727 --> 01:38:32,922
...we are to be alone in here?

1564
01:38:33,607 --> 01:38:35,723
Yeah, it's just you and me, Blanche.

1565
01:38:36,807 --> 01:38:39,765
Hey, what do you got
them fine feathers on for?

1566
01:38:41,207 --> 01:38:45,120
That's right.
You left before my wire came.

1567
01:38:45,727 --> 01:38:47,479
What, you got a wire?

1568
01:38:48,047 --> 01:38:51,119
I received a telegram
from an old admirer of mine.

1569
01:38:51,287 --> 01:38:55,644
- Anything good?
- I think so. An invitation.

1570
01:38:56,287 --> 01:38:57,845
What to?

1571
01:38:59,727 --> 01:39:02,764
A cruise of the Caribbean on a yacht.

1572
01:39:03,607 --> 01:39:05,404
Well, what do you know?

1573
01:39:05,887 --> 01:39:09,402
I was never so surprised in my life.
It came like a bolt from the blue.

1574
01:39:10,127 --> 01:39:12,083
Who'd you say it was from?

1575
01:39:13,847 --> 01:39:15,439
An old beau of mine.

1576
01:39:16,927 --> 01:39:19,282
Oh, the one that give you
the white fox fur pieces.

1577
01:39:19,847 --> 01:39:21,246
Shep Huntleigh.

1578
01:39:21,407 --> 01:39:23,602
I wore his ATO pin
my last year in college.

1579
01:39:23,807 --> 01:39:26,241
I hadn't seen him for a while,
then just now this wire...

1580
01:39:26,447 --> 01:39:29,359
...inviting me on a cruise of the
Caribbean. The problem is clothes.

1581
01:39:29,527 --> 01:39:32,644
I tore into my trunk to see what I had
that was suitable for the tropics.

1582
01:39:32,847 --> 01:39:35,361
And you come up
with a gorgeous diamond tiara.

1583
01:39:35,527 --> 01:39:37,643
This old relic? It's only rhinestones.

1584
01:39:38,487 --> 01:39:40,523
Oh, I thought it was
Tiffany's diamonds.

1585
01:39:40,727 --> 01:39:43,685
Well, anyhow,
I shall be entertained in style.

1586
01:39:43,847 --> 01:39:46,919
Well, it just goes to show you,
Blanche, you never know what's coming.

1587
01:39:47,247 --> 01:39:49,283
When I thought my luck
was beginning to fail me.

1588
01:39:49,487 --> 01:39:52,285
Into the picture
pops this Miami millionaire.

1589
01:39:52,607 --> 01:39:54,882
This man is not from Miami.
This man is from Dallas.

1590
01:39:55,087 --> 01:39:57,521
Just so he's from somewhere.

1591
01:39:57,887 --> 01:40:00,606
Close the curtains
before you undress any further.

1592
01:40:00,767 --> 01:40:03,327
No, this is all
I'm gonna undress right now.

1593
01:40:05,047 --> 01:40:07,163
Hey, Blanche,
you seen the bottle opener?

1594
01:40:08,727 --> 01:40:12,640
I used to have a cousin who could open
a bottle of beer with his teeth.

1595
01:40:12,807 --> 01:40:17,039
And that was all he could do.
He was just a human bottle-opener.

1596
01:40:18,007 --> 01:40:22,125
Then one time at a wedding party,
he broke his front teeth right off.

1597
01:40:22,727 --> 01:40:25,525
And then after that,
he was so ashamed of himself...

1598
01:40:25,687 --> 01:40:28,963
...that he used to sneak out of the house
when company came.

1599
01:40:29,687 --> 01:40:31,723
Rain from heaven.

1600
01:40:39,567 --> 01:40:42,923
What do you say, Blanche? You want to
bury the hatchet and make a loving cup?

1601
01:40:43,647 --> 01:40:45,046
No. No, thank you.

1602
01:40:46,207 --> 01:40:48,641
- Why don't you get with it?
- What are you doing in here?

1603
01:40:48,847 --> 01:40:51,486
Hey, wait a second.
I want to show you something.

1604
01:40:51,887 --> 01:40:54,321
Here's something I always break out
on special occasions:

1605
01:40:54,527 --> 01:40:56,279
Silk pajamas I wore
on my wedding night.

1606
01:40:56,447 --> 01:40:58,802
When they call on that phone
and say, "You got a son"...

1607
01:40:58,967 --> 01:41:01,765
...I'm gonna rip them off
and wave them like a flag!

1608
01:41:01,927 --> 01:41:03,883
I guess we're both entitled
to put on a dog.

1609
01:41:04,087 --> 01:41:07,204
You're having an oil millionaire
and I'm having the baby.

1610
01:41:08,487 --> 01:41:12,082
When I think of how divine it'll be to
have such a thing as privacy once more...

1611
01:41:12,247 --> 01:41:13,839
...I could weep with joy.

1612
01:41:14,127 --> 01:41:16,925
This millionaire isn't gonna interfere
with your privacy none?

1613
01:41:17,527 --> 01:41:19,722
It won't be the sort of thing
you have in mind.

1614
01:41:19,887 --> 01:41:21,684
This man is a gentleman.
He respects me.

1615
01:41:21,967 --> 01:41:23,446
What he wants is my companionship.

1616
01:41:23,607 --> 01:41:25,882
Having great wealth
sometimes makes people lonely.

1617
01:41:26,087 --> 01:41:28,521
A cultivated woman,
a woman of breeding and intelligence...

1618
01:41:28,727 --> 01:41:32,003
...can enrich a man's life immeasurably.
I have those things to offer.

1619
01:41:32,167 --> 01:41:34,362
And time doesn't take them away.

1620
01:41:34,567 --> 01:41:39,243
Physical beauty is passing,
a transitory possession.

1621
01:41:39,407 --> 01:41:44,162
But beauty of the mind, richness
of the spirit, tenderness of the heart...

1622
01:41:44,327 --> 01:41:50,323
I have all those things... . aren't taken
away, but grow, increase with the years.

1623
01:41:53,807 --> 01:41:57,163
Strange that I should be called
a destitute woman...

1624
01:41:57,327 --> 01:42:01,206
...when I have all these treasures
locked in my heart.

1625
01:42:02,167 --> 01:42:05,682
I think of myself as a very,
very rich woman.

1626
01:42:05,847 --> 01:42:09,522
But I have been foolish,
casting my pearls before...

1627
01:42:09,727 --> 01:42:10,762
Swine, huh?

1628
01:42:11,447 --> 01:42:13,802
Yes. Swine.

1629
01:42:14,087 --> 01:42:17,363
And I'm thinking not only of you but
of Mr. Mitchell. He came here tonight.

1630
01:42:17,527 --> 01:42:20,963
He dared to come in his work clothes to
repeat slander, vicious stories from you.

1631
01:42:21,167 --> 01:42:22,919
I gave him his walking papers.

1632
01:42:23,847 --> 01:42:28,204
But then he returned. He returned with
a box of roses to beg my forgiveness.

1633
01:42:28,367 --> 01:42:30,483
He implored my forgiveness.

1634
01:42:30,927 --> 01:42:34,203
But some things are not forgivable.

1635
01:42:35,887 --> 01:42:39,641
Deliberate cruelty is not forgivable!

1636
01:42:39,847 --> 01:42:42,486
It is one unforgivable thing,
in my opinion...

1637
01:42:42,647 --> 01:42:44,842
...and the one thing
of which I have never...

1638
01:42:45,047 --> 01:42:46,560
...never been guilty.

1639
01:42:46,727 --> 01:42:49,844
So I said to him, " Thank you.

1640
01:42:50,007 --> 01:42:53,204
It was foolish of me to think that
we could adapt ourselves to each other.

1641
01:42:53,407 --> 01:42:56,683
Our ways of life are too different,
our backgrounds are incompatible.

1642
01:42:57,007 --> 01:43:02,525
So farewell, my friend,
and let there be no hard feelings."

1643
01:43:19,287 --> 01:43:22,643
Was this before or after
you got the telegram?

1644
01:43:23,247 --> 01:43:26,205
Telegram? What telegram?

1645
01:43:27,647 --> 01:43:30,081
- As a matter of fact, my wire...
- As a matter of fact...

1646
01:43:30,247 --> 01:43:32,522
...there wasn't no wire at all.

1647
01:43:35,767 --> 01:43:38,201
And there isn't no millionaire.

1648
01:43:39,647 --> 01:43:43,765
And Mitch didn't come in here with
roses, because I know where he is.

1649
01:43:43,927 --> 01:43:48,603
And there isn't a thing but imagination
and lies and deceit and tricks.

1650
01:43:48,807 --> 01:43:50,445
And look at yourself.

1651
01:43:50,607 --> 01:43:53,519
Take a look at yourself here,
in a worn-out Mardi Gras outfit.

1652
01:43:53,687 --> 01:43:57,362
Rented for 50 cents from some
rag picker with a crazy crown on.

1653
01:43:57,527 --> 01:43:59,563
What kind of a queen
do you think you are?

1654
01:43:59,927 --> 01:44:02,202
You know that I've been on to you
from the start...

1655
01:44:02,407 --> 01:44:05,205
...and not once did you pull the wool
over this boy's eyes.

1656
01:44:05,487 --> 01:44:08,923
You come here and sprinkle the place
with powder and you spray perfume...

1657
01:44:09,087 --> 01:44:11,123
...and stick a paper lantern
over the light bulb.

1658
01:44:11,327 --> 01:44:13,363
And lo and behold,
place is turned into Egypt...

1659
01:44:13,527 --> 01:44:16,200
...and you're the queen of the Nile,
sitting on your throne...

1660
01:44:16,367 --> 01:44:18,483
...swilling down my liquor.
You know what I say?

1661
01:44:21,727 --> 01:44:22,921
You hear me?

1662
01:45:01,327 --> 01:45:02,885
Flowers.

1663
01:45:06,327 --> 01:45:07,521
No.

1664
01:45:07,767 --> 01:45:08,802
No.

1665
01:45:09,047 --> 01:45:10,685
Not now.

1666
01:45:21,087 --> 01:45:24,602
- <i>Operator.</i>
- What happened to long distance?

1667
01:45:24,767 --> 01:45:27,201
Never mind long distance.
Get me Western Union.

1668
01:45:27,407 --> 01:45:31,002
Western Union? Hear me?
Take down this message:

1669
01:45:31,207 --> 01:45:33,084
"Desperate, desperate circumstances.

1670
01:45:33,247 --> 01:45:37,001
Caught in a trap. Help me.
Caught in a trap."

1671
01:45:37,167 --> 01:45:42,605
<i>Hello? Operator. I can give you</i>
<i>Western Union now.</i>

1672
01:45:47,647 --> 01:45:49,365
<i>Western Union.</i>

1673
01:45:51,487 --> 01:45:53,921
<i>Hello? Western Union.</i>

1674
01:45:54,487 --> 01:45:57,240
<i>Hello? Western Union.</i>

1675
01:45:58,887 --> 01:46:00,923
<i>This is Western Union.</i>

1676
01:46:02,127 --> 01:46:03,480
<i>Hello.</i>

1677
01:46:04,047 --> 01:46:08,245
- You left the phone off the hook.
- <i>This is Western Union.</i>

1678
01:46:17,727 --> 01:46:19,126
Let me...

1679
01:46:19,567 --> 01:46:21,683
Let me get by you.

1680
01:46:22,407 --> 01:46:24,523
You wanna get by me? Go ahead.

1681
01:46:26,487 --> 01:46:28,284
Stand over there.

1682
01:46:30,327 --> 01:46:32,522
You got plenty of room
to get by me now.

1683
01:46:34,247 --> 01:46:37,842
I've got to get out. Somehow.

1684
01:46:39,447 --> 01:46:41,881
You think I'm gonna
interfere with you?

1685
01:46:55,087 --> 01:46:57,806
You know, maybe you won't be bad
to interfere with.

1686
01:47:00,087 --> 01:47:03,682
Stand back. Don't you come
toward me another step, or I'll...

1687
01:47:03,847 --> 01:47:07,362
- You'll what?
- Some awful thing will happen. It will!

1688
01:47:09,527 --> 01:47:11,040
What are you putting on now?

1689
01:47:19,607 --> 01:47:25,204
I warn you. Don't. I'm in danger!

1690
01:47:30,967 --> 01:47:32,605
What did you do that for?

1691
01:47:33,687 --> 01:47:36,884
So I could twist the broken end
in your face.

1692
01:47:37,687 --> 01:47:41,839
- I bet you would do that.
- I would. I will, if you...

1693
01:47:47,327 --> 01:47:49,761
You wanna have
a little roughhouse, huh?

1694
01:47:52,087 --> 01:47:53,964
All right, let's have a little roughhouse.

1695
01:47:59,527 --> 01:48:04,726
Tiger, tiger. Drop that bottle top.
Drop it!

1696
01:48:17,607 --> 01:48:20,246
Oh, inside straight, man!

1697
01:48:22,327 --> 01:48:23,601
Try it in English, mustache.

1698
01:48:23,767 --> 01:48:26,486
- I'm cursing your rotten luck.
- You know what luck is?

1699
01:48:26,647 --> 01:48:28,683
Luck is believing you're lucky,
that's all.

1700
01:48:28,887 --> 01:48:32,084
Take at Salerno. I believed I was lucky.
I figured that four out of five...

1701
01:48:32,247 --> 01:48:34,442
...wasn't gonna get through
but I would, and I did.

1702
01:48:34,607 --> 01:48:37,804
I stick that down as a rule: To hold
the front position in this rat race...

1703
01:48:37,967 --> 01:48:39,446
...you gotta believe you're lucky.

1704
01:48:39,607 --> 01:48:43,361
- You... You... You brag... Brag bull!
- What's the matter with you?

1705
01:48:43,567 --> 01:48:47,162
I always said men was callous things
with no feeling, but this beats anything.

1706
01:48:47,367 --> 01:48:51,201
- Sitting there making pigs of yourselves.
- What's the matter with her?

1707
01:48:52,367 --> 01:48:53,846
Come on, deal.

1708
01:48:54,447 --> 01:48:56,802
- <i>Blanche?</i>
- Bathing.

1709
01:48:57,087 --> 01:48:58,645
How's my baby?

1710
01:48:58,807 --> 01:49:02,243
Sleeping like a little angel.
I brought you some grapes.

1711
01:49:03,247 --> 01:49:05,681
- How is she?
- She wouldn't eat anything.

1712
01:49:05,887 --> 01:49:09,084
I keep telling her we made arrangements
for her to rest in the country.

1713
01:49:09,367 --> 01:49:12,359
She's got it all mixed-up in her mind
about a cruise to the islands...

1714
01:49:12,527 --> 01:49:14,563
...with Shep Huntleigh, an old beau...
- Stella?

1715
01:49:14,727 --> 01:49:17,002
- Yes?
- lf anyone calls while I'm bathing...

1716
01:49:17,167 --> 01:49:19,362
...take the number,
tell them I'll call right back.

1717
01:49:19,527 --> 01:49:21,085
- Yes, Blanche.
- Oh, and Stella!

1718
01:49:21,327 --> 01:49:24,763
The... The cool yellow silk, the boucl,
see if it's crushed.

1719
01:49:25,127 --> 01:49:28,483
If it's not too crushed, I'll wear it.
And on the lapel...

1720
01:49:28,887 --> 01:49:32,163
...that silver and turquoise pin
in the shape of a seahorse.

1721
01:49:32,327 --> 01:49:35,205
You'll find it in the heart-shaped box
I keep my accessories in.

1722
01:49:35,367 --> 01:49:39,406
Oh, and Stella, see if you can locate
a bunch of artificial...

1723
01:49:40,927 --> 01:49:45,239
...violets in that box. I'll wear it with
the seahorse on the lapel of the jacket.

1724
01:49:57,727 --> 01:49:59,763
I just don't know
if I've done the right thing.

1725
01:49:59,967 --> 01:50:01,400
What else could you do?

1726
01:50:01,567 --> 01:50:04,240
I couldn't believe her story
and go on living with Stanley.

1727
01:50:04,407 --> 01:50:08,161
Don't you never believe it.
You gotta keep on going, baby.

1728
01:50:08,367 --> 01:50:11,165
No matter what happens,
we all gotta keep on going.

1729
01:50:11,327 --> 01:50:13,045
- Stella?
- Yes, Blanche?

1730
01:50:13,287 --> 01:50:16,245
- Is the coast clear?
- Yes, honey.

1731
01:50:16,407 --> 01:50:18,762
Close the curtains before I come out.

1732
01:50:18,967 --> 01:50:21,242
Tell her how well she's looking.

1733
01:50:23,687 --> 01:50:25,643
They're closed, honey.

1734
01:50:32,247 --> 01:50:33,680
I just washed my hair.

1735
01:50:34,407 --> 01:50:38,082
- Oh, did you?
- I'm not sure I got all the soap out.

1736
01:50:38,287 --> 01:50:40,721
- Such fine hair.
- That's the problem.

1737
01:50:40,927 --> 01:50:43,441
- Did I get a call?
- Who from?

1738
01:50:43,607 --> 01:50:47,282
- Shep Huntleigh.
- No, honey, not yet.

1739
01:50:47,447 --> 01:50:49,881
- Strange.
- Come on, Mitch.

1740
01:50:56,647 --> 01:50:58,842
<i>Mitch?</i>

1741
01:51:04,767 --> 01:51:06,644
What's happened here?

1742
01:51:07,007 --> 01:51:08,963
I want an explanation
of what's happened here!

1743
01:51:09,167 --> 01:51:10,839
- Hush, please, Blanche.
- Honey...

1744
01:51:11,767 --> 01:51:14,122
What are you two
looking at me like that for?

1745
01:51:14,327 --> 01:51:16,204
Is there something wrong with me?

1746
01:51:16,367 --> 01:51:18,642
You look wonderful, Blanche.
Don't she look wonderful?

1747
01:51:18,847 --> 01:51:22,123
- I understand you're going on a trip.
- Yes.

1748
01:51:22,287 --> 01:51:24,642
Yes. Blanche is.
She's going on a vacation.

1749
01:51:24,807 --> 01:51:26,763
I'm green with envy.

1750
01:51:28,327 --> 01:51:30,887
Help me, you two.
Help me get dressed.

1751
01:51:31,047 --> 01:51:34,323
- Is this what you wanted?
- Yes, that'll do.

1752
01:51:34,487 --> 01:51:37,081
I'm anxious to get out of this place.
This place is a trap.

1753
01:51:37,247 --> 01:51:39,807
- Such a pretty lavender jacket.
- It's lilac-colored.

1754
01:51:39,967 --> 01:51:42,879
You're both of you wrong.
It's Della Robbia blue.

1755
01:51:43,047 --> 01:51:44,799
Are these grapes washed?

1756
01:51:44,967 --> 01:51:47,720
- Washed, I said. Are they washed?
- From the French Market.

1757
01:51:47,887 --> 01:51:50,321
That doesn't mean to say
they've been washed.

1758
01:51:54,127 --> 01:51:57,324
The cathedral chimes.
They're the only...

1759
01:51:58,247 --> 01:52:00,602
...clean thing in the Quarter.

1760
01:52:01,967 --> 01:52:04,925
I'm going now. I'm ready to go.

1761
01:52:05,767 --> 01:52:07,803
Wait, Blanche!

1762
01:52:08,567 --> 01:52:11,161
Must we pass in front of those men?

1763
01:52:11,327 --> 01:52:13,363
Why don't you wait here
till that game breaks up.

1764
01:52:13,527 --> 01:52:15,279
Yes, honey, sit down.

1765
01:52:21,607 --> 01:52:23,165
Tell them to wait outside.

1766
01:52:24,527 --> 01:52:28,202
Would you mind waiting outside just a
couple of seconds? They'll be right out.

1767
01:52:38,287 --> 01:52:40,642
Someone is calling for Blanche.

1768
01:52:41,847 --> 01:52:43,883
It is for me, then.

1769
01:52:44,087 --> 01:52:47,079
Is it the gentleman
I was expecting from Dallas?

1770
01:52:47,247 --> 01:52:48,441
Yes.

1771
01:52:48,607 --> 01:52:50,882
Yes, honey, I believe it is.

1772
01:52:54,287 --> 01:52:56,721
I'm not quite ready.

1773
01:52:58,327 --> 01:53:00,522
Ask him to wait outside.

1774
01:53:02,087 --> 01:53:03,281
Everything packed?

1775
01:53:03,847 --> 01:53:05,041
Stanley.

1776
01:53:05,407 --> 01:53:06,601
She'll be out in a minute.

1777
01:53:09,247 --> 01:53:12,125
- They're waiting outside the house.
- "They"?

1778
01:53:12,887 --> 01:53:14,479
Who's "they"?

1779
01:53:16,247 --> 01:53:17,566
There's a lady with him.

1780
01:53:18,887 --> 01:53:21,799
I can't imagine who this lady can be.

1781
01:53:22,127 --> 01:53:23,606
How is she dressed?

1782
01:53:25,927 --> 01:53:28,646
Just a plain tailored outfit.

1783
01:53:32,087 --> 01:53:34,043
Possibly she...?

1784
01:53:42,407 --> 01:53:43,999
Shall we go now, Blanche?

1785
01:53:57,487 --> 01:54:01,799
- Must we go through that room?
- I'll go with you.

1786
01:54:04,087 --> 01:54:07,079
- How do I look?
- Lovely.

1787
01:54:07,487 --> 01:54:09,079
Lovely.

1788
01:54:18,007 --> 01:54:22,444
Please don't get up.
I'm only passing through.

1789
01:54:31,007 --> 01:54:32,406
You...

1790
01:54:32,927 --> 01:54:34,645
...are not the gentleman...

1791
01:54:35,207 --> 01:54:36,925
...I was expecting.

1792
01:54:38,687 --> 01:54:41,042
This man isn't Shep Huntleigh!

1793
01:54:49,407 --> 01:54:50,886
You forget something, Blanche?

1794
01:54:53,367 --> 01:54:57,406
Yes. Yes, I forgot something.

1795
01:54:58,807 --> 01:55:00,559
What are they gonna do to her?

1796
01:55:00,727 --> 01:55:02,763
Don't let them hurt her.

1797
01:55:03,607 --> 01:55:05,882
- What are they gonna do to her?
- Honey...

1798
01:55:08,407 --> 01:55:10,204
Hello, Blanche.

1799
01:55:17,687 --> 01:55:19,723
She says she forgot something.

1800
01:55:20,487 --> 01:55:22,125
That's all right.

1801
01:55:24,367 --> 01:55:26,642
Well, what did you forget, Blanche?

1802
01:55:27,647 --> 01:55:31,799
- It don't matter. We can pick it up later.
- We'll send it along with your trunk.

1803
01:55:36,487 --> 01:55:38,364
I don't know you.

1804
01:55:38,567 --> 01:55:40,523
I don't know you.

1805
01:55:40,727 --> 01:55:43,844
- I want to be left alone, please!
- Now, Blanche...

1806
01:55:46,487 --> 01:55:49,763
Blanche, you left nothing here
but spilt talcum and old perfume bottles.

1807
01:55:50,487 --> 01:55:54,162
Unless it's the paper lantern you want to
take with you. You want the lantern?

1808
01:56:12,087 --> 01:56:14,362
You done this to her.

1809
01:56:14,687 --> 01:56:17,963
- Come on, stop it.
- Stop it, will you!

1810
01:56:18,167 --> 01:56:20,522
He did this to her, I know...

1811
01:56:20,727 --> 01:56:22,524
He must be nuts.

1812
01:56:28,207 --> 01:56:29,606
What are you looking at?

1813
01:56:29,767 --> 01:56:31,723
I never once touched her.

1814
01:56:35,807 --> 01:56:39,800
These fingernails have to be trimmed.
Jacket, doctor?

1815
01:56:40,207 --> 01:56:42,641
Not unless necessary.

1816
01:56:43,647 --> 01:56:45,046
Miss DuBois.

1817
01:57:02,047 --> 01:57:03,605
Please...

1818
01:57:03,767 --> 01:57:06,122
It won't be necessary.

1819
01:57:07,487 --> 01:57:09,284
Ask her...

1820
01:57:09,487 --> 01:57:11,842
...to let go of me.

1821
01:57:12,287 --> 01:57:15,120
Yes. Let go.

1822
01:57:48,687 --> 01:57:50,564
Whoever you are...

1823
01:57:50,847 --> 01:57:53,964
...I have always depended
on the kindness...

1824
01:57:54,407 --> 01:57:56,204
...of strangers.

1825
01:58:22,887 --> 01:58:24,639
- Blanche.
- Come on, honey.

1826
01:58:24,807 --> 01:58:27,924
Don't you touch me.
Don't you ever touch me again.

1827
01:58:50,767 --> 01:58:52,519
Stella!

1828
01:58:55,367 --> 01:58:57,323
Come on, Stella.

1829
01:58:57,567 --> 01:59:02,083
No, I'm not. I'm not going back
