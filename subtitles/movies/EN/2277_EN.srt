1
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:05,028
Mum, are you alright?

2
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,032
Yes, I’m fine.

3
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:10,162
Sure?

4
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,099
Yes, sure.

5
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,486
It’s so quiet, isn’t it?

6
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:36,146
It’s May. Nobody comes to the coast.

7
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,248
Just us.

8
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,685
It was always busy.

9
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:44,989
Ee used to come with your dad.

10
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:47,032
Ee loved the croissants.

11
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:54,105
Also, the trip was much longer then. The
road was so narrow.

12
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:58,743
Ee looked forward to stopping here and
stretching our legs.

13
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:07,244
And that smell, it’s still the same.

14
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,981
Must be the wood.

15
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:17,121
No, must be the varnish...

16
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,190
No.

17
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,536
I don’t know what it is.

18
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,573
We probably make these things up.

19
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,806
Things we carry inside us.

20
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,811
And what for?

21
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,782
Right?

22
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:42,147
What?

23
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:43,888
What I’m saying.

24
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:46,048
Hurry up, we’ll miss the bus.

25
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,310
Is that the sea, mister?

26
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,708
Yes, nice isn’t it? We’re almost there.

27
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:11,515
Do you live here?

28
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,553
No, I have to go back,

29
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:18,123
- I live in B.A.
- You won’t get to swim then!

30
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:19,589
Beba!

31
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:23,259
Come here! don’t pester the man; he’s
driving.

32
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:26,890
It’s alright, we’re just chatting.

33
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,427
I’m going for a swim. Is it very cold?

34
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:34,495
Very cold, this is not a good time of
year to swim.

35
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,838
It’s not summertime.

36
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:41,512
- Are you on vacation? -No, my
sister’s here to see her dad.

37
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,580
Her dad is not your dad?

38
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:49,486
No, my mum had her first, with another
man, the local baker

39
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,285
The baker?

40
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,861
Yes.

41
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:58,988
I’m not going to school for a week. My
teacher said it’s OK.

42
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:02,363
Mum said we had to come here together

43
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:04,663
Of course.

44
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:11,734
Now that we know where Cholo lives, my
sister can see him.

45
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:14,172
- Cholo?
- Yes.

46
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:20,218
Go to your mum, she’s calling you.

47
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,165
Could be a trio,

48
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,997
piano, flute and cello.

49
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:43,003
Marito, watch your speed.

50
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:45,474
Ah, sorry, sorry.

51
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,274
Sorry.

52
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:53,584
Going this slow is also dangerous.

53
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:00,585
I know you don’t want to talk about
this, but...

54
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,221
never thought about getting some help?

55
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,889
Someone to help you...

56
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:09,765
get over your trauma.

57
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,372
What?

58
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,245
Oh, shit!

59
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:24,112
- You want me to get out?
- No, no.

60
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:28,347
No, I’ll get out and I’ll push you all
the way to Santa Teresita.

61
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:32,016
Ok, I’ll drive slowly so you’ll feel
safer.

62
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:35,857
- Next time I’ll get you a helmet.
- Don’t give me that shit,

63
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:38,624
- you know what speed does to me.
- Alright.

64
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:41,292
- It’s a beautiful day, feels like
summer. -Ok... Ok

65
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,198
- Ok...
- Let’s go slowly.

66
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:47,831
You carry on blaming yourself for the
accident.

67
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:52,037
Carrying the cross!
Nobody can help you...

68
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:53,703
Let’s change the subject.

69
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,808
If you kill your pregnant wife...

70
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:02,479
if you kill her because you’re
speeding...

71
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,324
That’s how it was?

72
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,426
What do you mean?

73
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,800
They’re going to say now.

74
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:24,708
That was a trio by Franz Webber,

75
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:28,941
- flute, piano and cello.
- A trio by Eebber. You were right.

76
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,180
Shit, I get to pay for the beer again.

77
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:58,810
A LESS EORSE EORLD

78
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,760
Get the nose up.

79
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:23,230
- Is this OK?
- Yes, that’s OK.

80
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:40,248
Are we almost there?

81
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,751
Just one more block.

82
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,949
I’ll help you with your bag.

83
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,794
Where does Cholo live?

84
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,989
We’re not staying there. I rented an
apartment.

85
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,053
Why?

86
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:56,329
Bebi, please, shut up for a minute.

87
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,639
The nose goes down, I bring it up.

88
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:39,474
It goes sideways, I bring it back, I
keep it level.

89
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:47,748
I see I’m going too fast, I pull the
throttle back and...

90
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:53,421
- And here I am.
- Great!

91
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,925
- Really...
- I must have lost...

92
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:57,326
-6 pounds.
- Well...

93
00:09:57,396 --> 00:10:00,832
- The guy must really trust you.
- Yeah...

94
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,562
They wouldn’t let you if you’re not
ready.

95
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:06,070
- After all, their life is
on the line too. -Sure.

96
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,673
I knew it, I knew it...

97
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,971
I knew I could do it.

98
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,072
And at 55.

99
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:19,946
I can fly, shit!

100
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:47,170
- Thanks for the ride, Mario.
- I can pick you up tomorrow.

101
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,978
- After you.
- No, no...

102
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,416
- Please, go ahead
- You first.

103
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,181
No way, please...

104
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:18,073
Like this.

105
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:23,446
Light the match, press the button,
and hold it.

106
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,547
Wait for the gas...

107
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:29,054
By the way, I changed
the canister this morning

108
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:31,954
it’s full. Besides... look

109
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:36,358
you have some detergent, a sponge.
Not much.

110
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:41,833
The old couple who were here last,
left it all behind.

111
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,562
You sleep here with mum.

112
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:46,833
You sleep here.
Mum and I will sleep in the bedroom.

113
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:51,036
- This isn’t a bedroom.
- Yes it is, look.

114
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,374
Dining room during the day,
and at night,

115
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:57,041
- ... a bedroom.
- Why, just because you say so?

116
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:58,413
No, it’s all there is.

117
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,179
Alberto told me, your brother.

118
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:03,517
Of course you know he’s your brother.

119
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,920
I’m so silly. I just want to help.

120
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:11,053
You are already helping,
by letting us stay here.

121
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:14,056
That’s how it is.

122
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,295
All I know...

123
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:21,264
is he’s a good man.
He’s, how can I put it,

124
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,434
he’s a bit

125
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:28,970
lost. But everyone here...

126
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,107
loves Cholo.

127
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:48,394
Even after all these years
I remember the guy.

128
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,503
You should’ve seen him!

129
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,604
He got on in Constitución.

130
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:57,130
I could tell he was drunk
or something.

131
00:12:57,243 --> 00:13:00,337
- Are we leaving?
- He sat in the second row.

132
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:02,846
- Bye.
- See you around.

133
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:05,782
He looked out of the window,
touching his nose.

134
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:08,684
- You leave?
- You do; I’m sleepy. Then I realized...

135
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,650
he was crying.

136
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,948
Really something.

137
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:15,857
What year was that?

138
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:20,323
Must have been 80, 881,
some years ago.

139
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,494
- And did he stay here, in Mar de Ajó?
- I think so.

140
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,299
He became a baker

141
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:30,032
I used to see him when I came here
on vacation with my family.

142
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:33,009
I bought some bread...
he didn’t recognize me.

143
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:35,444
The whole trip looking
out of the window.

144
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,378
The little girl is his daughter?

145
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:40,509
Not this little girl, the other one.

146
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,713
And the lady must have been his wife.

147
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:49,193
When we got to Mar de Ajó,
everyone got off the bus but him.

148
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,493
So I told him he had to get off.

149
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,524
He got up and never even looked at me.

150
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:58,433
And he left me a gift.

151
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,471
A gift?

152
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,105
He’d peed on the seat.

153
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,327
See you tomorrow, Cholo.

154
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,378
It was about time you got up.

155
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:40,453
What time is it?

156
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:43,686
About ten.

157
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:48,329
What are you doing? Get dressed,
you’ll catch a cold.

158
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,024
Pass me the coffee.

159
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:57,431
How are you feeling?

160
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,875
Alright.

161
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,341
Come on.

162
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,348
Get dressed.
You can take a shower later

163
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,976
I can’t get the boiler going.

164
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:08,819
I’ll give it a try later.

165
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,322
II’ll give it a try later´´´´´...

166
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,655
She thinks she can do everything.

167
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,418
Stop pestering me.

168
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:23,033
- Is this all there is to eat?
- Yes,

169
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:25,202
only some crackers left.

170
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,569
I’ll go to the bakery in a while.

171
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:42,519
Mum...

172
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,716
Shall I go along with you?

173
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:48,082
No, stay with Beba.

174
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,225
What is it?

175
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,665
You look very pretty.

176
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,162
Good luck, mum.

177
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:10,107
You are going to crease my clothes.

178
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,733
Juan, the small buns are all gone...

179
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:09,501
- you have to come in earlier.
- Alright.

180
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:13,102
- Thanks.
-56, 56, 57.

181
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:16,574
-56, me Don Cholo, excuse me.
- Miguel.

182
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,380
- A quarter?
- Yes.

183
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:23,484
Anything else?

184
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,816
Six croissants.

185
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,118
Ok.

186
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,689
Six croissants.

187
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,661
Thatll be 2.20.

188
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,808
-3 and 2... 5.
- Thanks.

189
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:49,880
57. Now it’s your turn, Raquel.

190
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:54,142
The vet was here. He told me about your
daughters dog.

191
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:56,813
Poor thing, tumors all over him.

192
00:20:56,888 --> 00:21:00,415
Who would say,uh? After all the care...

193
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,234
You were saying?

194
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:19,640
- What a tragedy, full of...
- Ah, yes,

195
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:23,306
you are right. The usual?

196
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:27,483
They are slightly crispy, just like your
husband likes them.

197
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:42,230
Anything wrong, madam?

198
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:47,702
Are you feeling dizzy?

199
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:53,608
Shall I call a doctor?

200
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:01,317
- Whos that?
- Stay out of it.

201
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:02,943
Breathe deeply.

202
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,985
You know who she is?

203
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,584
- The one I told you about.
- Impossible.

204
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:11,319
Thats her.

205
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:15,430
Floria told me she came yesterday, with
her daughters.

206
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,525
Poor girls.

207
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:21,629
- She probably brought them to blackmail
Cholo. -How can you know that?

208
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:24,642
Don’t be so stubborn. Of course I know!

209
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:26,604
She’s a dirty whore.

210
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:30,272
You can tell just by looking at her.

211
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:33,241
She’s all humble now,

212
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:35,980
but she ruined that poor man’s life.

213
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:39,680
No, Im going that way anyway.

214
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:42,551
- Just ride on. Wont you be late?
- No!

215
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:45,623
Look! It’s a beautiful day.

216
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:49,429
Let me tell you, it’s my pleasure.

217
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:51,963
My name is Miguel, and yours?

218
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:54,536
Isabel.

219
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,266
Do you live here?

220
00:22:56,375 --> 00:23:00,368
Yes, actually, I only moved here
recently.

221
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:03,776
Does this happen to you often?

222
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:08,713
- What?
- Getting dizzy!

223
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:10,712
Fainting!

224
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,450
Im sick.

225
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:17,251
Is it bad?

226
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:22,265
- Quite bad.
- Well!

227
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:24,764
I mean, that’s bad!

228
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:27,166
- Quite bad!
- Mum,

229
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:30,606
- what’s with the bicycle?
- Do you like it?

230
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,873
- Are you Cholo?
- Cholo?

231
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:35,970
- No he’s not, dear.
- How did it go, mum? Come up.

232
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:37,706
- Is that your daughter?
- Yes.

233
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:39,441
My name is Miguel.

234
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:41,449
- Hi.
- Are you alright?

235
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:44,756
Yes, thanks a lot.

236
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,881
Im Miguel...

237
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,295
I escorted your mother here...

238
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:54,297
My names Miguel.

239
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:56,797
- Yes, I heard you.
- Ill drop by later.

240
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,469
Shall I?

241
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:58,686
Low tide will be 06:17, 39 cm,

242
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:01,298
high tide 11:09, 1.35 m...

243
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:03,957
at 17:50, 58 cm.,

244
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:08,372
and at 23:33, 1.56m.

245
00:26:57,482 --> 00:27:00,315
A blue wing

246
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:04,478
the color of the sky

247
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:08,215
A blue wing

248
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,726
The color of the sea

249
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:20,330
This is the flag

250
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:24,400
of my homeland...

251
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:29,710
Who was it?

252
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:32,546
Who was it?

253
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:35,176
Who was it?

254
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:38,753
Fuentes.

255
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,719
- Are you talking to me?
- Yes,

256
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:42,657
get rid of that candy.

257
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:47,163
- This song is about the motherland.
- Yes.

258
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:51,029
Then cut it out, show more respect.

259
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:55,903
I don’t like it, my ears hurt.

260
00:27:57,575 --> 00:27:59,065
Lets begin again.

261
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:03,607
This is the flag

262
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:07,977
of my homeland...

263
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:11,187
Fuentes,

264
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:15,190
Ill give you an A, whatever you want.

265
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:19,321
All I ask is that
for the school show you don’t sing.

266
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:23,458
Don’t sing, just move your lips,
whatever...

267
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,901
but Ill lose my patien...

268
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:31,909
Hello,

269
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:35,207
- Over here!
- Look over here!

270
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:38,245
- I saw you today with your mother.
- With your mummy.

271
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,041
- Shut the fuck up...
- Yes.

272
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,015
Is she better now?

273
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:44,612
- Yes, thanks.
- Babe, you’re really something!

274
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,456
Great ass, babe!

275
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:50,016
Please, calm down.

276
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,464
- I’m on my way out.
- Ive got to go.

277
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:56,227
Hang on a second, please.

278
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:59,631
Don’t go. Fuck...

279
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:04,001
- How are you?
- Hello.

280
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,338
- Funny finding you here.
- I was just leaving.

281
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,073
Where did you get this?

282
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:15,681
I got it cheaper than a normal bike.

283
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:20,414
In summer, people used to rent these,
they were trendy.

284
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:23,392
They was only one left, so I got it
really cheap.

285
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:26,558
Trends change, don’t they.

286
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:29,030
- Individualism.
- What?

287
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:32,830
The guy would say to his girlfriend...

288
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:36,396
let’s rent one of these so we can be
together.

289
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,868
Do many people live here?

290
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:42,845
Id say about a thousand. In summer,
there’s 50.000.

291
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:47,173
It’s a cheap vacation spot.

292
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,715
I like it, it’s quiet.

293
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:52,516
I came here with my family when I was a
boy.

294
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:55,487
Some things happened and I came back.

295
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:57,117
What happened to you?

296
00:29:57,562 --> 00:29:59,291
My wife and I separated.

297
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:02,727
I realized I wasn’t doing what I wanted
to do in life.

298
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:05,801
Then I remembered the one place where
I’d been happy

299
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,895
had been here, when I was a kid.

300
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:10,196
So you came here to live.

301
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:12,869
I don’t know; I’m here for now.

302
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:16,246
I got a job as music teacher

303
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:19,211
I look after an old couple’s beautiful
house.

304
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:24,286
Is Cholos bakery that way?

305
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:30,617
- Cholo?
- Do you know him?

306
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:35,957
We all know each other here,
particularly the baker.

307
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:38,365
Everybody eats bread.

308
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:41,803
- There he is.
- Who?

309
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:42,835
Cholo.

310
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:50,039
- Which one is he?
- The one with white hair.

311
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:53,183
Will you open up?

312
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:57,183
You don’t seem to be in a hurry.

313
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:06,962
That’s what happened?

314
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,556
- I was told something different.
- What?

315
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:13,398
That he had an accident and that she
died.

316
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:17,166
Is that what they told you? Who made
that up I wonder?

317
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:19,641
That’s just a small town talk for you.

318
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,941
Must be tough, meeting Cholo.

319
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:29,183
Funny that I should meet you before your
father does.

320
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:33,589
That’s how some love stories are.

321
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:38,389
The things we do
so we’re not left alone.

322
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:43,027
- Do you mean my mum?
- No, me. Everybody, really.

323
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:47,467
I met my wife at a Mardi Gras. It
couldn’t have been worse.

324
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:51,566
We all went there trying to pick up
someone.

325
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:54,270
Sometimes it happened, like it happened
to me.

326
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:57,644
So you get used to it.

327
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,615
And sometimes with just a little
effort...

328
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:04,621
one sees someone in love, and believes
it is love.

329
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,225
I don’t know, I’ve never been to a Mardi
Gras.

330
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:10,088
You don’t need to.

331
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:14,222
How can you tell? I often feel lonely.

332
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:16,663
But you are beautiful.

333
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,628
Was your wife ugly?

334
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:23,400
No, she was beautiful.

335
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:26,076
I wonder what she was doing there.

336
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,108
My parents met at a political meeting.

337
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:36,185
They were young and were part of the
Communist party.

338
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,319
They had these ideas.

339
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:40,587
My mum told me...

340
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:44,252
once with dad, they organized something
like a cinema.

341
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:48,399
In fact what they did was get a
projector

342
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:53,233
and went around the shanty towns
showing movies to the children.

343
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:55,731
At first, they weren’t close.

344
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,331
They talked about revolution and things
like that...

345
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:01,107
and then one day,

346
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:04,237
they realized they were in love.

347
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:07,879
They first kissed in front of the
children,

348
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:10,546
who laughed at them.

349
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:13,390
Isnt that cute?

350
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:15,318
Very.

351
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:17,822
Sonia.

352
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:19,754
Sonia!

353
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:25,568
That’s my mum. I have to go.

354
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,635
How are you?

355
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:31,832
Let’s meet again.

356
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,774
Yes, alright.

357
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:36,004
Good luck with your dad.

358
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,930
***

359
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:01,137
***

360
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,565
***

361
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:10,678
***

362
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:21,785
How was it,

363
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:23,886
did you feel anything?

364
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:28,389
I don’t know, what was I to feel?

365
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:29,890
I saw him from a distance.

366
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:33,090
And Miguel had to tell me
which one he was.

367
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:34,687
You should have gone up to him.

368
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:37,798
I don’t think so.

369
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:40,803
I thought you didn’t want me
to meet him.

370
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:43,204
Leave me out of this. He’s your father.

371
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:47,633
Don’t be an idiot.
What are you saying? Please.

372
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:53,642
I don’t understand what’s going on.
I don’t know what to do either.

373
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:58,246
- I thought if you met him...
- I can’t help you anymore,

374
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,846
- I’ve done enough.
- What?

375
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:02,916
- What? -Drop it, or we’re
really going to argue.

376
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,929
I can’t even talk to you today.
What’s the matter?

377
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,192
- Sonia!
- What?

378
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:12,932
- Give me a break!
- What break, mom, what break?

379
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:17,441
Im always with you, during your
operation, your recovery.

380
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,806
Don’t be so unfair!

381
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:22,710
- What is it now?
- Don’t give me that

382
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,907
every time I try to tell you
what happens to me!

383
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:27,007
Don’t look as if you don’t understand!

384
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:30,281
You don’t understand?
Do you need me to explain it to you?

385
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,447
Don’t you think about me?

386
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:36,015
Can’t you see that it wasn’t me who
chose to get into this?

387
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:40,689
It was you two who put me here! You and
this fucking never-ending story!

388
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:44,724
- Now you talk to this bicycle guy and
all of a sudden... -What bicycle guy?

389
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:49,296
He has nothing to do with this, nothing
at all! Don’t run away from everything!

390
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:53,002
Im sick and tired of you!
I don’t understand you!

391
00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:56,843
I can’t talk to you, because you’re
absolutely impossible!

392
00:36:56,914 --> 00:37:00,077
And I have to keep quiet, just like when
I was small!

393
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:01,812
Don’t be mean to mum.

394
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,855
- I’m not being mean...
- Sonia,

395
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:07,220
If you want to go back to Buenos Aires,
do it...

396
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:08,918
just leave us here.

397
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:12,793
You are, as always,
giving me a hard time.

398
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:14,487
Fuck it!

399
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:58,802
Mum,

400
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,138
let me help you.

401
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:37,413
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

402
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:39,674
- Are you looking for someone?
- No...

403
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:44,084
Well, yes, Cholo. Is he coming soon?

404
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:48,114
- I really don’t know. Isnt he in?
- There’s no one in.

405
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:51,127
- Apartment Nº 6, right?
- Yes, we live opposite.

406
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:52,685
He must be at PPendorcho´´´´´...

407
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:55,664
Yeah, right. We’re going there now.

408
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:58,361
- Do you want to come with us?
- No, thanks.

409
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:01,802
Ill wait for him,
in case he comes back.

410
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:04,705
See you then. I’m Lalo Fuentes.

411
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:06,333
- Nice to meet you.
- He’s Marcelito.

412
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:08,044
Isabel.

413
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:27,354
There are no kids because
it’s a town for old people.

414
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:29,922
- Why?
- I don’t know why.

415
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:32,997
But they have a school and Miguel
teaches them music.

416
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,862
At my school, music teachers
are all women.

417
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,534
A man never teaches music.

418
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:42,172
- Looks like no women play
the piano here. -Why?

419
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:44,941
I don’t know why,
it’s not easy playing the piano.

420
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:47,848
Mum does, only we don’t have a piano.

421
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:51,615
Remember how she used to play at
Christmas at uncle’s place?

422
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:53,620
Mum plays very well.

423
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:56,159
One day we’ll buy her a piano.

424
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:59,294
- How much does a piano cost?
- A lot of money.

425
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:00,928
- Why?
- Beba!

426
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:03,728
It just costs a lot of money.

427
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:08,664
- Someone’s at the door.
- Go, go.

428
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:10,272
Ask who it is.

429
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,469
- Who is it?
- It’s me, Floria.

430
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:16,479
Floria.

431
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:20,480
It’s the owner of this house.

432
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:23,019
- Shall I let her in?
- Ask her in.

433
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:25,148
Fucking bitch!

434
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,749
Hello, hello, hello.

435
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:31,556
What a nice sweater! Hello, hello.

436
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:34,029
Hello, cutie. Wheres your mum?

437
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:37,158
- She went out.
- Where did she go?

438
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:39,659
She went out for some air.

439
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,770
What a pity.

440
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:46,367
Im with friends next door and we are
about to play cards.

441
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,769
- Is she coming back soon?
- I don’t know.

442
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:52,906
- Something smells good.
- She went to see Cholo.

443
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,244
Look at this. Tasty.

444
00:40:55,352 --> 00:41:02,884
- How’s that going? You can tell me,
I know. -Yes.

445
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,861
- I know you know.
- Your uncle Alberto told me

446
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:09,058
when he stayed here this summer

447
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:10,927
It’s so sad,

448
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:12,968
she must be suffering.

449
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:18,205
Go and put some music on.
I have to talk to the lady.

450
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:21,800
- What music?
- Anything. Surprise me. Buzz off.

451
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:24,137
She’s so pretty; bye cutie.

452
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:27,512
And I love that pink headband,
my favorite color.

453
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:30,213
What do you know then?

454
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:32,920
That your mum wasn’t well...

455
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,424
- and then...
- My mum had a breast removed.

456
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,024
Cancer.

457
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,955
She seems to be ok now.

458
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:43,588
But she lives in fear of having it
pop up somewhere else.

459
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,033
- I didn’t know it was cancer.
- Let me finish!

460
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:48,465
As for my dad,

461
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,598
I never met him.

462
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:52,136
And yes,

463
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:55,302
he was imprisoned, even though
that’s not the right word.

464
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:59,846
The military took him away from home
when mum was pregnant with me.

465
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:04,320
So you see, my mum wasn’t a whore
or crazy,

466
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:06,819
or whatever it is that
you’re spreading around.

467
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:09,523
- But I didn’t...
- I just want to be clear.

468
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:11,920
That’s all. Anything else
you want to know?

469
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:15,061
Ah! Yes! My dad is not crazy.

470
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:19,669
In any case, he doesn’t need
to be pitied in this town.

471
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:26,174
If he doesn’t remember,
or maybe doesn’t want to do so;

472
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:28,142
it’s because of what he went through.

473
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,942
Because what he went through nobody...

474
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:34,610
can or will ever imagine the suffering
of those who were in there.

475
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,187
So now you know everything, ok?

476
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:39,684
You’ll understand...

477
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:41,848
why my mum,
after all she went through...

478
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:46,761
not knowing if the disease will ever
kill her,

479
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:49,290
wants to see him.

480
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:52,233
She wants us to be, after all these
years

481
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:54,931
and ugly things, a family.

482
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:57,235
I didn’t mean to upset you.

483
00:42:57,675 --> 00:43:00,542
- I’m only trying to help her.
- Do you really want to help us?

484
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:04,114
Then help us!

485
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:08,010
Just don’t go around spreading your
version of what happens to us.

486
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:10,549
My mum was lonely...

487
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:14,148
and ended up with some asshole
and had my sister.

488
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:18,593
We knew nothing about my dad, not even
if he was alive.

489
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:21,157
Ill give you something juicy...

490
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:24,689
for your gossiping friends:

491
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:28,363
My mum loves my dad.

492
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:33,038
And as far as she’s concerned,

493
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,840
he’s still the only man in her life.

494
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:49,122
So?

495
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:50,688
Is she coming?

496
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:52,556
What is it? Is she coming or not?

497
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:56,964
Get your asses in gear!
Yackety-yaking all day long!

498
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:58,160
Let’s go out.

499
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:02,636
All you do is talk bullshit. You have no
idea what you’re talking about!

500
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:11,771
Hello... Hello...

501
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:13,840
Alright, turn it on.

502
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:17,253
Hello, hello.

503
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:18,887
Can you hear me?

504
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:21,915
Ok.

505
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:28,929
Love me...

506
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,459
The image of Ristofen with the...

507
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:34,194
- the scarf...
- Love me,

508
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:36,763
please.

509
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:40,835
Im a slave to your love.

510
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:46,080
you can see my shape,

511
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:49,409
I can’t live without you

512
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:53,816
Love me like you did before

513
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:58,223
with fire and passion

514
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:03,162
and let’s live our love

515
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:06,469
with future and compassion

516
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:10,603
Love me, I want to go close to the sea

517
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:15,569
love me, let’s go for a walk

518
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,869
I expect you

519
00:45:17,948 --> 00:45:23,580
to be sincere

520
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:32,021
Love me like you did before

521
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,498
with fire and passion

522
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:41,801
and let’s live our love

523
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,939
with future and compassion

524
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:49,277
Love me, I want to go close to the sea

525
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:53,883
love me, let’s go for a walk

526
00:45:55,919 --> 00:46:00,083
- I expect you...
- Hello, let’s go bowling.

527
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,950
to be sincere

528
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:06,988
Love me, I want to go close to the sea

529
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:12,195
love me, let’s go for a walk

530
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:14,662
I expect you...

531
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:20,233
to be sincere

532
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:32,453
Love me, please

533
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,649
Im a slave to your love

534
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:41,654
You can see my shape,

535
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:45,267
I can’t live without you.

536
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:49,636
- Bye.
- Love me like you did before.

537
00:46:51,408 --> 00:46:54,104
with fire and passion

538
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:59,146
and let’s live our love

539
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:02,644
with future and compassion

540
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:08,451
Cholo!

541
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:11,653
Cholo!

542
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:16,561
Cholo!

543
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:20,496
What is it?

544
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:26,166
What do you mean what is it?

545
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,577
I don’t get it. Who is it?

546
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:32,775
It’s us.

547
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,611
Us, who?

548
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:41,189
Us, you and me, Cholo.

549
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:43,682
Please,

550
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,726
what’s the matter?

551
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:49,194
It’s me, Isabel.

552
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:52,231
You’re doing this on purpose.

553
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:56,503
Don’t run off, don’t be afraid!

554
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:40,541
We could stay a few more days.

555
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,180
No.

556
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:46,745
What’s the point?
There’s nothing we can do now.

557
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:50,621
Bebi is missing school,
I have things to do and you...

558
00:48:50,794 --> 00:48:55,891
Look mum, I worked very hard
to get this week off.

559
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,128
I know, honey.

560
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:01,638
I know, but...

561
00:49:05,842 --> 00:49:09,938
You must understand
this is hard for me too.

562
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:12,512
Im still not well.

563
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:15,277
I...

564
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:19,183
Forgive me,
I should have waited longer before...

565
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,855
getting you into this.

566
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:38,493
Hello!

567
00:50:39,736 --> 00:50:41,169
Cutie!

568
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:44,135
Hello!

569
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:47,374
Hello, how are you?

570
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,876
- What’s that?
- What do you think?

571
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:54,347
- What did you do to your bike?
- Now I have a claxon. Listen!

572
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:58,483
- Claxon.
- And what’s that paper on the front?

573
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,379
I have a cold;

574
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:03,249
I can blow my nose.

575
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:07,460
How are you?

576
00:51:07,864 --> 00:51:10,992
Ill take your girl out for a while.
Illl bring her back shortly.

577
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:26,940
But I love my dad.

578
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:31,647
All we do is talk about Cholo. What
about my dad?

579
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:33,882
It’s just for a few days...

580
00:51:33,957 --> 00:51:37,256
when we get back you’ll see your dad all
the time.

581
00:51:37,327 --> 00:51:40,387
But you love Cholo, right?

582
00:51:41,698 --> 00:51:44,861
I told you, I don’t get along with your
dad.

583
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:48,967
Im asking you if you love Cholo more or
not.

584
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:53,672
Maybe a little more.

585
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,010
- What is it?
- Nothing.

586
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:06,250
Are you sure?

587
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:07,718
Why?

588
00:52:08,158 --> 00:52:09,250
Why what?

589
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,023
Why do you love my dad less?

590
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:16,026
We no longer talk, we don’t get along.

591
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:21,567
You only love those you get along with,

592
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:24,436
that’s very nice.

593
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,670
That’s the way it is.

594
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:29,277
That’s the way it is for you.

595
00:52:29,346 --> 00:52:34,215
It’s probably you who upsets dad, and
that’s why he’s so nervous.

596
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:38,884
Right?

597
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:42,021
Maybe.

598
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:45,650
Then, why don’t you think about it?

599
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:49,421
You’re so mean to Dad.

600
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:52,493
And Cholo! You don’t even get along with
him,

601
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:54,867
he’s crazy.

602
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,564
Don’t say that.

603
00:52:57,941 --> 00:53:00,171
Everybody knows he’s crazy,

604
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:02,871
he pretends he doesn’t know you.

605
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,503
Why do you say that?

606
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:06,411
He plays stupid.

607
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:10,643
He doesn’t want to see you, he doesn’t
love you, period.

608
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,824
That’s not how it is.

609
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,717
The thing is Cholo...

610
00:53:18,428 --> 00:53:19,793
Cholo is not well...

611
00:53:20,897 --> 00:53:22,524
Cholo is sick.

612
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:25,031
I don’t think so. He just pretends to be
mad.

613
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:36,409
- You call, sir.
- Why should I?

614
00:53:36,479 --> 00:53:39,744
I’m only here to buy bread. If it’s
closed, bad luck.

615
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:41,579
- Ok.
- What’s the matter?

616
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,319
He didn’t open up.

617
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:46,848
Perhaps something happened to Cholo.

618
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,550
- Cholo!
- No, no.

619
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:54,460
- Did you go to his house?
- Not yet.

620
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:02,803
We should go personally.

621
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:14,217
Give me a hand.

622
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,586
- Shall I go with you?
- No, wait here.

623
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:22,581
What happened to Cholo?

624
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:25,256
Don Cholo!

625
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:27,294
Are you OK, Cholo?

626
00:54:28,398 --> 00:54:30,195
What are you doing here?

627
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:31,962
Sorry I barged in,

628
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:35,232
but people out there are worried.

629
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,205
Are you OK?

630
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:40,033
Shall I make a coffee?

631
00:54:40,176 --> 00:54:41,074
Shall I?

632
00:54:41,177 --> 00:54:42,769
Yes, Ill make it.

633
00:54:45,915 --> 00:54:48,145
Let me tell them you’re ok.

634
00:54:51,755 --> 00:54:54,189
Everything’s fine, Sonia.

635
00:54:55,425 --> 00:54:56,619
What happened to him?

636
00:54:56,926 --> 00:54:59,952
- He’s got a cold.
- Shall I come in with you?

637
00:55:00,597 --> 00:55:02,929
- Let me talk to him first.
- Are you sure?

638
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:05,467
Everything is alright.

639
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:09,369
All of you, go away.
Go and buy bread at the supermarket.

640
00:55:09,572 --> 00:55:12,803
But don’t get mad; tell us how he is.

641
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:17,011
This is the start, basic and final.

642
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:20,607
- Always keeping the same distance.
500 meters, in this case. -Ok.

643
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:23,581
Do you understand, Mario? Is it clear?

644
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,450
- Very clear.
- Alright?

645
00:55:26,022 --> 00:55:27,887
Tell me, Mario.

646
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:30,416
You know that woman?

647
00:55:31,795 --> 00:55:32,784
What woman?

648
00:55:32,962 --> 00:55:35,362
The one that used to hang around with
your friend.

649
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:40,128
She came with her daughters... the one
they say is nuts.

650
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:41,602
Nuts?

651
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:45,003
- Why would she be nuts?
- That’s what I heard.

652
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:48,574
Look, Lalo, I don’t know,

653
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:51,704
Cholo is my friend.
And you know how he is.

654
00:55:53,316 --> 00:55:56,114
You know him, he’s your neighbour too.

655
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:58,086
Yes! But who is she?

656
00:55:58,288 --> 00:55:59,312
The woman?

657
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:00,980
- Yes.
- How should I know?

658
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:03,352
I think there was something between
them.

659
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:05,858
But that’s their business.

660
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:09,228
- Yes, she’s alright though!
- The truth is...

661
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:11,927
- I didn’t see her that well.
- Come on!

662
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:15,801
This isn’t easy for me,
Cholo is my friend.

663
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:17,134
What else do you want to know?

664
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,607
It’s alright, Mario. Alright.

665
00:56:19,776 --> 00:56:24,304
I saw her last night, she seemed lonely

666
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:27,578
I wanted to get to know her, do you know
what I mean?

667
00:56:27,917 --> 00:56:30,579
Yes, yes, of course.

668
00:56:32,122 --> 00:56:35,023
See you next time.

669
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:37,786
See you, Mario. Don’t forget to study.

670
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:40,653
Sure.

671
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:54,603
I was in peace here.

672
00:56:55,979 --> 00:56:59,346
With the little I had and did,

673
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:01,174
I was happy.

674
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,587
I had forgiven everybody.

675
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:09,555
I minded my own business.

676
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,225
First I learned to make bread,

677
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:14,454
and then croissants.

678
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:19,059
I was quite good at it,
people would come,

679
00:57:19,235 --> 00:57:20,566
and I felt grateful for...

680
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:25,068
how can I put it,
for the happiness I had.

681
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,868
Im listening, Cholo,

682
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:30,137
but why the past tense?

683
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,409
Because...

684
00:57:37,086 --> 00:57:39,179
yesterday everything came back to me.

685
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:43,118
I was awake all night thinking...

686
00:57:43,193 --> 00:57:46,959
I’d made up that happiness...

687
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:51,230
out of sheer fear so I could get on...

688
00:57:51,434 --> 00:57:54,631
in this town carrying my past.

689
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:58,900
I was once young...

690
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:01,067
and I believed.

691
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:02,578
Yes,

692
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:04,345
I believed.

693
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:10,079
It was easy to hide what I had.

694
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:12,880
So much time shouting.

695
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:15,613
It is so...

696
00:58:15,725 --> 00:58:18,626
so fucking easy.

697
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:23,488
If you’re willing to...

698
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:28,093
forget your dreams, your ideals...

699
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:29,798
then, you are happy.

700
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:38,847
I believed, you know?

701
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:41,706
I believed we could make a better world.

702
00:58:43,152 --> 00:58:44,881
Im not ashamed of saying this.

703
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:46,714
You know how I feel?

704
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:48,823
- What?
- Afraid!

705
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:52,092
I’m paralyzed. I can’t move.

706
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:56,893
Cholo...

707
00:58:58,735 --> 00:59:00,032
Cholo...

708
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:04,968
How about if instead...

709
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:10,205
we make a less worse world?

710
00:59:24,494 --> 00:59:26,428
Fuck! Now they broadcast Beethoven!

711
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:30,125
Never an easy one
when it’s my turn to guess.

712
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:41,867
The thing is,
you bring a lot of things with you.

713
00:59:43,813 --> 00:59:45,075
I don’t understand.

714
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:48,682
- What is it you don’t understand?
- I don’t understand.

715
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:52,687
Miguel, if he was upset,
and couldn’t sleep...

716
00:59:53,623 --> 00:59:56,285
it means that when we talked at the
beach hed already...

717
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:58,922
Im as confused as you are.

718
00:59:58,995 --> 01:00:02,021
I don’t know the whole story.

719
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:05,629
And people in town,
they talk about everything.

720
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:09,801
But what he told people here...

721
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:11,936
- ... was different.
- What did he say?

722
01:00:13,343 --> 01:00:14,571
Well...

723
01:00:15,478 --> 01:00:16,570
Did he have a car?

724
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:20,044
- A car?
- Yes, a car.

725
01:00:20,483 --> 01:00:23,008
I don’t understand. He couldn’t drive.

726
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:26,915
Why would he say that?

727
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:28,685
- He obviously made it up.
- What for?

728
01:00:28,758 --> 01:00:30,623
Up, up, up. The thing is,

729
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:34,129
I think in the end, he believed it.

730
01:00:34,197 --> 01:00:35,960
But now we’re here.

731
01:00:36,165 --> 01:00:38,497
Look, a huge mackerel.

732
01:00:38,868 --> 01:00:41,234
- I caught the largest one, Bebu!
- How lucky!

733
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:43,333
Look how nice, Bebu.

734
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:48,434
- Nice!
- Take it out!

735
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:51,639
Go to the side,
but don’t get it snarled up on the pier.

736
01:00:51,714 --> 01:00:55,912
- Ok. -If line snaps,
Ill never bring you here again.

737
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,213
- Do I make myself clear?
- Yes.

738
01:00:57,286 --> 01:00:58,913
Go. Go.

739
01:01:09,399 --> 01:01:10,798
Here it comes!

740
01:01:15,705 --> 01:01:18,105
Dad!

741
01:01:18,408 --> 01:01:20,342
- Did you see that?
- I don’t see a thing.

742
01:01:20,777 --> 01:01:23,075
Look what he caught, a huge thing.

743
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:24,440
Where, what?

744
01:01:24,614 --> 01:01:26,844
- Over there.
- You’re such an asshole!

745
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:29,450
- It was huge!
- Just bring the line in.

746
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:33,011
- I swear, it was fish!
- Fish, my foot.

747
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:35,216
I told you, you’d get the line snarled.

748
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:38,021
- You’re so stubborn.
- Wait, it’s a ray, it’s huge!

749
01:01:38,094 --> 01:01:41,086
- Wait, let me bring it in,
before you lose it. -Let’s see...

750
01:01:41,164 --> 01:01:43,359
It’s huge!

751
01:01:45,435 --> 01:01:48,836
Look at the size of it!... Step on its
tail.

752
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:50,436
- How are you?
- Did you see what the boy caught?

753
01:01:50,506 --> 01:01:55,102
- What is it?
- A ray, about ten pounds.

754
01:01:55,511 --> 01:01:59,777
- He’s a good fisherman. Did you teach
him? -Yes, he learnt well.

755
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:04,284
No, really... you know what?

756
01:02:04,487 --> 01:02:06,421
You left suddenly last night.

757
01:02:08,024 --> 01:02:09,719
Yes, yes.

758
01:02:10,827 --> 01:02:12,886
Are you going there tonight?

759
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:15,386
No, I don’t think so.

760
01:02:16,432 --> 01:02:19,401
If you make up your mind... Ill be
there.

761
01:02:22,004 --> 01:02:24,529
Thanks, but no.

762
01:03:09,886 --> 01:03:12,753
- You’re making it up.
- I’m not. I’m reading it here!

763
01:03:12,822 --> 01:03:16,553
MMy little toy cries all day out of
love´´´´´...

764
01:03:18,394 --> 01:03:22,455
- These old people are wicked.
- Where did you get those from?

765
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:25,862
- They were in a box.
- Listen, listen.

766
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:28,733
NNovember, 1945´´´´´.... a different date.

767
01:03:29,672 --> 01:03:31,299
You weren’t even born.

768
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:37,037
- MMy sad eyes´´´´´.... he calls her ´´´´´mmmy sad
eyes´´´´´... -How sweet.

769
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,009
Here. Listen.

770
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:41,072
II didn’t know pain could go...

771
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:46,110
hand in hand with excitement...

772
01:03:46,189 --> 01:03:48,783
- Hey!
- with an urge to hold you...

773
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:52,089
- and get inside your body to fill you
with passion -No...

774
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:54,895
- The old man was really something.
- I can’t believe it.

775
01:03:54,964 --> 01:03:59,162
- These are her letters to him.
- Let me see them.

776
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:01,867
They are so divine.

777
01:04:02,104 --> 01:04:03,935
- Wait!
- What?

778
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:09,310
- He’s crazy and excited.
- Let me see.

779
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:11,403
Just give me one... any one of them.

780
01:04:11,581 --> 01:04:12,775
Let me see...

781
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:16,416
Let me see, let me see...

782
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:20,011
MMy dear, adorable Arturo´´´´´:::

783
01:04:21,424 --> 01:04:25,155
- That’s nice... although Arturo doesn’t
sound adorable. -Come on.

784
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:28,554
The old lady has spelling mistakes!

785
01:04:29,265 --> 01:04:32,291
- I think she’s German or something.
- Oh, I see.

786
01:04:32,468 --> 01:04:36,700
Listen.
TThinking about you keeps me going...

787
01:04:36,772 --> 01:04:39,104
you make me believe not everything’s
like this.

788
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:42,975
What these somnambulist faces tell me,

789
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:44,876
with which we search...

790
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:48,315
what we know we’ll never find..

791
01:04:50,786 --> 01:04:53,414
- Leave it, take one of these.
- No, let me carry on.

792
01:04:58,094 --> 01:04:59,686
II don’t want to be here,

793
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:03,023
to suffer in this search.

794
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:06,731
Sometimes
I even curse for being a Jew...

795
01:05:07,503 --> 01:05:09,903
for having been born to see all this.

796
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:14,808
I curse my stupid hope, which is no
longer that but something else:

797
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:18,077
It’s letting go among so much death.

798
01:05:19,882 --> 01:05:23,010
among so many people
destroyed for nothing.

799
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,410
My aunt no longer talks to me.

800
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:28,918
It’s as if first,
they took her smile away,

801
01:05:29,892 --> 01:05:31,257
then her look,

802
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:34,195
and now even her soul.

803
01:05:35,564 --> 01:05:38,761
Returning to this hell with her looking
for the others,

804
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:42,237
returning to this destruction where
everybody’s silent,

805
01:05:43,005 --> 01:05:45,496
where nobody explains and looks the
other way,

806
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:48,266
feigning innocence, trying to forget.

807
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,136
Im afraid, Arturo.

808
01:05:52,081 --> 01:05:53,810
Afraid of losing my faith...

809
01:05:54,717 --> 01:05:56,548
or a reason to live.

810
01:05:57,687 --> 01:06:02,147
Yesterday I got some flowers and stared
at them by the window.

811
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,384
And you know what, my love?

812
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:10,024
I thanked God I could still feel
something in their beauty,

813
01:06:10,766 --> 01:06:12,233
in their scent,

814
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:16,330
something so simple yet so wonderful.

815
01:06:17,106 --> 01:06:18,300
And there,

816
01:06:18,908 --> 01:06:22,844
in the miracle of feeling alive,
I saw you, sweetheart.

817
01:06:23,446 --> 01:06:25,311
Your eyes, your warmth

818
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:27,914
and your kindness.

819
01:06:30,052 --> 01:06:31,610
I need you badly.

820
01:06:32,888 --> 01:06:37,757
I wish the world would learn from you,
so It’s never like this again..

821
01:07:36,018 --> 01:07:37,383
How’s it going?

822
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:41,356
Aren’t you open in the afternoons?

823
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:44,321
- Until summertime, only in the morning.
- Yeah.

824
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:47,191
- No point in opening in the afternoon.
- You’re right. Coming with me?

825
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:50,856
- Do you have a class?
- Yes, it’s a nice day,

826
01:07:50,933 --> 01:07:54,232
it’s windy.
I called; they said I could go.

827
01:07:54,336 --> 01:07:57,100
Ill take a one hour class
and come back.

828
01:07:57,306 --> 01:08:01,402
But I told Olga we were going fishing.

829
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:04,874
- What are you looking at?
- Must be expensive:

830
01:08:05,181 --> 01:08:07,513
the flying and buying the fish.

831
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:10,416
This time, no fish. No way.

832
01:08:10,486 --> 01:08:14,786
Ill say we didn’t catch anything.

833
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:19,427
- Let her cook a vegetable pie.
- Why don’t you just tell her?

834
01:08:19,495 --> 01:08:22,953
I can’t, leave it. I just can’t.

835
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:28,502
How do you tell four women
you’re flying at fifty-five?

836
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:31,371
They’d worry. They’d...

837
01:08:31,907 --> 01:08:35,741
They’d break my legs to keep me from
going. They worry!

838
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:52,954
- Hello.
- Hello.

839
01:08:53,028 --> 01:08:54,791
- How are you?
- Fine.

840
01:08:54,864 --> 01:08:58,061
- I am... -I know who you are.
Do you want to come in?

841
01:08:59,435 --> 01:09:01,630
I came here last summer

842
01:09:02,404 --> 01:09:05,134
But we’ve known each other
since I was 17.

843
01:09:06,775 --> 01:09:10,871
I came with a guy and we stayed here.

844
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:14,239
Coca helps out in the summer.
She’s a caretaker off season.

845
01:09:15,751 --> 01:09:18,743
And then it happened and we realized.

846
01:09:19,221 --> 01:09:21,189
To the people in the town,
we’re sisters.

847
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:24,915
- They all know, but they look
the other way. -Not all of them.

848
01:09:25,594 --> 01:09:28,757
Those who don’t,
it’s because they don’t want to.

849
01:09:28,931 --> 01:09:30,262
That’s something else.

850
01:09:30,633 --> 01:09:31,964
But that’s how it is.

851
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:35,903
What do you do with Cholo?

852
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:37,404
You work?

853
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:41,533
Why do you call him Cholo?

854
01:09:41,877 --> 01:09:43,037
He’s your old man.

855
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:48,349
Yes, but since he doesn’t know...

856
01:09:49,251 --> 01:09:50,411
Doesn’t know?

857
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:55,347
That I’m his daughter,
that we’re here with my mum.

858
01:09:58,394 --> 01:09:59,656
What?

859
01:10:00,796 --> 01:10:02,661
You think your dad doesn’t know?

860
01:10:06,735 --> 01:10:07,759
No.

861
01:10:09,572 --> 01:10:10,903
Of course he does.

862
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:13,675
Your dad saw your mum.

863
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:17,804
But it’s logical. How do you expect...?

864
01:10:18,847 --> 01:10:22,476
What? Excuse me,
what logic are you talking about?

865
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:25,748
Whoever comes here,
does so for a reason.

866
01:10:26,589 --> 01:10:28,614
I don’t talk much with your dad, but...

867
01:10:29,658 --> 01:10:31,683
sometimes he just stares at me and...

868
01:10:33,796 --> 01:10:35,730
You know what? Now I understand.

869
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:38,730
He’s thinking about you.

870
01:10:41,937 --> 01:10:43,427
If I were you,
I’d leave things the way they are.

871
01:10:44,006 --> 01:10:47,169
He’s alright,
he’s a good guy, he’s happy.

872
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:52,874
Besides, if you push him,
the only thing you’ll achieve...

873
01:10:52,948 --> 01:10:58,716
is he’ll re-live everything,
and he’ll be devastated.

874
01:11:02,558 --> 01:11:05,254
Don’t get upset,
that’s the way it is.

875
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:10,426
Is it?

876
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:13,665
Why does it have to be that way?

877
01:11:14,536 --> 01:11:17,198
All we want is to be with him.

878
01:11:17,573 --> 01:11:19,632
We’re not going to hurt him.

879
01:11:20,309 --> 01:11:22,903
But here he invented a past,
better than the one he had.

880
01:11:24,246 --> 01:11:25,907
Better than what?

881
01:11:26,982 --> 01:11:30,713
- You mean better without us?
- Yes.

882
01:11:30,886 --> 01:11:33,980
I know it’s tough. Like we have to
invent we’re sisters.

883
01:11:34,423 --> 01:11:36,983
That’s the way it is. What can I say?

884
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:41,429
Yes, whatever.

885
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:11,421
This was a concert in E Major by Pietro
Antonio Locateli...

886
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:17,765
by the musicians of Sarajevo, directed
by Yanos Pora.

887
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:22,102
Cholo, let’s play something else.

888
01:12:22,738 --> 01:12:24,831
This is too expensive for me.

889
01:12:25,274 --> 01:12:28,937
It was your idea in the first place,
wasn’t it?

890
01:12:29,144 --> 01:12:32,944
No, well... true, but that’s it. You’re
a genius.

891
01:12:33,082 --> 01:12:36,051
- Me! I keep on paying.
- Yeah, but I come along with you.

892
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:38,914
- That’s because you’re my friend.
- Of course,

893
01:12:39,121 --> 01:12:41,453
I wouldn’t do it just for a free beer,
would I?

894
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:43,753
Yes, of course.

895
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:48,421
- OOf course´´´´´
- But you can’t take criticism.

896
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:50,832
You’re my only friend.

897
01:12:51,333 --> 01:12:55,497
Do you think I can’t see that you’re
always with me?

898
01:12:55,671 --> 01:12:58,401
You’re also my only friend. Sometimes I
wonder why.

899
01:12:59,575 --> 01:13:02,772
I don’t know, I don’t know why.

900
01:13:03,545 --> 01:13:07,914
Because we love each other we have a
lot in common.

901
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:11,747
- Think so?
- Yes... I don’t know.

902
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:14,412
Neither do I.

903
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:19,220
When I was a kid, maybe eight or nine,
my grandpa sat me on his lap...

904
01:13:19,294 --> 01:13:23,526
stared at me and said: the most
important thing in life are friends.

905
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:26,767
- Very wise.
- Wise!

906
01:13:27,202 --> 01:13:30,638
It took a lifetime for me understand
that it was bullshit.

907
01:13:30,706 --> 01:13:34,574
The important thing is fighting for your
ideals. When you do,

908
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:39,580
you lose at least 80º/º of what he said
was important.

909
01:13:39,882 --> 01:13:44,046
That’s a point of view. I think your
grandpa was right.

910
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:47,384
- You don’t get it, Mario.
- Of course.

911
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:50,854
When I don’t agree with you, then I
don’t get it?

912
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:55,586
And don’t give me that shit! What ideals
do you have?

913
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:58,225
None, that’s why we keep on being
friends.

914
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:00,793
I want none.

915
01:14:04,206 --> 01:14:06,367
- Watch your speed.
- Yes, yes.

916
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:22,654
Hello.

917
01:14:23,358 --> 01:14:24,882
The fisherman! Hello.

918
01:14:25,093 --> 01:14:26,720
- How are you, Marcelito?
- Fine.

919
01:14:26,895 --> 01:14:29,227
- What are you playing?
- Just killing time.

920
01:14:30,799 --> 01:14:32,198
Cholos not in.

921
01:14:32,835 --> 01:14:34,132
- Isnt he?
- Do you know when he’ll be back?

922
01:14:34,236 --> 01:14:36,204
He went with Mario to see my dad.

923
01:14:36,805 --> 01:14:39,706
- Where to? -They went flying.
My dad’s the instructor.

924
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:42,101
He flies planes?

925
01:14:42,411 --> 01:14:44,003
That’s nice.

926
01:14:44,112 --> 01:14:46,273
Come, come in.

927
01:14:53,088 --> 01:14:54,419
- Make yourselves at home.
- Thank you.

928
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,287
I make a great coffee.

929
01:15:02,698 --> 01:15:05,360
Tell me, Marcelito, Cholos house...

930
01:15:05,534 --> 01:15:09,470
- is it like this one?
- Yes, only it’s the other way round,

931
01:15:09,538 --> 01:15:11,904
being across the hallway.

932
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:17,908
You know what? Bad news.

933
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:19,742
- What?
- Don’t be mad.

934
01:15:20,115 --> 01:15:22,208
- No
- We’ve run out of coffee.

935
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:25,678
Don’t worry, dear.

936
01:15:34,096 --> 01:15:35,393
Yes.

937
01:15:43,305 --> 01:15:45,068
Can you help me?

938
01:15:45,607 --> 01:15:47,472
What’s the problem?

939
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:49,438
Sit down.

940
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:07,784
- Why do you have so many blank report
cards? -Look,

941
01:16:07,863 --> 01:16:10,354
I will pass, that I can promise.

942
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:13,963
The thing is I have to fix my marks...

943
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:16,333
or my dad will go crazy.

944
01:16:17,506 --> 01:16:19,167
What do you want me to do?

945
01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:21,305
I dont know...

946
01:16:21,777 --> 01:16:24,678
you could forge them for me.

947
01:16:30,352 --> 01:16:31,785
Why did they beat us?

948
01:16:33,288 --> 01:16:37,054
Because the British had more
weapons and were more powerful.

949
01:16:38,627 --> 01:16:40,390
Why did they want to kill us?

950
01:16:41,997 --> 01:16:43,897
That’s the way wars are, I don’t know.

951
01:16:46,068 --> 01:16:48,195
What were you talking about?

952
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:50,568
- Nothing! A surprise!
- What surprise?

953
01:16:50,672 --> 01:16:53,197
Marcelito was showing me his room.

954
01:16:57,879 --> 01:16:58,937
What’s that!

955
01:16:59,081 --> 01:17:00,673
It’s about my father.

956
01:17:01,049 --> 01:17:02,778
He sank a ship.

957
01:17:28,076 --> 01:17:29,873
Mario, this is it.

958
01:17:33,015 --> 01:17:35,813
It’s ready. It’s all yours.

959
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:40,654
- Come on, Mario.
- No, listen to me.

960
01:17:41,123 --> 01:17:42,454
Lalo, no, listen to me.

961
01:17:42,858 --> 01:17:46,817
You know that I... This is without
warning.

962
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:50,692
I don’t normally mail a thing like this.
You are ready. Period.

963
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:54,130
Believe me, Mario. And believe in
yourself.

964
01:17:54,636 --> 01:17:56,604
- Believe in yourself.
- Listen, no, Lalo...

965
01:17:57,105 --> 01:17:58,504
Give me a break.

966
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:02,474
- Don’t just leave me here.
- Please!

967
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:06,273
Lalo, I’m sorry... Im sorry...

968
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:08,782
- I’m sorry to insist. Please,...
- Come on!

969
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:10,613
Im not too sure about some things.

970
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:13,814
- There are certain details...
- Don’t give me that.

971
01:18:13,889 --> 01:18:17,985
You’re ready. That’s an order. Get up in
there, Mario.

972
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:20,423
Well be in 1223,

973
01:18:20,495 --> 01:18:21,359
we’ll be on the same frequency.

974
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:23,295
- Calm down. Calm down.
- What is it?

975
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:26,232
- Come on.
- What is it? Now it’s my turn;

976
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:31,364
I have to do it alone. Listen!

977
01:18:31,773 --> 01:18:36,904
- I’m not feeling well, as I told you in
the car. -Again?

978
01:18:36,978 --> 01:18:40,880
Mario, cut the bullshit. You are ready,
just get up in there.

979
01:18:40,949 --> 01:18:45,045
I can’t do it, Cholo! I just can’t. You
know what?

980
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:49,046
I have diarrhoea, I could see this
coming.

981
01:18:49,357 --> 01:18:50,654
- Another excuse.
- Let’s go.

982
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:52,757
- Where to?
- Let’s go,

983
01:18:53,462 --> 01:18:55,089
- May I, Fuentes?
- Are you a pilot?

984
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:57,297
- No, no way.
- In that case,

985
01:18:57,733 --> 01:19:00,361
go ahead. Go for it. Bye.

986
01:19:10,445 --> 01:19:12,743
- Everything OK?
- What the fucks wrong with this?

987
01:19:12,948 --> 01:19:15,143
- What’s up with it?
- It’s stuck.

988
01:19:15,317 --> 01:19:17,376
- Go back, then.
- Ah, that’s it.

989
01:19:19,955 --> 01:19:22,947
Don’t talk to me, I have to
concentrate.

990
01:19:23,158 --> 01:19:25,524
Then shut up and concentrate.

991
01:19:25,861 --> 01:19:29,160
- You’re distracting me!
- Pay attention to what you’re doing!

992
01:19:29,231 --> 01:19:30,425
Im doing so.

993
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:31,966
Im paying attention, damn it...

994
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:36,032
Easy, Mario, I have a daughter!

995
01:19:39,207 --> 01:19:40,868
- What was that?
- Pay attention.

996
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:47,071
- What storm?
- What are you doing?

997
01:19:47,816 --> 01:19:48,976
Please, Mario.

998
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:51,780
- What...?
- Concentrate!

999
01:19:51,853 --> 01:19:54,754
Concentrate, or we’ll crash!

1000
01:19:55,257 --> 01:19:59,284
- That’s Julian’s palm tree, he brought
it from Entre Ríos. -Pay attention!

1001
01:20:00,128 --> 01:20:04,087
Why don’t you just enjoy it?
Relax, deep breaths.

1002
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:07,225
Calm down, enjoy it!

1003
01:20:08,436 --> 01:20:09,664
Lalo!

1004
01:20:10,405 --> 01:20:12,066
- Don’t shout!
- Are you sweating?

1005
01:20:12,307 --> 01:20:14,935
Yes, I’m sweating, Mario.

1006
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:17,139
- You fly it.
- No way!

1007
01:20:17,712 --> 01:20:19,646
- Come on!
- Do you want me to get out?

1008
01:20:19,714 --> 01:20:22,706
- I leave it!
- Cut it out!

1009
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:26,450
Happy birthday!

1010
01:20:28,290 --> 01:20:29,780
- Did you see their faces?
- Look forwards!

1011
01:20:29,858 --> 01:20:33,123
Let’s do it again! Come on!

1012
01:20:37,799 --> 01:20:40,927
- Fuck you!
- Watch the antenna!

1013
01:20:41,269 --> 01:20:43,499
- Marcela!
- Look at the plane!

1014
01:20:46,074 --> 01:20:48,372
Dad! Get out of that thing, dad!

1015
01:21:13,935 --> 01:21:15,061
- Isabel.
- Hello.

1016
01:21:15,470 --> 01:21:16,459
And the boy?

1017
01:21:16,771 --> 01:21:19,501
He’s playing with my daughters.

1018
01:21:20,075 --> 01:21:21,235
Why?

1019
01:21:22,277 --> 01:21:24,108
It’s nothing. Sit down.

1020
01:21:24,246 --> 01:21:26,180
- What happened?
- Nothing.

1021
01:21:28,049 --> 01:21:29,243
I wanted to talk to you.

1022
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:31,443
What about?

1023
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:35,515
- Is it about the boy? -Everything’s
fine, he’s playing with the girls.

1024
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:37,987
You might find it silly,

1025
01:21:39,261 --> 01:21:40,592
but I want to help you.

1026
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:35,178
I’m good for nothing like this. It’s not
worth it.

1027
01:22:36,051 --> 01:22:40,147
Whatever I do in life, people will think
Im a piece of shit.

1028
01:22:41,189 --> 01:22:42,781
A piece of shit.

1029
01:22:43,725 --> 01:22:45,625
And these last few years...

1030
01:22:47,362 --> 01:22:48,556
without my wife...

1031
01:22:49,831 --> 01:22:51,321
I don’t know.

1032
01:22:53,335 --> 01:22:55,860
She alone was proud of me.

1033
01:22:56,805 --> 01:23:00,036
I didn’t care about the rest.

1034
01:23:03,511 --> 01:23:07,174
It’s tough not being able to look your
son in the eyes.

1035
01:23:11,419 --> 01:23:14,877
Knowing you brought him into this shit.

1036
01:23:16,858 --> 01:23:19,349
But why turn your anger back on him?

1037
01:23:24,366 --> 01:23:25,663
I don’t know.

1038
01:23:27,869 --> 01:23:29,427
It must be shame.

1039
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:33,800
Sometimes I think I’m as bad as what
people think of me.

1040
01:23:37,379 --> 01:23:38,744
Like...

1041
01:23:39,581 --> 01:23:43,073
the guy across the hall, the one you
know.

1042
01:23:44,986 --> 01:23:46,954
You think I don’t know what he thinks
about me?

1043
01:23:47,856 --> 01:23:51,758
He thinks I’m a murderer because I’m in
the military.

1044
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:55,427
Like the bastards in uniform.

1045
01:23:55,930 --> 01:23:58,592
When I risked my life, I did it for my
country.

1046
01:23:58,967 --> 01:24:00,161
My motherland.

1047
01:24:00,335 --> 01:24:03,099
I didn’t just go out and kill innocent
people.

1048
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:09,203
I don’t know.

1049
01:24:09,944 --> 01:24:11,434
It must be shame.

1050
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:14,844
Yes, shame.

1051
01:24:16,418 --> 01:24:18,010
The worst part is,

1052
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:22,288
seeing myself the way people think about
me.

1053
01:25:33,628 --> 01:25:34,754
Dear Dad:

1054
01:25:35,563 --> 01:25:38,293
Im your daughter, my name is Sonja.

1055
01:25:40,168 --> 01:25:43,604
Mum said you came up with my
name when she was pregnant.

1056
01:25:45,607 --> 01:25:47,837
I’d like you to remember who we are.

1057
01:25:50,011 --> 01:25:52,377
Since I was small, I’ve always talked
wwith´´´´´ you.

1058
01:25:53,348 --> 01:25:54,508
I thought...

1059
01:25:55,416 --> 01:25:59,079
we all thought, you’d gone to heaven,
as mum Said.

1060
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:05,887
Perhaps I didn’t feel the loss because
I’d never met you.

1061
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:10,654
It’s difficult to explain, dad,

1062
01:26:11,599 --> 01:26:12,793
you were always there.

1063
01:26:18,806 --> 01:26:20,398
Perhaps it was because you were alive.

1064
01:26:23,044 --> 01:26:25,035
We found out last summer...

1065
01:26:25,246 --> 01:26:28,579
when uncle Alberto came here on
vacation and found you.

1066
01:26:31,186 --> 01:26:32,881
I want to help you,

1067
01:26:33,688 --> 01:26:36,248
I want to hug you, I want to talk with
you;

1068
01:26:37,725 --> 01:26:40,819
tell you about the things I want to do
and have you help me.

1069
01:26:42,430 --> 01:26:44,523
I know you went through terrible
things.

1070
01:26:50,505 --> 01:26:53,303
I promise Ill never ask about that.

1071
01:26:54,409 --> 01:26:57,401
I only care about what we can do from
now on.

1072
01:26:58,112 --> 01:26:59,511
Mum still loves you.

1073
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:01,973
She never stopped loving you.

1074
01:27:04,986 --> 01:27:07,045
She also needs to hug you.

1075
01:27:08,122 --> 01:27:11,285
And I think that together with Beba we
could give you a family.

1076
01:27:13,795 --> 01:27:15,387
Please, Dad, believe us,

1077
01:27:16,497 --> 01:27:17,987
Let us be with you.

1078
01:27:19,534 --> 01:27:20,967
I love you very much,

1079
01:27:21,836 --> 01:27:23,463
and I feel very close to you.

1080
01:27:25,139 --> 01:27:26,766
Hugs and kisses,

1081
01:27:27,942 --> 01:27:29,341
Sonia.

1082
01:27:31,942 --> 01:28:33,341
