1
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,039
If you want any tickets,

2
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,637
you'll have to go round
to the front of...

3
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,268
Well, I suppose it'll be alright.

4
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,396
What the hell am I doing around here?

5
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,313
They walk in here and...

6
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,114
Let's see. I hope I got...

7
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,109
Three?

8
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,711
That'll be seven dollars...

9
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,992
...and 50 cents.

10
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,277
No.

11
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,398
Frank?

12
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,032
Frank sent us.

13
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,280
Did you bring a horse for me?

14
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,559
Well, looks like we're...

15
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,070
Looks like we're shy of one horse.

16
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,917
You brought two too many.

17
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,516
Pa!

18
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,557
Look!

19
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,675
That's enough for now.
It's getting late. Come on home.

20
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,992
Timmy.

21
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,231
Maureen, look.

22
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,353
What you doing there?

23
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,351
Go inside, quick, and get washed.

24
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,954
And don't touch the apple pie
or the roast.

25
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,476
Patrick's already left
for the station.

26
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,278
He's getting ready, Pa.

27
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,590
- Damn it, Patrick!
- Coming, Pa.

28
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,992
Not bad, I'd say.

29
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,593
Bigger, them slices. What the hell?
We're throwing a party, ain't we?

30
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,149
But these are
the same slices as usual.

31
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,556
Yeah, sure.

32
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,239
As usual.

33
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,031
Maureen.

34
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:32,759
Soon, you can cut the bread in slices
as big as a door if you want to.

35
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,276
You'll have beautiful new clothes

36
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,954
and you won't have to work no more.

37
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,429
We're going to get rich, Pa?

38
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,796
Who knows?

39
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,031
Patrick!

40
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,156
Wait a minute!

41
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,753
Look at the filth on your boots.
Clean 'em.

42
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,269
The train'll come in and there
won't be no one to meet your mother.

43
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,158
Our mother died six years ago.

44
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,196
Go now, or you'll really be late.

45
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,192
Just a minute. Listen, Pa.
How will I recognise her?

46
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,351
You can't make no mistake, Patrick.

47
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:36,152
She's young and she's pretty
and she's a lady.

48
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,957
''For travelling,
I'll be wearing a black dress

49
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:49,151
and the same straw hat
that I was wearing when we met.''

50
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,438
I'm gonna get
some fresh water from the well.

51
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,393
Oh, Danny boy

52
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,473
The pipes, the pipes are calling

53
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,552
And down the mountain side

54
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,278
The summer's gone

55
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,630
And all the roses fall...

56
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,237
Maureen!

57
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,713
What are we gonna do with this one,
Frank?

58
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,033
Now that you've called me by name...

59
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,357
- I saw some fine stock down south.
- That so?

60
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,832
And the prices are good.

61
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,315
- These your valises, ma'am?
- Yes.

62
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,471
- Come, Sarah.
- Bring them other two.

63
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,358
We'll tote 'em for you, ma'am.

64
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,710
Is that true?
The sawmill needs hands?

65
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,553
- Was yesterday.
- Why didn't you tell your brother?

66
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,154
- Hiya, Gramps.
- Hiya, Bill. We're back again.

67
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,151
Come on. Get a move on, will you?

68
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,512
Get the lead out of your asses,
you redskin warriors.

69
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,830
I got a whole train to unload.

70
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,878
Alright,
chuck down those feed sacks first.

71
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,270
Come on!

72
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,114
What's the name
of the place you wanted to go?

73
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,554
Sweetwater.

74
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,358
Brett McBain's farm.

75
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,989
McBain? Yeah, sure.

76
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,355
That stubborn redheaded Irishman,

77
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,910
tilling sand for years
out in the middle of nowhere.

78
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,072
Sweetwater! Only a loony like him

79
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,915
could call that stinking piece
of desert Sweetwater.

80
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,798
Sweetwater!

81
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,588
A little more to the right.

82
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,910
Higher.

83
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,469
Hold it there.

84
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,592
Here they are.
Even got here with their damn rails.

85
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,548
They caught up with us again,
eh, Lafayette? Let's go!

86
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,188
Slow down.
What's the matter with you?

87
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,598
Watch out down there!

88
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,715
Slow down!

89
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,230
Why are we stopping?
I told you I was in a hurry.

90
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,516
Don't the train stop?

91
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,552
What can I do for you, ma'am?

92
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,280
I would like some water,
if it's no trouble.

93
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,797
Water? That word is poison
around these parts

94
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,030
ever since the days
of the great flood.

95
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,112
- You mean you never wash?
- We sure do!

96
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,078
I'd like to use the same facilities
you people do.

97
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,437
You sure can. Just happen
to have a full tub at the back.

98
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,479
You're lucky. Only three people
have used it this morning.

99
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,200
Used it one at a time
or all together?

100
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,035
I can tell
you're accustomed to fine living.

101
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,192
Bet you come from
one of those big eastern cities.

102
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,794
- New Orleans.
- New Orleans!

103
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,757
- You've been there?
- No.

104
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,309
But I got a cousin down there.
She runs a bar.

105
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,596
You know, she...

106
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,553
Jug.

107
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:14,158
Do you only know how to play
or do you know how to shoot?

108
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,638
Do you know
how to blow music from that?

109
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,834
Pick it up.

110
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,077
You!

111
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,196
You don't know how to play.

112
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,118
Try this one.

113
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:57,950
Take it.

114
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,351
Go on.

115
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,993
Here.

116
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,514
Bravo.

117
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,917
Cheyenne.
We thought we'd never make it.

118
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,799
It's alright. You're right on time.

119
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,432
To bury my escort.

120
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,236
If I'd waited for you,
I'd be in jail by now.

121
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,039
The gun.

122
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,116
You interested in fashions,
Harmonica?

123
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,234
I saw three of these dusters
a short time ago.

124
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,391
They were waiting for a train.

125
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,552
Inside the dusters,
there were three men.

126
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,069
So?

127
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:07,078
Inside the men,
there were three bullets.

128
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,477
That's a crazy story, Harmonica.

129
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,516
For two reasons.

130
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,148
One, nobody around these parts

131
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,517
got the guts to wear those dusters
except Cheyenne's, man.

132
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:36,393
Two, Cheyenne's, man,
don't get killed.

133
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,437
That surprise you?

134
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,272
Yeah.

135
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,350
Well, you know music.

136
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:54,479
And you can count.
All the way up to two.

137
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,398
All the way up to six, if I have to.

138
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,116
And maybe faster than you.

139
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,958
Yeah, go on.

140
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,190
Play, Harmonica.

141
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:28,033
Play, so you can't bullshit.

142
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,953
Only, watch those false notes.

143
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,319
Like so?

144
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:58,915
This cousin of mine keeps writing me
to come down to New Orleans.

145
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,629
''Come on down. Help me with the bar.
Make a pile of money.''

146
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,473
I don't think
I'd get along in a big city.

147
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,915
It's too full
of fast men and loose women.

148
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,514
Begging your pardon, ma'am. No.

149
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,592
Now, I'm too used to
a quiet simple country life.

150
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,632
He's Timmy.

151
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,630
Yes.

152
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,756
Dear God.

153
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,957
On the day...

154
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:54,117
On the very day of your wedding.

155
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,191
Poor little miss.

156
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,037
Mrs.

157
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,878
Mrs McBain.

158
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,873
But we all... We thought...

159
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,159
I know.

160
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:12,233
It was to be a surprise today.

161
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,630
Brett McBain and I were married.

162
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,836
A month ago.

163
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,673
In New Orleans.

164
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,196
I am the resurrection and the life.

165
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:40,750
He who believeth in me, though
he were dead, yet shall he live.

166
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:44,993
Whosoever liveth and believeth in me
shall never die. Amen.

167
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,159
- Mr Bennett!
- What's he doing here?

168
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,635
I found this collar
on a nail by the door.

169
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,589
You got no way of knowing,
but this is as good as a signature.

170
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,671
Cheyenne's hand.

171
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:23,669
- But why?
- Don't worry, Mrs McBain.

172
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,195
We'll make 'em tell us
before we hang 'em.

173
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,472
Let's get moving.

174
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:51,993
Come on.
Let's go back to Flagstone.

175
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,750
No, Sam.

176
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,230
You go back.

177
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,756
You don't want
to stay out here alone.

178
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,153
Why not?

179
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,038
This is my home.

180
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:58,959
You know, Wobbles...

181
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,428
...I'm kinda mad at you.

182
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,471
Frank wasn't there.

183
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:12,229
He sent three friends.

184
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,914
I don't know nothing, I swear.

185
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:19,392
I only arranged the meeting
the way you wanted it.

186
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:22,711
I don't know why Frank wasn't there.

187
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,316
- I swear to you that I...
- Cos he was at the McBains'.

188
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,679
That's not true.
Cheyenne did that job.

189
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,479
Everyone knows that. We got proof.

190
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,599
That was always one
of Frank's tricks. Faking evidence.

191
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:41,433
I don't know. I swear.

192
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:45,718
I only arranged the meeting. I swear.

193
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,189
I don't know nothing.

194
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,477
Who's there?

195
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:12,879
Did you make coffee?

196
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,353
Make it.

197
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,831
Didn't sleep a wink.

198
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,152
A pack of turds dressed in black
rode herd on me the whole damn night.

199
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,111
Yeah, but I left them
in the middle of the desert.

200
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:41,511
If they're lucky,
they'll be home in three days.

201
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:02,356
I'll do it. You fetch the coffee.

202
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:12,516
They want to hang me,
the big black crows.

203
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,871
Idiots.

204
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,712
What the hell?

205
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:20,678
I'll kill anything, but never a kid.

206
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,869
Be like killing a priest.

207
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:26,315
A Catholic priest, that is.

208
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:30,231
Yeah, the world is full of people
who hate Cheyenne.

209
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:48,634
See, I ain't
the mean bastard people make out.

210
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:57,069
Of course, if somebody
had a mind to kill me...

211
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,356
...it fires me up.

212
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,829
And a fired-up Cheyenne...

213
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,789
...ain't a nice thing to see.

214
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,996
Especially for a lady.

215
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:27,273
But you're too smart to make him mad.

216
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:35,793
So this here's where I was
supposed to do all the killing?

217
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,191
Yeah.

218
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,839
Don't seem the place is worth a shit.

219
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:53,117
Now, if somebody gets dressed up
to look like me...

220
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,438
...so they can hang this thing
around my neck...

221
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,551
...I don't like it none.

222
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:05,711
But I can understand it.

223
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:14,512
What I don't understand is why.

224
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,118
Neither do I.

225
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:24,876
But I see you looked a lot
for the why.

226
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,394
Yeah.

227
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:38,995
What if there were
a whole heap of whys?

228
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:43,196
Round. Yellow.

229
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,751
You know the kind.

230
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,836
You rap 'em on a stone...

231
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,270
...and they go ''ding''.

232
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:53,509
Maybe.

233
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,070
But I didn't find them.

234
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,512
By the way,

235
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:10,356
you know anything about a man
going around playing a harmonica?

236
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:15,000
He's somebody you'd remember.

237
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:18,508
Instead of talking, he plays.

238
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:22,033
And when he'd better play, he talks.

239
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:29,635
You know, when you've killed four,
it's easy to make it five.

240
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:36,273
Sure. You're an expert.

241
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,599
Ma'am, it seems to me
you ain't caught the idea.

242
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:51,113
Of course I have.

243
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:54,917
I'm here alone in the hands
of a bandit who smelled money.

244
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:58,550
If you want to, you can lay me
over the table and amuse yourself.

245
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,392
And even call in your men.

246
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:03,154
Well, no woman ever died from that.

247
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:07,199
When you're finished, all I'll need
will be a tub of boiling water,

248
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,476
and I'll be exactly
what I was before.

249
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:13,030
With just another filthy memory.

250
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:31,310
You make good coffee, at least.

251
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:33,359
Not bad.

252
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,556
Congratulations.

253
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:39,554
Tell me, was it necessary
that you kill all of them?

254
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:42,598
I only told you to scare them.

255
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:45,593
People scare better
when they're dying.

256
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:49,469
And can you tell me
what good was your stupid massacre?

257
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:53,199
Now, a Mrs McBain has turned up.

258
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:58,597
So, I didn't expect that.
It happens in business.

259
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:02,036
Let's say
this is something I didn't plan on.

260
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,917
I have no time for surprises, Frank.

261
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:09,550
You know that.

262
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:13,554
I got on board
in sight of the Atlantic,

263
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:16,757
and before my eyes rot,

264
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:22,153
I want to see the blue of the Pacific
outside that window.

265
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,595
I know where you got on board.

266
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:27,035
I was there, too, remember.

267
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:37,875
To remove small obstacles
from the track, you said.

268
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:40,308
Well, there were a few.

269
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:47,593
But we travelled a long way,
just the same.

270
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,239
And fast.

271
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:53,075
Even tuberculosis of the bones
travels fast.

272
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:58,509
Don't play the sick man with me,
Mr Morton.

273
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:01,797
I knew you
when you were just barely limping.

274
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:08,399
I watch that dry rot
rise a little more every day.

275
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:13,115
Any normal man'd
put a bullet in his brain.

276
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:17,114
But you,
you just got a little more hasty.

277
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,195
Otherwise you ain't changed any.

278
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:22,669
I'd say you've changed, Frank.

279
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:24,239
A lot.

280
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,876
You used to take care
of certain things personally.

281
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:33,910
Now, you're keeping
in the background.

282
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,389
You'll end up giving orders.

283
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:42,396
It's because, now, I don't want
to leave you alone too much.

284
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:48,879
You're gonna need somebody more
and more every day to stay near you.

285
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:51,554
- Like a friend.
- Or like a partner.

286
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:05,196
How does it feel
sitting behind that desk, Frank?

287
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,628
It's almost like holding a gun.

288
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:17,873
Only much more powerful.

289
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,598
You see, staying with you, I...

290
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,878
...I'm beginning to think big, too.

291
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:46,159
This McBain business...

292
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:49,596
...has given me ideas.

293
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:58,149
I'm sorry for you, Frank.

294
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:00,436
You're doing your best.

295
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,675
You'll never succeed
in becoming like me.

296
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:07,555
Why?

297
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:13,078
Because there are many things
you'll never understand.

298
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:26,229
This is one of them.

299
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,836
You see, Frank,
there are many kinds of weapons.

300
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,790
And the only one
that can stop that is this.

301
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:29,472
Now, shall we get back
to our little problem?

302
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:34,712
My weapons might look simple to you,
Mr Morton,

303
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:39,669
but they can still shoot holes
big enough for our little problems.

304
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:44,468
Pretty soon the widow McBain
won't be a problem no more.

305
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:49,833
You wake up one morning and say,
''World, I know you.''

306
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,560
''From now on,
there are no more surprises.''

307
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:55,109
And then you happen to meet
a man like this,

308
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:56,998
who looked like a good man.

309
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:59,754
Clear eyes, strong hands.

310
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,717
And he wants to marry you.

311
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:03,916
Which doesn't happen often.

312
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:06,958
And he says he's rich, too,
which doesn't hurt.

313
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:13,157
So you think,
''The hell with New Orleans.''

314
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:16,198
''Now I'll say yes
and go live in the country.''

315
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:21,829
''I wouldn't mind giving him
half a dozen kids after all.''

316
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:27,111
''Take care of a house. Do something.
What the hell? ''

317
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:40,472
Well, God rest your soul,
Brett McBain.

318
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:45,350
Even if he's going to have a job
pulling you out of the devil's grip.

319
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:02,631
Still, I swear
he'd left money around someplace.

320
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:07,234
If you can find it,
you're welcome to it.

321
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,960
Mrs McBain goes back to civilisation.

322
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:13,556
Minus a husband
and plus a great future.

323
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:27,791
You deserve better.

324
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:33,758
The last man who told me that
is buried out there.

325
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:45,269
You know, Jill,
you remind me of my mother.

326
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:51,433
She was the biggest whore
in Alameida

327
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:54,512
and the finest woman that ever lived.

328
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:58,916
Whoever my father was,
for an hour or for a month...

329
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:02,549
...he must have been a happy man.

330
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:22,271
What do you want?

331
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:28,789
Cheyenne's right. Once you've killed
four, it's easy to make it five.

332
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:44,349
This isn't the time to leave.

333
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,150
Give me some water.

334
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,116
From the well.

335
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:00,714
I like my water fresh.

336
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:26,830
When you hear a strange sound,
drop to the ground.

337
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,673
A sound? Like what?

338
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,439
Like that.

339
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:06,438
He not only plays, he can shoot, too.

340
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:40,593
Morning, Mrs McBain.

341
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:43,149
- What brings you to town?
- Good morning.

342
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:46,471
Maybe you don't remember,
but yesterday at the funeral...

343
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,471
I remember very well.

344
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:51,393
Is there something I can do for you?

345
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:54,158
Yes.

346
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:59,475
See Frank.
And tell him I know everything.

347
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:02,438
Why is everybody hounding me
about this guy Frank?

348
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:05,034
I don't know him.
I've never heard of him.

349
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:08,272
I got my own worries, and all I want
is to be left in peace.

350
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:12,433
Tell Frank I want to negotiate
with him. Personally.

351
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:08,196
You were told
not to come here for any reason.

352
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:11,955
Whatever business you have with
Frank, keep it far away from here.

353
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:15,556
I know, but when I heard that woman
say she knew everything,

354
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:18,792
I thought I should come over here
and tell you about it.

355
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,871
You never thought it wasn't a trick?

356
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:23,270
Sure, but you know
I'm mighty careful.

357
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,476
No one could have followed me.

358
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:28,359
That's the first thing I learned,
working for you.

359
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,829
To listen unseen
and to watch unheard.

360
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:35,073
You should learn
to live as if you didn't exist.

361
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:37,435
You've known me a long time, Frank.

362
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,431
You know you can trust me.

363
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,158
Wobbles.

364
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:49,272
How can you trust a man who wears
both a belt and suspenders?

365
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:52,799
The man
can't even trust his own pants.

366
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,559
Let's get out of here.

367
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:40,952
The end of the line.

368
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:44,870
Yeah.

369
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:51,919
Get him on board.

370
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:07,837
Tie him up.

371
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:42,033
Wait, Frank.

372
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:43,599
I didn't...

373
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:45,159
So, nobody followed you?

374
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:47,955
No. You gotta believe me.

375
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:51,520
So, this is the way I can trust you.

376
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:54,319
I can explain.
I didn't know that he...

377
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:57,595
- Get out.
- No, Frank.

378
01:21:58,360 --> 01:21:59,873
Get out.

379
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:20,316
Frank, wait!

380
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:43,872
I told you to keep quiet.

381
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:50,399
Did Logan and Jim
take care of the woman?

382
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:52,630
Someone took care of them.

383
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,109
We found them out at McBain's place.

384
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:58,113
Stone dead.
And the woman was gone.

385
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:01,795
Your friends
have a high mortality rate, Frank.

386
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:15,189
First three, then two.

387
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:29,354
So you're the one
who makes appointments.

388
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:33,553
And you're the one
who doesn't keep 'em.

389
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:37,195
What do you want?

390
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:40,351
Who are you?

391
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:44,433
Dave Jenkins.

392
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:54,755
Dave Jenkins is dead a long time ago.

393
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:57,792
Calder Benson.

394
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,830
What's your name?
Benson's dead, too.

395
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:05,751
You ought to know better than anyone.

396
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:07,273
You killed 'em.

397
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:08,830
Who are you?

398
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,116
- Who are you, you...
- Frank!

399
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:15,596
The woman.

400
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:19,754
We're only losing time.

401
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:28,511
Alright. This time,
I'll take care of her personally.

402
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:31,035
Yeah, it ought to be easy for you.

403
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:37,751
Keep him warm for me.

404
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:40,195
If he gives you any trouble, hit him.

405
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:44,558
Not in the mouth.
He's got to talk. And plenty.

406
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:51,869
Meet me at the Navajo cliff.

407
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:54,793
Keep an eye
on that cripple all the time.

408
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:56,393
Sure, Frank.

409
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:26,955
- See anyone?
- No.

410
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:48,192
There he is.

411
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:26,515
You only know how to shoot?

412
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:30,511
Or do you know how to cut, too?

413
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:43,995
You.

414
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:46,478
Wait a minute.

415
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:50,232
Let's have a good look at you.

416
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:03,112
Mr Choo-Choo.

417
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:24,150
It's easy to find you. Bastard.

418
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:26,470
I don't have to kill you now.

419
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:28,870
You leave a slime behind you
like a snail.

420
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:32,919
Two beautiful shiny rails.

421
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,033
There's another bastard.

422
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:38,029
And he's getting further away
every minute.

423
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:52,998
There it is.
What your husband ordered from me.

424
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:57,039
And seeing as how he paid cash,
it all belongs to you.

425
01:30:57,200 --> 01:31:00,272
Oak planks, beech, pine.

426
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:02,351
All first-grade lumber.

427
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:05,034
And there's beams
and foundation pylons.

428
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:09,079
Ten kegs of nails, 20 barrels of tar,
and all these tools.

429
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:11,515
Maybe he wanted
to enlarge the farmhouse.

430
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:13,477
Enlarge the farmhouse?

431
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:16,677
He could have built
at least eight of them.

432
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:18,592
By the way, ma'am,

433
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:22,116
McBain also ordered this.
Said it was important.

434
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:26,671
Only it seems he forgot to tell
me what he wanted printed on it.

435
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:34,999
Station.

436
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,115
How's that again?

437
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:39,748
I said print ''station''.

438
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:12,311
Looking for this?

439
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:15,313
I've had enough
of your butcher tactics.

440
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:17,710
I know that woman is here.

441
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:20,519
I don't want
any more useless killing.

442
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:23,638
I'm ready to make a deal
for that land.

443
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:25,791
To pay what's necessary.

444
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:28,235
I don't want to waste any more time.

445
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:31,316
You've made a big mistake, Morton.

446
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:39,073
When you're not on that train, you
look like a turtle out of its shell.

447
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:41,518
Just funny.

448
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:45,673
Poor cripple talking big
so nobody'll know how scared you are.

449
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:47,558
I'm here to make a deal, Frank.

450
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:52,909
I don't have time
to compete with you.

451
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:00,112
Compete?

452
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:08,360
Why, you... You can't even
stand on your own feet by yourself.

453
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:21,114
Is that sufficient
to make you feel stronger?

454
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:25,032
I could squash you
like a wormy apple.

455
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:29,672
Sure, but you won't do it.

456
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:33,557
Because it's not to your advantage.

457
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:43,593
Who knows how far you'd have gone
with two good legs.

458
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:54,790
Help him back to the train.
Keep your eye on him.

459
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:59,919
Morton.
Don't worry about the land.

460
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:02,389
If you feel like paying for it,
you can pay.

461
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:06,075
It won't make any difference to you,
dealing with the new owner.

462
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:34,393
Cheyenne!

463
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:37,597
There's a square staked out here.
It says ''water tank''.

464
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:41,719
Over here, too.
Only, it says ''post office''.

465
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:43,757
And this one says ''corral''.

466
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:46,115
And this here ''church''.

467
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:49,109
What the hell is this?

468
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:50,508
Can't you see?

469
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:53,034
It's a station.

470
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:56,679
And all around it, a town.

471
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:01,110
Brett McBain's town.

472
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:05,828
Was he crazy!

473
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,195
Yeah, in a very special way.

474
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:12,116
An Irishman.

475
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:17,956
He knew that railroad coming through
Flagstone would continue on west.

476
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:20,759
So he looked over
all this country out here

477
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:23,354
until he found this hunk of desert.

478
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:26,157
Nobody wanted it.

479
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:31,229
But he bought it.

480
01:35:33,880 --> 01:35:38,158
Then he tightened his belt,
and for years, he waited.

481
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:41,551
Waited for what?

482
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:45,554
For the railroad to reach this point.

483
01:35:45,720 --> 01:35:50,874
But how could he be sure the railroad
would pass through his property?

484
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:55,193
Them steam engines
can't roll without water.

485
01:35:55,360 --> 01:36:00,434
And the only water for 50 miles
west of Flagstone is right here.

486
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:01,669
Under this land.

487
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:05,917
He was no fool, our dead friend.

488
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:10,358
He was going to sell this piece
of desert for its weight in gold.

489
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:13,833
You don't sell
the dream of a lifetime.

490
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:17,795
Brett McBain wanted his station.

491
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:22,310
He got the rights to build it.

492
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:27,318
- How do you know all this?
- I saw a document.

493
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:30,392
It was all in order.
Seals, signatures, everything.

494
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:32,828
One thing, though.

495
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:37,232
In very small print,
there is a short clause,

496
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:41,075
which says that McBain or his heirs
lose all rights

497
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:44,391
if, by the time
the railroad reaches this point...

498
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:47,636
...the station ain't built yet.

499
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:58,273
Speaking of railroads,
I noticed the rail gang's already...

500
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:05,355
I noticed the rail gang's
already behind those hills.

501
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:10,116
And before you know it,
they're gonna be here.

502
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:11,474
Yeah.

503
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:12,914
Yeah.

504
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,513
Listen.

505
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:17,599
Harmonica.

506
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:21,632
A town built around the railroad.

507
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:25,510
You could make a fortune.

508
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:29,233
Hundreds of thousands of dollars.

509
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:32,311
More than that.

510
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:35,835
Thousands of thousands.

511
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:38,955
They call them millions.

512
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:41,718
Millions?

513
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:46,630
- Yeah, millions.
- Yeah.

514
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:51,396
I always thought it'd be easier
to make a deal with a smart lady.

515
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:53,915
All you gotta do is...

516
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,151
What in the hell
are you standing around for?

517
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:01,751
Chief, what are we supposed to do?

518
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:03,990
What are you supposed to do?

519
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:06,515
Build a station, idiots!

520
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:11,589
I figure
it ain't gonna look like much.

521
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:19,232
But it'll be the first thing she sees
when she gets back.

522
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:22,156
If she gets back.

523
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:40,072
I think...

524
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,513
Yeah.

525
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:54,314
I'm beginning to think I might be
a little sorry killing you.

526
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:58,913
You like being alive.

527
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:14,711
You also like
to feel a man's hands all over you.

528
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:18,511
You like it.

529
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:25,590
Even if they're the hands of the man
who killed your husband.

530
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,116
What a...

531
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:51,796
What a little tramp.

532
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:58,557
Is there anything in the world
you wouldn't do to save your skin?

533
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:04,030
Nothing, Frank.

534
01:41:26,360 --> 01:41:29,158
Now I understand
why they miss you so much...

535
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:34,155
...down there in New Orleans.

536
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:39,195
Great invention, the telegraph.

537
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:45,319
''Jill? The brunette? ''

538
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:49,953
''The customers of the most elegant
whorehouse on Bourbon Street

539
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:53,078
have been weeping
ever since she left.''

540
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:57,351
Say, tell me.

541
01:41:58,360 --> 01:42:00,316
Did old McBain know?

542
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:02,951
Yeah.

543
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:05,315
Yeah, I bet he did.

544
01:42:05,480 --> 01:42:08,392
He was just the type
to marry a whore.

545
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:15,910
It's an idea.

546
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:19,711
I could marry you.

547
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:23,075
And the land would become mine.

548
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:25,637
And maybe...

549
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:30,109
...you'd make a perfect wife.

550
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:37,156
It would be me who wouldn't be
any good as a husband.

551
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:40,598
Too bad.

552
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:44,070
We'll have to think
of another solution.

553
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:45,753
Simpler.

554
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:52,391
Quicker.

555
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:14,875
As sheriff of this county,

556
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:18,157
I've been asked to preside
over the sale by auction

557
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:22,598
of all property belonging to
Mrs Jill McBain, here present.

558
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:26,477
This parcel of land
measures 320 acres.

559
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:30,713
It's free of all encumbrances,
liens and mortgages.

560
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:33,631
This property and all it contains,

561
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:35,995
lock, stock and barrel,

562
01:43:36,160 --> 01:43:39,470
will be turned over to the lucky
purchaser at the time of sale.

563
01:43:39,640 --> 01:43:42,108
All the contents therein
are listed by number

564
01:43:42,280 --> 01:43:45,078
on the inventory sheet
distributed among you.

565
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:48,949
The entire property will be sold
in block to the highest bidder.

566
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:51,918
Alright. That's clear to everybody.

567
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:53,798
I declare the auction open.

568
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:56,633
Now, who's going to make
the first bid?

569
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:05,153
A list of all the items.
Some of them are worth money.

570
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:09,596
Alright. Now,
who's going to make the first bid?

571
01:44:13,720 --> 01:44:15,836
$200.

572
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,355
Well, I have an opening bid of $200.

573
01:44:19,120 --> 01:44:22,192
$200. Do I hear more?

574
01:44:22,360 --> 01:44:26,273
That stinking piece of land
ain't worth it.

575
01:44:26,440 --> 01:44:29,273
Come on, my friends, $200.

576
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:32,398
The livestock alone
is worth twice that much.

577
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:35,478
Well...

578
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:38,550
Who's going to bid $300?

579
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:47,236
Now, look, friends, I realise
we're not offering California here,

580
01:44:47,400 --> 01:44:50,472
but 200 is damn little
for all that property.

581
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:54,519
Ladies and gentlemen, I wouldn't
even take 200 as a deposit.

582
01:44:57,680 --> 01:45:00,831
Well, nobody's going to bid it up.

583
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:11,278
You're sure you wouldn't want
to set a minimum price?

584
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:15,796
I wish I were wrong, Mrs McBain,

585
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:19,953
but you're liable to end up selling
the place for a plate of beans.

586
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:27,511
All I want is to sell.

587
01:46:32,240 --> 01:46:35,471
- You're fat.
- If you say so.

588
01:46:35,640 --> 01:46:37,232
- How many?
- One card.

589
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:41,510
One for me.

590
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:45,717
Dealer takes three.

591
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,072
Can I take a hand?

592
01:47:04,120 --> 01:47:05,553
15.

593
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:20,428
Yeah, sit down.

594
01:47:43,240 --> 01:47:44,992
I'll deal.

595
01:49:24,920 --> 01:49:27,514
How do you...

596
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:30,399
How do you play this game,
Mr Morton?

597
01:49:32,640 --> 01:49:34,756
It's very simple.

598
01:49:35,680 --> 01:49:40,310
As long as you use your head,
you never lose.

599
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:43,633
$500.

600
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:49,910
$500.

601
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:53,196
Do I hear any other bids?

602
01:49:55,200 --> 01:49:57,555
I don't think so.

603
01:50:06,240 --> 01:50:07,468
I'm sorry, Mrs McBain,

604
01:50:07,640 --> 01:50:12,316
but I think I'm gonna have to
knock down on that last bid.

605
01:50:23,120 --> 01:50:25,429
$500 once.

606
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:30,360
$500 twice.

607
01:50:32,840 --> 01:50:34,831
- $500...
- $5,000.

608
01:50:57,640 --> 01:51:02,668
- You said $5,000?
- It's on its way.

609
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:17,273
It's Cheyenne!

610
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:28,671
The reward for this man
is $5,000, that's right?

611
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:33,311
Judas was content with $4,970 less.

612
01:51:33,480 --> 01:51:35,835
There were no dollars in them days.

613
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:40,149
But sons of bitches, yeah.

614
01:51:53,960 --> 01:51:56,110
Wait a minute.

615
01:51:57,760 --> 01:52:00,832
- The jail's that way.
- Yeah, I know.

616
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:04,356
Yeah, but you're going
to the railroad station.

617
01:52:05,080 --> 01:52:07,640
I'm sending you to Yuma, Cheyenne.

618
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:09,677
They got a modern jail there.

619
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:14,436
It's got more walls, more bars,
more guards.

620
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:18,388
You'll like it, in 20 years.
You'll see.

621
01:53:17,480 --> 01:53:20,711
Two tickets, amigo,
to the next station.

622
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:22,871
One way only.

623
01:53:24,760 --> 01:53:27,558
Here's to you. And congratulations.

624
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:34,316
You got yourself a good deal.

625
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:36,954
The auction.

626
01:53:38,040 --> 01:53:41,237
Forget it. I don't invest in land.

627
01:53:43,320 --> 01:53:47,711
You don't look at all like the noble
defender of poor defenceless widows.

628
01:53:49,720 --> 01:53:51,551
But then again...

629
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:57,711
...I don't look
like a poor defenceless widow.

630
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,798
Cheyenne's right.
You're a remarkable woman.

631
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:10,035
And you're a remarkable man.

632
01:54:10,200 --> 01:54:12,714
But you have something on your mind.

633
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:21,639
Have you got something
on your mind?

634
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:27,795
Hot water.
A bathtub full of hot water.

635
01:54:45,720 --> 01:54:48,439
I think it's time
I filled that bathtub.

636
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:20,517
Who are you?

637
01:55:40,120 --> 01:55:42,270
Jim Cooper.

638
01:55:42,440 --> 01:55:44,032
Chuck Youngblood.

639
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:46,678
More dead men.

640
01:55:50,040 --> 01:55:52,713
They were all alive
until they met you, Frank.

641
01:55:58,840 --> 01:56:02,310
You paid $5,000
for something that belongs to me.

642
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:09,110
5,000...

643
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:15,190
...plus one.

644
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,150
You've got a right
to make a profit, too.

645
01:56:47,840 --> 01:56:50,991
I wouldn't take too long
thinking about it, if I were you.

646
01:56:55,200 --> 01:56:58,033
You got yourself
into something bigger than you.

647
01:56:58,200 --> 01:57:00,919
You got a chance to get out easy.
You better take it.

648
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:04,117
You sound like a real businessman,
Frank.

649
01:57:04,280 --> 01:57:07,272
Being with Mr Morton's
done you a lot of good.

650
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:17,794
And you've learned
some new methods.

651
01:57:19,040 --> 01:57:21,679
Yeah, Mr Morton
has shown you a lot of new ways.

652
01:57:26,280 --> 01:57:28,748
Even though
you haven't given up the old ones.

653
01:57:30,200 --> 01:57:33,112
Pick any method you like.
Just make the deal.

654
01:57:35,520 --> 01:57:37,033
Which deal, Frank?

655
01:57:39,640 --> 01:57:41,790
We have more than one, you and me.

656
01:57:45,560 --> 01:57:50,680
We can lump them together
into one bundle, settle all of them.

657
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:52,956
Here and now.

658
01:57:55,040 --> 01:57:56,632
Easy, Frank.

659
01:57:57,240 --> 01:57:58,673
Easy.

660
01:57:59,360 --> 01:58:01,430
You gotta learn not to push things.

661
01:58:01,600 --> 01:58:04,592
Taking it easy is the first thing
a businessman should do.

662
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:11,230
I got an idea
Mr Morton can teach you a lot more.

663
01:58:15,680 --> 01:58:17,272
How much?

664
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:18,989
One dollar.

665
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:23,353
Giddy up!

666
02:00:53,880 --> 02:00:55,154
Giddy up!

667
02:01:56,400 --> 02:01:59,358
I'd swear we're going to have
that strange sound.

668
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:00,350
Right now.

669
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:50,591
Time sure flies.

670
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:54,195
It's already past 12.

671
02:04:50,600 --> 02:04:52,795
But they were his men.

672
02:04:52,960 --> 02:04:55,190
- Yeah.
- And they tried to kill him.

673
02:04:55,360 --> 02:04:57,476
They found somebody
who pays better.

674
02:04:57,640 --> 02:05:01,155
And you! You saved his life.

675
02:05:03,280 --> 02:05:06,113
I didn't let them kill him.
That's not the same thing.

676
02:05:18,640 --> 02:05:20,596
Sure.

677
02:05:20,760 --> 02:05:22,990
It's not the same thing.

678
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:31,478
You get dressed.

679
02:05:31,640 --> 02:05:32,789
It's time to go home.

680
02:10:39,800 --> 02:10:41,233
Did you make coffee?

681
02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:44,836
This time I did.

682
02:11:22,880 --> 02:11:24,996
Good.

683
02:11:26,840 --> 02:11:29,752
My mother
used to make coffee this way.

684
02:11:30,640 --> 02:11:34,997
Hot, strong and good.

685
02:11:44,200 --> 02:11:45,792
Cheyenne.

686
02:11:47,960 --> 02:11:50,110
What's he waiting for out there?

687
02:11:52,720 --> 02:11:53,630
What's he doing?

688
02:11:59,520 --> 02:12:01,636
He's whittling on a piece of wood.

689
02:12:04,040 --> 02:12:07,112
I got a feeling
when he stops whittling...

690
02:12:08,400 --> 02:12:10,356
...something's gonna happen.

691
02:13:16,080 --> 02:13:17,798
Surprised to see me here?

692
02:13:19,800 --> 02:13:21,711
I knew you'd come.

693
02:13:44,280 --> 02:13:47,078
Morton once told me
I could never be like him.

694
02:13:48,440 --> 02:13:50,556
Now I understand why.

695
02:13:52,360 --> 02:13:56,433
Wouldn't have bothered him, knowing
you were around somewhere alive.

696
02:13:57,680 --> 02:14:01,309
So you found out
you're not a businessman after all?

697
02:14:01,480 --> 02:14:03,471
Just a man.

698
02:14:04,840 --> 02:14:06,956
An ancient race.

699
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:17,156
Other Mortons will be along
and they'll kill it off.

700
02:14:17,320 --> 02:14:19,311
The future don't matter to us.

701
02:14:19,480 --> 02:14:20,959
Nothing matters now.

702
02:14:21,120 --> 02:14:24,271
Not the land,
not the money, not the woman.

703
02:14:24,920 --> 02:14:26,831
I came here to see you.

704
02:14:29,080 --> 02:14:32,038
Cos I know that now
you'll tell me what you're after.

705
02:14:46,640 --> 02:14:49,313
Only at the point of dying.

706
02:14:52,120 --> 02:14:54,111
I know.

707
02:15:36,040 --> 02:15:39,476
I heated some water for you.
I also found a razor.

708
02:15:40,520 --> 02:15:42,431
Put it there, please.

709
02:15:45,080 --> 02:15:48,516
So I can watch the railroad move up
while I shave.

710
02:15:54,480 --> 02:15:55,754
You know what?

711
02:15:57,480 --> 02:16:01,234
If I was you, I'd go down there
and give those boys a drink.

712
02:16:09,520 --> 02:16:12,239
You can't imagine

713
02:16:12,400 --> 02:16:15,949
how happy it makes a man
to see a woman like you.

714
02:16:17,720 --> 02:16:19,870
Just to look at her.

715
02:16:22,960 --> 02:16:26,475
And if one of them
should pat your behind...

716
02:16:28,040 --> 02:16:30,554
...just make believe it's nothing.

717
02:16:33,160 --> 02:16:35,196
They earned it.

718
02:20:57,920 --> 02:21:00,070
Keep your loving brother happy.

719
02:24:11,200 --> 02:24:13,077
Who are you?

720
02:25:20,280 --> 02:25:21,872
You're sort of a handsome man.

721
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:26,877
But I'm not the right man.

722
02:25:39,320 --> 02:25:41,072
And neither is he.

723
02:25:43,640 --> 02:25:45,517
Maybe not.

724
02:25:45,680 --> 02:25:47,636
But it doesn't matter.

725
02:25:51,120 --> 02:25:53,759
You don't understand, Jill.

726
02:25:54,400 --> 02:25:57,119
People like that
have something inside.

727
02:25:59,720 --> 02:26:01,790
Something to do with death.

728
02:26:05,640 --> 02:26:09,519
If that fella lives,
he'll come in through that door,

729
02:26:09,680 --> 02:26:12,638
pick up his gear and say adis.

730
02:26:17,880 --> 02:26:20,952
It would be nice
to see this town grow.

731
02:27:48,480 --> 02:27:50,675
Now I gotta go.

732
02:28:34,200 --> 02:28:37,317
Gonna be a beautiful town,
Sweetwater.

733
02:28:42,120 --> 02:28:44,315
I hope you'll come back someday.

734
02:29:01,400 --> 02:29:03,118
Someday.

735
02:29:14,440 --> 02:29:17,910
Yeah. I gotta go, too.

736
02:29:43,080 --> 02:29:45,036
Make believe it's nothing.

737
02:31:45,520 --> 02:31:47,431
Sorry, Harmonica.

738
02:31:47,600 --> 02:31:49,431
I gotta stay here.

739
02:32:26,160 --> 02:32:27,513
Who?

740
02:32:30,720 --> 02:32:33,154
I ran into Mr Choo-Choo.

741
02:32:34,040 --> 02:32:37,237
I didn't count on
that half-man from the train.

742
02:32:38,120 --> 02:32:39,917
He got scared.

743
02:32:57,520 --> 02:32:59,351
Harmonica.

744
02:33:00,320 --> 02:33:02,231
When they do you in,

745
02:33:02,400 --> 02:33:05,153
pray it's somebody
who knows where to shoot.

746
02:33:20,240 --> 02:33:21,309
Go away.

747
02:33:23,680 --> 02:33:25,989
Go away.

748
02:33:26,160 --> 02:33:28,993
Go away.
I don't want you to see me die.
