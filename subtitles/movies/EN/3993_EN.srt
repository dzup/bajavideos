The King Of Death

1
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,395
That which kills me, will remain my secret
(F. Lacenaire)

2
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,238
Monday

3
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,835
Hello, the personnel department
please!

4
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,833
Hello, my name is Barsch.

5
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,469
I wanted to inform you that I will quit my job
on the ïst of next month

6
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,998
Yes, but I have personal
reasons

7
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,750
Actually, I would like to take my unused
holiday. Is this possible?

8
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:37,235
Good, I will send you my written notice
tomorrow.

9
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,675
No, I took those already with me last week,
thanks.

10
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,078
Tuesday

11
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,711
Only one today?

12
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,678
Yes, I'll have to go to Uschis Birthday Party
Later on

13
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,269
Say hello from me

14
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,390
Jesus, I think he killed himself.

15
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,313
Who? Let me see

16
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,389
Bullshit! I don t believe this...

17
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,633
The guy is nuts anyway...

18
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,593
OK, here you go
6 marks.

19
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,429
Bye!

20
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,993
The story you are about to see is true
It is based on actual facts.

21
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,389
Vera - Gestapo's angel of Death

22
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:19,435
What are you doing here already?
Tell me!

23
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,957
Thought you would be at Uschi's birthday party...

24
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,153
Could you explain why
you are here already?

25
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,879
Wednesday

26
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,112
I love my wife very much

27
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:38,475
But a few months ago she started to bleed strongly
When we were,, Doing it"

28
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:47,157
I told her to see a doctor
But nothing changed.

29
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:53,518
He said, there is nothing wrong with her.
That idiot.

30
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:01,669
My wife always told me that I don't
have to worry about it.

31
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:10,392
But you know... people who say that
things like that often have mental problems.

32
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,640
Do YOU think this is normal?
Or not?

33
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,752
We tried to figure something out...

34
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,716
tried to be very careful...

35
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:30,597
But everytime I thought it got better,
she started bleeding again...

36
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,274
...like a slaughtered pig.

37
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:46,593
I guess, I didn't always have enough time for her...
Working six days a week...

38
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,591
Sometimes even longer...
All for us.

39
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:57,469
And the only thing I could think of during work,
was our,, problem".

40
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:04,592
But I never really could come up with something.

41
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,152
I was mentally blocked.

42
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,749
I never had problems...
with women and...

43
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:21,750
My wife seemed not to be as concerned
as I was.

44
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,798
Sometimes I was not sure who was ill...
her or me.

45
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,996
And on top of this... her
understanding comments:

46
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:47,037
,, No, it is not your fault...,,
,, No, I am not depressed"

47
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,588
,, I enjoy the time we have together"

48
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,633
Slowly I became tired
of all this...

49
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,039
...it made me agressive.

50
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,638
And when she tried to calm me down,
I became even more angry

51
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,994
I couldn't stand her kindness
any longer.

52
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,158
Do you understand?

53
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:22,388
I always tried to be a good lover.
Never just used her.

54
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,952
Why am I punished with her problem?

55
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,798
It did not make sense to me...
Am I right?

56
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,630
Yesterday was our
wedding anniversary.

57
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,472
And we wanted to do
something special.

58
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,837
I took a day off... even at this
Busy time.

59
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,998
But I wanted to spend this day
only with my wife.

60
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,394
First, we went to the museum...

61
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,954
...then to an overpriced restaurant.

62
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,111
...and finally to the cinema.

63
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,677
I had my suspicions,

64
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:23,753
but she was so happy during
that whole day.

65
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,434
As we went to bed early,
I knew it would...

66
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,589
turn out good.

67
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,554
First, everything worked out well...

68
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,553
and I was so happy.

69
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,630
Suddenly she started to cry.

70
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:57,352
I didn't have to ask what was going on.
I felt how,, wet" it became.

71
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,471
That was it...

72
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,319
All the hate and rage of the last months
Broke loose in me.

73
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,154
It was over, I did not care anymore!

74
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,559
I took a... and separated her head from the body

75
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,514
And the whole shit ran out...

76
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,112
...her body blew up.

77
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,397
...and then she burst.

78
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,360
Governess

79
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,240
Businessman

80
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,680
Pupil

81

Farmer

82
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,080
Schoolgirls

83
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,160
Gynaecologist

84
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,240
Apprentice

85
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,840
Pensioner

86
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,040
Unemployed

87
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,520
Stock Broker

88
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,240
Housewife

89
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,040
Student

90
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,640
Landlord

91
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,709
Thursday

92
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,400
Actor

93
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,230
Friday

94
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:07,669
We loose our life with pleasure (L'autréamont)

95
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:12,914
This is a chain letter. And it is a message

96
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,356
We demand you take your own life

97
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,794
According to our realization "I die, therefore I am"

98
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:29,312
In six days god created heaven and earth.
On day seven he killed himself.

99
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,549
Let's die!!!

100
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,118
Are we ready?

101
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,438
Is this the first reel?

102
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,516
Yes, reel one.

103
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,030
Are the colleagues all here?
...Yes!

104
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,592
OK, lights out.

105
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,278
This seems to be a test

106
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,675
Good, I go up now.

107
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,438
Attention, the sound is starting.

108
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:03,834
The person running amok doesen't
always choose his target consciously.

109
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,598
With his urge for
spectacular publicity he is...

110
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:12,438
...sometimes trying to correct an
imbalance.

111
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:16,038
Through the act of
killing he or she compensates...

112
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,030
...their own lack of celebrity
of importance.

113
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,678
By the end of the
twentieth century, man has come...

114
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,596
...to feel that he no longer has to
endure everything. No longer...

115
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:31,676
...does he accept miseries and
disasters with the stoicism of...

116
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,673
...a cow standing in the rain.

117
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,596
He has come to feel, that he
deserves justice and a degree of...

118
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,756
...consideration as an individual.

119
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,838
Where in the past he was passive,
modern man has become...

120
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:46,277
...reactive, therefore even a
person nauseated by life,

121
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,439
...the potential suicide, doesn't only
think of a quiet escape through...

122
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,516
...the backdoor.

123
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:56,358
Cheated by life,
this creature is trying to give a...

124
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:01,351
...final signal, to give its life a post-
humous meaning by its way of...

125
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,278
...dying. The frustration about
its own existence and its neglect...

126
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,839
...by a callously progressive
society manifests itself in this...

127
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:14,757
...universal act of vengeance.

128
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:19,199
The Amok-suicide seems to aim at all...

129
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,109
...those who always ignored him.

130
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,198
For once HE is making history...

131
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,678
...he is standing in the limelight
and finally people are interested...

132
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:37,353
...in his biography. He escapes a
"dead" life into a "living" death,

133
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:42,278
...knowing that, at least for a few
days, he will have the almost...

134
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,837
...undivided attention of the
general public. This absurd hope...

135
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:52,111
...is probably more authentic and
genuine than his whole virtually...

136
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,117
...non-existent life before.

137
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:59,517
He, the "motiveless-mass-murderer"
is the martyr of Post-modernism.

138
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:24,310
Saturday

139
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,832
Now, reel two.

140
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,436
There is some light showing

141
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:45,119
Reel three is next.

142
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,357
Now, the camera in the back

143
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:23,998
Sunday

144
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,156
This is the king of death...

145
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:19,794
he makes people want to die.
