00:02:02,546 --> 00:02:07,574
LIKE A CRASHED PLANE

2
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,827
Yes, in the morning I guess...
but I'm not sure yet...

3
00:02:19,664 --> 00:02:21,325
...yes...

4
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:24,397
...when it stops raining I guess...

5
00:02:25,102 --> 00:02:28,094
I'll drop the bags
and go to the vet.

6
00:02:30,174 --> 00:02:31,835
Yes, I paid everything.

7
00:02:33,044 --> 00:02:35,808
Benito! Hello!
This is aunt Luchi.

8
00:02:36,947 --> 00:02:39,074
Hello! Listen, is Ani there?

9
00:02:40,918 --> 00:02:42,852
Yes, yes.
I'm bringing you a gift.

10
00:02:42,987 --> 00:02:45,455
Listen, can you
wake your mom up?

11
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:51,451
Something I made
for you, with shells.

12
00:02:52,496 --> 00:02:53,793
No, sea shells.

13
00:02:53,931 --> 00:02:55,523
I collected them.

14
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:05,771
These shells have little holes,
then you tie them to a twig...

15
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,538
...painted them
with granny's help.

16
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:14,076
Ana, hello, how are you?
Yes, fine, everything's fine.

17
00:03:14,352 --> 00:03:16,445
Listen, sorry
my calling at this hour...

18
00:03:16,587 --> 00:03:18,612
I'll be quick because
this will cut off any moment.

19
00:03:18,756 --> 00:03:21,691
The plane was late. I don't think
I'll get there tomorrow...

20
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,851
...in time to open the shop.
Can you go?

21
00:03:23,994 --> 00:03:27,327
- No, not now, I'm waiting...
- Great, great.

22
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,994
- No, I already paid for it.
- No, no, because...

23
00:03:31,135 --> 00:03:34,366
- Oh! Wait... have you a coin?
- What?

24
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,097
It's going to cut off...

25
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,067
- Yeah...
- Wait

26
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,670
Ana?

27
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:47,474
No, it cut off...
doesn't matter, thanks.

28
00:03:47,718 --> 00:03:49,379
- Bye.
- Bye.

29
00:05:21,846 --> 00:05:24,576
- Get out, Santi.
- I thought you'd died, dude.

30
00:05:25,649 --> 00:05:29,016
- I arrived yesterday, really late.
- This one's really good!

31
00:05:29,386 --> 00:05:30,876
Yeah, so is this one.

32
00:05:31,021 --> 00:05:34,115
Yes, it's the son.
Let's go for a walk?

33
00:05:34,391 --> 00:05:35,722
Okay, let's go.

34
00:05:48,105 --> 00:05:51,040
- So what d'you do in the end?
- Shall we play best of three?

35
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:52,669
Let's.

36
00:05:54,445 --> 00:05:55,707
- Goal, dude.
- No way, pinwheel.

37
00:05:55,846 --> 00:05:57,507
No? Hell of a goal!

38
00:05:58,415 --> 00:06:00,815
Will you tell me what you
fixed up yesterday?

39
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:03,511
- We're going to a rock concert.
- What are you going to see?

40
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:07,086
I don't know.
I'm not going... no way!

41
00:06:07,424 --> 00:06:09,289
Didn't you say you liked her?

42
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,728
I lied, she's stupid.

43
00:06:12,963 --> 00:06:15,397
- Aren't you going
to let her know? - No.

44
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:18,695
You, what,
any chicks in Valdivia?

45
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:21,464
- I met one...
- So tell me about her.

46
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:24,634
- What do you want to know?
- What she's like.

47
00:06:24,775 --> 00:06:27,539
What's her name,
where she lives, what she does...

48
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,948
- She's pretty, she's cute.
- What else?

49
00:06:32,082 --> 00:06:34,448
That, that's the fun.
Come on! The ball!

50
00:06:34,585 --> 00:06:35,916
What's her name?

51
00:06:36,053 --> 00:06:39,545
- I don't know, come on! The ball!
- Wait... where does she live?

52
00:06:40,591 --> 00:06:41,888
I don't know.

53
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:45,519
But you must have her phone,
you're going to see her again.

54
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:49,495
- No, no, I haven't got it.
- But... you must be kidding...

55
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:54,295
- Well, that's how I do things.
- You do things like an asshole.

56
00:06:54,438 --> 00:06:56,838
Hey look, it's a goal.
Serves you right... asshole.

57
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:17,751
Here, feed it
and put it in a cage.

58
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,328
What's it called?

59
00:07:23,467 --> 00:07:24,627
Arturo.

60
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,535
Hi, Arturo!

61
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,603
Yes, I hope so, okay...

62
00:07:44,722 --> 00:07:47,953
Hello, yes, how are you.
I spoke to you the other day?

63
00:07:48,859 --> 00:07:51,419
Ah! The guy
I spoke to isn't there?

64
00:07:51,795 --> 00:07:54,559
Because he knows everything,
I already explained...

65
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:56,960
...yes...

66
00:07:57,468 --> 00:08:00,835
Yes... about a house in Valdivia,
I don't want the gas cut off.

67
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,507
No...

68
00:08:04,642 --> 00:08:07,702
...no, the thing is that
the holders can't sign.

69
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:12,315
The other guy said he'd
fix things for me.

70
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:16,352
Yes, I know... but now
I'm in charge, I could sign it...

71
00:08:17,821 --> 00:08:18,685
No...

72
00:08:18,822 --> 00:08:20,619
...no, it's impossible.

73
00:08:22,059 --> 00:08:22,889
Yes...

74
00:08:23,027 --> 00:08:26,861
No, all I can do is fax you
the holder's death certificate.

75
00:08:26,997 --> 00:08:29,761
I can send it to the subsidiary,
or to Valdivia, or...

76
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,097
...I can give it to you personally
but I sign.

77
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,941
Yes, I know
my father was the holder.

78
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,605
No, no,
my mother can't either.

79
00:09:37,568 --> 00:09:40,002
Nico,
can you bring Arturo?

80
00:09:51,782 --> 00:09:55,616
Here, Nico, go get some change
and give her the rabbit.

81
00:10:05,129 --> 00:10:08,360
Hi, Arturo!
I came to fetch you.

82
00:10:08,499 --> 00:10:10,899
"Hey, that's great.
I was already thinking...

83
00:10:11,034 --> 00:10:13,002
...you would leave me here."

84
00:10:13,137 --> 00:10:16,402
Where are you going
to get change?

85
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,338
Because I live near from here
and I'm in a hurry.

86
00:10:19,476 --> 00:10:21,774
If you're going that side we can
go together and then I go on.

87
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,106
What?

88
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,946
I said if you're going that side,
we can go together...

89
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,517
Yes, yes, okay.

90
00:10:33,724 --> 00:10:36,090
When is the treatment over?

91
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,394
Monday is the last shot.

92
00:10:39,563 --> 00:10:40,860
Next Monday?

93
00:10:40,998 --> 00:10:42,056
Yes.

94
00:10:44,601 --> 00:10:46,000
What's wrong with it?

95
00:10:46,136 --> 00:10:48,001
It's a breathing problem.

96
00:10:48,739 --> 00:10:50,832
He needs some nebulizations.

97
00:10:53,477 --> 00:10:55,468
Look, there is a kiosk over there.

98
00:10:57,815 --> 00:11:01,615
"Oh, Luchi,
I missed you so much!"

99
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,024
He didn't have any...

100
00:11:19,603 --> 00:11:21,901
Since when have you had him?

101
00:11:22,706 --> 00:11:24,674
My sister gave it to me
a year ago.

102
00:11:24,808 --> 00:11:26,366
His name used to be Jorgelín.

103
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,478
Do you remember when
you were called Jorgelín?

104
00:11:28,612 --> 00:11:33,640
"Ah, yes! What an ugly name.
Arturo is much nicer!"

105
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,517
I once had a dog.

106
00:11:41,525 --> 00:11:43,493
Yes, his name was Coco.

107
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:49,324
His name was always Coco.
He was run over by a train.

108
00:11:49,466 --> 00:11:51,764
"Look, Luchi, there is
a flower shop over there."

109
00:11:51,902 --> 00:11:54,462
- D'you want me to go?
- Well, no... I'll go if you want.

110
00:11:54,605 --> 00:11:56,368
No, no, it's okay.
You hold Arturo.

111
00:11:56,506 --> 00:11:59,031
"When are you coming back,
Luchi?" Be right back.

112
00:12:06,917 --> 00:12:08,350
Thanks.

113
00:12:11,655 --> 00:12:12,713
Here.

114
00:12:12,856 --> 00:12:15,586
Ah... it was 20.

115
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,488
Well, I'll go my way...

116
00:12:21,632 --> 00:12:23,293
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

117
00:12:23,433 --> 00:12:25,367
- Bye, Arturo.
- "Bye, sir!"

118
00:12:25,502 --> 00:12:26,764
Not sir, Nico.

119
00:12:26,904 --> 00:12:29,634
"Bye, Nico.
Say hello to the rabbits."

120
00:12:29,773 --> 00:12:31,138
- Bye.
- Bye.

121
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:07,737
These?
They're good!

122
00:13:08,111 --> 00:13:09,908
Say, what'll I do?

123
00:13:10,447 --> 00:13:12,438
I don't know, do something
so she'll have to come back...

124
00:13:12,582 --> 00:13:15,073
...just seeing her for a moment on
Monday at the vet isn't enough.

125
00:13:15,686 --> 00:13:17,119
What d'you think?

126
00:13:19,122 --> 00:13:21,682
Once you give the rabbit
the last shot, that's that?

127
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,116
Yes...

128
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,753
...unless it gets sick again.

129
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:28,691
So, poison the rabbit.

130
00:13:29,533 --> 00:13:31,592
- Do I look good in these?
- Seriously, Santi, come on.

131
00:13:31,735 --> 00:13:33,635
I don't know, do something so
she comes back.

132
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,328
That's all I can say.

133
00:14:02,099 --> 00:14:04,294
You guys, you going to
buy something or not?

134
00:14:04,434 --> 00:14:05,992
He wants to get a teddy bear
for his girlfriend.

135
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,694
This.

136
00:15:23,113 --> 00:15:24,944
D'you want, would you
like something to drink?

137
00:15:25,582 --> 00:15:26,879
No, thanks.

138
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:30,779
- The treatment is over, isn't it?
- Yes, I hope so. Besides...

139
00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:33,685
...it doesn't Arturo any good
to be out all the time.

140
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:37,118
All the same, you don't
live far from here I think.

141
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:40,557
No, about three blocks from
where we went for change.

142
00:15:40,931 --> 00:15:42,592
Will this take long?

143
00:15:43,934 --> 00:15:46,994
No, I don't think so.
It must be over by now.

144
00:15:47,604 --> 00:15:50,437
- Why, you have to work today?
- No, I'm not working today.

145
00:15:51,775 --> 00:15:55,541
- You have to go to college?
- No, but I've a lot to study.

146
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:03,045
- There it's over.
- How is he?

147
00:16:03,787 --> 00:16:06,915
- A bit low.
- He's very weak, Arturo.

148
00:16:07,324 --> 00:16:10,919
"Yes, I feel very dizzy,
let's go home, please!"

149
00:16:11,461 --> 00:16:13,691
- How much is it?
- Forty five.

150
00:16:15,365 --> 00:16:17,356
Here, Nico, you take the money,
give her those...

151
00:16:17,501 --> 00:16:19,492
...antibiotics over there,
behind the cash register.

152
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,995
Okay, now just keep an eye
on him, see how he gets along.

153
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,370
He might be a little low the first
few days, it's normal.

154
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:27,704
But don't worry,
he'll get over it.

155
00:16:30,981 --> 00:16:32,915
Well, I'm leaving,
I have a lot of work to do.

156
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:34,573
Thank you, bye.

157
00:16:37,921 --> 00:16:41,755
Take this, it's all inside.
I put a bunny inside, for Arturo.

158
00:16:41,892 --> 00:16:44,520
"Ah! That's nice, thank you!"

159
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:47,323
- Bye.
- Bye. Bye, Arturo.

160
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:48,522
"Bye".

161
00:17:28,939 --> 00:17:31,305
- You think I mustn't call her?
- How are you going to call her!

162
00:17:31,441 --> 00:17:33,102
If you call somebody to
give them back the money...

163
00:17:33,376 --> 00:17:36,504
...is either because you like her
or you're dumb. Let her call you.

164
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,541
- What if she doesn't call?
- It's fifty bucks. She'll call.

165
00:17:41,484 --> 00:17:43,111
Here, have some.

166
00:17:45,121 --> 00:17:47,055
- What is it?
- Peanuts.

167
00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:51,719
- You didn't pay for it!
- Then don't eat!

168
00:17:52,062 --> 00:17:53,324
You're an asshole.

169
00:17:53,463 --> 00:17:55,590
You call me an asshole but
you stole from the girl you like.

170
00:17:55,732 --> 00:17:58,724
- I'm going to give her the money.
- Yeah, that's how I started.

171
00:18:08,578 --> 00:18:10,876
We've been here
for more than two hours.

172
00:18:11,047 --> 00:18:14,312
- Why don't we go to my place?
- I'll stay a little longer.

173
00:18:14,517 --> 00:18:15,711
Doing what?

174
00:18:16,086 --> 00:18:17,815
Nothing, dude.

175
00:18:17,954 --> 00:18:19,785
After that, you going home?

176
00:18:19,923 --> 00:18:22,619
No, Enrique is staying with
my mother. I'll stay here.

177
00:18:24,694 --> 00:18:27,720
- Come on, let's go to my place.
- I don't want to go to your place.

178
00:18:27,864 --> 00:18:30,924
- Did you fix your bedroom wall?
- Not yet.

179
00:18:31,468 --> 00:18:33,402
But you can sleep on a mattress
in the living room floor.

180
00:18:33,536 --> 00:18:35,697
I won't sleep well that way.

181
00:18:39,142 --> 00:18:41,406
Do as you please.
Come over later if you want to.

182
00:18:42,646 --> 00:18:44,671
- Okay.
- Bye.

183
00:18:47,684 --> 00:18:50,016
Don't go stealing things
on the way.

184
00:18:50,387 --> 00:18:51,877
Bye, man!

185
00:19:19,482 --> 00:19:20,676
Hello!

186
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,381
Ah! Hello.

187
00:19:24,321 --> 00:19:26,289
You're still there!

188
00:19:27,724 --> 00:19:29,419
Let me see, hold on.

189
00:19:37,767 --> 00:19:39,394
The gas bill?

190
00:19:39,936 --> 00:19:43,531
It was paid on March 14 of 2002.

191
00:19:45,108 --> 00:19:46,803
It's all right.

192
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,578
What time you coming back?

193
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,079
Yes, well, yes, I'll stay.
No problem.

194
00:19:55,051 --> 00:19:57,986
Hey, you forgot to buy
the ventilator that broke.

195
00:19:59,856 --> 00:20:00,914
Okay.

196
00:20:01,057 --> 00:20:02,422
Bye.

197
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:12,666
Did you know that Fran hangs
with my father's friends...

198
00:20:12,802 --> 00:20:14,895
...to play squash and have dinner?

199
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:16,471
How come?

200
00:20:17,741 --> 00:20:19,641
Where does he know them from?

201
00:20:19,909 --> 00:20:23,401
Julio, the one he plays with,
he met him in Valdivia...

202
00:20:23,646 --> 00:20:25,580
...and the rest he knows
them from the club.

203
00:20:25,715 --> 00:20:28,115
We used to spend
summer holidays together.

204
00:20:28,385 --> 00:20:29,977
Sounds hilarious.

205
00:20:30,487 --> 00:20:32,546
He used to go every weekend.

206
00:20:33,056 --> 00:20:35,786
I don't know... it seems...
it's odd.

207
00:20:37,394 --> 00:20:39,624
- Are you jealous?
- No.

208
00:20:49,005 --> 00:20:50,495
What's that you're taking?

209
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,835
Don't know,
stole them from mom.

210
00:20:54,744 --> 00:20:56,371
- Want some?
- No.

211
00:21:03,953 --> 00:21:05,443
Hello.

212
00:21:06,389 --> 00:21:08,653
Forty-eight pesos.

213
00:21:12,629 --> 00:21:14,358
Have you got your ID?

214
00:21:14,497 --> 00:21:15,964
I think I forgot it.

215
00:21:18,468 --> 00:21:20,698
Why don't you
have another look?

216
00:21:24,407 --> 00:21:26,500
No, I haven't got it.

217
00:21:26,709 --> 00:21:29,576
You know me.
I always come here.

218
00:21:29,779 --> 00:21:32,339
It's a gift for him,
it's his birthday.

219
00:21:35,552 --> 00:21:36,883
You're Enrique?

220
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,488
Yeah.
What's my name?

221
00:21:41,024 --> 00:21:42,389
Enrique.

222
00:21:43,193 --> 00:21:44,626
See?

223
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:08,549
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

224
00:22:08,685 --> 00:22:10,710
- Happy birthday, pal!
- Get out, you moron!

225
00:22:10,854 --> 00:22:12,082
Bye, thanks.

226
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,355
- Hi, there.
- How are you.

227
00:22:19,662 --> 00:22:20,924
Take this.

228
00:22:21,431 --> 00:22:23,956
- What is it?
- Chocolate, for you.

229
00:22:24,734 --> 00:22:25,860
Thank you.

230
00:22:26,002 --> 00:22:27,333
What, are they imported?

231
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,404
Yes,
it was well worth the effort.

232
00:22:29,672 --> 00:22:32,072
Shut up!
What, are you funny now?

233
00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:35,969
- What's wrong with him?
- He's sleepy.

234
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:41,016
- Your mom? How is she?
- Same as always.

235
00:22:41,384 --> 00:22:44,512
- Is she home already?
- Yes, Enrique's looking after her.

236
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:49,887
Don't you want
anything to drink?

237
00:22:50,026 --> 00:22:52,324
No, he doesn't want anything.
Did you call the plumber?

238
00:22:52,462 --> 00:22:54,589
No, I didn't have time.
I was all day after the gas thing.

239
00:22:54,731 --> 00:22:57,666
Yes, I know, but my bedroom
wall is dripping all over.

240
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,700
Well, I can't be
in charge of everything!

241
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,599
But you do take care of things in
Valdivia. My bedroom wall...

242
00:23:01,738 --> 00:23:03,603
...waters for two weeks and you
didn't even pick up the phone.

243
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,264
The house needs
to be taken care of.

244
00:23:05,408 --> 00:23:07,706
We never go there,
why don't we just rent it?

245
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,903
This isn't the right time
to talk about this, see?

246
00:23:10,046 --> 00:23:11,809
I've got to go to work,
my ears hurt.

247
00:23:11,948 --> 00:23:14,109
Go see the doctor
if your ears hurt.

248
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:25,024
Drop it! You're going to set
the whole house on fire!

249
00:23:25,161 --> 00:23:28,062
Nico, this isn't the right time
to talk about this, see?

250
00:23:29,632 --> 00:23:31,327
Fuck you, asshole!

251
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:44,369
Veterinary.

252
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:49,384
Oh, yes.
How are you?

253
00:23:52,522 --> 00:23:54,547
No, frankly I have no idea.

254
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,661
I'll take a look and if I find
anything I call you, okay?

255
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:02,922
Okay.

256
00:24:03,766 --> 00:24:05,358
No, please.

257
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,327
Bye, see you.

258
00:24:07,604 --> 00:24:09,868
- What's up? You finished?
- Yes.

259
00:24:10,473 --> 00:24:11,872
Who was that?

260
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:13,736
The rabbit girl.

261
00:24:14,477 --> 00:24:17,378
Remember? Says we made a
mistake with the change.

262
00:24:17,513 --> 00:24:19,504
Why do you care
who's calling now?

263
00:24:19,649 --> 00:24:22,447
No, it's just
that I think I charged her.

264
00:24:22,585 --> 00:24:23,779
So?

265
00:24:24,887 --> 00:24:27,014
I don't remember
what I did with the money.

266
00:24:27,657 --> 00:24:29,625
Well,
be more careful next time.

267
00:24:31,861 --> 00:24:34,455
Hey, we could cash up,
couldn't we?

268
00:24:34,597 --> 00:24:36,997
Maybe I made a mistake.
Bad show, she's a client.

269
00:24:37,133 --> 00:24:39,067
What's wrong with you, Nico?

270
00:24:39,569 --> 00:24:41,901
I just think we should check.
It'll only take two minutes.

271
00:24:42,038 --> 00:24:43,869
If you're busy, I can do it.

272
00:24:44,007 --> 00:24:45,599
You're a jerk.

273
00:24:45,742 --> 00:24:47,972
Okay do it.
You do it.

274
00:24:48,144 --> 00:24:49,873
Yes, leave it up to me.

275
00:25:14,637 --> 00:25:15,763
- Hello?
- Hello.

276
00:25:15,905 --> 00:25:18,635
It's from the veterinary,
I've come to bring some money.

277
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:20,342
Nico?

278
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:22,309
Yes.

279
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:24,738
This is Luchi.
Come on in.

280
00:25:32,889 --> 00:25:34,481
- Hi.
- Hi.

281
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:36,952
Take this.
Again, I apologize.

282
00:25:37,093 --> 00:25:39,084
No, it's okay, thanks.

283
00:25:40,029 --> 00:25:41,963
- Arturo?
- Better.

284
00:25:42,098 --> 00:25:43,827
Even so, yesterday
he was behaving strangely.

285
00:25:43,966 --> 00:25:46,434
He seemed kind of down,
didn't want to eat.

286
00:25:46,569 --> 00:25:49,504
D'you want me to take
a look at him, since I'm here?

287
00:25:49,639 --> 00:25:51,607
- Yeah, come on in.
- OK.

288
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,805
I'll bring him over.

289
00:26:10,693 --> 00:26:13,457
"Hello, Nico, hey
how are you doing?"

290
00:26:13,596 --> 00:26:16,690
Hi, Arturo.
Now let's take a look at you.

291
00:26:18,401 --> 00:26:19,698
Were you studying?

292
00:26:19,836 --> 00:26:21,269
Yes, I have an exam tomorrow.

293
00:26:21,404 --> 00:26:22,871
Are you studying
Natural Science?

294
00:26:23,005 --> 00:26:24,597
No, Gardening.

295
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:28,503
- Where does one study that?
- At the Botanical Gardens.

296
00:26:28,644 --> 00:26:30,009
The Botanical Gardens...

297
00:26:32,949 --> 00:26:35,349
"So, tell me doctor,
what's wrong with me?"

298
00:26:35,485 --> 00:26:39,683
Nothing, Arturo.
Only the antibiotic.

299
00:26:39,822 --> 00:26:41,847
There's nothing wrong with him.

300
00:26:41,991 --> 00:26:44,926
You were just pretending
to be sick.

301
00:26:45,128 --> 00:26:47,562
"No, Luchi, I swear to you,
I fell really bad."

302
00:26:47,697 --> 00:26:49,096
Is that Valdivia?

303
00:26:49,365 --> 00:26:51,993
- Yes.
- Ah, my father was born there.

304
00:26:52,135 --> 00:26:53,830
- Really?
- Yes, we have a house.

305
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:56,871
I go there very often.
Well, to Santiago and Valdivia.

306
00:26:57,006 --> 00:26:58,871
My grandmother lives in Valdivia.

307
00:26:59,008 --> 00:27:00,600
Ah! Yes, it's nice,
it's very nice.

308
00:27:00,743 --> 00:27:01,869
Yes.

309
00:27:02,411 --> 00:27:03,503
Done?

310
00:27:03,646 --> 00:27:04,977
Yes, all done.

311
00:27:06,115 --> 00:27:08,379
I leave you to your studies.
I won't bother you any longer.

312
00:27:08,518 --> 00:27:09,712
OK.

313
00:27:10,353 --> 00:27:12,480
Any problem,
just call the vet.

314
00:27:13,756 --> 00:27:15,280
- Bye.
- Bye.

315
00:27:18,528 --> 00:27:20,291
- Good luck tomorrow.
- Thank you.

316
00:27:20,429 --> 00:27:22,488
"So long, Nico,
so long, good luck."

317
00:27:22,632 --> 00:27:24,657
- Bye now.
- Bye.

318
00:27:43,452 --> 00:27:45,818
- Yes, what can I do for you?
- We want this.

319
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,581
The duplicate,
do you have it?

320
00:27:55,798 --> 00:27:57,561
You have the card?

321
00:27:57,767 --> 00:28:00,702
- What card?
- The medical scheme card.

322
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,459
I always come here.

323
00:28:02,605 --> 00:28:04,971
I can't give you the drugs
if you haven't got the card.

324
00:28:05,107 --> 00:28:06,836
They've never
asked me for no card.

325
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:09,877
Without the card
I can't give you the drugs.

326
00:28:10,012 --> 00:28:12,310
My mother's sick.
She must have her medicines!

327
00:28:12,448 --> 00:28:14,348
I can't give you these medicines
without the card.

328
00:28:14,483 --> 00:28:15,780
We'll bring it to you later.

329
00:28:15,918 --> 00:28:18,478
- When you bring me the card...
- No, my mother needs them now.

330
00:28:18,621 --> 00:28:21,784
I already told you, without the
card, I can't give you the drugs.

331
00:28:21,924 --> 00:28:24,722
I know him. And I also know his
mother, they always come here.

332
00:28:24,861 --> 00:28:26,920
Well you attend them, then.

333
00:28:28,764 --> 00:28:30,391
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

334
00:28:32,802 --> 00:28:34,793
I'll bring them to you.

335
00:28:35,471 --> 00:28:37,462
He's a son of a bitch!

336
00:28:39,075 --> 00:28:41,908
Well, so I'll go
fetch you at your house.

337
00:28:42,845 --> 00:28:43,971
Let's.

338
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:47,676
Could we go to dinner?

339
00:28:47,917 --> 00:28:49,544
Yes, all together...

340
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,955
I guess so... yes, in any case
we have the court until two.

341
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:55,284
We <i>could...</i>

342
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,288
...let's...

343
00:28:56,425 --> 00:28:59,952
...okay... Julio, be seeing you,
my regards to Lucía.

344
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:02,595
Fine,
bye, bye.

345
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:23,035
- Hi there.
- Hello, how are you?

346
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,605
I'm fine, and you?

347
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,570
Very well.

348
00:31:25,708 --> 00:31:27,403
- How's the veterinary?
- What?

349
00:31:27,543 --> 00:31:30,011
- The veterinary...
- Oh! Fine, fine...

350
00:31:30,146 --> 00:31:32,614
...just fine... how's Arturo?
- All right, better.

351
00:31:32,748 --> 00:31:34,773
- What?
- I said he's all right, better.

352
00:31:34,917 --> 00:31:36,942
You can sit here if you like.
I'm expecting a friend...

353
00:31:37,086 --> 00:31:39,577
...of mine who's
just taken her exam.

354
00:31:46,929 --> 00:31:49,124
- You also had an exam,
didn't you? - Yes.

355
00:31:49,398 --> 00:31:52,697
- So, how did you get on?
- Very well, I got a 9.50.

356
00:31:52,835 --> 00:31:55,861
It was quite difficult, but I've
only two more subjects to finish.

357
00:31:56,005 --> 00:31:57,870
- That's wonderful!
- Thank you.

358
00:31:58,641 --> 00:32:01,075
I was killing time
to see some friends...

359
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,508
...of mine who are
rehearsing near here.

360
00:32:03,879 --> 00:32:07,645
- Have they got a band?
- Yes, they're playing tomorrow.

361
00:32:08,417 --> 00:32:09,941
My Small Death?

362
00:32:10,086 --> 00:32:12,680
That's what they call themselves.
But they play really well.

363
00:32:12,922 --> 00:32:15,482
- What is it, some kind of party?
- Yes, in a house.

364
00:32:15,624 --> 00:32:17,854
First they play and then
there's a party.

365
00:32:17,993 --> 00:32:20,120
It's outdoors, in the garden.

366
00:32:20,429 --> 00:32:22,420
D'you feel like coming?

367
00:32:23,132 --> 00:32:25,032
Oh! I don't know...

368
00:32:26,769 --> 00:32:30,000
- It's quite near here.
- Ah! It's three blocks from here.

369
00:32:30,506 --> 00:32:33,942
- I'd have to ask my friends.
- They can go too if they like.

370
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,537
Could be. In any case,
I still don't know.

371
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:40,115
- No, keep it, it has the address.
- Thank you. It's nice.

372
00:32:40,382 --> 00:32:41,576
Could be good.

373
00:32:41,717 --> 00:32:45,050
You can go and celebrate
you both passed your exams.

374
00:32:45,187 --> 00:32:48,645
Yah, yah...
it could be... that's good.

375
00:32:50,993 --> 00:32:53,928
That's my friend coming,
she's coming with the other girls.

376
00:32:54,463 --> 00:32:55,760
I won't bother you anymore,

377
00:32:55,898 --> 00:32:59,698
Tell them that if they
want to go there's no problem.

378
00:32:59,835 --> 00:33:01,530
- Bye.
- Bye.

379
00:33:02,571 --> 00:33:03,868
Bye.

380
00:33:06,842 --> 00:33:10,471
Yes, I wanted to know the cost
of rents...

381
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,740
...for the summer season.

382
00:33:13,482 --> 00:33:15,848
And also per month.

383
00:33:20,756 --> 00:33:23,520
And also per
month out of season?

384
00:33:30,699 --> 00:33:33,668
Nico, next Sunday after squash
we're getting together...

385
00:33:33,802 --> 00:33:35,633
...with Julio and the rest to eat.
A barbecue, want to come?

386
00:33:35,771 --> 00:33:36,999
No, it's okay.

387
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:38,963
Well, as you wish.

388
00:33:39,875 --> 00:33:43,675
I spoke to some
real state agents in Valdivia.

389
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:46,979
To find out
about prices for rent.

390
00:33:47,149 --> 00:33:48,377
What?

391
00:33:48,517 --> 00:33:50,781
Here it is, these are the costs
per month and for the season...

392
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,683
...plus their commission.

393
00:33:52,922 --> 00:33:55,891
What did you go down there,
Nico? Did I ask you to go?

394
00:33:56,025 --> 00:33:58,050
It suits us,
it's another income.

395
00:33:58,194 --> 00:34:00,128
It's not enough
with the veterinary only.

396
00:34:00,396 --> 00:34:02,557
I'm working on that!
How do you know it isn't enough?

397
00:34:02,698 --> 00:34:03,494
It's obvious.

398
00:34:03,632 --> 00:34:06,863
No, it's not. Renting Valdivia is
a mess. We're out of season.

399
00:34:07,002 --> 00:34:08,902
Then, let's sell the house. What
do you want that house for?

400
00:34:09,038 --> 00:34:11,529
I don't want to hear
another word.

401
00:34:12,942 --> 00:34:14,773
When is the plumber coming?

402
00:34:15,077 --> 00:34:17,910
- Don't know, I left a message.
- That's bullshit, you didn't call.

403
00:34:18,047 --> 00:34:19,912
- You can think what you please.
- Yes, I do think what I please.

404
00:34:20,049 --> 00:34:22,415
Until I see that wall fixed
I don't believe a word you say.

405
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:33,995
What happened to our hands...

406
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:41,864
...that can no longer
hold flowers?

407
00:34:43,505 --> 00:34:50,069
When the wind drowns our song...

408
00:34:50,846 --> 00:34:57,376
When an abyss
dwells in my heart...

409
00:34:57,686 --> 00:35:03,716
I will remember
the springtime...

410
00:35:04,526 --> 00:35:07,427
...of our love

411
00:35:08,797 --> 00:35:15,066
The springtime of our love

412
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:20,307
Who?
Who will I wait for...

413
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:24,406
...now that the years...

414
00:35:24,546 --> 00:35:27,879
...cast a mist over my eyes?

415
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:34,113
And where does my voice...

416
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:42,957
...go now that the dead
no longer wait for my words?

417
00:35:43,899 --> 00:35:46,993
I don't want to stay here.

418
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:50,731
I will not stay here

419
00:35:56,478 --> 00:35:58,503
Benito, does he go to pre-school?

420
00:35:58,647 --> 00:36:00,911
No, he just began kindergarten.

421
00:36:01,884 --> 00:36:03,647
- He already has three girlfriends.
- Three girlfriends.

422
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:06,482
But one of them
he hasn't told yet.

423
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:09,988
- Is he your only nephew?
- Yes.

424
00:36:12,061 --> 00:36:14,859
Ana owns the greenhouse,
or does it belong to your parents?

425
00:36:14,997 --> 00:36:18,057
My parents helped her from
Santiago, but it belongs to her.

426
00:36:18,967 --> 00:36:21,265
Come to the greenhouse
one of these days if you want.

427
00:36:21,403 --> 00:36:24,861
You're not there Tuesdays
and Thursdays, right?

428
00:36:25,007 --> 00:36:27,805
Every day, except
Tuesdays and Thursdays.

429
00:36:27,943 --> 00:36:29,808
- Okay, then I'll drop by.
- Yah.

430
00:36:32,414 --> 00:36:36,043
- Do you have this one?
- I thought of going next week.

431
00:36:36,618 --> 00:36:40,418
Why wait so long, dude?
She invited you, go today.

432
00:36:40,556 --> 00:36:43,116
- No, she's not there today.
- Okay, then go tomorrow.

433
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:44,120
D'you think so?

434
00:36:44,393 --> 00:36:46,884
I don't know, that's what I think.
You decide what you want to do.

435
00:36:47,029 --> 00:36:48,462
Yes, I know.

436
00:36:48,997 --> 00:36:51,625
Why don't you ask if they
have "Grace" by Jeff Buckley.

437
00:36:51,767 --> 00:36:54,031
- Haven't you got it?
- I lost it.

438
00:36:55,404 --> 00:36:57,998
- Why don't you ask?
- Because I'm shy, man.

439
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,869
Come on, dude.

440
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:05,344
One question...
"Grace" by Jeff Buckley?

441
00:37:05,481 --> 00:37:07,415
Let me have a look.

442
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:17,848
Nico...

443
00:37:19,461 --> 00:37:21,452
Come on, man!
Come on!

444
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,801
You're an asshole!

445
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:34,842
Wait a minute,
what's wrong with you?

446
00:37:34,977 --> 00:37:36,410
What's wrong with you?

447
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:38,570
We went to a record store and
bought some CDs, what's wrong?

448
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:40,545
Don't play the fool, Santi!

449
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:42,710
Here, take these...

450
00:37:42,851 --> 00:37:45,411
...I chose them for you.
- Great present, thanks!

451
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:47,351
Stop it dude,
they scratch easily...

452
00:37:47,923 --> 00:37:49,515
- You can change them if you want.
- Stop it.

453
00:37:49,658 --> 00:37:52,718
- Did you ask for the receipt?
- I'm serious, Santi, cut it out!

454
00:37:52,861 --> 00:37:54,726
What are you being
serious about?

455
00:37:55,597 --> 00:37:57,531
- About what you're doing.
- What am I doing?

456
00:37:57,666 --> 00:37:59,896
- You're being an absolute jerk.
- I'm a jerk, why does it bug you?

457
00:38:00,035 --> 00:38:01,866
- Yes, it does bother me.
- Then don't let it bother you.

458
00:38:02,004 --> 00:38:04,063
It's my business,
it's my problem if I'm a jerk...

459
00:38:07,709 --> 00:38:08,801
Look...

460
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,737
It's not your problem only.

461
00:38:32,034 --> 00:38:33,524
They're perfect for outdoors.

462
00:38:33,669 --> 00:38:36,069
Yes... but what about now,
with the cold?

463
00:38:36,338 --> 00:38:41,332
No... I think... these resist both
the cold and the summer heat...

464
00:38:41,477 --> 00:38:43,342
...except this one is more
likely to grow in winter.

465
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:51,476
This is it.

466
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,449
- Here?
- Yes.

467
00:39:16,678 --> 00:39:18,305
How much sugar?

468
00:39:19,715 --> 00:39:20,739
Two.

469
00:39:36,932 --> 00:39:42,268
There's also a wood,
I like going there, but it's far.

470
00:39:42,404 --> 00:39:44,804
- Next time, then.
- Okay.

471
00:39:47,476 --> 00:39:48,966
What's that?

472
00:39:49,378 --> 00:39:51,073
It's Benito,
my nephew's birthday...

473
00:39:51,346 --> 00:39:53,837
...in a few days and I promised
to entertain his birthday party...

474
00:39:53,982 --> 00:39:55,916
...in the kindergarten.
- That's great!

475
00:39:56,652 --> 00:39:57,914
You can come if you like.

476
00:39:58,053 --> 00:39:59,918
- Really?
- Yes.

477
00:40:00,088 --> 00:40:03,023
- You can invite Santi, so you
won't get bored. - I don't know.

478
00:40:03,158 --> 00:40:05,683
Yes, come on, tell him
that way I can get to meet him.

479
00:40:05,827 --> 00:40:07,658
I'll see, thank you.

480
00:40:11,433 --> 00:40:13,526
- Want some?
- Okay.

481
00:41:29,645 --> 00:41:32,478
Hi, children!

482
00:41:33,515 --> 00:41:36,712
I see many children here today!

483
00:41:37,019 --> 00:41:42,355
I'm looking
for my friend Gandolfo.

484
00:41:42,524 --> 00:41:45,084
Have you seen him around?

485
00:41:45,494 --> 00:41:49,453
Did he go that way?
Or that way?

486
00:41:51,033 --> 00:41:52,557
- That way!
- That way!

487
00:41:53,535 --> 00:41:59,132
Thank you children.
I'll go that way, then...

488
00:42:03,011 --> 00:42:05,411
Looks surprised...

489
00:42:05,547 --> 00:42:07,708
It can make many
different gestures...

490
00:42:07,849 --> 00:42:09,646
...it can even show anger.

491
00:42:11,687 --> 00:42:13,348
Let's see, can I try?

492
00:42:20,395 --> 00:42:21,657
There...

493
00:42:21,797 --> 00:42:23,059
Let's see...

494
00:42:27,469 --> 00:42:29,130
When you don't know
how to do it...

495
00:42:29,404 --> 00:42:31,429
...the head goes that way
upwards...

496
00:42:31,573 --> 00:42:35,669
...you have to hold it downwards.
Did you put your hand in there?

497
00:42:35,811 --> 00:42:38,837
Like this?
Or do I have to squeeze less?

498
00:42:39,147 --> 00:42:40,978
And you can comb it...

499
00:42:43,885 --> 00:42:46,945
These are easy,
they have only one stick.

500
00:42:48,824 --> 00:42:50,621
"Hello, hello..."

501
00:42:57,099 --> 00:42:58,566
His name is Gandolfo.

502
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,793
- Gandolfo.
- Gandolfo.

503
00:43:03,705 --> 00:43:05,673
And does your sister
live near here?

504
00:43:05,807 --> 00:43:09,072
More or less. She often
asks me to go fetch Benito.

505
00:43:11,747 --> 00:43:13,908
And how long is it since you
went to live with your brother?

506
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:18,315
No, I didn't go to live with him.
My parents died over a year ago...

507
00:43:18,453 --> 00:43:20,921
...they were flying this plane of
theirs and they had an accident.

508
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:22,887
Since that happened
I've been living with him...

509
00:43:23,024 --> 00:43:25,458
- I'm sorry, I had no idea.
- No, it's okay.

510
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:47,708
Feed him a little more, see.

511
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:51,346
Do you know who sent it?

512
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:02,690
What are you doing?

513
00:44:02,831 --> 00:44:03,923
Wait.

514
00:44:07,435 --> 00:44:09,494
Hey, in the end
what's going on with the girl?

515
00:44:09,638 --> 00:44:11,629
I don't know,
what do you think?

516
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:14,467
That she's into you,
you need to do something.

517
00:44:16,077 --> 00:44:19,706
- Yes, I have to do something.
- That's obvious.

518
00:44:20,982 --> 00:44:24,474
- There's nobody here.
- There's one on duty not so far.

519
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,855
But I'm not buying anything,
there's usually no one this time.

520
00:44:27,989 --> 00:44:30,480
- The pharmacist comes out.
- So what for?

521
00:44:30,625 --> 00:44:33,856
- I'm robbing the drugstore.
- Come on, there's one over there.

522
00:44:33,995 --> 00:44:36,327
I don't want another one,
I want to rob this one.

523
00:44:42,404 --> 00:44:43,928
Did you have a good time?

524
00:44:44,072 --> 00:44:46,563
Yes, the kids
enjoyed themselves.

525
00:44:46,708 --> 00:44:48,369
Did your friend
have a good time?

526
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:50,603
Yes, I think he liked it.

527
00:44:50,745 --> 00:44:52,804
He seems a nice person,
I liked him.

528
00:44:52,948 --> 00:44:55,576
Although some of his jokes,
I just couldn't understand.

529
00:44:55,717 --> 00:44:59,380
- Lately, he's being quite a jerk.
- I liked him anyway.

530
00:44:59,521 --> 00:45:01,113
He played with Benito
all afternoon.

531
00:45:01,389 --> 00:45:03,755
He was so happy
with that gift you gave him.

532
00:45:03,892 --> 00:45:06,019
I brought this.

533
00:45:06,962 --> 00:45:10,625
- Didn't have time to wrap it up.
- What is it? Is it for Benito?

534
00:45:10,832 --> 00:45:13,596
Yes, well no, actually,
it's for you.

535
00:45:14,102 --> 00:45:17,299
It's a puppet,
to keep yours company.

536
00:45:26,514 --> 00:45:30,644
- You don't like it?
- Yes, of course, I love it.

537
00:45:30,785 --> 00:45:33,379
- Where did you buy it?
- I searched for it.

538
00:45:33,521 --> 00:45:36,581
Looked for it in several places
and finally found it.

539
00:45:36,725 --> 00:45:39,023
I bought mine during summer,
at a fair...

540
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,684
...from a big, bald-headed
gentleman.

541
00:45:40,829 --> 00:45:43,923
Yes, an old man with glasses.
He also had the pink fish...

542
00:45:44,065 --> 00:45:45,828
...same as the one you have.

543
00:45:47,535 --> 00:45:49,469
Thank you, it's really great.

544
00:45:53,441 --> 00:45:59,846
Nico, I wanted to tell you I'm off
to Switzerland for two years...

545
00:46:00,015 --> 00:46:03,007
- What?
- Yes, I'm going to study Botany.

546
00:46:03,652 --> 00:46:05,916
There's a very good
school over there.

547
00:46:06,354 --> 00:46:07,946
I... I had no idea.

548
00:46:08,089 --> 00:46:11,923
I didn't tell you because it was
confirmed only two days ago.

549
00:46:12,093 --> 00:46:14,061
I won a scholarship.

550
00:46:14,329 --> 00:46:17,355
I'm so happy. They chose me
among 200 other people.

551
00:46:17,499 --> 00:46:21,458
- Isn't it wonderful?
- Yes, wonderful. Congratulations.

552
00:46:23,004 --> 00:46:25,734
Anyway, we'll keep in touch.

553
00:46:28,643 --> 00:46:31,874
- When are you leaving?
- In 20 days time.

554
00:46:32,881 --> 00:46:36,112
But I'm going to be very busy,
I have to prepare everything...

555
00:46:36,384 --> 00:46:39,353
...and besides I have to take
the remaining exams.

556
00:46:39,487 --> 00:46:41,648
But I suppose we can still see
each other before you go.

557
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:44,657
Yes, I guess, I'll manage
to find some time off.

558
00:46:47,796 --> 00:46:50,094
Thank you, Nico,
I really liked it.

559
00:47:06,848 --> 00:47:08,713
She's scared, if not, then why
didn't she tell you sooner?

560
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:10,841
- It was only confirmed.
- Bullshit.

561
00:47:10,986 --> 00:47:13,045
She was playing fool, until
she began to feel something...

562
00:47:13,321 --> 00:47:14,720
...for you and she got scared.

563
00:47:14,856 --> 00:47:17,654
I don't think so, I don't think
she has feelings for me.

564
00:47:17,792 --> 00:47:19,919
My idea is she just wanted to
keep her distance and that's all.

565
00:47:20,061 --> 00:47:22,723
You have to do something
about it, forget about the trip.

566
00:47:22,864 --> 00:47:26,322
If she wanted to keep a distance,
she should have done so before.

567
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:30,369
- Hi.
- How are you.

568
00:47:30,505 --> 00:47:31,631
Hello

569
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:36,770
This one is for the barred door,
and this one for the glass one.

570
00:47:36,911 --> 00:47:38,708
Tomorrow at one-fifteen.

571
00:47:38,847 --> 00:47:42,305
The drugs are those beside the
counter, they're in a green box.

572
00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:45,886
Don't take too long, the old man
is out 10 minutes and comes back.

573
00:47:46,021 --> 00:47:47,818
You asshole, Santi!

574
00:47:49,624 --> 00:47:52,525
What's the matter? He's the one
who's gonna help you?

575
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:53,718
- Yes.
- You sure?

576
00:47:53,862 --> 00:47:55,989
Yes, he's my best friend,
he's going to help me.

577
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:57,829
Well, let's continue.

578
00:47:57,966 --> 00:48:00,127
If a customer shows up,
don't let them in...

579
00:48:00,402 --> 00:48:02,836
...tell them the owner's gone
and is coming back later...

580
00:48:02,971 --> 00:48:04,768
...don't open the door
for anyone, got it?

581
00:48:04,906 --> 00:48:06,339
Yeah.

582
00:48:21,089 --> 00:48:23,250
Nicolás, all these bills arrived,
you didn't pay anything.

583
00:48:23,391 --> 00:48:25,882
- No, I forgot.
- But, idiot, the money was here.

584
00:48:26,027 --> 00:48:27,551
Yes, but I forgot, so what?!

585
00:48:27,695 --> 00:48:29,788
- You didn't even take the money.
- You forget to get my room fixed.

586
00:48:29,931 --> 00:48:31,330
Can't I forget too?

587
00:48:31,466 --> 00:48:34,299
- What's wrong with you, man?
- Nothing. I just forgot to pay.

588
00:48:34,436 --> 00:48:36,563
Now they're going to cut off
everything, what do we do?

589
00:48:36,704 --> 00:48:38,672
I've already told you what we
can do with that house.

590
00:48:38,807 --> 00:48:41,332
- Don't bust my balls with that.
- You never listen to me.

591
00:48:41,476 --> 00:48:43,467
I'm in charge of
that house and this one.

592
00:48:43,611 --> 00:48:44,839
You're in charge of nothing.

593
00:48:44,979 --> 00:48:46,674
You waste all your time
with that Valdivia shit...

594
00:48:46,815 --> 00:48:49,375
...or with those old creeps, what
the fuck are you in charge of?

595
00:48:49,517 --> 00:48:51,815
Since when it's your business
what I do now?!

596
00:48:51,953 --> 00:48:53,386
I see whomever I please.

597
00:48:53,521 --> 00:48:55,716
I don't meddle in your things!
I don't mess around with Santi!

598
00:48:55,857 --> 00:48:57,688
You're an asshole!
You left the gas on!

599
00:48:57,826 --> 00:49:00,852
- The wind must have blown it off.
- You can't forget the gas on!

600
00:49:00,995 --> 00:49:02,622
It's because I started reading
all that shit you didn't pay.

601
00:49:02,764 --> 00:49:04,823
You never accept anything.
You don't listen.

602
00:49:04,966 --> 00:49:07,901
- Cut out the insults, you prick.
- Fuck off. Do what you want!

603
00:49:08,036 --> 00:49:09,765
You fuck off, asshole!

604
00:50:54,773 --> 00:50:56,934
- Nico...
- What are you doing here, moron?

605
00:50:57,075 --> 00:50:59,043
- I'm okay, and you?
- What d'you want?

606
00:50:59,177 --> 00:51:00,701
- I need a favor.
- No fucking way.

607
00:51:00,846 --> 00:51:03,713
5.000 pesos are missing at my
place and my mom is blaming me.

608
00:51:03,849 --> 00:51:05,817
Did you see the guy at the
pharmacist's? He buys drugs.

609
00:51:05,951 --> 00:51:08,010
- Did you steal the money or not?
- Yes, I stole it, yeah.

610
00:51:08,153 --> 00:51:09,643
- You're a real asshole.
- Yeah, I know...

611
00:51:09,788 --> 00:51:11,949
- Do you?
- Yes, I'm not dumb, I know.

612
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:14,558
- I have to replace the money.
- Fuck you.

613
00:51:14,693 --> 00:51:16,820
You're at the counter, just in
case, nothing's gonna happen.

614
00:51:16,962 --> 00:51:19,055
- We're in and out. Five minutes.
- Get out.

615
00:51:19,197 --> 00:51:21,859
I'm asking you a favor, what
the fuck's the matter with you?

616
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,458
D'you think I like it? I'm asking
you a favor and you play dumb.

617
00:51:25,604 --> 00:51:27,071
You are a prick...
you're a chicken.

618
00:51:27,205 --> 00:51:29,105
- No, it's not that.
- You're a fucking chicken!

619
00:51:29,241 --> 00:51:31,505
- Don't you realize?!
- I'm going to steal it anyway.

620
00:51:31,643 --> 00:51:34,703
- Why don't you...
- I can't talk to my mother.

621
00:51:38,016 --> 00:51:39,779
I'm going on with this.

622
00:51:39,918 --> 00:51:42,011
And if it gets screwed up,
I don't mind, d'you understand?

623
00:51:44,689 --> 00:51:47,249
If you want to help, call me,
otherwise, go to hell.

624
00:51:58,837 --> 00:51:59,804
Hi.

625
00:51:59,938 --> 00:52:01,269
Hello, Nico!

626
00:52:01,606 --> 00:52:03,437
- Everything okay?
- Just fine, and you?

627
00:52:03,575 --> 00:52:05,941
Is your answering machine
working? I've been calling you...

628
00:52:06,077 --> 00:52:09,046
Ah, yes... I know...
but I had a lot of work to do.

629
00:52:09,915 --> 00:52:12,008
- Can I help you?
- No, no, it's okay.

630
00:52:12,918 --> 00:52:15,751
- You're about finished, right?
- No, I'm staying one hour longer.

631
00:52:16,788 --> 00:52:19,882
- Shall we go for a drink?
- I can't, I must study.

632
00:52:20,025 --> 00:52:23,586
- Aren't the exams next week?
- But I already started reading.

633
00:52:24,763 --> 00:52:26,560
What about later,
in the evening?

634
00:52:26,731 --> 00:52:29,962
I'd love to, but I'm having dinner
with my sister and Benito.

635
00:52:32,671 --> 00:52:35,606
- Are you okay?
- Yes, why?

636
00:52:36,007 --> 00:52:39,170
It's nothing...
When can we meet?

637
00:52:39,811 --> 00:52:43,645
I'll see, maybe one of these days
I find the time, I don't know...

638
00:52:44,149 --> 00:52:47,175
- Luchi... can you come, please?
- I'll just finish this.

639
00:52:51,289 --> 00:52:54,122
Well... bye.

640
00:52:55,126 --> 00:52:57,026
I'll call you, okay?

641
00:53:22,821 --> 00:53:26,018
Hello, Lucía?
How are you, it's Francisco.

642
00:53:26,558 --> 00:53:28,116
Is Julio around?

643
00:53:29,628 --> 00:53:32,028
Ah, you don't know if he
was coming to the Club.

644
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,230
Ah, yes?
I didn't know...

645
00:53:38,270 --> 00:53:40,431
To eat, where?

646
00:53:42,807 --> 00:53:44,707
They were all going?

647
00:53:46,144 --> 00:53:48,704
No, no... how strange...

648
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:52,980
Yes, I was home until now, but,
he didn't leave a message either.

649
00:53:54,919 --> 00:53:57,820
Don't worry,
I'll speak to him later.

650
00:53:58,290 --> 00:53:59,917
Okay, thank you.

651
00:54:04,663 --> 00:54:06,927
- Hurry up, Santi, how long?
- Coming... hold on a minute.

652
00:54:07,065 --> 00:54:09,693
- Hurry up.
- Yes, I can't find then

653
00:54:09,901 --> 00:54:11,960
It doesn't matter, let's go.

654
00:54:13,438 --> 00:54:15,497
- Here they are.
- Are they those?

655
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:17,571
Yes, yes,
we're leaving now.

656
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:24,078
- What do I do?
- Attend them, send them away.

657
00:54:24,215 --> 00:54:26,513
- No, you go.
- They've already seen you, go.

658
00:54:26,651 --> 00:54:29,586
- What do I tell them?
- Anything, just send them away.

659
00:54:40,965 --> 00:54:44,196
Hello, I need either
espasmosedan or espasmoactril.

660
00:54:46,805 --> 00:54:49,171
Quickly, please,
he's not feeling well.

661
00:54:51,576 --> 00:54:53,544
Wait here,
just a second.

662
00:54:57,982 --> 00:55:00,951
- Espasmosedan?
- Don't know what that is.

663
00:55:01,086 --> 00:55:05,785
- Espasmoactril or something?
- Don't know. Give them anything.

664
00:55:05,957 --> 00:55:09,620
- No, I think he's with fever.
- Come on, man, give him this.

665
00:55:20,705 --> 00:55:23,902
- Look, this is all I have.
- It's different.

666
00:55:25,777 --> 00:55:29,372
- This is for the fever, kid.
- He doesn't have just a fever!

667
00:55:29,514 --> 00:55:32,210
I've got a temperature,
dizziness, sharp pains...

668
00:55:34,018 --> 00:55:36,179
You didn't go to a hospital?

669
00:55:36,454 --> 00:55:38,649
I called a friend, he told me
to just give him these...

670
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:41,759
- I also have palpitations.
- Okay, take it easy, Dad.

671
00:55:43,061 --> 00:55:45,791
They told me I could find
these drugs in any drugstore.

672
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:48,626
- Did you take a good look, kid?
- It's just that I'm new here.

673
00:55:48,767 --> 00:55:52,498
- Isn't there a book to look it up?
- A drug handbook.

674
00:55:52,937 --> 00:55:54,905
Isn't there someone
who can attend us properly?

675
00:55:55,039 --> 00:55:57,439
The chemist will come back
in half an hour.

676
00:55:57,575 --> 00:55:59,668
We can't wait half an hour...
He's not feeling well and...

677
00:55:59,811 --> 00:56:01,972
...he must have the drugs now.
- Maybe he'll come sooner.

678
00:56:02,113 --> 00:56:03,603
How sooner?

679
00:56:04,749 --> 00:56:08,014
I don't know, maybe he'll
come sooner, don't know yet.

680
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:11,653
- Can you wait for half an hour?
- Yes, yes, I can stand it...

681
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:14,156
Let's go home
and we come back later.

682
00:56:14,492 --> 00:56:17,086
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

683
00:56:17,996 --> 00:56:21,625
- No, we'll go to the E.R. Ward.
- No, dear, it's not necessary.

684
00:56:21,766 --> 00:56:23,825
I don't care what you think,
just look at you.

685
00:56:23,968 --> 00:56:24,935
I'm sorry.

686
00:56:25,069 --> 00:56:26,969
- No, kid, forget about it.
- Come on.

687
00:56:27,105 --> 00:56:28,766
Okay, we're leaving.

688
00:56:33,645 --> 00:56:35,670
Nothing happened, man,
it's over that's that...

689
00:56:35,814 --> 00:56:37,679
...bad luck, that's all.

690
00:56:40,051 --> 00:56:41,848
I'm talking to you.

691
00:56:47,525 --> 00:56:48,856
- Well?
- Hello.

692
00:56:52,864 --> 00:56:54,195
Everything cool?

693
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:57,891
- The keys are in there.
- Any problems?

694
00:56:58,036 --> 00:57:00,504
None, I got up early,
that's all.

695
00:57:03,842 --> 00:57:05,969
- What's this?
- Aropax, what you asked me for...

696
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:07,702
The anti-depressant.

697
00:57:07,846 --> 00:57:09,711
But I told you to get the 30 ones.

698
00:57:10,081 --> 00:57:12,675
- What? - What does it say here?
- It's all I could find.

699
00:57:12,817 --> 00:57:14,614
- Where did you get this from?
- The middle shelf.

700
00:57:14,752 --> 00:57:16,344
I told you beside the counter.

701
00:57:16,488 --> 00:57:18,012
- You didn't say that!
- I did.

702
00:57:18,156 --> 00:57:19,987
- These are no good to me!
- Give me less money.

703
00:57:20,124 --> 00:57:21,716
You're telling me how much
I have to give you?

704
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:23,589
Give me half the money,
I already pulled the job.

705
00:57:23,728 --> 00:57:26,754
You did it wrong,
I explained it to you very well.

706
00:57:26,898 --> 00:57:28,695
What else did you need
a bloody map, imbecile?

707
00:57:28,833 --> 00:57:30,824
Shove them up your ass,
these are no good to me, punk!

708
00:57:31,102 --> 00:57:32,694
Come here!

709
00:57:41,779 --> 00:57:46,045
Dammit, fucking dammit!

710
00:58:02,166 --> 00:58:06,899
- Hi, there!
- Hello! How are you!

711
00:58:07,472 --> 00:58:09,337
- Still playing?
- Yeah.

712
00:58:09,474 --> 00:58:11,704
I need a leash
for my girlfriend's dog.

713
00:58:11,843 --> 00:58:14,505
- How is it? Big, small...
- Medium.

714
00:58:15,914 --> 00:58:18,144
You have these leather ones...

715
00:58:19,784 --> 00:58:21,684
...these are a bit longer...

716
00:58:22,887 --> 00:58:25,185
- Hey, you didn't go on Saturday...
- Where to?

717
00:58:25,456 --> 00:58:27,822
- It was Julio's birthday.
- Really?

718
00:58:28,159 --> 00:58:30,059
Your father told me nothing.

719
00:58:30,194 --> 00:58:32,685
I was there for a short time
because I had to play.

720
00:58:33,631 --> 00:58:36,725
- And who were there?
- All the guys from the club.

721
00:58:37,902 --> 00:58:40,063
- And was it fun?
- It was a bore...

722
00:58:40,204 --> 00:58:43,037
They spent the whole time
organizing their holidays.

723
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:48,070
- You going to Valdivia on summer?
- No, I don't think so.

724
00:58:48,212 --> 00:58:50,180
I'm going with my
girlfriend to the countryside.

725
00:58:50,448 --> 00:58:52,712
- Okay.
- How much is it?

726
00:58:53,217 --> 00:58:55,481
Nothing...
just leave me five pesos.

727
00:58:57,255 --> 00:58:58,882
- Okay, fine.
- Thanks.

728
00:58:59,023 --> 00:59:02,083
- Tell your old man to call me.
- I will.

729
00:59:02,226 --> 00:59:04,126
- Bye.
- Bye and good luck.

730
00:59:15,173 --> 00:59:19,041
A teaspoonful in a pot
more or less like this one...

731
00:59:19,177 --> 00:59:22,635
...and then water it regularly.
- You didn't call me.

732
00:59:22,814 --> 00:59:24,714
Hello!
I've almost finished.

733
00:59:25,049 --> 00:59:28,450
- I left you three messages.
- Nico, wait a minute, please.

734
00:59:28,786 --> 00:59:30,048
Couldn't you just call?

735
00:59:30,188 --> 00:59:31,883
I'd better come
some other time.

736
00:59:32,023 --> 00:59:33,650
Yah... I'm sorry.

737
00:59:35,059 --> 00:59:36,924
Nico, Can't you see
I'm with customers?

738
00:59:37,061 --> 00:59:39,086
I just want to talk to you and
you're not capable of calling.

739
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:42,427
I said I'd phone if I could.
If I didn't is because I was busy.

740
00:59:42,567 --> 00:59:44,501
Just pick up the phone,
it's five minutes.

741
00:59:44,636 --> 00:59:46,604
- I didn't have five minutes.
- Don't lie to me.

742
00:59:46,738 --> 00:59:49,536
You know I'm working a lot
and I've got the exams.

743
00:59:49,674 --> 00:59:52,006
- Cut the bullshit.
- It's not bullshit, Nico.

744
00:59:52,143 --> 00:59:54,634
I only have ten days left,
that's all. I'm off on a trip.

745
01:00:01,619 --> 01:00:03,484
What is going on, Luchi?

746
01:00:04,055 --> 01:00:05,716
About what?

747
01:00:06,157 --> 01:00:07,624
With me...

748
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,951
...what's going on with me?

749
01:00:13,598 --> 01:00:15,225
I'm traveling.

750
01:00:15,566 --> 01:00:18,034
You know the way I feel,
don't you?

751
01:00:20,805 --> 01:00:24,434
I think we'd better not see
each other for a few days.

752
01:00:25,009 --> 01:00:26,636
I'll call you.

753
01:02:07,578 --> 01:02:09,705
I think this one's empty.

754
01:02:10,047 --> 01:02:11,571
Are you okay?

755
01:02:13,684 --> 01:02:15,174
Yes, why?

756
01:02:16,521 --> 01:02:19,115
Don't know, you seem
rather strange these days.

757
01:02:19,924 --> 01:02:23,121
Strange about what?
No, nothing's wrong with me.

758
01:02:27,498 --> 01:02:30,592
Nico, wouldn't you like
to take some days off?

759
01:02:32,036 --> 01:02:33,196
What?

760
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:37,134
It's just that there are things to
pay in Valdivia and I thought...

761
01:02:37,275 --> 01:02:40,403
- Still insisting on that, Fran?
- No, no... to rent it...

762
01:02:40,545 --> 01:02:42,775
I can't do anything
about it from here...

763
01:02:42,914 --> 01:02:45,712
And I thought maybe
the trip would do you good.

764
01:02:45,850 --> 01:02:47,545
You can ask Santi, if you like.

765
01:02:47,685 --> 01:02:50,916
- I'll give you money for it all.
- You want to rent it?

766
01:02:51,656 --> 01:02:54,750
Yes, maybe for a couple
of months in the year...

767
01:02:55,793 --> 01:02:57,021
...and then we see.

768
01:02:57,161 --> 01:03:00,096
But everything
has to be paid for now.

769
01:03:00,531 --> 01:03:01,862
Is something wrong?

770
01:03:02,066 --> 01:03:03,556
No, nothing's wrong.

771
01:03:03,701 --> 01:03:07,398
While you're away,
I can call the plumber.

772
01:03:07,538 --> 01:03:10,996
- Would you like that?
- Okay, let me talk to Santi.

773
01:03:11,976 --> 01:03:15,434
Ask him and let me know.
Otherwise. I'll go, no problem.

774
01:03:15,947 --> 01:03:17,039
Yes.

775
01:03:17,582 --> 01:03:19,607
Let me know when
you're through with that...

776
01:03:20,718 --> 01:03:22,982
...so we can get
something to eat.

777
01:03:23,821 --> 01:03:25,186
Okay.

778
01:03:41,606 --> 01:03:43,471
I'm going to buy smokes.

779
01:03:43,975 --> 01:03:46,205
There's a bigger kiosk
next block.

780
01:03:46,577 --> 01:03:49,171
- I need batteries.
- I want to smoke now.

781
01:04:13,137 --> 01:04:16,038
Come on man, are you looking
at those fucking little fish?

782
01:04:23,214 --> 01:04:25,444
Do you want something
to eat now?

783
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,010
Drink?

784
01:04:32,223 --> 01:04:33,656
No.

785
01:04:36,494 --> 01:04:39,395
- C'mon, Santi, it's over now.
- It's not fucking over, man.

786
01:04:39,530 --> 01:04:43,022
I can't sell those drugs. I won't
be able to replace the money.

787
01:04:44,101 --> 01:04:47,662
- Cool it, man.
- I do what I damn well please.

788
01:04:48,205 --> 01:04:50,503
You have no idea what's
going to happen at home now.

789
01:04:50,641 --> 01:04:53,804
Do you have the money? No.
Then keep your nose out of this.

790
01:04:54,278 --> 01:04:55,745
Go to hell!

791
01:05:02,486 --> 01:05:06,422
- What d'you say?
- I said go to hell!

792
01:05:22,606 --> 01:05:25,541
You know you're
my best friend, don't you?

793
01:05:28,512 --> 01:05:30,537
I'm sorry I got you
into this mess...

794
01:05:30,681 --> 01:05:33,081
...and also for that thing
about the fish.

795
01:05:33,217 --> 01:05:36,414
Look at all the fish you like,
that little fish was cool.

796
01:05:37,021 --> 01:05:39,046
It was wooden, wasn't it?

797
01:05:40,992 --> 01:05:42,653
It was cool.

798
01:06:53,631 --> 01:06:55,428
And... isn't it possible that
he went back to your house?

799
01:06:55,566 --> 01:06:58,535
No, I went there before coming,
and everything was the same.

800
01:06:58,669 --> 01:07:00,603
Besides, he didn't have a key.

801
01:07:00,738 --> 01:07:03,707
And... had he ever been
to Niebla or Valdivia?

802
01:07:03,841 --> 01:07:04,933
No.

803
01:07:05,843 --> 01:07:08,903
And... didn't he say if
he wanted to go somewhere?

804
01:07:09,046 --> 01:07:10,707
No, he said nothing.

805
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:15,441
What was the last thing
you two spoke about?

806
01:07:18,622 --> 01:07:20,954
Nothing...
nothing important.

807
01:07:23,694 --> 01:07:27,186
This is what you'll have to do.
You go home, wait overnight...

808
01:07:27,465 --> 01:07:29,399
...and if by tomorrow he hasn't
shown up, call your brother...

809
01:07:29,533 --> 01:07:33,162
...because we need a responsible
adult to begin the search.

810
01:07:37,141 --> 01:07:38,631
Okay.

811
01:09:11,202 --> 01:09:13,363
Nothing remained, see?

812
01:09:14,972 --> 01:09:17,634
Last time you could
still see the ailerons...

813
01:09:18,709 --> 01:09:21,007
...the engine,
which was over there...

814
01:09:22,146 --> 01:09:23,841
...and the propeller.

815
01:09:27,818 --> 01:09:31,549
Grass didn't grow there before,
it was all burnt, remember?

816
01:10:30,514 --> 01:10:31,446
Nico!

817
01:10:32,249 --> 01:10:33,682
Nico!

818
01:10:34,218 --> 01:10:36,049
Come on, we're home.

819
01:10:41,659 --> 01:10:42,990
Nico!

820
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:45,854
You'll sleep better in bed!

821
01:11:10,254 --> 01:11:12,916
- Everything okay?
- Yes.

822
01:11:15,092 --> 01:11:17,652
- D'you want to dine out?
- No.

823
01:11:18,495 --> 01:11:21,794
- Come on, let's go.
- No, I'm not hungry.

824
01:11:23,934 --> 01:11:25,424
Nico...

825
01:11:25,903 --> 01:11:29,634
I've been thinking, we're
selling the house in Valdivia.

826
01:11:29,807 --> 01:11:32,207
- Really?
- Yes.

827
01:11:35,512 --> 01:11:38,140
What about
the summer holidays?

828
01:11:38,282 --> 01:11:40,216
Julio and the others?

829
01:11:40,484 --> 01:11:43,578
Don't know... it's been ten days
since I last heard of them.

830
01:11:46,623 --> 01:11:49,615
That's great. We don't have
to go there again, do we?

831
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:51,557
Whatever you like.

832
01:11:51,729 --> 01:11:53,560
I must go over there
to sign and all that.

833
01:11:53,697 --> 01:11:56,165
But only when a potential buyer
appears, not just yet.

834
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:57,699
Okay.

835
01:11:57,935 --> 01:12:01,803
There are several
messages for you.

836
01:12:04,041 --> 01:12:07,602
I just spoke to Santi's mother...
she said that she an Enrique...

837
01:12:07,745 --> 01:12:09,770
...will cope with everything
from now on.

838
01:12:09,913 --> 01:12:11,608
Hi, Nico,
this is your cousin Martín...

839
01:12:11,749 --> 01:12:13,410
...I wanted to ask you a favor...

840
01:12:14,017 --> 01:12:16,577
Hello! Nico, this is Luchi.

841
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:19,712
I just wanted to tell you my trip
was put forward, and...

842
01:12:19,857 --> 01:12:24,885
...well, I wanted to see you...
well, call me...

843
01:12:25,129 --> 01:12:26,528
...kiss...

844
01:12:33,804 --> 01:12:36,796
- Hello! Is Luchi here?
- Was there nobody in front?

845
01:12:37,274 --> 01:12:39,936
- No, is Luchi here?
- I don't know any Luchi.

846
01:12:40,077 --> 01:12:45,481
Luchi, she works here, she's from
Chile, she's the owner's sister.

847
01:12:45,649 --> 01:12:48,243
- Could be Luciana.
- Yes, could be, is she here?

848
01:12:48,519 --> 01:12:50,953
- No, she no longer works here.
- How come she doesn't?

849
01:12:51,088 --> 01:12:53,716
- No, she went off on a trip.
- Has she already left?

850
01:12:53,857 --> 01:12:55,950
Was leaving one of these days.
I think she was leaving today.

851
01:12:56,093 --> 01:12:59,585
- Today, at what time?
- I really don't know.

852
01:13:00,697 --> 01:13:02,062
Okay...

853
01:13:30,961 --> 01:13:33,486
Make me feel...

854
01:13:35,566 --> 01:13:39,832
...that things
do have a meaning...

855
01:13:41,772 --> 01:13:46,004
...that everything is not lost...

856
01:13:47,945 --> 01:13:51,005
...that there's still tomorrow.

857
01:13:54,284 --> 01:13:58,243
That I no longer need...

858
01:14:00,624 --> 01:14:04,583
...these pills...

859
01:14:06,830 --> 01:14:09,492
...to light me up...

860
01:14:13,070 --> 01:14:16,039
...to shine

861
01:14:22,946 --> 01:14:31,445
And I'll never think
of dying again

862
01:14:35,626 --> 01:14:43,931
And I'll never think
of dying again...

863
01:14:44,468 --> 01:14:46,993
If you are with me...

864
01:14:50,807 --> 01:14:53,640
...I want to be alive

865
01:14:58,615 --> 01:15:00,583
Believe me...

866
01:15:03,186 --> 01:15:07,714
...I've been through hell...

867
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:13,926
...and the taste of the gun
in my mouth...

868
01:15:15,766 --> 01:15:18,735
...is no longer a game

869
01:15:22,172 --> 01:15:27,075
In fact, my past...

870
01:15:28,078 --> 01:15:31,707
...is a whole mess

871
01:15:34,585 --> 01:15:37,679
If you want to change it...

872
01:15:40,991 --> 01:15:44,085
...I won't refuse.

873
01:15:50,901 --> 01:15:59,809
And I'll never think
of dying again

874
01:16:03,547 --> 01:16:11,716
And I'll never think
of dying again...

875
01:16:12,155 --> 01:16:15,124
If you are with me...

876
01:16:19,096 --> 01:16:22,065
...I want to be alive

877
01:17:38,442 --> 01:17:42,401
