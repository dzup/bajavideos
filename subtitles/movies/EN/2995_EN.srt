1
00:00:23,011 --> 00:00:26,852
SEX AND LUCIA

2
00:02:05,915 --> 00:02:07,161
Yes?

3
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:11,131
I'm sorry, Lorenzo.
For everything I said when I left.

4
00:02:11,371 --> 00:02:13,651
Yeah, but you were right

5
00:02:14,331 --> 00:02:16,131
You live with a sick person

6
00:02:17,131 --> 00:02:19,172
No, that's not true.

7
00:02:20,452 --> 00:02:22,132
I was too hard on you.

8
00:02:22,332 --> 00:02:24,372
Don't worry, Lucia
That's it

9
00:02:24,973 --> 00:02:28,773
I'm in a hole I've tried to
get out, but I can't

10
00:02:29,773 --> 00:02:31,613
I'm lost forever

11
00:02:32,294 --> 00:02:34,854
I'll take a few days off
and we'll take a trip.

12
00:02:35,814 --> 00:02:37,014
To your island.

13
00:02:37,454 --> 00:02:39,575
You can show me.
How about it?

14
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:44,455
Just the two of us.
It's calm this time of year.

15
00:02:44,655 --> 00:02:47,136
We'll swim and lay in the sun.

16
00:02:47,616 --> 00:02:49,656
I don't want to go to the island

17
00:02:51,936 --> 00:02:55,297
I don't understand you.
You always wanted to go back.

18
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,939
Relax, honey. Don't worry.

19
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:11,899
Look, wait up for me

20
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,220
and tell me tonight.

21
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,060
I'll listen to anything you say.

22
00:03:23,061 --> 00:03:25,821
Is that why you're so screwed up?

23
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:27,661
Something about the island?

24
00:03:27,862 --> 00:03:30,382
I'm sorry, I can't tell you about it

25
00:03:30,582 --> 00:03:33,702
You don't deserve this
You shouldn't know

26
00:03:33,902 --> 00:03:35,663
Lucía, we're slammed.

27
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,983
Sorry, I have to hang up.

28
00:03:39,183 --> 00:03:42,824
- We're slammed, but later...
- Yeah, slammed Bye

29
00:04:10,588 --> 00:04:12,868
Sorry, but I have to go.
Lorenzo needs me.

30
00:04:13,068 --> 00:04:16,548
If I were you, I'd take him to a shrink

31
00:04:33,471 --> 00:04:34,551
Lorenzo.

32
00:04:37,912 --> 00:04:38,952
Lorenzo.

33
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:17,437
Lorenzo?

34
00:05:17,637 --> 00:05:20,318
- Lorenzo Alvarez residence?
- Yes.

35
00:05:21,318 --> 00:05:23,598
Are you a family member?

36
00:05:23,878 --> 00:05:26,478
I'm his girlfriend,
I live with him. What is it?

37
00:05:26,678 --> 00:05:29,839
This is the police department
calling to inform you that

38
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:31,479
I've got some bad news

39
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:33,279
Don't wait up

40
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:36,080
I may never be back

41
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,600
You see, he

42
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,520
A car came along and

43
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,121
I don't know where to,
but faraway

44
00:05:43,321 --> 00:05:45,281
I leave you everything

45
00:05:45,481 --> 00:05:48,722
but me Forgive me
That's my last request

46
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,311
I'll live alone.

47
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:18,272
With no one else.

48
00:09:19,032 --> 00:09:20,592
I don't need people.

49
00:09:30,553 --> 00:09:31,954
What'll it be?

50
00:10:22,161 --> 00:10:23,241
Alone.

51
00:10:23,881 --> 00:10:25,321
Alone in the sun.

52
00:10:28,362 --> 00:10:29,242
No.

53
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:32,482
I'm not gonna swim.
I'll stay in the sun.

54
00:10:40,043 --> 00:10:41,123
Alone.

55
00:10:42,04 --> 00:10:44,044
Alone in the sun.

56
00:10:44,684 --> 00:10:46,924
Alone.
Alone in the sun.

57
00:12:01,775 --> 00:12:06,216
SEX
6 YEARS EARLIER

58
00:13:05,544 --> 00:13:07,504
The best fuck of my life.

59
00:13:09,305 --> 00:13:11,265
I don't even know your name.

60
00:13:11,465 --> 00:13:14,305
It's better that way.
Less complicated.

61
00:13:17,866 --> 00:13:19,266
Give me a hint.

62
00:13:19,706 --> 00:13:22,106
Anything. I'd like that.

63
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:25,787
Like a souvenir.
Where are you from?

64
00:13:27,547 --> 00:13:28,507
Madrid.

65
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:30,788
I'm from Valencia.

66
00:13:31,788 --> 00:13:33,028
Another one.

67
00:13:34,108 --> 00:13:36,989
Two more hints each
and we go our separate ways.

68
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:41,269
I'm a paella expert.

69
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:45,350
- That's logical.
- Not quite. Keep in mind

70
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,670
that you just fucked
a world-class cook.

71
00:13:51,311 --> 00:13:52,351
You're right.

72
00:13:52,871 --> 00:13:55,111
Everything was delicious.

73
00:13:55,311 --> 00:13:56,391
Of course.

74
00:13:58,912 --> 00:14:01,192
A little salty, though.

75
00:14:01,392 --> 00:14:02,552
What about you?

76
00:14:02,752 --> 00:14:03,912
Sure, lots.

77
00:14:04,112 --> 00:14:06,393
- Let's hear one.
- I was born in Madrid

78
00:14:07,073 --> 00:14:08,393
on this very day.

79
00:14:08,913 --> 00:14:10,153
Around this time.

80
00:14:12,674 --> 00:14:14,114
It's your birthday!

81
00:14:14,834 --> 00:14:15,834
Yes.

82
00:14:17,154 --> 00:14:19,195
My birthday boy from Madrid.

83
00:14:19,795 --> 00:14:21,755
What a great way to celebrate!

84
00:14:21,955 --> 00:14:24,355
I'm your paella chef
from Valencia.

85
00:14:24,555 --> 00:14:26,116
And your birthday gift.

86
00:14:26,596 --> 00:14:28,236
Hey, that's three things!

87
00:14:30,116 --> 00:14:31,756
You gave me only two.

88
00:14:32,396 --> 00:14:34,877
I'm going to look for the third.

89
00:15:04,201 --> 00:15:06,961
I've been calling all morning.

90
00:15:07,121 --> 00:15:09,282
It's not my fault he's so busy

91
00:15:09,482 --> 00:15:12,682
- Then whose fault is it?
- It's his job's fault

92
00:15:12,882 --> 00:15:16,363
Tell him to work less.
I'll call back later.

93
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:39,446
He still can't talk

94
00:15:39,726 --> 00:15:41,206
Can I leave him a message?

95
00:15:41,406 --> 00:15:44,487
Of course I'll pass it on

96
00:15:44,687 --> 00:15:45,927
Well, let's see.

97
00:15:46,047 --> 00:15:47,767
I'm pregnant.

98
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:50,648
Since I know it's not his,

99
00:15:50,848 --> 00:15:52,208
and I don't need him,

100
00:15:52,408 --> 00:15:54,648
tell him I'm going to find
my child's father.

101
00:15:54,848 --> 00:15:56,848
- You're leaving?
- That's right.

102
00:15:57,369 --> 00:15:59,729
I'll give you two
a little hint.

103
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:02,329
He's not from Valencia.

104
00:16:03,09 --> 00:16:05,610
Fine, one more hint.

105
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,690
I'm leaving right now for...
Madrid.

106
00:16:11,451 --> 00:16:14,931
They'll advance you 20 percent
of what they gave you last time.

107
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:18,332
- I couldn't ask for more.
- No, it's fine. Thanks, Pepe.

108
00:16:18,532 --> 00:16:20,052
It'll get me through winter.

109
00:16:20,252 --> 00:16:22,412
I'll have it ready by summer.

110
00:16:22,612 --> 00:16:25,373
Really?
You've been blocked two years.

111
00:16:28,213 --> 00:16:29,293
I'm figuring out

112
00:16:29,493 --> 00:16:30,733
if I'm really a writer.

113
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:33,534
You? A writer?

114
00:16:35,174 --> 00:16:36,494
To the core.

115
00:16:40,775 --> 00:16:44,415
What about that other story?
The one about the island.

116
00:16:44,615 --> 00:16:45,855
And the Valencian girl?

117
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,256
Maybe.

118
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:51,296
I'm going to buy smokes.

119
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:55,257
Put lots of sex in it.
That's always nice.

120
00:16:56,577 --> 00:16:57,697
Yeah, very.

121
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:02,298
Can I talk to you?

122
00:17:04,578 --> 00:17:05,458
Now?

123
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,219
Later, then.

124
00:17:09,379 --> 00:17:10,739
I'm with a friend.

125
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,140
What about?

126
00:17:26,701 --> 00:17:27,741
Well...

127
00:17:28,462 --> 00:17:29,862
Is something wrong?

128
00:17:32,782 --> 00:17:33,702
Yes.

129
00:17:34,662 --> 00:17:35,543
Tell me.

130
00:17:38,823 --> 00:17:39,783
Now?

131
00:17:40,783 --> 00:17:41,703
Yes.

132
00:18:00,066 --> 00:18:01,146
What's your name?

133
00:18:02,346 --> 00:18:03,387
Lucía.

134
00:18:03,987 --> 00:18:05,067
I'm Lorenzo.

135
00:18:05,267 --> 00:18:06,507
I know. I know you.

136
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:10,428
I read your novel.

137
00:18:11,468 --> 00:18:13,068
Many times, and...

138
00:18:13,388 --> 00:18:14,988
I can't read anything else.

139
00:18:16,468 --> 00:18:18,149
It grabbed me inside

140
00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:20,349
and won't let go.

141
00:18:22,029 --> 00:18:22,989
But...

142
00:18:23,509 --> 00:18:25,390
I've also followed you.

143
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,070
When I see you

144
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,030
I like to follow behind

145
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,591
and see where you go,

146
00:18:31,751 --> 00:18:32,711
in secret.

147
00:18:33,991 --> 00:18:35,271
I know where you live.

148
00:18:37,031 --> 00:18:37,951
It's nearby.

149
00:18:38,552 --> 00:18:39,592
And sometimes

150
00:18:39,832 --> 00:18:42,752
I see you here.
Do you recognize me?

151
00:18:43,512 --> 00:18:44,432
No.

152
00:18:47,353 --> 00:18:48,753
I'm a waitress

153
00:18:49,593 --> 00:18:50,953
in that restaurant.

154
00:18:51,513 --> 00:18:53,354
You've never come in.

155
00:18:57,114 --> 00:18:58,674
My boss is fine.

156
00:18:59,635 --> 00:19:01,235
He's a good cook.

157
00:19:02,635 --> 00:19:04,715
But he wants to live together,

158
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:06,676
and the truth is,

159
00:19:07,156 --> 00:19:08,676
I was really glad.

160
00:19:09,236 --> 00:19:10,356
Because...

161
00:19:10,556 --> 00:19:11,716
I felt needed.

162
00:19:13,117 --> 00:19:14,317
And I even like him.

163
00:19:15,637 --> 00:19:16,757
So...

164
00:19:18,677 --> 00:19:20,038
I've decided...

165
00:19:24,278 --> 00:19:25,198
What?

166
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:30,319
The person I really want
to live with is you.

167
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,439
It's not that you're lonely.

168
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:34,920
I'm completely in love with you.

169
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,480
Madly, as you can see.

170
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:45,521
You're so brave.

171
00:19:46,481 --> 00:19:47,401
Yeah.

172
00:19:48,722 --> 00:19:51,242
And it's over. I tried.

173
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,842
Did you enjoy that?

174
00:20:00,803 --> 00:20:02,364
Feel free to leave.

175
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,810
Is there anything else
you want?

176
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,170
Yes.

177
00:20:52,171 --> 00:20:54,491
With time, living together,

178
00:20:56,411 --> 00:20:59,452
you'll end up falling in love
with me, of course.

179
00:21:24,775 --> 00:21:26,536
I think I just did.

180
00:21:33,057 --> 00:21:35,657
Let's go get drunk and celebrate.

181
00:22:20,303 --> 00:22:21,383
What pretty lights

182
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:22,704
you have at home.

183
00:22:33,745 --> 00:22:36,146
I'm so happy.
You can't imagine.

184
00:22:40,466 --> 00:22:41,866
Go ahead and undress me.

185
00:22:49,867 --> 00:22:50,828
Forgive me, Lorenzo.

186
00:22:51,468 --> 00:22:53,188
I'm not used to
things working out.

187
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:11,311
Do whatever you want to me.

188
00:23:33,634 --> 00:23:36,554
You start, okay?

189
00:24:43,364 --> 00:24:45,524
A ray of sunshine

190
00:24:46,564 --> 00:24:48,324
Brought your love to me

191
00:25:17,929 --> 00:25:18,889
Slowly.

192
00:25:19,089 --> 00:25:21,689
With love.
We're just starting.

193
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:28,730
Like that.
So it lasts longer.

194
00:26:12,296 --> 00:26:14,097
I'm dying, I'm dying!

195
00:26:16,497 --> 00:26:17,417
My love!

196
00:26:20,858 --> 00:26:22,258
I'm gonna die!

197
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,221
It's delicious, Lorenzo.

198
00:26:41,341 --> 00:26:43,821
Wait until you try the fish.

199
00:26:45,461 --> 00:26:48,101
I've always been
around good cooks.

200
00:26:48,382 --> 00:26:49,622
I don't know why.

201
00:26:50,462 --> 00:26:52,942
Though my boss isn't around
much anymore.

202
00:26:54,062 --> 00:26:55,543
My grandmother, yes.

203
00:26:55,703 --> 00:26:57,543
With her home cooking...

204
00:26:59,223 --> 00:27:00,343
just for me.

205
00:27:01,303 --> 00:27:03,544
I moved in with her
when I was six.

206
00:27:04,144 --> 00:27:05,944
She said my parents and brother

207
00:27:06,104 --> 00:27:08,424
had opened a newsstand in heaven

208
00:27:08,624 --> 00:27:10,665
in front of the angel school.

209
00:27:11,745 --> 00:27:15,345
And a bookshop. Their stand
in the village never paid much.

210
00:27:16,546 --> 00:27:19,786
The three of them were killed
in a car crash.

211
00:27:20,346 --> 00:27:22,746
And my poor grandmother
two years ago...

212
00:27:23,747 --> 00:27:25,947
told me the whole story.

213
00:27:26,147 --> 00:27:27,387
I still believe it.

214
00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:30,268
I always liked people
who tell good stories.

215
00:27:31,388 --> 00:27:32,588
I trust them.

216
00:27:33,188 --> 00:27:35,988
Did your mother
teach you to cook?

217
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:39,389
No. She left my dad real quick,
when I was young.

218
00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:41,429
I had to cook for him.

219
00:27:41,629 --> 00:27:43,389
Until one day he got stabbed.

220
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,590
I may be

221
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:53,751
a shitty cook,
but I'm a great waitress.

222
00:27:55,511 --> 00:27:56,671
I have a camera.

223
00:29:05,961 --> 00:29:07,801
How about a striptease?

224
00:29:11,362 --> 00:29:14,242
Right now, without getting up.

225
00:29:14,442 --> 00:29:15,843
If you do one later.

226
00:29:16,243 --> 00:29:17,483
You wouldn't.

227
00:29:32,165 --> 00:29:34,445
I've got just what you want.

228
00:29:40,526 --> 00:29:42,566
Oh, how I knew...

229
00:29:42,766 --> 00:29:45,07
I've got just what you want

230
00:29:45,447 --> 00:29:50,047
Oh, how I knew
I've got just what you want

231
00:29:50,448 --> 00:29:52,528
It's all been taken care of,

232
00:29:52,728 --> 00:29:55,688
I'll settle the score,
remember

233
00:29:56,088 --> 00:29:57,169
I've got a map

234
00:29:58,329 --> 00:29:59,249
Gorgeous.

235
00:29:59,449 --> 00:30:02,729
and I'm one nosy bitch
I'm working on it

236
00:30:03,609 --> 00:30:07,170
I gotta do it,
I don't want to end up broke

237
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:09,650
My feet are my ticket

238
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,691
Had to be good at something

239
00:30:12,691 --> 00:30:14,731
I'm working on it

240
00:30:14,931 --> 00:30:16,491
I'm working on it

241
00:30:16,691 --> 00:30:17,891
I'm working on it

242
00:30:18,091 --> 00:30:19,972
I'm resourceful, baby!

243
00:30:20,172 --> 00:30:22,772
You turn me on,
saliva, milk and stuff

244
00:30:23,052 --> 00:30:24,612
I'm in control

245
00:32:02,946 --> 00:32:03,987
Lorenzo...

246
00:32:05,027 --> 00:32:06,587
Lorenzo, my love.

247
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:08,987
I can't take anymore.

248
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:12,668
So much love will kill me.

249
00:32:22,669 --> 00:32:23,709
I'm dying!

250
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,630
I'm dying!

251
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,991
Don't scream, it's no big deal!

252
00:32:38,031 --> 00:32:39,072
Push.

253
00:32:39,912 --> 00:32:41,992
That's it, a little more.

254
00:32:45,072 --> 00:32:46,593
Here it comes.

255
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:48,073
A little more.

256
00:32:48,393 --> 00:32:49,913
Here it comes.

257
00:33:03,795 --> 00:33:05,035
I'll get the dad.

258
00:33:05,795 --> 00:33:06,876
Yes, please.

259
00:33:14,317 --> 00:33:16,957
You see?
Shouting makes no difference.

260
00:33:23,758 --> 00:33:24,838
There's no one there.

261
00:33:25,478 --> 00:33:28,639
It's all right, my little girl
will help me find him.

262
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:31,279
Have you ever...

263
00:33:31,479 --> 00:33:33,039
with another girl...

264
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:34,960
had better sex?

265
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,400
No.

266
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,960
Tell me the truth.

267
00:33:41,241 --> 00:33:43,761
Maybe on an isolated occasion.

268
00:33:44,441 --> 00:33:46,01
But it's different.

269
00:33:47,121 --> 00:33:49,442
Isolated on the island, right?

270
00:33:51,122 --> 00:33:52,042
Yes.

271
00:33:54,682 --> 00:33:56,323
A random somebody,

272
00:33:56,683 --> 00:33:58,283
a total stranger,

273
00:33:58,643 --> 00:34:00,243
with a full moon...

274
00:34:03,764 --> 00:34:07,564
We should go to your island.
Separately, and meet there,

275
00:34:07,764 --> 00:34:09,044
like strangers.

276
00:34:09,205 --> 00:34:11,445
We'd have the best sex ever.

277
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:23,767
Which do you prefer?

278
00:34:24,607 --> 00:34:27,247
Wild sex with a stranger?

279
00:34:28,407 --> 00:34:30,568
Or sex with someone you know,

280
00:34:30,848 --> 00:34:32,248
someone you love,

281
00:34:32,448 --> 00:34:33,848
but also wild?

282
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:37,489
What?

283
00:34:39,769 --> 00:34:41,289
You have to choose.

284
00:34:41,689 --> 00:34:43,929
Wild sex with a stranger,

285
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:47,450
or wild sex with someone

286
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:50,450
who's crazy about you,
and who you love.

287
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:51,611
Go ahead.

288
00:34:51,811 --> 00:34:53,971
- Be frank.
- With you.

289
00:34:56,571 --> 00:34:57,651
Finally.

290
00:35:02,452 --> 00:35:04,372
I'd never imagined
being so lucky.

291
00:35:05,092 --> 00:35:06,333
Girls like you

292
00:35:06,533 --> 00:35:09,133
never like guys like me.

293
00:35:14,374 --> 00:35:15,934
You're a gift.

294
00:35:40,698 --> 00:35:42,738
The restaurant in Madrid
grew famous

295
00:35:42,938 --> 00:35:45,338
thanks to the paellas
made by the silent girl

296
00:35:46,138 --> 00:35:50,339
She still recalled her grandmother,
buried back home with her parents

297
00:35:51,019 --> 00:35:54,340
When asked where she was from,
she was so timid that

298
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,740
she'd say she was from Malta

299
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:03,301
Her destiny changed that night,
when she ran into a real Maltese

300
00:36:04,421 --> 00:36:07,141
A ray of sunshine

301
00:36:08,302 --> 00:36:10,782
Brought your love to me

302
00:36:11,822 --> 00:36:13,382
A ray of sunshine

303
00:36:15,663 --> 00:36:17,463
Straight to my heart

304
00:37:51,796 --> 00:37:53,797
- How's it going?
- Fine.

305
00:37:54,357 --> 00:37:56,917
Getting used to all this clean air.

306
00:37:57,437 --> 00:37:58,357
Yeah.

307
00:37:59,357 --> 00:38:03,158
You get used to everything here.
This island's easy.

308
00:38:04,318 --> 00:38:05,558
And you're a pro.

309
00:38:06,198 --> 00:38:08,759
Of course. You have oxygen.

310
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:11,639
I'm renting scuba equipment
this summer.

311
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,080
I'm testing it.

312
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,120
You like diving?

313
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,841
No, not me. Just the opposite.

314
00:38:22,561 --> 00:38:23,801
Sorry, but...

315
00:38:24,01 --> 00:38:26,801
I prefer open air.
Open air and sunshine.

316
00:38:27,681 --> 00:38:28,722
Too bad.

317
00:38:30,02 --> 00:38:31,802
These waters are special.

318
00:38:32,162 --> 00:38:33,562
To each his own.

319
00:38:45,444 --> 00:38:48,204
This really isn't an island.

320
00:38:50,205 --> 00:38:51,245
It isn't?

321
00:38:51,965 --> 00:38:53,525
It's a giant lid.

322
00:38:53,765 --> 00:38:55,805
A floating piece of earth.

323
00:38:56,165 --> 00:38:57,566
Like a raft.

324
00:38:59,926 --> 00:39:02,206
But it isn't moving.

325
00:39:04,327 --> 00:39:07,07
People get dizzy here
during high tide.

326
00:39:07,207 --> 00:39:09,07
And no one knows why.

327
00:39:09,927 --> 00:39:11,168
Except you.

328
00:39:12,08 --> 00:39:14,608
I've dived underneath
the whole island.

329
00:39:15,488 --> 00:39:17,369
It's totally hollow.

330
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:19,769
Thousands of caves,

331
00:39:21,209 --> 00:39:22,609
but nothing else.

332
00:39:23,449 --> 00:39:27,130
Not a single rock connects it
to the sea floor.

333
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:28,530
What's your name?

334
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:30,850
Carlos.

335
00:39:31,811 --> 00:39:32,891
I'm Lucía.

336
00:39:34,371 --> 00:39:35,771
Trust me, Lucía.

337
00:39:36,411 --> 00:39:37,851
I'll show you someday.

338
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:39,292
Okay.

339
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:42,532
But I'll stay up here.

340
00:39:42,732 --> 00:39:45,973
Right. The girl waits
on the pretty side,

341
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:47,733
and the crab explores the ugly,

342
00:39:48,413 --> 00:39:49,653
rocky,

343
00:39:50,373 --> 00:39:51,813
horrible side.

344
00:40:00,135 --> 00:40:01,575
You want to see the good things

345
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:03,015
on this island?

346
00:40:05,375 --> 00:40:06,215
Yeah.

347
00:40:07,856 --> 00:40:09,736
I want you to meet Elena.

348
00:40:32,019 --> 00:40:33,379
Hi, I'm Elena.

349
00:40:34,219 --> 00:40:35,300
Lucía.

350
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,900
Stay for dinner?

351
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:44,581
Okay.

352
00:40:44,781 --> 00:40:46,061
You can sleep here, too.

353
00:40:46,221 --> 00:40:47,901
It's a guest house.

354
00:40:48,502 --> 00:40:49,822
Carlos is alone,

355
00:40:50,022 --> 00:40:53,262
so I have 9 rooms free.
Want to see them?

356
00:40:55,222 --> 00:40:56,263
Come on.

357
00:40:59,543 --> 00:41:00,943
This is my room.

358
00:41:07,344 --> 00:41:09,585
Next to the kitchen
so I can cook on-line.

359
00:41:11,985 --> 00:41:12,785
Come on in.

360
00:41:13,425 --> 00:41:14,705
No, I'm sorry.

361
00:41:15,025 --> 00:41:16,386
I'm not ready to see

362
00:41:16,586 --> 00:41:18,066
other people up close.

363
00:41:21,066 --> 00:41:22,226
I know which room.

364
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:27,587
It's perfect for you.

365
00:41:28,307 --> 00:41:29,387
Come on.

366
00:41:32,188 --> 00:41:35,148
I leave the second floor vacant
until summer.

367
00:41:55,071 --> 00:41:56,911
3,000 a day in low season,

368
00:41:57,311 --> 00:41:59,192
but you can have it for 2,000.

369
00:41:59,352 --> 00:42:01,352
Plus 2,000 if you want board.

370
00:42:01,712 --> 00:42:04,912
I recommend it,
I'm the best cook around.

371
00:42:06,233 --> 00:42:09,273
Can I skip dinner
and stay tonight?

372
00:42:09,433 --> 00:42:10,833
We'll talk tomorrow.

373
00:42:12,033 --> 00:42:13,074
Of course.

374
00:42:16,954 --> 00:42:20,155
Something terrible happened
and I had to run.

375
00:42:23,835 --> 00:42:26,155
We'll take care of you here.

376
00:42:31,356 --> 00:42:33,196
A ray of sunshine

377
00:42:35,077 --> 00:42:36,957
Straight to my heart

378
00:42:38,077 --> 00:42:41,038
Brought your love to me

379
00:42:41,798 --> 00:42:44,878
I'd searched for so long

380
00:42:45,558 --> 00:42:47,158
And finally it's mine

381
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:48,639
I have a new guest.

382
00:42:49,479 --> 00:42:51,359
She's a fantastic singer.

383
00:42:52,279 --> 00:42:54,560
So from now on,
I'll cook even better.

384
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,800
If possible.

385
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,800
Can I name you?

386
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,441
Name? Yeah, Lucía.

387
00:43:08,642 --> 00:43:10,202
Are you writing it?

388
00:43:11,682 --> 00:43:13,122
It's still unsent.

389
00:43:14,602 --> 00:43:16,963
You can change your name
if you want.

390
00:43:17,163 --> 00:43:19,203
We all use nicknames.

391
00:43:21,883 --> 00:43:23,484
HER NAME'S LUCIA.

392
00:43:26,564 --> 00:43:28,324
A RAY OF SUNSHINE.

393
00:43:28,804 --> 00:43:30,045
Is that okay?

394
00:43:31,965 --> 00:43:33,125
It's great.

395
00:43:40,806 --> 00:43:41,886
Look.

396
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:43,527
This is for you.

397
00:43:45,567 --> 00:43:47,367
"Sing us something, Lucía".

398
00:43:55,248 --> 00:43:57,248
A RAY OF SUNSHINE...

399
00:44:00,649 --> 00:44:03,049
STRAIGHT TO MY HEART...

400
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:11,811
"Welcome, Lucía. Nice song.
Where are you?".

401
00:44:14,891 --> 00:44:18,692
EVERYDAY FURTHER AWAY
FROM WHERE I WAS.

402
00:44:19,372 --> 00:44:20,892
I like that.

403
00:44:22,772 --> 00:44:24,012
So would Carlos.

404
00:44:24,452 --> 00:44:25,453
For himself.

405
00:44:25,773 --> 00:44:27,613
He's been here 6 months.

406
00:44:27,973 --> 00:44:30,533
I sense he's still tied
to the mainland.

407
00:44:32,133 --> 00:44:35,014
He's someone
who gains your trust easily.

408
00:44:36,334 --> 00:44:38,054
Is there anything between you?

409
00:44:38,254 --> 00:44:40,295
Yeah, sex.

410
00:44:41,815 --> 00:44:43,335
Every now and then.

411
00:44:44,695 --> 00:44:46,255
Without intimacy.

412
00:44:48,456 --> 00:44:51,616
I prefer it,
this way I don't get hooked.

413
00:44:52,496 --> 00:44:54,857
Just wild sex.

414
00:44:56,337 --> 00:44:58,177
It must be the island.

415
00:44:59,817 --> 00:45:01,138
Yeah, but...

416
00:45:02,738 --> 00:45:06,418
Carlos has the biggest dick
I've ever seen.

417
00:45:06,898 --> 00:45:08,139
How lucky.

418
00:45:11,219 --> 00:45:14,099
I don't know where he got it.
It's enormous.

419
00:46:12,788 --> 00:46:14,108
Where are you?

420
00:46:14,388 --> 00:46:15,708
The abortion part.

421
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:26,430
Is that a hint?

422
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,110
Why don't you take a stroll?

423
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:29,390
I am.

424
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:31,831
In the street.

425
00:46:32,551 --> 00:46:34,751
You're like an expectant father.

426
00:46:35,071 --> 00:46:36,111
Exactly.

427
00:46:38,792 --> 00:46:40,312
And you're the mother.

428
00:47:21,918 --> 00:47:25,438
It's very positive.
There's lots of happiness.

429
00:47:26,278 --> 00:47:28,959
It's me. I was expecting
something tragic.

430
00:47:29,159 --> 00:47:30,759
Like in your first novel.

431
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:36,440
I should have read it
while you were writing,

432
00:47:37,00 --> 00:47:38,840
to get used to the idea.

433
00:47:41,00 --> 00:47:43,201
I screwed up. I'm sorry.

434
00:47:43,601 --> 00:47:45,401
I'm going for a walk.

435
00:47:49,042 --> 00:47:51,242
I didn't grab your heart
this time.

436
00:47:51,842 --> 00:47:53,722
I guess I already have it.

437
00:48:06,324 --> 00:48:09,405
Remember that birthday
when you were on the island?

438
00:48:09,605 --> 00:48:11,645
You sure got a great gift.

439
00:48:12,805 --> 00:48:16,806
Get ready, because tonight
I've got another for you.

440
00:48:17,06 --> 00:48:19,886
- From me.
- Are you proposing?

441
00:48:21,206 --> 00:48:22,606
Remember my sister?

442
00:48:22,926 --> 00:48:24,327
The one who's a nurse?

443
00:48:25,207 --> 00:48:28,327
Well, she's become
close friends with a girl

444
00:48:29,647 --> 00:48:33,128
whose baby she helped deliver
four years ago.

445
00:48:33,688 --> 00:48:35,088
A little girl.

446
00:48:40,889 --> 00:48:42,729
Speaking of girls...

447
00:48:43,569 --> 00:48:46,090
How's the novel? All the stalling...

448
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:48,450
What do I tell my editors?

449
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:51,210
- You always think of something.
- Sure,

450
00:48:51,411 --> 00:48:55,171
that's why you get
all your stories from me.

451
00:48:57,811 --> 00:49:00,212
Write this one as is.
It's unbelievable.

452
00:49:01,372 --> 00:49:02,452
Why's that?

453
00:49:02,932 --> 00:49:04,372
By the way, don't worry

454
00:49:04,572 --> 00:49:08,213
about my sister, she doesn't know
it's you. Or the mother

455
00:49:08,373 --> 00:49:11,013
who gave birth,
I don't even know her.

456
00:49:11,693 --> 00:49:13,494
I kept you secret.

457
00:49:14,174 --> 00:49:15,214
Why secret?

458
00:49:16,534 --> 00:49:17,494
Well,

459
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:20,175
the baby girl was born
here in Madrid.

460
00:49:20,855 --> 00:49:23,095
But she was conceived
on a beach,

461
00:49:23,775 --> 00:49:25,015
on an island,

462
00:49:26,095 --> 00:49:27,696
a night like tonight,

463
00:49:28,856 --> 00:49:30,416
with a stranger...

464
00:49:30,616 --> 00:49:31,856
from Madrid.

465
00:49:32,856 --> 00:49:34,737
It was his birthday.

466
00:49:38,137 --> 00:49:40,698
If you write this well,
it'll be the story of your life

467
00:49:41,498 --> 00:49:43,898
and my birthday gift to you.

468
00:49:46,258 --> 00:49:49,979
I know where to find the kid.
Afternoons in a square.

469
00:49:51,419 --> 00:49:52,699
Without the mother.

470
00:49:53,779 --> 00:49:55,100
What's her name?

471
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:56,340
The mother?

472
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:58,460
No, the daughter.

473
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:00,620
Your daughter's name is Luna.

474
00:50:03,581 --> 00:50:05,461
Of course. Luna.

475
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:17,991
What's your name?

476
00:51:19,112 --> 00:51:19,992
Luna.

477
00:51:28,233 --> 00:51:29,993
What's the sun's name?

478
00:51:33,314 --> 00:51:35,234
- Lorenzo.
- Lorenzo.

479
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:37,994
Just like me.

480
00:51:38,314 --> 00:51:40,195
What's the moon's name?

481
00:51:40,395 --> 00:51:41,355
You want the job?

482
00:51:41,675 --> 00:51:42,475
Yes.

483
00:51:42,795 --> 00:51:44,835
Then the moon's name is Luna.

484
00:51:53,517 --> 00:51:55,357
Today was an important day.

485
00:52:10,039 --> 00:52:11,559
You don't know your father?

486
00:52:12,439 --> 00:52:13,479
You've never seen him?

487
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,040
Do you know his name?

488
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:18,960
No.

489
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,441
Don't worry, names don't matter.

490
00:52:26,521 --> 00:52:27,841
Would you like it if

491
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:31,682
I were your dad?

492
00:52:34,642 --> 00:52:35,723
Could you be?

493
00:52:36,363 --> 00:52:38,443
Yeah, if you want me to be.

494
00:52:40,083 --> 00:52:41,323
But in secret.

495
00:52:41,723 --> 00:52:43,244
My real father?

496
00:52:47,484 --> 00:52:51,885
He thought it was a very big secret
for such a small little girl

497
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:53,605
His smile faded

498
00:52:54,05 --> 00:52:57,486
Then he went over
and sat alongside her

499
00:52:57,726 --> 00:53:01,206
You know what happens
if someone discovers the secret

500
00:53:01,566 --> 00:53:03,727
between the moon and the sun?

501
00:53:06,847 --> 00:53:08,407
The tide would drop...

502
00:53:09,647 --> 00:53:10,768
and drop...

503
00:53:11,928 --> 00:53:13,528
with a sound like:

504
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:26,810
Like mountains caving in.

505
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:37,811
Maybe someday he'd find a way
to tell her,

506
00:53:38,011 --> 00:53:41,012
so for the time being
he left it at that

507
00:53:42,012 --> 00:53:44,252
What was the point of being a father

508
00:53:44,532 --> 00:53:46,253
if she didn't know?

509
00:53:49,173 --> 00:53:51,573
He knew then that
if he'd told her,

510
00:53:52,253 --> 00:53:54,654
she'd have kept the secret

511
00:53:57,054 --> 00:53:58,134
Secret

512
00:54:06,175 --> 00:54:07,456
You have a daughter?

513
00:54:09,816 --> 00:54:11,536
Lorenzo, honey.

514
00:54:13,697 --> 00:54:14,657
Do you?

515
00:54:16,057 --> 00:54:17,217
Why do you ask?

516
00:54:17,737 --> 00:54:19,377
I saw it on your computer.

517
00:54:20,778 --> 00:54:21,978
And I loved it.

518
00:54:22,498 --> 00:54:24,258
I can't keep writing it.

519
00:54:24,538 --> 00:54:25,538
Why not?

520
00:54:25,698 --> 00:54:27,619
I don't know what it is
to be a father.

521
00:54:27,779 --> 00:54:30,139
Then make it up.

522
00:54:44,701 --> 00:54:46,781
I'm glad you're writing again.

523
00:54:47,301 --> 00:54:49,182
I was feeling guilty.

524
00:54:50,462 --> 00:54:51,942
None of it is your fault.

525
00:55:03,024 --> 00:55:04,904
Luna doesn't know her dad.

526
00:55:06,184 --> 00:55:07,784
She lives alone with her mom?

527
00:55:07,944 --> 00:55:10,345
No, with a dumb soccer player.

528
00:55:13,385 --> 00:55:15,425
I've never seen my dad.

529
00:55:18,706 --> 00:55:19,786
Me, neither.

530
00:55:22,506 --> 00:55:24,267
My mother's an actress.

531
00:55:24,747 --> 00:55:27,467
A porn actress.

532
00:55:29,707 --> 00:55:30,788
I like that.

533
00:55:31,148 --> 00:55:32,908
She quit last year.

534
00:55:33,548 --> 00:55:35,388
She met this amazing guy

535
00:55:35,668 --> 00:55:38,269
who was a client,
and fell for him.

536
00:55:39,429 --> 00:55:41,029
Now we live together.

537
00:55:41,869 --> 00:55:43,709
He retired her.

538
00:55:44,309 --> 00:55:45,710
Sounds nice.

539
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:47,950
He's the sweetest guy...

540
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:51,070
He has the biggest heart ever

541
00:55:51,471 --> 00:55:53,351
And he's handsome

542
00:55:53,711 --> 00:55:55,471
He's really sexy

543
00:55:56,911 --> 00:55:58,111
You like him, too?

544
00:55:58,672 --> 00:55:59,552
Me?

545
00:56:01,552 --> 00:56:02,992
Why? Can you tell?

546
00:56:07,953 --> 00:56:09,233
You like him a lot?

547
00:56:10,673 --> 00:56:11,953
Okay, drop it.

548
00:56:17,394 --> 00:56:18,954
Would you do him?

549
00:56:19,154 --> 00:56:22,675
No! He's my mother's lover.

550
00:56:23,315 --> 00:56:25,635
Poor thing,
she's in love for once.

551
00:56:27,436 --> 00:56:29,396
Do you think he likes you?

552
00:56:35,437 --> 00:56:38,797
If he offered,
and your mom never found out?

553
00:56:38,997 --> 00:56:40,718
Just once, as a test.

554
00:56:41,238 --> 00:56:42,678
A test, right?

555
00:56:43,798 --> 00:56:45,878
This is between you and me.

556
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:50,359
Just once?

557
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,519
Yeah. Why not?

558
00:56:56,00 --> 00:56:59,480
Because. I don't know...
I hope I never get

559
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,841
put to the test.

560
00:57:03,641 --> 00:57:05,561
But she put him to the test

561
00:57:06,681 --> 00:57:09,522
One morning when her mother
was shopping,

562
00:57:10,402 --> 00:57:13,322
she took a shower
and left the door open

563
00:58:01,249 --> 00:58:03,09
It almost happened.

564
00:58:03,209 --> 00:58:04,249
What did?

565
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:07,650
The test. With Antonio.

566
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:12,291
Tell me about it.

567
00:58:14,531 --> 00:58:17,091
Last night,
when they went to bed,

568
00:58:18,371 --> 00:58:21,012
I put one of my mom's movies on.

569
00:58:22,212 --> 00:58:23,652
It's strange, but...

570
00:58:24,172 --> 00:58:26,493
Seeing her in action
gets me hot.

571
00:58:27,613 --> 00:58:29,213
You masturbated.

572
00:58:29,413 --> 00:58:31,013
You always guess.

573
00:58:32,934 --> 00:58:34,774
I took one of her dildos

574
00:58:34,974 --> 00:58:37,214
from her room while they slept.

575
00:58:39,815 --> 00:58:42,375
I lay naked on the sofa,

576
00:58:43,655 --> 00:58:44,855
in the dark,

577
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:46,776
in front of the TV.

578
00:58:47,456 --> 00:58:50,016
I started copying
her sexual positions.

579
00:59:47,504 --> 00:59:49,184
Their lust almost killed them

580
00:59:52,025 --> 00:59:53,265
He covered her mouth

581
00:59:53,465 --> 00:59:55,585
so her mother wouldn't wake up

582
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:26,990
We decided not to tell my mom

583
01:00:27,350 --> 01:00:29,710
And to never do it again

584
01:00:31,671 --> 01:00:35,191
I promised Antonio
I'd find myself a boyfriend

585
01:00:35,671 --> 01:00:38,552
right away so I'd have someone
to play with.

586
01:00:41,952 --> 01:00:45,432
Here, I'll loan you my mom
for a couple days.

587
01:00:51,993 --> 01:00:54,314
I masturbated because of you,

588
01:00:54,434 --> 01:00:56,594
but ended up thinking of him.

589
01:00:57,914 --> 01:00:59,474
But we didn't do it.

590
01:01:00,355 --> 01:01:02,555
I'm not even sure I saw him

591
01:01:03,795 --> 01:01:05,235
I just felt him

592
01:01:05,435 --> 01:01:07,756
Spying on me from behind

593
01:01:09,116 --> 01:01:10,476
At least I think so.

594
01:01:46,401 --> 01:01:47,801
How nice!

595
01:01:48,201 --> 01:01:50,682
You never greet me this way anymore.

596
01:01:53,642 --> 01:01:56,123
I should get home early every night.

597
01:01:58,963 --> 01:02:00,363
Your mom was great.

598
01:02:00,803 --> 01:02:01,803
Quite an actress.

599
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:03,964
You got off?

600
01:02:04,644 --> 01:02:05,564
Yes.

601
01:02:07,084 --> 01:02:08,284
If only I'd seen you

602
01:02:10,285 --> 01:02:12,405
through a hole in the wall.

603
01:02:12,925 --> 01:02:14,845
Are you Belén's boyfriend?

604
01:02:17,046 --> 01:02:18,606
Would you like him to be?

605
01:02:18,726 --> 01:02:20,686
Yeah, sure.

606
01:02:21,166 --> 01:02:22,806
Then that's that.

607
01:02:40,289 --> 01:02:41,769
I have to sleep

608
01:02:41,889 --> 01:02:44,449
at Luna's tonight.
Her parents are going out.

609
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:50,730
I can ask if my boyfriend
can come along.

610
01:02:52,131 --> 01:02:53,451
She's really cool.

611
01:02:55,491 --> 01:02:57,091
What's her name?

612
01:02:57,611 --> 01:02:58,772
Elena.

613
01:03:00,172 --> 01:03:01,092
Well,

614
01:03:03,132 --> 01:03:06,693
I'd prefer just to see you and Luna,
no one else.

615
01:03:15,934 --> 01:03:17,374
Why the boyfriend?

616
01:03:17,494 --> 01:03:19,214
Can't they wait?

617
01:03:19,334 --> 01:03:22,215
She asked me as a special favor.
Maybe they can't.

618
01:03:22,335 --> 01:03:24,455
- They'll fuck.
- Good for them.

619
01:03:24,535 --> 01:03:27,416
We don't even know him.
And in our bed?

620
01:03:28,736 --> 01:03:30,696
You're just like your dog.

621
01:03:35,897 --> 01:03:38,337
Hi, boyfriend.
The doors are open.

622
01:03:46,698 --> 01:03:49,659
Be nice to him
or I'll have you fixed.

623
01:03:49,779 --> 01:03:51,019
You hear me?

624
01:04:04,421 --> 01:04:05,381
Delicious.

625
01:04:06,421 --> 01:04:07,821
You're a great cook.

626
01:04:11,782 --> 01:04:14,302
And what do you do?

627
01:04:22,824 --> 01:04:24,184
You won't tell me?

628
01:04:32,185 --> 01:04:33,345
I'll find out later.

629
01:04:42,826 --> 01:04:43,827
I want some water.

630
01:04:48,667 --> 01:04:51,388
Before I met Luna
I thought I'd never have kids.

631
01:04:54,268 --> 01:04:56,588
Wouldn't you want
a daughter like her?

632
01:04:59,989 --> 01:05:01,109
Of course.

633
01:05:02,149 --> 01:05:03,069
To me...

634
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:05,870
You'll always be my first.

635
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:07,950
And to you?

636
01:05:09,110 --> 01:05:10,790
The first and only.

637
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:39,555
Can I watch TV?

638
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:43,995
It's late, go to bed.

639
01:05:45,635 --> 01:05:47,516
If Lorenzo tucks me in.

640
01:05:47,596 --> 01:05:50,076
You'll have to show me where.

641
01:05:53,797 --> 01:05:54,717
And a kiss?

642
01:06:21,641 --> 01:06:25,241
- Can you tell stories?
- Of course, that's my job.

643
01:06:50,925 --> 01:06:53,885
Did you know that island
has the lowest moon?

644
01:06:56,525 --> 01:06:59,046
That's right.
But only a few of us

645
01:06:59,246 --> 01:07:01,606
in the world know it.
It also has

646
01:07:01,806 --> 01:07:04,647
great weather,
and it grants wishes.

647
01:07:05,447 --> 01:07:08,607
If you need something,
the rocks below the shore

648
01:07:08,807 --> 01:07:10,608
give it to you as a gift.

649
01:07:11,648 --> 01:07:14,368
But watch out for the holes
in the ground.

650
01:07:17,809 --> 01:07:19,609
Though it doesn't matter,
because

651
01:07:19,809 --> 01:07:21,409
no one ever dies there.

652
01:07:21,609 --> 01:07:25,450
For example, if you fall,
you can choose any life you want.

653
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:27,730
You can be your favorite fish.

654
01:07:53,614 --> 01:07:56,494
The island was glad
when the girl arrived,

655
01:07:56,654 --> 01:07:58,494
especially the rocks
below the shore,

656
01:07:58,614 --> 01:08:01,135
so they decided
to give her something.

657
01:08:01,335 --> 01:08:02,255
But what?

658
01:08:04,055 --> 01:08:05,215
A raft.

659
01:08:05,815 --> 01:08:06,976
Bigger.

660
01:08:08,176 --> 01:08:09,096
A dog.

661
01:08:09,416 --> 01:08:11,976
No. Something she didn't have.

662
01:08:12,616 --> 01:08:13,737
Her father.

663
01:08:15,817 --> 01:08:17,937
Bull's-eye, butterfly.

664
01:08:50,142 --> 01:08:52,262
Tonight you keep watch outside.

665
01:08:56,383 --> 01:08:58,383
All she had to do was

666
01:08:58,703 --> 01:09:01,863
look everywhere for him
until she found him.

667
01:09:03,064 --> 01:09:05,864
Her father could be
whoever she wanted.

668
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:11,385
But then the girl had doubts,
like everyone.

669
01:09:11,905 --> 01:09:15,305
Would she choose a lighthouse keeper
or a fisherman?

670
01:09:15,745 --> 01:09:18,546
She knew one thing:
what she really wanted

671
01:09:18,746 --> 01:09:21,946
was her mother to become
a beautiful mermaid.

672
01:09:31,748 --> 01:09:33,028
She's asleep.

673
01:09:41,909 --> 01:09:44,630
Belén, I want you to know something.

674
01:09:47,030 --> 01:09:49,470
I changed into this,
do you mind?

675
01:13:37,863 --> 01:13:39,863
Hi, it's Elena

676
01:13:40,543 --> 01:13:41,903
Is Belén there?

677
01:13:42,664 --> 01:13:43,544
Yes.

678
01:13:44,424 --> 01:13:45,824
It's Elena.

679
01:13:53,625 --> 01:13:54,545
Hello?

680
01:13:55,145 --> 01:13:57,386
- How are you?
- Better.

681
01:13:57,546 --> 01:13:59,386
I'm improving.

682
01:14:00,746 --> 01:14:01,786
And you?

683
01:14:02,346 --> 01:14:04,467
Well, I haven't cried.

684
01:14:05,467 --> 01:14:07,787
I can't.
I haven't seen her.

685
01:14:07,947 --> 01:14:11,028
They told me,
but I don't understand.

686
01:14:11,748 --> 01:14:14,788
I don't want to imagine it.
That's why I came here.

687
01:14:15,108 --> 01:14:18,629
To be closer to her
by swimming in the sea.

688
01:14:22,429 --> 01:14:23,429
Cry, Belén

689
01:14:24,109 --> 01:14:25,430
Now that you can.

690
01:14:29,790 --> 01:14:32,511
It helps me to hear you cry.

691
01:14:35,311 --> 01:14:36,551
That's it

692
01:14:36,871 --> 01:14:37,831
Cry

693
01:14:37,991 --> 01:14:38,872
Cry

694
01:14:39,152 --> 01:14:40,552
You need to cry.

695
01:14:43,472 --> 01:14:45,152
She hears you, too

696
01:14:46,513 --> 01:14:49,353
A big kiss from the sea...

697
01:14:49,793 --> 01:14:51,073
from both of us.

698
01:15:01,475 --> 01:15:03,675
Lately you're always in bed.

699
01:15:03,875 --> 01:15:05,435
You know what time it is?

700
01:15:07,716 --> 01:15:10,716
It's a beautiful day.
Sunny and clear.

701
01:15:12,436 --> 01:15:14,077
And it's my day off.

702
01:15:14,637 --> 01:15:16,477
Get up, lazybones!

703
01:15:20,838 --> 01:15:21,958
You need all

704
01:15:22,118 --> 01:15:24,038
these pills just to sleep?

705
01:15:25,158 --> 01:15:27,839
You never had problems
sleeping before.

706
01:15:31,119 --> 01:15:32,479
Lorenzo, honey.

707
01:15:33,999 --> 01:15:37,440
I'm worried about you.
You've been depressed for days.

708
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:38,800
Trouble with the novel?

709
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:41,520
Is that it?

710
01:15:43,721 --> 01:15:45,281
You look terrible.

711
01:15:46,601 --> 01:15:47,761
Something's happened.

712
01:15:47,961 --> 01:15:48,882
What?

713
01:15:52,922 --> 01:15:54,162
You're sweating.

714
01:15:54,842 --> 01:15:57,963
I've left,
and there's no coming back.

715
01:15:58,163 --> 01:15:59,203
Your life

716
01:15:59,403 --> 01:16:01,323
is more important
than your novel.

717
01:16:01,483 --> 01:16:02,844
Than any novel.

718
01:16:03,04 --> 01:16:06,284
Writing is vital to you, but
you need to take care of yourself.

719
01:16:06,644 --> 01:16:10,925
You're too good a person to see
the shit I have inside.

720
01:16:11,085 --> 01:16:12,045
Stop, that's enough.

721
01:16:12,245 --> 01:16:13,365
I have a confession.

722
01:16:13,565 --> 01:16:15,765
So you see how close I am.

723
01:16:16,726 --> 01:16:18,286
I've been reading the novel.

724
01:16:18,966 --> 01:16:20,566
Everything you've written.

725
01:16:20,726 --> 01:16:23,847
At night, when you're asleep.
Do you mind?

726
01:16:24,527 --> 01:16:25,527
I understand

727
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:28,407
why you're so affected,
why you reject it,

728
01:16:28,607 --> 01:16:30,808
and why it's hard for you
to go on.

729
01:16:31,08 --> 01:16:33,048
It can't be easy, living there,

730
01:16:33,248 --> 01:16:34,608
in that house,

731
01:16:34,808 --> 01:16:36,968
with that stormy relationship.

732
01:16:37,088 --> 01:16:40,689
So much repressed desire,
impossible to control.

733
01:16:41,809 --> 01:16:45,010
He's coming between
a mother and her daughter,

734
01:16:45,210 --> 01:16:46,770
breaking a sacred bond.

735
01:16:47,090 --> 01:16:49,770
But the passion's there, too.
The lust.

736
01:16:57,011 --> 01:16:58,651
I identify with her.

737
01:16:58,852 --> 01:17:01,132
I understand exactly
how she feels.

738
01:17:01,412 --> 01:17:04,052
Disgusted, guilty, selfish...

739
01:17:04,252 --> 01:17:05,372
Her mom's jealousy...

740
01:17:05,572 --> 01:17:07,613
But she's forced to choose

741
01:17:07,773 --> 01:17:10,093
between passionate love
for a man,

742
01:17:10,293 --> 01:17:11,773
and love for a mother.

743
01:17:12,373 --> 01:17:16,094
I'd have chosen the same.
Such decisions are made

744
01:17:16,294 --> 01:17:17,974
by gut instinct.

745
01:17:18,174 --> 01:17:19,134
Sex...

746
01:17:19,334 --> 01:17:21,655
The thick, burning lust

747
01:17:21,895 --> 01:17:23,215
filled the mother,

748
01:17:23,415 --> 01:17:24,975
the man and the daughter.

749
01:17:26,615 --> 01:17:27,856
They were sex-crazed

750
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:29,776
The stench of raw sex

751
01:17:30,696 --> 01:17:31,696
The mother and the man,

752
01:17:35,457 --> 01:17:36,577
the man and the daughter,

753
01:17:37,497 --> 01:17:38,657
the daughter and the man

754
01:17:39,937 --> 01:17:41,138
All the man's poisoned love...

755
01:17:41,338 --> 01:17:44,058
Alone with the daughter,
the daughter and the man

756
01:17:44,218 --> 01:17:45,378
The smell was...

757
01:17:45,578 --> 01:17:47,899
heavy, hot, overwhelming

758
01:17:48,099 --> 01:17:49,059
Stuffy

759
01:17:49,259 --> 01:17:50,539
Stale air.

760
01:17:51,739 --> 01:17:52,819
Exhausted

761
01:18:03,821 --> 01:18:06,341
The paint fell from the corners
of the room

762
01:18:06,701 --> 01:18:08,862
and the walls became rocky,

763
01:18:09,982 --> 01:18:11,782
Like those in a cave.

764
01:18:12,862 --> 01:18:14,902
A filthy den of...

765
01:18:16,543 --> 01:18:17,423
Get out!

766
01:18:19,423 --> 01:18:20,303
Relax.

767
01:18:21,543 --> 01:18:24,024
Just wanted to let you know
that I'm here.

768
01:18:42,066 --> 01:18:44,587
The man was selfish, a coward.

769
01:18:45,187 --> 01:18:49,187
He hated himself so deeply,
so utterly, there wasn't even

770
01:18:49,587 --> 01:18:51,428
time for forgiveness.

771
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:53,948
Only time for death.

772
01:18:54,308 --> 01:18:55,908
Death, death,

773
01:18:56,868 --> 01:18:58,709
death, death.

774
01:18:59,789 --> 01:19:00,829
Belén's fine.

775
01:19:01,069 --> 01:19:03,149
She's home with her family.

776
01:19:03,629 --> 01:19:05,310
Forget the whole thing.

777
01:19:05,590 --> 01:19:07,070
You've suffered enough.

778
01:19:08,470 --> 01:19:10,510
Will I ever read the novel?

779
01:19:10,670 --> 01:19:11,630
Of course.

780
01:19:15,271 --> 01:19:16,351
Another thing.

781
01:19:17,591 --> 01:19:19,592
Tell me about Elena, too.

782
01:19:19,992 --> 01:19:21,872
My sister writes to her on-line.

783
01:19:22,072 --> 01:19:25,072
She's on that Mediterranean
cooking chat everyday.

784
01:19:25,272 --> 01:19:27,433
- Her user name is "Alsi".
- "Alsi"?

785
01:19:27,633 --> 01:19:28,513
A-L-S-l.

786
01:19:30,673 --> 01:19:33,354
That's Spanish
for "island" backwards.

787
01:19:33,754 --> 01:19:35,554
Hi, Alsi How are you?

788
01:19:38,554 --> 01:19:39,955
I don't know you.

789
01:19:40,635 --> 01:19:43,395
It's better that way.
I'm here to help.

790
01:19:46,035 --> 01:19:47,076
What's your user name?

791
01:19:47,196 --> 01:19:48,996
I don't understand the icon.

792
01:19:49,836 --> 01:19:51,956
It's a lighthouse for your island.

793
01:19:52,156 --> 01:19:53,516
Are you the keeper?

794
01:19:53,837 --> 01:19:54,837
Yeah.

795
01:19:56,437 --> 01:19:59,797
I have a story for you,
it's full of advantages.

796
01:20:00,718 --> 01:20:01,878
I'd like that.

797
01:20:03,798 --> 01:20:04,718
Thanks.

798
01:20:07,518 --> 01:20:10,679
The first advantage
is at the end of the story.

799
01:20:10,879 --> 01:20:13,999
It doesn't finish,
it falls in a hole.

800
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:19,520
And the story
starts again halfway.

801
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:22,961
The other advantage,
and the biggest,

802
01:20:23,761 --> 01:20:26,801
is that you can change course
along the way

803
01:20:27,121 --> 01:20:29,882
If you let me.
If you give me time.

804
01:20:32,242 --> 01:20:35,162
All the time you want.

805
01:20:36,563 --> 01:20:38,203
Go on, please

806
01:21:12,608 --> 01:21:13,888
To be continued

807
01:21:22,689 --> 01:21:24,970
What happened?
Why are you so late?

808
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:27,090
My boss invited me to dinner.

809
01:21:27,290 --> 01:21:29,810
He wanted me to try a new dish.

810
01:21:30,210 --> 01:21:31,650
Did you screw him?

811
01:21:32,171 --> 01:21:33,251
What?

812
01:21:34,171 --> 01:21:36,291
Did you go to bed with him?

813
01:21:40,292 --> 01:21:43,332
That's right, you guessed it.

814
01:21:48,013 --> 01:21:49,853
And how was it?

815
01:21:50,253 --> 01:21:52,293
- Tell me about it.
- No.

816
01:21:52,734 --> 01:21:53,894
You first.

817
01:21:54,814 --> 01:21:56,214
What's going on?

818
01:21:56,414 --> 01:21:57,654
What's your problem?

819
01:21:58,534 --> 01:22:00,615
I lost track of you ages ago.

820
01:22:01,135 --> 01:22:02,615
You're not alive!

821
01:22:03,935 --> 01:22:05,495
Was it the first time with him?

822
01:22:06,896 --> 01:22:07,976
The second.

823
01:22:08,896 --> 01:22:11,016
The first was before we met.

824
01:22:11,976 --> 01:22:13,536
Or should I say
before I proposed?

825
01:22:14,017 --> 01:22:15,617
So it doesn't count.

826
01:22:18,097 --> 01:22:21,498
You could have told me before.

827
01:22:22,178 --> 01:22:24,058
Yeah, I could have.

828
01:22:25,538 --> 01:22:26,458
And today?

829
01:22:28,179 --> 01:22:29,099
Well...

830
01:22:30,539 --> 01:22:32,139
It doesn't count, either.

831
01:22:32,459 --> 01:22:33,419
It's a lie.

832
01:22:34,419 --> 01:22:36,060
But we came close.

833
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:39,860
How close?

834
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:42,701
Did you stop or did he?

835
01:22:43,061 --> 01:22:45,661
What about you stopping with me?

836
01:22:56,903 --> 01:23:00,063
Lorenzo, do you love me?

837
01:23:01,063 --> 01:23:04,384
I need to hear you say it
right now.

838
01:23:08,624 --> 01:23:10,865
Yes. Deeply.

839
01:23:11,865 --> 01:23:14,385
More than myself. But I'm lost.

840
01:23:15,945 --> 01:23:17,546
Then let me help you.

841
01:23:17,906 --> 01:23:19,506
You don't deserve this.

842
01:23:19,706 --> 01:23:22,026
Why not? I'm your girlfriend,

843
01:23:22,906 --> 01:23:25,027
and I love you more than myself.

844
01:23:25,147 --> 01:23:27,787
Come on, it's obvious.
You're draining my life away.

845
01:23:27,947 --> 01:23:31,268
I'm doing all I can to get back,
and accept myself,

846
01:23:31,468 --> 01:23:33,188
but if I can't,

847
01:23:33,748 --> 01:23:35,508
don't wait for me.

848
01:23:37,308 --> 01:23:39,149
I wouldn't, either.

849
01:23:40,829 --> 01:23:42,309
What happened to you?

850
01:23:47,870 --> 01:23:49,870
Belén, it's Elena.

851
01:23:51,871 --> 01:23:52,951
How are you?

852
01:23:54,671 --> 01:23:55,951
It's real hot here.

853
01:23:56,151 --> 01:23:58,631
Why don't you come out?
The sea will do you good

854
01:23:58,832 --> 01:24:01,512
I have a guesthouse
for the whole summer.

855
01:24:01,872 --> 01:24:05,272
I'll have a room free in August.
Upstairs.

856
01:24:05,592 --> 01:24:07,873
My best room.
You'll watch the sunset

857
01:24:08,033 --> 01:24:10,913
from your bed.
Bring someone if you want.

858
01:24:11,513 --> 01:24:12,393
Well?

859
01:24:12,794 --> 01:24:15,834
The truth is,
I'd love to visit an island...

860
01:24:17,434 --> 01:24:18,554
with someone.

861
01:24:18,994 --> 01:24:20,155
Then that's it

862
01:24:21,635 --> 01:24:23,915
- It's difficult, Elena.
- Difficult?

863
01:24:24,115 --> 01:24:27,276
Nothing is here
All the bad's left behind

864
01:24:27,476 --> 01:24:29,756
- Just bring along the good
- Right.

865
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:32,556
The good up front.

866
01:24:33,436 --> 01:24:34,957
I really want to see you,

867
01:24:35,157 --> 01:24:36,077
but here

868
01:24:37,157 --> 01:24:38,997
I don't want to lose touch

869
01:24:41,398 --> 01:24:42,878
Say you'll come

870
01:24:43,878 --> 01:24:44,958
Promise me

871
01:24:47,398 --> 01:24:48,479
I promise.

872
01:24:48,999 --> 01:24:50,199
I'll try.

873
01:24:51,319 --> 01:24:52,399
Good bye.

874
01:25:24,204 --> 01:25:26,964
Forgive me, Lucía.
I've got to end this.

875
01:25:28,964 --> 01:25:32,05
I'm going to kill them
for once and for all.

876
01:25:32,685 --> 01:25:33,725
Both of them.

877
01:25:35,645 --> 01:25:36,645
Right now.

878
01:25:55,648 --> 01:25:58,569
If you've stopped being a writer,
you have to

879
01:25:58,769 --> 01:25:59,849
explain why.

880
01:26:02,089 --> 01:26:03,209
You're holding back.

881
01:26:08,050 --> 01:26:09,130
If you don't tell me,

882
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:10,570
I'll never forgive you!

883
01:26:10,770 --> 01:26:12,211
You hear me? Never!

884
01:26:12,611 --> 01:26:13,771
I can't talk like this.

885
01:26:13,971 --> 01:26:14,851
Talk?

886
01:26:16,371 --> 01:26:18,852
You're the one who won't talk.

887
01:26:19,812 --> 01:26:21,652
You keep it all inside.

888
01:26:21,812 --> 01:26:23,772
You won't let me help you.

889
01:26:24,212 --> 01:26:25,452
Everything's you.

890
01:26:25,612 --> 01:26:27,413
I'm crumpled up in the corner.

891
01:26:28,373 --> 01:26:29,293
Look.

892
01:26:29,613 --> 01:26:31,213
You were meant to live alone,

893
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:34,094
and to suffer alone.

894
01:26:34,934 --> 01:26:38,414
And to drive yourself fucking crazy,
which I don't understand.

895
01:26:39,214 --> 01:26:40,895
You're sick, Lorenzo.

896
01:26:41,335 --> 01:26:45,735
Sick of yourself, of your
own standards, and nothing else.

897
01:26:46,455 --> 01:26:48,096
Of your fucking secrets!

898
01:26:48,536 --> 01:26:51,056
You keep me around,
but in the dark.

899
01:26:52,216 --> 01:26:54,017
Because my complaints
don't count.

900
01:26:54,777 --> 01:26:56,137
Because you don't give

901
01:26:56,297 --> 01:26:58,137
a fuck what happens to me.

902
01:26:58,297 --> 01:27:00,057
Your troubles are so deep,

903
01:27:00,457 --> 01:27:01,938
I'm fucking stupid,

904
01:27:02,138 --> 01:27:04,818
and all you care about
is if I screw my boss or not.

905
01:27:10,739 --> 01:27:12,099
I'm exhausted.

906
01:27:13,019 --> 01:27:14,379
You're driving me nuts.

907
01:27:14,699 --> 01:27:16,300
I'll be late to work.

908
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:20,260
Enjoy your hole.

909
01:27:22,301 --> 01:27:24,461
Have fun rotting by yourself.

910
01:27:32,862 --> 01:27:35,182
Look, I've never been this mean

911
01:27:35,382 --> 01:27:36,583
to anyone.

912
01:27:37,743 --> 01:27:40,023
It's the last time
I'll let myself talk like this.

913
01:27:40,543 --> 01:27:42,183
It's for me, not you.

914
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:46,744
That's right.

915
01:27:48,704 --> 01:27:50,825
It's time to think of myself,

916
01:27:51,345 --> 01:27:52,745
of my own needs.

917
01:27:53,905 --> 01:27:56,345
Because I see no future with you.

918
01:28:46,153 --> 01:28:46,873
Lucía!

919
01:28:49,433 --> 01:28:51,633
Come over here
and lie next to me.

920
01:29:23,158 --> 01:29:24,678
Relax, Lucía.

921
01:29:25,318 --> 01:29:27,839
Let the mud absorb all the bad.

922
01:29:28,199 --> 01:29:31,079
Later it'll wash away in the sea.

923
01:30:05,324 --> 01:30:06,604
I don't want sex.

924
01:30:09,04 --> 01:30:10,485
I'm not ready yet.

925
01:30:20,206 --> 01:30:21,446
Don't worry.

926
01:30:24,207 --> 01:30:26,247
We'll just lie here,

927
01:30:28,367 --> 01:30:30,127
drying out in the sun.

928
01:30:39,569 --> 01:30:41,649
Yeah, he looks like Carlos.

929
01:30:49,370 --> 01:30:52,171
"Missing for 6 months".

930
01:30:52,691 --> 01:30:54,811
"Manuela and Belén Lozano,
mother and daughter,

931
01:30:55,011 --> 01:30:57,771
and Antonio Castillo,
were all living together.

932
01:30:57,971 --> 01:31:02,332
If anyone knows where they are,
please contact the police."

933
01:31:02,812 --> 01:31:03,852
The police?

934
01:31:03,972 --> 01:31:05,172
We'll...

935
01:31:05,812 --> 01:31:07,613
act like we didn't see this,

936
01:31:08,373 --> 01:31:10,093
Like nothing's happened.

937
01:31:14,654 --> 01:31:16,494
We know he lived with two women.

938
01:31:16,894 --> 01:31:18,414
Mother and daughter.

939
01:31:18,614 --> 01:31:20,255
Yeah, and the daughter...

940
01:31:22,295 --> 01:31:23,135
What?

941
01:31:25,055 --> 01:31:27,736
The daughter was taking care of...

942
01:31:28,376 --> 01:31:29,616
my daughter.

943
01:31:40,257 --> 01:31:42,258
They left without him,

944
01:31:42,618 --> 01:31:44,898
quietly, without saying good bye

945
01:31:45,258 --> 01:31:47,138
As he slept,

946
01:31:47,298 --> 01:31:48,539
Like in a dream

947
01:31:49,019 --> 01:31:51,619
When he woke, he felt
the two lifeless women

948
01:31:52,299 --> 01:31:53,619
were still with him,

949
01:31:54,459 --> 01:31:55,740
Like any morning

950
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:57,460
at that hour

951
01:31:58,140 --> 01:32:00,740
And he lay still,
wishing his life would also

952
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:03,861
leave him, through his blood

953
01:32:04,541 --> 01:32:06,661
What good was his blood now?

954
01:32:07,661 --> 01:32:10,142
He wished it softly,
without real intent

955
01:32:10,982 --> 01:32:13,062
And he chose to escape,
to start over,

956
01:32:13,542 --> 01:32:14,662
to be new

957
01:32:14,862 --> 01:32:16,663
To change his blood

958
01:32:16,863 --> 01:32:18,183
So he said good bye

959
01:32:18,943 --> 01:32:19,863
and left

960
01:32:24,104 --> 01:32:25,944
We should give him a chance.

961
01:32:28,104 --> 01:32:29,945
Don't we all deserve one?

962
01:32:32,225 --> 01:32:33,985
Just in case, if in doubt,

963
01:32:35,025 --> 01:32:37,146
isn't it better to trust people?

964
01:32:37,666 --> 01:32:38,586
Right?

965
01:32:41,666 --> 01:32:44,547
So when he gets back,
we'll ask him to explain.

966
01:32:45,187 --> 01:32:46,587
It's better this way.

967
01:32:47,347 --> 01:32:49,507
- Especially for you.
- For me?

968
01:32:50,147 --> 01:32:52,028
I just want to forget.

969
01:32:53,388 --> 01:32:55,228
You can't forget some things.

970
01:32:55,348 --> 01:32:58,429
In this house you can.
That's why we're here.

971
01:32:59,949 --> 01:33:01,309
Then it's too late.

972
01:33:02,349 --> 01:33:04,509
I should have come before.

973
01:33:05,910 --> 01:33:07,270
When there was time...

974
01:33:10,510 --> 01:33:11,550
for Lorenzo.

975
01:33:14,471 --> 01:33:16,871
I wanted him to show me
the island.

976
01:33:17,871 --> 01:33:20,352
I asked him to, but he wouldn't.

977
01:33:22,992 --> 01:33:25,232
It would have been
his birthday soon.

978
01:33:30,633 --> 01:33:32,833
- What day?
- The 23rd.

979
01:33:43,315 --> 01:33:44,115
Of May?

980
01:33:50,236 --> 01:33:51,956
We could have celebrated

981
01:33:52,276 --> 01:33:53,636
here on the island.

982
01:33:53,877 --> 01:33:54,957
Maybe even with you.

983
01:33:56,317 --> 01:33:57,357
Who knows if

984
01:33:57,557 --> 01:33:59,437
we'd have met, right?

985
01:34:00,157 --> 01:34:01,038
Right.

986
01:34:03,798 --> 01:34:05,158
When was Lorenzo here?

987
01:34:07,118 --> 01:34:08,399
A long time ago.

988
01:34:09,759 --> 01:34:11,239
Before we met.

989
01:34:11,599 --> 01:34:12,679
How long ago?

990
01:34:13,119 --> 01:34:15,520
About six years ago.

991
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:18,400
Yeah.

992
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:20,080
I think he turned 25 here.

993
01:34:21,921 --> 01:34:22,801
Lucía...

994
01:34:24,281 --> 01:34:25,201
What is it?

995
01:34:27,481 --> 01:34:28,962
I'm overwhelmed...

996
01:34:29,362 --> 01:34:31,162
But I can't cry.

997
01:34:32,322 --> 01:34:33,362
Don't worry.

998
01:34:33,762 --> 01:34:35,322
You don't have to.

999
01:34:36,163 --> 01:34:38,443
I'm the one
who should cry over him.

1000
01:34:46,164 --> 01:34:47,564
I'll just faint, then.

1001
01:34:49,925 --> 01:34:51,085
It's the sea.

1002
01:34:51,645 --> 01:34:53,365
Must be high tide.

1003
01:35:04,727 --> 01:35:06,367
I'll never cry again.

1004
01:35:10,327 --> 01:35:11,648
I'm going to bed.

1005
01:35:22,489 --> 01:35:23,569
What's going on?

1006
01:36:08,496 --> 01:36:09,736
"Luna,

1007
01:36:09,936 --> 01:36:12,056
spring of 1988".

1008
01:36:16,297 --> 01:36:17,217
Luna.

1009
01:36:28,739 --> 01:36:31,179
"Why bother being a father

1010
01:36:31,939 --> 01:36:33,419
if she didn't know?"

1011
01:36:35,340 --> 01:36:37,860
He knew then that
if he'd told her,

1012
01:36:38,580 --> 01:36:40,740
she'd have kept the secret

1013
01:36:45,741 --> 01:36:47,821
Lucía, never talk to me
about this.

1014
01:36:48,341 --> 01:36:50,142
I don't want to hear it.

1015
01:37:02,503 --> 01:37:03,584
Well, I do.

1016
01:38:02,992 --> 01:38:04,392
He's out diving.

1017
01:38:06,833 --> 01:38:08,233
Beneath the island.

1018
01:38:10,993 --> 01:38:12,393
Do you like Carlos?

1019
01:38:14,234 --> 01:38:15,634
I don't anymore.

1020
01:38:16,154 --> 01:38:19,834
Go ahead, he's all yours.
I won't even be jealous.

1021
01:38:24,915 --> 01:38:26,235
What are you doing?

1022
01:38:28,116 --> 01:38:29,836
Asking a friend for advice.

1023
01:38:30,036 --> 01:38:31,356
I don't know him,

1024
01:38:31,636 --> 01:38:33,676
but I'm getting to like him.

1025
01:38:39,557 --> 01:38:42,878
He's been writing me since
I got here. He made up

1026
01:38:43,078 --> 01:38:45,198
a sweet story to help me.

1027
01:38:45,598 --> 01:38:47,438
He taught me to forget.

1028
01:38:47,638 --> 01:38:49,079
And to escape pain.

1029
01:38:51,999 --> 01:38:53,039
Want to read it?

1030
01:38:54,279 --> 01:38:55,520
You could get into it.

1031
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:58,240
It's full of advantages.

1032
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:00,080
Because in the end...

1033
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:01,680
there's a hole

1034
01:39:02,121 --> 01:39:04,081
to escape through.

1035
01:39:10,202 --> 01:39:11,442
Back to the middle.

1036
01:39:13,402 --> 01:39:15,162
To change course,

1037
01:39:16,443 --> 01:39:17,443
if you want.

1038
01:39:24,324 --> 01:39:27,604
That's his icon,
it's a lighthouse.

1039
01:39:29,644 --> 01:39:31,685
But it has no keeper,

1040
01:39:32,605 --> 01:39:34,645
it must be a computer.

1041
01:39:36,205 --> 01:39:37,446
Maybe his.

1042
01:39:45,087 --> 01:39:47,127
You'll meet my daughter.

1043
01:39:52,128 --> 01:39:53,528
I can't read this.

1044
01:39:53,888 --> 01:39:54,888
Why not?

1045
01:39:59,529 --> 01:40:01,369
It will grab me.

1046
01:40:02,249 --> 01:40:03,729
And won't let go.

1047
01:40:04,209 --> 01:40:05,450
That's good.

1048
01:40:07,010 --> 01:40:08,650
Did you finally do it?

1049
01:40:08,930 --> 01:40:10,010
Do what?

1050
01:40:10,250 --> 01:40:11,610
Change course?

1051
01:40:13,171 --> 01:40:16,051
Not all the way,
there wasn't time.

1052
01:40:16,931 --> 01:40:18,531
That's why I'm writing him.

1053
01:40:20,972 --> 01:40:23,452
WHERE'S THE KEEPER?

1054
01:40:24,692 --> 01:40:25,892
Don't write him.

1055
01:40:29,333 --> 01:40:32,093
There's nothing more he can do.

1056
01:40:40,615 --> 01:40:43,615
Has he written you
since I first got here?

1057
01:41:48,824 --> 01:41:51,625
Hi, Lorenzo. How are you?

1058
01:41:53,265 --> 01:41:54,905
Your face says it all.

1059
01:41:55,065 --> 01:41:57,266
They called to say
you were more awake.

1060
01:42:00,786 --> 01:42:02,026
Do you know who I am?

1061
01:42:03,346 --> 01:42:04,107
Pepe.

1062
01:42:05,587 --> 01:42:06,707
Thank God.

1063
01:42:09,467 --> 01:42:12,908
Glad to have you back.
You'll be writing in no time.

1064
01:42:14,548 --> 01:42:15,788
Where's Lucía?

1065
01:42:20,869 --> 01:42:22,389
It says here that

1066
01:42:22,749 --> 01:42:25,150
your cranial hematoma
has subsided.

1067
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:29,230
And the rest of your bruises
are history.

1068
01:42:30,630 --> 01:42:31,670
Where's Lucía?

1069
01:42:36,151 --> 01:42:37,871
You were in bad shape.

1070
01:42:39,552 --> 01:42:41,872
We didn't think you'd make it.

1071
01:42:43,672 --> 01:42:44,832
How long have I been here?

1072
01:42:45,912 --> 01:42:46,913
Well...

1073
01:42:48,473 --> 01:42:50,273
One week in a coma,

1074
01:42:50,873 --> 01:42:53,114
with this horrible respirator...

1075
01:42:53,594 --> 01:42:55,314
And two more weeks

1076
01:42:55,754 --> 01:42:58,834
breathing on your own,
but unconscious.

1077
01:42:59,714 --> 01:43:03,075
And in this room
since four or five days ago,

1078
01:43:04,235 --> 01:43:06,515
blabbering in your sleep.

1079
01:43:06,955 --> 01:43:09,796
And when you'd wake up,
you were out of it.

1080
01:43:15,037 --> 01:43:17,437
We haven't heard from Lucía.

1081
01:43:18,117 --> 01:43:20,117
I looked everywhere.

1082
01:43:20,477 --> 01:43:24,118
She hasn't been to your place,
nor the restaurant, since the night

1083
01:43:24,318 --> 01:43:25,318
of your accident.

1084
01:43:33,279 --> 01:43:34,239
Lorenzo.

1085
01:43:36,040 --> 01:43:39,160
I think Lucía
believes you're dead.

1086
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:41,640
That's why she left.

1087
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:43,481
I talked to the ambulance guy.

1088
01:43:44,161 --> 01:43:46,441
He said a cop called your house

1089
01:43:46,641 --> 01:43:47,881
and talked to her.

1090
01:43:48,081 --> 01:43:49,922
He mentioned the car

1091
01:43:50,242 --> 01:43:51,322
and she hung up.

1092
01:43:52,802 --> 01:43:54,082
He tried to call back

1093
01:43:55,242 --> 01:43:56,643
but she wouldn't answer.

1094
01:43:58,803 --> 01:44:00,123
I need to pee.

1095
01:44:01,203 --> 01:44:02,363
Do it there,

1096
01:44:02,563 --> 01:44:04,444
- in the pan.
- No way!

1097
01:44:04,684 --> 01:44:05,804
Wait, wait.

1098
01:44:06,244 --> 01:44:08,484
Thanks, Pepe, but I can manage.

1099
01:44:11,685 --> 01:44:13,405
Lose the attitude.

1100
01:44:13,645 --> 01:44:15,965
I've helped you all week.

1101
01:44:16,405 --> 01:44:17,926
You just don't remember.

1102
01:44:35,128 --> 01:44:36,488
I know where she might be.

1103
01:44:39,209 --> 01:44:40,249
You came by car?

1104
01:44:41,969 --> 01:44:43,569
As soon as they called.

1105
01:45:09,213 --> 01:45:10,293
Good morning.

1106
01:45:11,253 --> 01:45:13,894
Tell me right now why
you're here and Belén isn't.

1107
01:45:16,854 --> 01:45:17,894
You see?

1108
01:45:18,094 --> 01:45:21,295
I don't want to forget anymore.
Thanks to you, honey.

1109
01:45:24,175 --> 01:45:25,095
Well?

1110
01:45:25,775 --> 01:45:27,216
Won't you answer me?

1111
01:45:28,816 --> 01:45:32,296
It's time to show you who
I really am, no more stories.

1112
01:45:32,536 --> 01:45:35,377
Were you there with Belén,
in my room,

1113
01:45:38,737 --> 01:45:41,578
when that fucking dog
killed my daughter?

1114
01:45:42,978 --> 01:45:44,698
- It wasn't me.
- It wasn't?

1115
01:45:44,898 --> 01:45:47,658
Then why are the cops
looking for you?

1116
01:45:51,219 --> 01:45:52,819
Belén was with some guy

1117
01:45:53,019 --> 01:45:56,020
who met her in the park
with your daughter.

1118
01:45:57,140 --> 01:46:00,620
But he disappeared
after that night.

1119
01:46:11,142 --> 01:46:12,302
What about Belén?

1120
01:46:12,502 --> 01:46:14,582
Where is she?
Since you know everything.

1121
01:46:16,063 --> 01:46:19,223
She left with her mom
but didn't tell me where.

1122
01:46:20,543 --> 01:46:23,664
She changed in the end,
and chose her mom over me.

1123
01:46:28,664 --> 01:46:30,065
Can't blame her.

1124
01:46:30,745 --> 01:46:33,185
A mother always comes first.

1125
01:46:36,505 --> 01:46:39,826
I don't trust you anymore,
Antonio...

1126
01:46:41,306 --> 01:46:43,746
I won't ask you
any more questions.

1127
01:46:43,946 --> 01:46:45,787
I'll leave that to the police.

1128
01:46:46,427 --> 01:46:48,227
Lying to them won't be so easy.

1129
01:46:49,307 --> 01:46:51,668
Look how brave I got
all of a sudden.

1130
01:46:52,028 --> 01:46:52,708
Wait.

1131
01:46:54,108 --> 01:46:56,988
Please don't call the police.

1132
01:46:57,988 --> 01:46:59,029
Why not?

1133
01:46:59,549 --> 01:47:01,469
Are you holding back
anything else?

1134
01:47:05,030 --> 01:47:06,390
I've no one left

1135
01:47:07,150 --> 01:47:08,550
who I can trust.

1136
01:47:10,030 --> 01:47:11,390
Where are you going?

1137
01:47:11,870 --> 01:47:13,191
Making a getaway?

1138
01:47:13,391 --> 01:47:15,191
They'll track you down!

1139
01:47:16,351 --> 01:47:17,751
If you call the cops,

1140
01:47:19,112 --> 01:47:20,352
I'll leave, too.

1141
01:47:20,992 --> 01:47:21,992
Are you stupid?

1142
01:47:22,472 --> 01:47:23,352
Yes.

1143
01:48:21,00 --> 01:48:22,401
Where are you going?

1144
01:48:23,441 --> 01:48:24,521
I don't understand.

1145
01:48:25,361 --> 01:48:28,561
I trust Carlos, and I believe him.
I want to know more.

1146
01:48:28,721 --> 01:48:30,402
That's the easy part.

1147
01:48:30,922 --> 01:48:32,562
Believing what you want.

1148
01:48:32,842 --> 01:48:34,082
What pleases you.

1149
01:48:34,282 --> 01:48:36,323
I did that, too.
Until tonight.

1150
01:48:36,523 --> 01:48:38,283
I'll chase whomever I please!

1151
01:48:39,083 --> 01:48:41,443
Men matter less and less to me.

1152
01:48:41,683 --> 01:48:42,683
That's my lot.

1153
01:48:43,364 --> 01:48:44,964
They've never given me anything.

1154
01:48:45,364 --> 01:48:46,404
Except sex.

1155
01:48:46,644 --> 01:48:49,284
No? What about the keeper?

1156
01:48:50,765 --> 01:48:52,325
What? Besides wild sex

1157
01:48:52,525 --> 01:48:53,565
and a daughter?

1158
01:48:55,165 --> 01:48:56,565
Don't forget that story

1159
01:48:56,765 --> 01:48:59,526
full of advantages that
he wrote just for you!

1160
01:49:00,086 --> 01:49:01,286
That's right.

1161
01:49:02,06 --> 01:49:04,06
Maybe your boyfriend
was the last

1162
01:49:04,207 --> 01:49:05,967
- good man on earth.
- No, he wasn't.

1163
01:49:07,327 --> 01:49:10,447
You're wrong,
but that's my business.

1164
01:49:10,927 --> 01:49:13,768
And I suppose Carlos
is also your business.

1165
01:49:14,168 --> 01:49:15,368
Yours alone.

1166
01:49:15,888 --> 01:49:17,848
You're the only one chasing him.

1167
01:49:19,289 --> 01:49:20,169
Yeah.

1168
01:49:21,049 --> 01:49:22,529
Come to think of it,

1169
01:49:22,729 --> 01:49:25,290
I always chase men.
When I like them.

1170
01:49:25,810 --> 01:49:27,410
To each his own, right?

1171
01:49:31,730 --> 01:49:33,211
Where could he be?

1172
01:49:34,451 --> 01:49:37,011
I don't know. I'm going home.

1173
01:49:37,211 --> 01:49:38,931
You guys cook tonight.

1174
01:52:47,998 --> 01:52:49,559
I'm so sorry.

1175
01:54:05,370 --> 01:54:07,010
Carlos! It's me, Lucía.

1176
01:54:07,210 --> 01:54:09,170
I want to come down.

1177
01:54:10,730 --> 01:54:12,131
Come and help me.

1178
01:54:13,091 --> 01:54:15,651
I know how to dive, too.
What did you think?

1179
01:54:21,412 --> 01:54:23,372
Lucía. It's me, Elena.

1180
01:54:34,574 --> 01:54:35,654
Where's Carlos?

1181
01:54:36,054 --> 01:54:37,334
Down there.

1182
01:54:37,654 --> 01:54:38,934
Did he escape?

1183
01:54:41,095 --> 01:54:42,135
Maybe he's dead.

1184
01:54:46,375 --> 01:54:49,776
If he turns up,
we have to believe him, okay?

1185
01:54:50,816 --> 01:54:52,136
Whatever you want.

1186
01:54:52,776 --> 01:54:53,856
That's right.

1187
01:54:55,057 --> 01:54:56,257
He's a crab.

1188
01:54:59,697 --> 01:55:00,777
Let's go home.

1189
01:55:01,017 --> 01:55:01,978
What for?

1190
01:55:02,218 --> 01:55:03,218
To eat.

1191
01:55:03,458 --> 01:55:04,218
So early?

1192
01:55:05,858 --> 01:55:06,898
I'm not hungry.

1193
01:55:07,298 --> 01:55:09,899
Tough. It's about time
you helped me cook.

1194
01:55:11,499 --> 01:55:14,779
We'll make a special meal
and we'll be together

1195
01:55:15,620 --> 01:55:16,860
and have fun.

1196
01:55:33,382 --> 01:55:35,422
You're a gift to this earth.

1197
01:55:36,663 --> 01:55:39,743
Elena. You're crying.

1198
01:55:43,103 --> 01:55:46,224
Tears of happiness,
which is what I am from now on.

1199
01:55:46,424 --> 01:55:48,384
Great. I hope it's contagious.

1200
01:55:48,584 --> 01:55:50,185
Piece of cake.
Let's go.

1201
01:58:51,610 --> 01:58:54,971
The first advantage
is at the end of the story

1202
01:58:55,171 --> 01:58:56,131
It doesn't finish,

1203
01:58:56,331 --> 01:58:58,171
it falls in a hole

1204
01:59:02,372 --> 01:59:04,612
And the story
starts again halfway.

1205
01:59:06,132 --> 01:59:09,013
The other advantage,
and the biggest,

1206
01:59:09,653 --> 01:59:12,733
is that you can change course
along the way...

1207
01:59:12,893 --> 01:59:15,814
If you let me.
If you give me time.

1208
01:59:58,660 --> 01:59:59,860
A ray of sunshine...
