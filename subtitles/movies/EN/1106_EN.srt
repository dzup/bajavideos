1
00:01:42,415 --> 00:01:45,168
What's this war in the heart of nature?

2
00:01:48,215 --> 00:01:51,013
Why does nature vie with itself?.

3
00:01:52,255 --> 00:01:54,644
The land contend with the sea?

4
00:02:05,615 --> 00:02:08,209
Is there an avenging power in nature?

5
00:02:11,175 --> 00:02:13,370
Not one power, but two?

6
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,049
I remember my mother when she was dying.

7
00:04:04,135 --> 00:04:06,330
Looked all shrunk up and grey.

8
00:04:10,335 --> 00:04:12,530
I asked her if she was afraid.

9
00:04:13,975 --> 00:04:16,170
She just shook her head.

10
00:04:17,535 --> 00:04:20,208
I was afraid to touch the death I seen in her.

11
00:04:21,615 --> 00:04:26,689
I couldn't fiind nothing beautiful or uplifting
about her going back to God.

12
00:04:29,695 --> 00:04:33,688
I heard people talk about immortality,
but I ain't seen it.

13
00:05:39,495 --> 00:05:41,770
I wondered how it'd be when I died.

14
00:05:43,455 --> 00:05:48,529
What it'd be like to know that this breath now
was the last one you was ever gonna draw.

15
00:05:52,695 --> 00:05:55,687
I just hope I can meet it the same way she did.

16
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:59,329
With the same... calm.

17
00:06:02,215 --> 00:06:06,686
Cos that's where it's hidden -
the immortality I hadn't seen.

18
00:06:46,455 --> 00:06:48,650
Kids around here never fight.

19
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,086
Sometimes.

20
00:06:51,175 --> 00:06:54,053
Sometimes when you see them playing

21
00:06:54,135 --> 00:06:56,205
they always fight!

22
00:06:59,975 --> 00:07:02,409
- Is she afraid of me?
- Little bit.

23
00:07:04,415 --> 00:07:06,975
- Are you afraid of me?
- Yes.

24
00:07:07,055 --> 00:07:10,047
- Why?
- Cos you look...

25
00:07:11,495 --> 00:07:13,326
You look as an army!

26
00:07:13,415 --> 00:07:15,406
- I look army?
- Yes.

27
00:07:17,095 --> 00:07:19,086
Well, that don't matter.

28
00:07:20,735 --> 00:07:22,726
It doesn't matter.

29
00:07:26,055 --> 00:07:28,046
- Baby's tired.
- Yes.

30
00:07:29,455 --> 00:07:31,923
If she swims, she wants, she will sleep.

31
00:08:00,415 --> 00:08:02,485
All right, come on. Turn around.

32
00:08:02,575 --> 00:08:04,566
Go, go, go, go. Go!

33
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,366
Come on, go.

34
00:08:11,135 --> 00:08:13,126
Go, go, go, go!

35
00:09:46,415 --> 00:09:48,565
Witt, patrol boat!

36
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:50,646
She's American.

37
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:03,085
What's it doing out here all alone?

38
00:10:28,615 --> 00:10:31,687
You haven't changed at all, have you, Witt?

39
00:10:31,775 --> 00:10:33,970
You haven't learned a thing.

40
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:40,013
All a man has to do is leave it to you,
you'll put your head in the noose for him.

41
00:10:46,135 --> 00:10:48,126
How many times you been AWOL?

42
00:10:51,095 --> 00:10:53,609
Been in the army, what? Six years now?

43
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:57,529
Ain't it time you smartened up
and stopped being such a punk recruit?

44
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,606
I mean, if you're ever gonna.

45
00:10:59,695 --> 00:11:01,686
We can't all be smart.

46
00:11:03,215 --> 00:11:05,604
No, we can't, and that's a shame.

47
00:11:05,695 --> 00:11:07,686
Look at you.

48
00:11:12,095 --> 00:11:16,293
Truth is,
you can't take straight duty in my company.

49
00:11:17,735 --> 00:11:21,045
You'll never be a real soldier,
not in Gods world.

50
00:11:23,855 --> 00:11:27,165
This is C Company,
of which I'm First Sergeant. I run this outfit.

51
00:11:27,255 --> 00:11:31,885
Captain Staros, he's the CO, but I'm the guy
who runs it. Nobody's gonna foul that up.

52
00:11:33,135 --> 00:11:35,649
You're just another mouth for me to feed.

53
00:11:38,215 --> 00:11:40,809
Normally, you'd be court-martialled.

54
00:11:41,295 --> 00:11:43,286
But I worked a deal for ya.

55
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,366
Gotta consider yourself lucky.

56
00:11:47,255 --> 00:11:50,452
I'm sending you to a disciplinary outfit.

57
00:11:50,535 --> 00:11:54,767
You'll be a stretcher-bearer.
You'll be taking care of the wounded.

58
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:58,893
I can take anything you dish out.

59
00:11:58,975 --> 00:12:01,205
I'm twice the man you are.

60
00:12:12,215 --> 00:12:14,206
In this world...

61
00:12:15,095 --> 00:12:18,770
a man himself is nothing.

62
00:12:22,295 --> 00:12:26,174
And there ain't no world but this one.

63
00:12:28,775 --> 00:12:30,766
You're wrong there, Top.

64
00:12:33,455 --> 00:12:35,446
I seen another world.

65
00:12:40,815 --> 00:12:44,524
Sometimes I think
it was just... my imagination.

66
00:12:46,855 --> 00:12:48,846
Well,

67
00:12:49,055 --> 00:12:51,523
then you've seen things I never will.

68
00:13:00,855 --> 00:13:06,088
We're living in a world that's blowing itself
to hell as fast as everybody can arrange it.

69
00:13:07,015 --> 00:13:11,770
In a situation like that all a man can do
is shut his eyes and let nothing touch him.

70
00:13:11,855 --> 00:13:13,846
Look out for himself.

71
00:13:25,615 --> 00:13:28,209
I might be the best friend you ever had.

72
00:13:30,335 --> 00:13:32,326
You don't even know it.

73
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,770
He hates you worse than poison.

74
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:12,685
I never felt he hated me, cos I don't hate him.

75
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,966
I love Charlie Company.

76
00:14:58,735 --> 00:15:00,726
They're my people.

77
00:15:24,615 --> 00:15:26,412
They call it "The Rock".

78
00:15:26,495 --> 00:15:29,612
Nobody wants this island.
Japs just put an airfield there.

79
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,492
Fighting's confined to this area.

80
00:15:31,575 --> 00:15:36,933
This is their road to Australia, and this is their
way of controlling the sea lanes to America.

81
00:15:37,015 --> 00:15:42,009
If we're gonna stop the Japs' advance into the
South Pacific, we've gotta do it right there.

82
00:15:43,535 --> 00:15:46,413
The Marines have done theirjob.
Now it's our turn.

83
00:15:47,815 --> 00:15:49,806
Worked my ass off.

84
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:53,286
Brown-nosed the generals.

85
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,446
Degraded myself

86
00:15:59,255 --> 00:16:02,292
for them and my family.

87
00:16:03,535 --> 00:16:05,526
For my home.

88
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:09,326
- I admire you, Colonel. I do.
- Thank you, sir.

89
00:16:09,415 --> 00:16:12,248
Most men your age
would have retired by now.

90
00:16:12,335 --> 00:16:14,326
It's OK.

91
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:18,849
We need general officers
with maturity and character like you.

92
00:16:18,935 --> 00:16:22,166
We've got good sergeants
and good lieutenant colonels.

93
00:16:22,255 --> 00:16:25,486
But once a man gets those eagles,
he can't wait to get that star.

94
00:16:25,575 --> 00:16:27,566
He becomes a politician, right?

95
00:16:27,655 --> 00:16:29,646
Goes along to get along.

96
00:16:31,055 --> 00:16:34,172
So goddamn hard to stay upright.

97
00:16:34,255 --> 00:16:38,134
- You said it there, sir.
- With the Admiral watching, which he will be.

98
00:16:38,215 --> 00:16:41,013
- There's always someone watching.
- Yeah.

99
00:16:41,775 --> 00:16:43,925
Like a hawk.

100
00:16:44,015 --> 00:16:47,007
Always someone ready to jump in,
if you're not.

101
00:16:58,855 --> 00:17:00,846
- D'you have a son, Colonel?
- Yes, sir.

102
00:17:00,935 --> 00:17:05,167
Good. We don't want our sons or grandsons
fighting this war 30 years from now, do we?

103
00:17:05,255 --> 00:17:08,645
- No, sir, we sure don't.
- Then you crush 'em without mercy.

104
00:17:08,735 --> 00:17:11,647
You dig them out of the hills
and protect that airfield.

105
00:17:11,735 --> 00:17:13,532
Yes, sir.

106
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:19,531
You wonder why... Why did the Japs
put an airfield there of all places?

107
00:17:20,055 --> 00:17:23,525
I guess we don't know the bigger picture,
if there is such a thing.

108
00:17:23,615 --> 00:17:27,528
- What do you think?
- Well, sir, I never ask myself that question.

109
00:17:27,615 --> 00:17:29,207
You're a humble man.

110
00:17:31,255 --> 00:17:34,327
Nobody wants that island... but you.

111
00:17:35,535 --> 00:17:37,765
How much do you want it?

112
00:17:37,855 --> 00:17:40,164
As much as I have to, sir.

113
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,855
All they sacrifiiced for me

114
00:17:48,775 --> 00:17:51,414
poured out like water on the ground.

115
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:59,773
All I might have given for love's sake.

116
00:18:13,695 --> 00:18:15,686
Too late.

117
00:18:20,335 --> 00:18:22,326
Died...

118
00:18:23,695 --> 00:18:25,686
slow as a tree.

119
00:18:27,855 --> 00:18:29,846
D'you feel it?

120
00:18:30,535 --> 00:18:32,526
Yes, sir.

121
00:18:36,495 --> 00:18:38,486
Thank you, sir.

122
00:18:51,295 --> 00:18:53,490
Take topside to the signal bridge.

123
00:18:59,335 --> 00:19:02,452
The closer you are to Caesar,
the greater the fear.

124
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:21,925
I just can't help
how damn scared I am, sarge, all right?

125
00:19:22,935 --> 00:19:24,527
I can't help it. I got...

126
00:19:24,615 --> 00:19:27,846
My stepdaddy took a block
and beat me when I was real little

127
00:19:27,935 --> 00:19:30,608
and I was scared
and I used to run, I used to hide.

128
00:19:30,695 --> 00:19:34,210
Hell, I slept in the chicken coop
a whole lot of nights.

129
00:19:34,295 --> 00:19:38,288
And I never thought
it'd get no worse than that.

130
00:19:39,535 --> 00:19:43,210
But I'm living by the... by the minute here.
I'm counting the seconds.

131
00:19:43,295 --> 00:19:47,573
Hell, we're gonna be landing soon
and there's gonna be air raids.

132
00:19:47,655 --> 00:19:50,931
We're probably gonna die
before we get off the beach.

133
00:19:51,015 --> 00:19:54,849
This place is...
It's like a big floating graveyard.

134
00:19:54,935 --> 00:19:58,974
- What's your name, kid?
- I wanna own an automobile when I get out.

135
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:03,048
- What's your name?
- Edward, Edward B Train.

136
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,170
Train?

137
00:20:04,255 --> 00:20:09,454
The only things that are permanent
is, is dying and the Lord. That's it.

138
00:20:09,535 --> 00:20:15,212
That's all you gotta worry about. This war
ain't... gonna be the end of me or you neither.

139
00:20:15,295 --> 00:20:18,492
- Think we'll catch an air raid?
- How in the hell should I know?

140
00:20:18,575 --> 00:20:23,126
All's I know are them crew guys said
they didn't catch no air raid the last time.

141
00:20:23,215 --> 00:20:26,651
On the other hand,
time before last they nearly got blew up.

142
00:20:26,735 --> 00:20:28,532
What dyou want me to tell you?

143
00:20:28,615 --> 00:20:31,527
You're a big help, Tills.
Nothing. Tell me nothing.

144
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,014
Tell you something.

145
00:20:33,095 --> 00:20:37,486
We're sitting out here on this ocean
like a couple of fuckin' ducks in these boats.

146
00:20:37,575 --> 00:20:39,452
I already know that.

147
00:20:39,535 --> 00:20:41,207
Well, brood on it, Tills.

148
00:20:41,295 --> 00:20:43,490
Brood on it.

149
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,851
- Ain't you watching the fun?
- I ain't interested.

150
00:20:46,935 --> 00:20:51,213
- Yeah, I guess it is pretty crowded.
- Wouldn't be interested, even if it wasn't.

151
00:20:51,295 --> 00:20:53,968
Well, I'm on my way to get me that pistol.

152
00:20:54,055 --> 00:20:55,647
Yeah? Well, have fun.

153
00:20:55,735 --> 00:20:57,851
Yeah, have fun.

154
00:20:57,935 --> 00:21:02,565
You'll wish you had one once we get ashore
and run into some of them samurai sabres.

155
00:21:02,655 --> 00:21:06,125
Open this door! Open this goddamn door!

156
00:21:06,215 --> 00:21:08,012
Open the door!

157
00:21:09,895 --> 00:21:12,489
You all learn to deal these cards...

158
00:21:14,535 --> 00:21:17,003
All right. Here I am sleeping, yeah.

159
00:21:17,815 --> 00:21:21,171
All right, ladies.
Is this a sewing circle or a card game?

160
00:21:21,255 --> 00:21:24,850
All right, jack's high, jack to bet.
Robert's got two jacks.

161
00:21:27,815 --> 00:21:32,570
I never bargained for nothing like this when I
signed up for this man's army before the war.

162
00:21:32,655 --> 00:21:37,251
How was I supposed to know there was
gonna be a fuckin' war, huh? Answer me that.

163
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:43,924
All I know is Charlie Company's
always getting screwed. Always.

164
00:21:44,015 --> 00:21:46,654
And I can tell you whose fault it is, too.

165
00:21:46,735 --> 00:21:48,612
It's that captain of ours.

166
00:21:48,695 --> 00:21:53,291
First he gets us stuck off on this boat
where we don't know a fucking soul.

167
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:58,608
Then he gets us stuck way down in fourth
place on the list to get off this son of a bitch.

168
00:22:11,735 --> 00:22:13,726
Hello, Captain.

169
00:22:55,815 --> 00:22:59,444
I read in your 201 file
that you were an officer before the war.

170
00:23:00,015 --> 00:23:02,085
How'd you end up a private?

171
00:23:02,175 --> 00:23:04,166
Cos of my wife.

172
00:23:04,895 --> 00:23:07,011
I was in the corps of engineers.

173
00:23:08,255 --> 00:23:11,088
We'd never been separated before,

174
00:23:11,175 --> 00:23:13,166
not even for a night.

175
00:23:14,015 --> 00:23:17,803
I took it for four months and then I quit.

176
00:23:19,655 --> 00:23:21,646
Just resigned.

177
00:23:22,575 --> 00:23:25,214
They sent me back to the States.

178
00:23:25,295 --> 00:23:28,253
They told me
I'd never get another commission.

179
00:23:28,335 --> 00:23:33,773
They said they'd see to it I got drafted
and that I for damn sure'd be in the infantry.

180
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,366
Sons of bitches.

181
00:23:36,975 --> 00:23:38,966
No, I don't blame them.

182
00:23:41,135 --> 00:23:43,285
Well, where is she now?

183
00:23:44,135 --> 00:23:46,126
She's home.

184
00:23:58,815 --> 00:24:01,283
Why should I be afraid to die?

185
00:24:03,815 --> 00:24:05,214
I belong to you.

186
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:10,094
Move! Move! Move!

187
00:24:10,175 --> 00:24:12,166
Move! Move!

188
00:24:19,015 --> 00:24:20,209
Move! Move!

189
00:24:20,295 --> 00:24:21,489
Moving out!

190
00:24:21,575 --> 00:24:25,568
If I go fiirst, I'll wait for you there.

191
00:24:26,855 --> 00:24:29,164
On the other side of the dark waters.

192
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:38,166
Put your helmet on.

193
00:24:39,255 --> 00:24:41,246
Be with me now.

194
00:24:50,895 --> 00:24:53,284
- Feeling the pressure, Captain?
- Yes, sir.

195
00:24:55,015 --> 00:24:56,812
I like you, Captain.

196
00:24:56,895 --> 00:25:02,174
And I just want you to know, well,
we're in this thing together. All right?

197
00:25:02,255 --> 00:25:06,168
Keep pressing inland till you reach the line.
I'll catch up with you there.

198
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:08,052
- Yes, sir.
- It's all yours, Captain.

199
00:25:08,135 --> 00:25:10,490
Gangway! Gangway there!

200
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:11,974
Coming through!

201
00:25:12,055 --> 00:25:14,853
Squad leaders! Both teams!

202
00:25:14,935 --> 00:25:17,165
This way, son. This way, right here.

203
00:25:18,175 --> 00:25:20,166
Stand by to go over the side!

204
00:26:30,095 --> 00:26:32,086
Our Father, who art in heaven...

205
00:26:33,055 --> 00:26:36,764
And forgive us our debts,
as we forgive our debtors.

206
00:26:36,855 --> 00:26:40,325
For Thine is the kingdom,
and the power, and the glory.

207
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:54,492
Your outfit's lucky.

208
00:26:54,575 --> 00:26:56,566
Transports must've been spotted.

209
00:26:56,655 --> 00:26:59,453
You're getting outta here just ahead of time.

210
00:27:09,415 --> 00:27:11,804
Take a breath, mister. You gotta breathe!

211
00:27:40,735 --> 00:27:42,327
- You Charlie Company?
- Yeah.

212
00:27:42,415 --> 00:27:44,406
We went in a mile. Nothing there.

213
00:27:44,495 --> 00:27:46,929
Some oil drums.
There'd be nothing there for...

214
00:27:47,015 --> 00:27:48,334
- A week.
- A week, sir.

215
00:27:48,415 --> 00:27:50,770
No casualties. Japs must've hauled ass.

216
00:27:50,855 --> 00:27:53,767
Two mortars hit the beach,
but most guys came in standing up.

217
00:27:53,855 --> 00:27:55,652
Darnedest thing I ever did see.

218
00:27:57,815 --> 00:28:00,488
They got fish that live in trees.

219
00:28:03,935 --> 00:28:08,326
If they didn't know this beach was deserted,
what else don't they know?

220
00:29:36,015 --> 00:29:39,405
Who are you to live in all these many forms?

221
00:30:10,095 --> 00:30:12,484
Your death that captures all.

222
00:30:18,615 --> 00:30:22,403
You, too, are the source
of all that's gonna be born.

223
00:30:45,575 --> 00:30:47,566
Your glory.

224
00:30:50,735 --> 00:30:52,726
Mercy.

225
00:30:54,215 --> 00:30:56,206
Peace.

226
00:30:58,095 --> 00:31:00,086
Truth.

227
00:31:06,455 --> 00:31:08,650
You give calm a spirit,

228
00:31:11,575 --> 00:31:13,566
understanding,

229
00:31:15,295 --> 00:31:17,286
courage.

230
00:31:21,775 --> 00:31:23,766
The contented heart.

231
00:34:55,015 --> 00:34:57,006
Get a medic here!

232
00:35:02,015 --> 00:35:06,372
Maybe all men got one big soul
who everybody's a part of.

233
00:35:08,975 --> 00:35:11,364
All faces of the same man.

234
00:35:12,575 --> 00:35:14,566
One big self.

235
00:35:47,415 --> 00:35:50,373
Everyone looking for salvation by himself.

236
00:35:56,935 --> 00:35:59,165
Each like a coal

237
00:35:59,255 --> 00:36:01,246
drawn from the fiire.

238
00:36:31,975 --> 00:36:34,694
We're going straight up that hill there.

239
00:36:38,175 --> 00:36:42,134
- We can't do that, Colonel.
- Well, there's no way to outflank it.

240
00:36:42,215 --> 00:36:45,013
On the left is a cliff
that falls down into the river.

241
00:36:45,095 --> 00:36:48,724
The Japanese hold the jungle.
It has to be taken frontally.

242
00:36:50,855 --> 00:36:53,653
What about water, sir?
It's not getting up here.

243
00:36:53,735 --> 00:36:56,044
My men are... passing out, sir.

244
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:07,243
Only time you worry about a soldier
is when he stops bitching.

245
00:37:20,135 --> 00:37:24,048
We're all gonna attack abreast.
Third Platoon in reserve.

246
00:37:24,135 --> 00:37:27,366
We've gotta cross
those three folds of ground. You see?

247
00:37:27,455 --> 00:37:30,128
Once we get beyond that,
we gotta attack that hill.

248
00:37:41,255 --> 00:37:46,283
Colonel says there's no way to outflank it,
so we gotta take it head-on by frontal assault.

249
00:37:47,975 --> 00:37:49,374
- Whyte?
- Yeah?

250
00:37:49,455 --> 00:37:52,333
- See the grassy ridges at the foot of that hill?
- Yeah.

251
00:37:52,415 --> 00:37:57,205
When you get to the end of that field,
eliminate all strongpoints on those ridges.

252
00:38:01,215 --> 00:38:05,128
I'm sure the Japs got something there
to protect the approaches.

253
00:38:56,215 --> 00:38:58,206
Are you here?

254
00:39:11,935 --> 00:39:13,926
Let me not betray you.

255
00:39:17,495 --> 00:39:19,486
Let me not betray my men.

256
00:39:26,855 --> 00:39:29,050
In you I place my trust.

257
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,406
Rosy-fingered dawn.

258
00:39:47,855 --> 00:39:50,164
You're Greek, aren't you, Captain?

259
00:39:50,255 --> 00:39:52,246
D'you ever read Homer?

260
00:39:52,335 --> 00:39:54,769
We read Homer at the Point.

261
00:39:54,855 --> 00:39:56,652
In Greek.

262
00:39:56,735 --> 00:40:00,091
What kind of artillery support
do we have, sir? Over.

263
00:40:00,175 --> 00:40:04,566
- Two batteries of 105s.
- They won't make a dent. Over.

264
00:40:04,655 --> 00:40:08,853
No, but it bucks the men up.
It'll look like the Japs are catching hell.

265
00:41:00,495 --> 00:41:02,292
OK, you guys.

266
00:41:02,375 --> 00:41:03,967
This is it.

267
00:41:04,055 --> 00:41:06,444
We're going down in groups of ten.

268
00:41:07,775 --> 00:41:12,053
There's no point in going by rushes.
Only make a better target stopped, so...

269
00:41:12,135 --> 00:41:14,365
run all the way.

270
00:41:14,455 --> 00:41:17,652
We ain't got no choice.
We're picked, so we gotta go.

271
00:41:20,655 --> 00:41:22,850
I'm gonna take the first bunch myself.

272
00:41:22,935 --> 00:41:25,165
I want Charlie Dale with me. Dale?

273
00:41:25,255 --> 00:41:27,849
You go organise them guys that's up there.

274
00:41:33,335 --> 00:41:35,530
Moving out in five minutes.

275
00:41:36,375 --> 00:41:37,933
Let's go.

276
00:41:41,975 --> 00:41:43,772
Sico?

277
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:47,368
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm sick to my stomach.

278
00:41:47,455 --> 00:41:50,652
Sico, you get up now,
or I'll kick you so hard you're gonna be sick.

279
00:41:50,735 --> 00:41:52,453
I can't. I would if I could.

280
00:41:52,535 --> 00:41:54,765
I'm sick.

281
00:41:54,855 --> 00:41:56,652
I'm sick.

282
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,726
You ain't sick. Get up!

283
00:42:02,855 --> 00:42:06,131
- What's the matter, Sico?
- I don't know, Sergeant.

284
00:42:06,215 --> 00:42:09,252
It's my stomach. I'm in pain, I got cramps.

285
00:42:09,335 --> 00:42:11,485
I can't even sit up straight. I'm sick.

286
00:42:15,335 --> 00:42:17,132
- Come on, get up!
- Leave him.

287
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:21,288
I need a volunteer to carry the BAR!
Drop your gear. I'm taking you to the medics.

288
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:23,366
Thank you, Sergeant.

289
00:42:25,575 --> 00:42:27,566
Don't argue with me.

290
00:42:27,655 --> 00:42:29,646
Good luck, Keck.

291
00:43:30,415 --> 00:43:32,406
Plug that hole on your right!

292
00:43:32,495 --> 00:43:34,292
Move!

293
00:43:53,175 --> 00:43:55,166
Maybe they pulled out.

294
00:46:00,535 --> 00:46:02,093
Hit dirt!

295
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:04,326
Hit dirt!

296
00:46:09,215 --> 00:46:11,854
Calm down, calm down,
calm down, calm down.

297
00:46:16,455 --> 00:46:18,411
Stretcher-bearers!

298
00:46:33,455 --> 00:46:35,047
Come on!

299
00:46:35,135 --> 00:46:37,126
Stretcher-bearers, this way!

300
00:46:38,175 --> 00:46:41,247
- Go get that man.
- We already got eight or nine down there...

301
00:46:41,335 --> 00:46:45,214
- Don't argue with me! Get that man!
- He's not the one we should think about...

302
00:46:45,295 --> 00:46:48,446
Goddamn it, all of you!
Am I in command here or am I not?!

303
00:46:48,535 --> 00:46:52,448
- Am I the captain or a goddamn private?
- Others are hit bad. That's all I meant.

304
00:46:54,335 --> 00:46:56,371
- I gave you an order, private!
- Yes, sir!

305
00:46:59,015 --> 00:47:00,607
Hello, First Sergeant.

306
00:47:02,295 --> 00:47:04,604
Who we going after over here?

307
00:47:05,375 --> 00:47:07,366
We think it's Jacques.

308
00:47:07,895 --> 00:47:09,487
OI' Jockey.

309
00:47:09,575 --> 00:47:12,169
Well, shit. That's, that's, that's too bad.

310
00:47:12,615 --> 00:47:14,014
Sir?

311
00:47:14,655 --> 00:47:19,729
Sir? Sir, can I come back to the company
after we get Jockey back to the battalion?

312
00:47:20,535 --> 00:47:24,448
- OK, but you gotta get permission.
- Sure. And my rifle.

313
00:47:27,375 --> 00:47:29,684
Nicky! You're still alive!

314
00:47:30,575 --> 00:47:32,372
Keep moving! Keep moving!

315
00:47:33,415 --> 00:47:39,172
Magnificent, Staros, magnificent. The finest
thing these old eyes have seen in a long time!

316
00:47:39,255 --> 00:47:43,567
Beautifully conceived and executed!
You'll be mentioned in battalion orders.

317
00:47:43,655 --> 00:47:46,089
Young Whyte led beautifully.

318
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:48,166
Yes, sir. Over.

319
00:47:48,295 --> 00:47:51,014
But sending in your second too was brilliant.

320
00:47:51,095 --> 00:47:56,374
They may have carried the ridge. I don't think
they were hurt too bad. Blane led well, too.

321
00:47:56,455 --> 00:47:59,128
Now, how many emplacements
did they locate?

322
00:47:59,215 --> 00:48:01,206
Did they knock any out?

323
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:05,174
We ought to have those ridges
cleaned out by noon! Over.

324
00:48:07,215 --> 00:48:09,410
Hello! Hello! Staros, are you there?

325
00:48:09,495 --> 00:48:11,645
Here, sir. Over.

326
00:48:11,735 --> 00:48:16,411
I said, how many emplacements did they
locate? Did they knock any out? Over.

327
00:48:16,495 --> 00:48:18,770
Children.

328
00:48:18,855 --> 00:48:21,574
I don't know, sir.

329
00:48:21,655 --> 00:48:25,967
What the hell do you mean, you don't know?
How can you not know? Over.

330
00:48:26,095 --> 00:48:30,213
I'm right here behind the first swell, sir.
I'm right here behind the swell.

331
00:48:30,295 --> 00:48:32,525
You want me to stand up and wave? Over.

332
00:48:32,615 --> 00:48:35,687
No, I can see where you are.
I want you to do something.

333
00:48:35,775 --> 00:48:38,847
I want you to get up there
and see what the situation is.

334
00:48:38,935 --> 00:48:41,085
I want Hill 210 in my hands tonight.

335
00:48:41,175 --> 00:48:44,372
Now, goddamn it,
the Admiral got up at dawn for this!

336
00:48:44,455 --> 00:48:46,810
Come to life up there, Staros. Out!

337
00:49:12,095 --> 00:49:14,086
Move up!

338
00:49:31,695 --> 00:49:33,094
Hey, Keck!

339
00:49:34,255 --> 00:49:36,052
Yeah!

340
00:49:36,415 --> 00:49:39,168
- We gotta get out of here.
- I know it.

341
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:41,926
Blane's dead.

342
00:49:42,015 --> 00:49:44,006
You're in charge.

343
00:49:46,855 --> 00:49:49,847
We know you there, Yank!

344
00:49:50,615 --> 00:49:52,606
Tojo eats shit!

345
00:49:52,815 --> 00:49:55,807
No! Roosevelt eats shit!

346
00:50:30,095 --> 00:50:31,892
I got him! I got him!

347
00:50:49,095 --> 00:50:51,086
I killed a man.

348
00:50:51,175 --> 00:50:53,166
Hey, Queen!

349
00:50:53,855 --> 00:50:55,652
Queen, you there?

350
00:50:55,735 --> 00:50:59,614
Worst thing you can do.
Worse than rape.

351
00:50:59,695 --> 00:51:02,528
Queen! You see them Japs
leaving that left ridge?

352
00:51:02,615 --> 00:51:06,290
- I killed a man. Nobody can touch me for it.
- I ain't seen nothing.

353
00:51:06,375 --> 00:51:09,287
Well, get your fuckin' head up
and look around!

354
00:51:10,575 --> 00:51:12,691
I'm serious!

355
00:51:12,775 --> 00:51:16,529
I counted seven Japs
leaving that left-hand grassy ridge!

356
00:51:17,015 --> 00:51:19,006
I got me one of 'em.

357
00:51:19,095 --> 00:51:20,289
So?

358
00:51:20,375 --> 00:51:22,525
I think maybe they're pulling out.

359
00:51:25,735 --> 00:51:28,010
Maybe somebody
ought to go tell the captain.

360
00:51:28,095 --> 00:51:29,574
You wanna be the one to do it?

361
00:51:35,215 --> 00:51:37,683
You just stay put! I'm ordering you!

362
00:51:59,855 --> 00:52:01,254
Down!

363
00:52:09,575 --> 00:52:11,566
Stay low.

364
00:52:37,055 --> 00:52:39,046
Go! Go!

365
00:52:39,255 --> 00:52:41,246
Go! Go!

366
00:53:20,375 --> 00:53:22,366
What do we do now?

367
00:53:22,455 --> 00:53:26,448
We wait right here. Maybe
they'll send us up some reinforcements.

368
00:53:26,535 --> 00:53:27,934
To do what?

369
00:53:28,015 --> 00:53:30,927
To capture some of these
fucking positions around here!

370
00:53:31,015 --> 00:53:36,248
- You mean you really wanna go on with this?
- Hell, no. No, not no uphill charge.

371
00:53:36,335 --> 00:53:39,850
If they send us reinforcements,
maybe we could scout around

372
00:53:39,935 --> 00:53:41,926
and locate these machine guns.

373
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:45,849
- Anyway, it's better than going back down.
- Something's coming!

374
00:53:45,935 --> 00:53:47,766
They're coming!

375
00:53:53,055 --> 00:53:54,249
What are they doin'?

376
00:53:54,335 --> 00:53:57,293
If they want to throw us out,
why didn't they come in force?

377
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:59,491
Maybe they was acting on their own.

378
00:54:00,935 --> 00:54:03,324
Maybe they wanted to get into nirvana.

379
00:54:04,775 --> 00:54:06,572
They're coming.

380
00:54:16,215 --> 00:54:17,330
Keck!

381
00:54:17,415 --> 00:54:18,768
Jesus!

382
00:54:18,855 --> 00:54:20,846
Oh, Jesus!

383
00:54:22,415 --> 00:54:23,973
I blew my butt off!

384
00:54:24,055 --> 00:54:27,331
- It's all right. It's all right.
- I blew my butt off!

385
00:54:27,415 --> 00:54:28,814
Lay down!

386
00:54:28,895 --> 00:54:31,534
What a fucking recruit trick to pull!

387
00:54:31,615 --> 00:54:34,493
- Take it easy. Take it easy.
- I grabbed it by the pin!

388
00:54:35,175 --> 00:54:39,407
You write my old lady. You tell her...
I want her to know I died like a man.

389
00:54:39,495 --> 00:54:41,725
Nobody's gonna have to write her.
You'll make it.

390
00:54:41,815 --> 00:54:43,612
- Don't bullshit me!
- Stay down!

391
00:54:43,695 --> 00:54:45,686
Hey, hey.

392
00:54:46,735 --> 00:54:48,453
Have I got mud on my face?

393
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:50,526
Wipe it off. Get it off.

394
00:54:51,975 --> 00:54:53,966
No!

395
00:54:54,055 --> 00:54:56,046
I'll write her. I promise.

396
00:54:59,335 --> 00:55:03,169
Take my canteen.
There's still some water in there.

397
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:09,766
It's for the best.

398
00:55:10,615 --> 00:55:12,810
I'm all messed up down there.

399
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:15,926
I can't fuck no more.

400
00:55:18,215 --> 00:55:21,446
Whoa... Where am I?

401
00:55:22,855 --> 00:55:24,447
Where am I?

402
00:55:27,175 --> 00:55:29,370
You're gonna be all right.

403
00:55:29,455 --> 00:55:33,414
Even if you die,
you didn't let your brother down.

404
00:55:33,495 --> 00:55:38,011
If you hadn't thrown yourself against
that embankment, we'd all have been killed.

405
00:55:38,095 --> 00:55:40,086
I'm cold.

406
00:55:42,415 --> 00:55:44,485
I'm cold.

407
00:55:45,695 --> 00:55:47,686
I'm... freezing.

408
00:56:40,775 --> 00:56:42,766
You gonna write his wife?

409
00:56:44,135 --> 00:56:45,932
Fuck, no.

410
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:48,326
I don't know his old lady.

411
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:53,252
That's the company commander's job. You
outta your mind? I ain't no good at writing.

412
00:56:53,335 --> 00:56:55,326
You told him you would.

413
00:56:55,415 --> 00:56:59,044
I'll say anything to 'em
when they're like that.

414
00:56:59,855 --> 00:57:01,652
Somebody ought to do it.

415
00:57:01,735 --> 00:57:04,488
Well, then, you write her. Yeah, you write her.

416
00:57:13,375 --> 00:57:15,570
What's wrong, Jim?

417
00:58:32,815 --> 00:58:37,172
There's nothing anybody can do for him.
He'll die before they get him to a surgeon.

418
00:58:37,255 --> 00:58:42,045
- Then I can't ask you to go out there.
- Maybe I could get some morphine into him.

419
00:58:42,135 --> 00:58:45,252
- Would it keep him quiet?
- Not for long, but I can give him two.

420
00:58:45,335 --> 00:58:48,611
And I could maybe leave him
three or four for himself.

421
00:58:50,615 --> 00:58:52,810
Couldn't you give 'em to him all at once?

422
00:59:10,535 --> 00:59:12,526
That's what you are.

423
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:17,167
That's all there is for us.
That's us, that's us.

424
00:59:17,735 --> 00:59:20,852
I lost all twelve. I lost all twelve.

425
00:59:22,055 --> 00:59:23,852
All twelve of 'em.

426
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:25,334
It's insanity up there.

427
00:59:25,415 --> 00:59:29,328
I told 'em what to do, I showed 'em
where to go and I gave 'em a push.

428
00:59:29,415 --> 00:59:34,535
- Somebody help!
- I know you. I know you, Sergeant.

429
00:59:34,615 --> 00:59:39,131
It's insane. I don't know who's in charge here,
but don't let him go! Don't let him go!

430
00:59:39,215 --> 00:59:41,171
I'm outta here. I'm outta here.

431
00:59:41,255 --> 00:59:45,214
I'm outta here. All right, move feet.
Move, move, move, move. Move, move!

432
00:59:45,295 --> 00:59:47,934
I'm moving. I'm moving. I'm moving now.

433
00:59:48,015 --> 00:59:52,486
Don't touch. Don't touch. Don't look at me.
Don't touch. OK, I'm outta here.

434
00:59:52,575 --> 00:59:54,486
All right. All right.

435
00:59:54,575 --> 00:59:57,408
All right. All right.

436
01:00:14,695 --> 01:00:16,731
Somebody help me!

437
01:00:16,815 --> 01:00:18,009
Help me!

438
01:00:20,175 --> 01:00:22,689
You gotta be quiet. I came to help you, Tella.

439
01:00:22,775 --> 01:00:25,084
- OK. Calm down.
- Fuck you!

440
01:00:25,175 --> 01:00:28,133
I'm dying! I'm dying, sarge!

441
01:00:28,215 --> 01:00:30,524
OK. Well, goddamn it, do it with less noise!

442
01:00:31,495 --> 01:00:34,214
- How you gonna get me out?
- I'm gonna take you back.

443
01:00:37,495 --> 01:00:39,087
- Come on.
- No!

444
01:00:39,175 --> 01:00:41,643
Put me down! Put me down!

445
01:00:46,815 --> 01:00:49,648
Leave me alone... Leave me alone.

446
01:00:49,775 --> 01:00:52,005
Please, leave me alone.

447
01:01:00,095 --> 01:01:02,086
Give me more. Give me more.

448
01:01:02,695 --> 01:01:04,845
Give me more. Give me more.

449
01:01:04,935 --> 01:01:07,005
Give me more. Give me more.

450
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:11,209
Here, Tella.

451
01:01:19,615 --> 01:01:22,129
Goodbye... goodbye.

452
01:01:25,295 --> 01:01:26,887
Bye, kid.

453
01:01:26,975 --> 01:01:29,853
Goodbye, sarge. Goodbye.

454
01:01:45,455 --> 01:01:49,243
Fortunately, Jim, the fate of the company
doesn't depend on one man.

455
01:01:53,935 --> 01:01:56,893
Sergeant, I saw the whole thing
through the glasses.

456
01:01:56,975 --> 01:02:01,048
I'm gonna mention you in orders tomorrow
and recommend you for the Silver Star.

457
01:02:01,135 --> 01:02:03,649
- It's the most courageous thing...
- Captain,

458
01:02:03,735 --> 01:02:07,774
you say one more word to thank me,
I'll knock you right in the teeth.

459
01:02:07,855 --> 01:02:11,404
You mention me in your fuckin' orders,
and I'll resign so fast

460
01:02:11,495 --> 01:02:15,374
and leave you here
to run this busted-up outfit by yourself.

461
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:18,566
You understand?

462
01:02:19,255 --> 01:02:22,850
Property!
Whole fuckin' thing's about property.

463
01:02:37,135 --> 01:02:41,253
What's the matter with you, Staros? Those
men should be reinforced immediately!

464
01:02:41,335 --> 01:02:44,054
What are they doing?
I can see 'em through my glasses.

465
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:46,126
They're lying behind that ledge!

466
01:02:46,215 --> 01:02:49,605
They should be up and out,
cleaning out those machine guns! Over!

467
01:02:49,695 --> 01:02:52,493
I don't think you understand
what's going on, sir.

468
01:02:52,575 --> 01:02:55,328
We've had... heavy casualties.

469
01:02:55,415 --> 01:03:00,091
We had a man... His gut got shot out
on the slopes, sir. Created quite an upset.

470
01:03:00,175 --> 01:03:03,212
Fine, fine. Now,
what about those reinforcements? Over.

471
01:03:03,295 --> 01:03:06,685
I have... two squads to...

472
01:03:06,775 --> 01:03:08,891
First Platoon I can send up, sir. Over.

473
01:03:08,975 --> 01:03:11,284
What the hell do you mean, two squads?!

474
01:03:11,375 --> 01:03:14,685
Goddamn you, Staros!
When I say reinforcements,

475
01:03:14,775 --> 01:03:19,326
goddamn it, I mean it! You commit
everybody you have there and do it now!

476
01:03:19,415 --> 01:03:23,249
Your First Platoon, too. I see 'em
lying on their fat asses doing nothing.

477
01:03:23,335 --> 01:03:28,170
Get a man to 'em right now with orders to
attack, and move 'em by the flank to the ridge.

478
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:30,928
Then get that Second Platoon over to the hill!

479
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:34,132
Have 'em press the centre.
Go straight up that goddamn hill!

480
01:03:34,215 --> 01:03:35,807
Attack them right now!

481
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:39,524
Jesus, Staros! Do I have to give you
a lesson on infantry tactics

482
01:03:39,615 --> 01:03:42,129
while your men
are getting their asses shot off?.

483
01:03:42,215 --> 01:03:45,810
Colonel, I don't think you fully understand
what is going on here.

484
01:03:45,895 --> 01:03:48,967
My company alone
cannot take that position, sir.

485
01:03:49,055 --> 01:03:52,411
The Japs are too well dug in.
They've got too much fire power.

486
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:54,486
Colonel, there's a bunker up there.

487
01:03:54,575 --> 01:03:57,806
We can't see it, and it's...
it's chewing my men to pieces, sir.

488
01:04:00,855 --> 01:04:04,291
I request permission
for patrol reconnaissance around

489
01:04:04,375 --> 01:04:07,845
to the right of Hill 210.
I believe the entire position, sir,

490
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:10,449
can be outflanked
with a manoeuvre there in force.

491
01:04:10,535 --> 01:04:12,730
- No! Goddamn it, no!
- Might save lives!

492
01:04:12,815 --> 01:04:14,612
There'll be no flanking move.

493
01:04:14,695 --> 01:04:17,414
Listen, Staros.
You're not gonna take your men

494
01:04:17,495 --> 01:04:20,805
around into the jungle
to avoid a goddamn fight!

495
01:04:20,895 --> 01:04:26,208
Do you hear me, Staros? I want you to attack
right now with every man at your disposal!

496
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:29,048
Now, attack, Staros! That's a direct order!

497
01:04:38,055 --> 01:04:40,888
Sir, I must tell you
that I refuse to obey your order.

498
01:04:54,775 --> 01:04:58,563
- There it is, right there. See it?
- I don't see it.

499
01:04:59,295 --> 01:05:01,968
This is not your fault, Jim.
He's ordering you to.

500
01:05:05,375 --> 01:05:10,608
I again request permission for patrol
reconnaissance around to the right in force.

501
01:05:11,815 --> 01:05:15,364
The time, sir... is 1321 hours, 25 seconds.

502
01:05:15,455 --> 01:05:20,245
I have two witnesses here. I request that
you do the same with witnesses there. Over.

503
01:05:25,215 --> 01:05:28,605
Staros, don't pull this
guardhouse-lawyer bullshit with me!

504
01:05:28,695 --> 01:05:32,608
Now, I know you're a goddamn lawyer!
This is not a court of law.

505
01:05:32,695 --> 01:05:34,845
This is a war. It's a goddamn battle!

506
01:05:34,935 --> 01:05:39,611
Now, I want that frontal attack.
I repeat my order. Over.

507
01:05:39,695 --> 01:05:43,210
Colonel, I refuse to take my men up there
in a frontal attack.

508
01:05:43,295 --> 01:05:45,365
It's suicide, sir.

509
01:05:45,455 --> 01:05:50,404
I've lived with these men for two years, and
I will not order them all to their deaths. Over.

510
01:05:59,055 --> 01:06:01,523
This is a very important decision, Staros.

511
01:06:04,975 --> 01:06:08,650
But if you feel that strongly, maybe
you have a reason, so I'm coming down.

512
01:06:08,735 --> 01:06:11,010
Go take a look.

513
01:06:11,095 --> 01:06:13,689
I'm not rescinding my order to you, son,

514
01:06:13,775 --> 01:06:18,405
but if I find extenuating circumstances
when I get there, I'll take that into account.

515
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:22,613
Now, in the meantime, goddamn it,
I want you to hold on until I get there.

516
01:06:22,695 --> 01:06:26,734
And, if possible, you get those men
on the ridge out and moving! Out.

517
01:06:39,415 --> 01:06:41,929
One spot's as good as another, men.

518
01:06:42,015 --> 01:06:44,006
There's no place to hide.

519
01:06:48,335 --> 01:06:52,647
Just take it easy, son.
Take it easy. Take it easy.

520
01:06:53,615 --> 01:06:55,970
Where's... where's Fife?

521
01:06:56,055 --> 01:06:58,171
Fife? He's right here, son. Fife.

522
01:06:58,255 --> 01:07:00,769
Hold my hand, Fife.

523
01:07:01,655 --> 01:07:03,646
Hold my hand.

524
01:07:08,615 --> 01:07:10,526
I got it.

525
01:07:14,375 --> 01:07:16,366
I'm dying, Fife.

526
01:07:42,295 --> 01:07:44,365
Oh, Captain...

527
01:08:31,415 --> 01:08:33,610
Shut up in a tomb.

528
01:08:35,495 --> 01:08:37,690
Can't lift the lid.

529
01:08:39,855 --> 01:08:42,050
Played a role I never conceived.

530
01:08:42,415 --> 01:08:46,169
Get that blouse on, soldier.
It's not a goddamn bathing beach!

531
01:08:46,255 --> 01:08:47,847
Put it on right now.

532
01:08:47,935 --> 01:08:51,166
What you aiming at, son?
Let's go get those son of a bitches.

533
01:08:51,255 --> 01:08:53,246
Move up!

534
01:09:02,695 --> 01:09:06,210
What are you doing laying down there
where you can't see a damn thing?

535
01:09:11,575 --> 01:09:14,726
Observing, sir. Just sent
First Platoon forward to the ridge.

536
01:09:14,815 --> 01:09:18,285
- How many of 'em were hit this time?
- None, sir.

537
01:09:18,375 --> 01:09:20,366
None? Not one?

538
01:09:21,335 --> 01:09:25,123
Doesn't sound like the situation
you described to me over the sound power.

539
01:09:25,215 --> 01:09:29,606
Well, it's not. The situation's changed
just in the last five minutes, sir.

540
01:09:33,015 --> 01:09:35,006
Captain, you listen to me.

541
01:09:35,095 --> 01:09:37,609
We're going over there
and taking everybody with us.

542
01:09:37,695 --> 01:09:40,084
Do you have any more complaints
or demurrers?

543
01:09:41,455 --> 01:09:44,652
- No, sir. Not now.
- All right! We're gonna do things my way!

544
01:09:44,735 --> 01:09:47,044
My way! You understand that, Captain?

545
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:51,253
We're taking everybody over to that ledge!
We may take that ridge by nightfall!

546
01:09:51,335 --> 01:09:55,044
I think the ridge
is quite a way from being reduced, sir.

547
01:10:01,935 --> 01:10:04,324
Show me how to see things the way you do.

548
01:10:07,415 --> 01:10:09,645
Show me how to see things the way you do.

549
01:10:12,855 --> 01:10:15,847
We're just dirt. We're just dirt.

550
01:10:38,495 --> 01:10:40,884
We're gonna get killed if we stay here.

551
01:10:40,975 --> 01:10:44,092
Bell, take six men

552
01:10:44,175 --> 01:10:46,166
and go see what's up there.

553
01:10:51,335 --> 01:10:54,247
And we'll cover you the best we can
from down there.

554
01:12:10,695 --> 01:12:12,094
OK.

555
01:12:12,175 --> 01:12:14,564
You guys, you guys, stay here. OK?

556
01:12:15,655 --> 01:12:17,646
I'm going alone.

557
01:13:53,175 --> 01:13:55,166
Come out.

558
01:14:00,295 --> 01:14:02,286
Come out where I am.

559
01:15:07,935 --> 01:15:10,574
There was a... There was a...

560
01:15:11,815 --> 01:15:14,409
There's a bunker... up there.

561
01:15:16,175 --> 01:15:18,166
It's five guns.

562
01:15:18,495 --> 01:15:20,690
It's five guns.

563
01:15:24,935 --> 01:15:29,611
That strongpoint up there,
somewhere up there around those rocks,

564
01:15:29,695 --> 01:15:31,686
is the key to this ridge.

565
01:15:34,655 --> 01:15:36,691
Bell here is quite right.

566
01:15:36,775 --> 01:15:42,247
From their knob up there, those little brown
brothers can cover the whole of the ground

567
01:15:42,335 --> 01:15:46,487
in front of this position for 1,000 yards.
They've left this ledge unguarded.

568
01:15:46,575 --> 01:15:50,363
Now, goddamn it, that's a mistake.
That's a hell of a mistake.

569
01:15:50,455 --> 01:15:54,448
We need to take advantage of it
before they see their error.

570
01:15:56,775 --> 01:16:00,085
All right, all right,
I know you're all pretty exhausted,

571
01:16:00,175 --> 01:16:03,485
and we've had a hell of a time
getting water up here.

572
01:16:04,335 --> 01:16:07,133
For that I'm sorry. I apologise to you all.

573
01:16:08,215 --> 01:16:12,686
But if we can reduce this bunker tomorrow,
I think we can take this ridge.

574
01:16:15,415 --> 01:16:17,645
So I'm asking for volunteers.

575
01:16:17,735 --> 01:16:19,885
Go back up there and knock it out.

576
01:16:19,975 --> 01:16:21,966
Sir?

577
01:16:22,055 --> 01:16:24,046
I'll be glad to go back up

578
01:16:24,135 --> 01:16:26,365
- and lead the way back for a party.
- Right.

579
01:16:26,455 --> 01:16:28,093
- I'll go, sir.
- You.

580
01:16:28,815 --> 01:16:30,214
All right.

581
01:16:30,295 --> 01:16:34,925
- I'd like to lead the party, Colonel.
- All right, John. I was hoping you'd say that.

582
01:16:35,015 --> 01:16:37,813
- You'll be in command.
- I'll go, sir.

583
01:16:37,895 --> 01:16:39,214
- Sir?
- You.

584
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:43,129
All right, men, that's enough.
Seven is plenty. Gather up.

585
01:16:46,775 --> 01:16:51,087
I don't know if you realise the importance
of this operation, Staros.

586
01:16:52,215 --> 01:16:55,491
Once our position is secured,
we can move the bombers in.

587
01:16:55,575 --> 01:16:59,363
That means air power
for 1,000 miles in every direction.

588
01:17:00,735 --> 01:17:03,727
Guadalcanal may be
the turning point in the war.

589
01:17:04,815 --> 01:17:08,251
- It'll cost lives. Is that what's troubling you?
- No, sir.

590
01:17:11,255 --> 01:17:14,133
I explained to you
the importance of this objective.

591
01:17:14,215 --> 01:17:17,287
How many men do you think it's worth?
How many lives?

592
01:17:17,375 --> 01:17:19,366
I can't say, sir.

593
01:17:25,415 --> 01:17:30,045
Are you prepared to sacrifice the lives
of any of your men in this campaign?

594
01:17:32,335 --> 01:17:34,326
How many? One? Two?

595
01:17:35,575 --> 01:17:37,566
Twenty?

596
01:17:38,735 --> 01:17:41,727
Lives will be lost in your company, Captain.

597
01:17:42,975 --> 01:17:47,207
And if you don't have the stomach for it,
now is the time to let me know.

598
01:17:48,055 --> 01:17:51,809
No, sir. You're right...
about everything you said.

599
01:17:51,895 --> 01:17:53,886
Fine, fine.

600
01:17:53,975 --> 01:17:55,966
That's all, Captain.

601
01:17:57,615 --> 01:17:59,606
One more thing, Staros.

602
01:18:00,335 --> 01:18:04,453
It's not necessary for you
to ever tell me that you think I'm right.

603
01:18:05,015 --> 01:18:06,607
Ever.

604
01:18:06,695 --> 01:18:08,925
We'll assume it.

605
01:18:09,015 --> 01:18:10,812
Dismissed.

606
01:18:26,959 --> 01:18:28,950
I feel sorry for you, kid.

607
01:18:30,279 --> 01:18:32,270
- Yeah?
- Yeah, a little.

608
01:18:35,599 --> 01:18:37,590
This army's gonna kill you.

609
01:18:40,959 --> 01:18:46,670
If you were smart, you'd take care of yourself.
There's nothing you can do for anybody else.

610
01:18:46,759 --> 01:18:50,752
You're just running into a burning house
where nobody can be saved.

611
01:19:03,079 --> 01:19:07,709
What difference do you think you can make?
One single man in all this madness.

612
01:19:13,039 --> 01:19:15,348
If you die, it's gonna be for nothing.

613
01:19:19,319 --> 01:19:23,790
There's not some other world out there
where everything's gonna be OK.

614
01:19:23,879 --> 01:19:25,870
There's just this one.

615
01:19:27,719 --> 01:19:29,710
Just this rock.

616
01:20:05,159 --> 01:20:07,548
Go ahead! Come on, come on.

617
01:20:07,639 --> 01:20:10,631
Who's deciding who's gonna live?

618
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:13,313
Who's deciding who's gonna die?

619
01:20:15,119 --> 01:20:17,110
This is futile!

620
01:20:18,519 --> 01:20:23,388
Look at me!
I stand right up here and not one bullet.

621
01:20:23,479 --> 01:20:25,470
Not one shot!

622
01:20:26,359 --> 01:20:28,156
Why?

623
01:20:28,439 --> 01:20:30,430
How come they all had to die?

624
01:20:30,519 --> 01:20:34,797
I can stand right here, I can stand right up
and nothing happens to me!

625
01:20:54,439 --> 01:20:56,430
We.

626
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:04,710
We together.

627
01:21:14,999 --> 01:21:16,990
One being.

628
01:21:31,399 --> 01:21:33,594
Flow together like water,

629
01:21:36,759 --> 01:21:38,954
till I can't tell you from me.

630
01:21:56,119 --> 01:21:58,110
I drink you.

631
01:22:00,079 --> 01:22:02,070
Now.

632
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:06,310
Now.

633
01:22:41,439 --> 01:22:43,430
You're my light.

634
01:22:46,559 --> 01:22:48,550
My guide.

635
01:23:54,559 --> 01:23:58,074
John, I'll be behind you.
If you wanna break through, we'll come after.

636
01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:00,593
We'll charge at your whistle signal.

637
01:24:01,319 --> 01:24:03,708
All right, let's go, men. Go get 'em.

638
01:25:53,359 --> 01:25:55,350
OK.

639
01:25:56,319 --> 01:25:58,879
Stay down, below this ledge,

640
01:25:58,959 --> 01:26:02,793
and I'll call down the data from above.

641
01:26:02,879 --> 01:26:07,270
Once the 81s have plastered that rock...
as much as possible,

642
01:26:07,359 --> 01:26:10,988
we're gonna crawl out
along that big rock for cover

643
01:26:12,439 --> 01:26:14,430
and then flank 'em to the right.

644
01:26:14,519 --> 01:26:16,316
OK?

645
01:26:17,759 --> 01:26:20,227
OK. OK.

646
01:26:40,079 --> 01:26:44,470
Azimuth 1470... from Easy Roger 7.

647
01:26:45,319 --> 01:26:47,549
100 left, add 200.

648
01:26:47,639 --> 01:26:50,199
Uncle Baker 1, fire mission.

649
01:26:50,279 --> 01:26:53,157
Azimuth 1470 from Easy Roger 7.

650
01:26:53,239 --> 01:26:56,311
Left 100, add 200.

651
01:26:56,959 --> 01:27:00,110
Machine gun. Will adjust. Over.

652
01:27:00,199 --> 01:27:02,838
Understand. 1470 from Easy Roger 7.

653
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:18,630
Left 25, drop 50!

654
01:27:19,759 --> 01:27:21,750
Left 25, Uncle Baker 1.

655
01:27:21,839 --> 01:27:24,034
Left 25, drop 50.

656
01:27:24,119 --> 01:27:26,110
Fire for effect. Over.

657
01:27:26,359 --> 01:27:28,350
Roger, Uncle Baker 1.

658
01:27:49,799 --> 01:27:51,391
Let's go!

659
01:28:06,199 --> 01:28:09,475
OK, we're gonna continue on
up the hill to the right.

660
01:28:09,559 --> 01:28:13,632
Nobody fire or throw the grenades
till I give the signal.

661
01:28:13,719 --> 01:28:15,710
OK, let's do it.

662
01:28:29,759 --> 01:28:32,592
Is he OK? Is he all right?

663
01:28:32,679 --> 01:28:34,954
What we gonna do? Can't take him with us.

664
01:28:35,039 --> 01:28:38,918
- No, we can't leave him here.
- He's from your platoon. You stay with him.

665
01:28:38,999 --> 01:28:42,833
We can leave him and pick him up
on the way back... if he's still alive.

666
01:28:46,559 --> 01:28:48,868
- Is he dead?
- Not yet.

667
01:28:48,959 --> 01:28:52,395
Dale, stay with him!
Cover our flank! Move!

668
01:29:16,119 --> 01:29:17,154
Behind you!

669
01:29:31,959 --> 01:29:33,950
We're pinned down!

670
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:04,630
Fall back!

671
01:30:09,399 --> 01:30:10,798
Go!

672
01:31:18,999 --> 01:31:20,990
Watch out.

673
01:31:58,039 --> 01:31:59,438
Clear!

674
01:32:49,519 --> 01:32:51,510
Come on. Get out.

675
01:32:52,839 --> 01:32:54,830
Go on.

676
01:32:57,679 --> 01:32:59,670
Think you're soldiers?

677
01:33:06,399 --> 01:33:08,549
You piece of shit!

678
01:33:14,559 --> 01:33:16,356
Son of a bitch!

679
01:33:16,439 --> 01:33:18,430
Son of a bitch!

680
01:33:36,679 --> 01:33:38,670
All right?

681
01:33:41,319 --> 01:33:43,310
I shot a man.

682
01:34:17,119 --> 01:34:19,110
Stinks around here.

683
01:34:20,279 --> 01:34:23,669
- All these dead people.
- Put a cigarette up your nose.

684
01:35:42,439 --> 01:35:44,794
Look at 'em move!

685
01:35:44,879 --> 01:35:46,551
Look at 'em move!

686
01:35:46,639 --> 01:35:48,436
We got 'em on the run!

687
01:35:48,519 --> 01:35:51,591
Way to go, John. When they saw you
make that attack and win,

688
01:35:51,679 --> 01:35:54,113
you put their hearts back into them.

689
01:35:54,199 --> 01:35:56,315
- Hey, hey!
- Don't do that, soldier.

690
01:35:56,399 --> 01:36:00,995
Take care of the others. G-2 will want them.
There'll be somebody around before long.

691
01:36:01,079 --> 01:36:03,434
We've wasted enough time here. Let's go.

692
01:36:03,519 --> 01:36:06,158
Sir, I've a few recommendations
for decorations.

693
01:36:06,239 --> 01:36:09,629
Yes. We'll get everything for all of 'em
that we can, but later.

694
01:36:09,719 --> 01:36:13,997
Meantime, I want you to know I'm personally
recommending you for something, John.

695
01:36:14,079 --> 01:36:15,478
Perhaps the big one.

696
01:36:15,559 --> 01:36:18,517
- Thank you, sir, but I don't feel...
- Yes, you do, John.

697
01:36:18,599 --> 01:36:21,318
Getting it for you
will be the goddamn problem!

698
01:36:21,399 --> 01:36:25,631
But, hell, it'd be a big thing for the battalion
and the regiment, if you did get it.

699
01:36:25,719 --> 01:36:27,311
We better move out.

700
01:36:27,399 --> 01:36:31,756
We need to extend our lines, hook up with
the other companies and push on to the top.

701
01:36:31,839 --> 01:36:34,672
Would you like to take command
of Baker Company?

702
01:36:34,759 --> 01:36:35,748
Of course.

703
01:36:35,839 --> 01:36:40,276
Sir, I don't mean to be a wet blanket,
but about the water. If we don't get water...

704
01:36:40,359 --> 01:36:42,350
Don't worry about water.

705
01:36:43,799 --> 01:36:48,827
John, I don't want anything to break up this
attack of ours now we have the momentum.

706
01:36:48,919 --> 01:36:52,309
We'll have some water in a... couple of hours.

707
01:36:52,399 --> 01:36:54,390
I've arranged for that.

708
01:36:54,999 --> 01:36:58,355
Now, we just can't stop now, goddamn it,
and wait for it.

709
01:36:58,439 --> 01:37:00,236
No, sir.

710
01:37:00,319 --> 01:37:02,435
That's right.

711
01:37:02,519 --> 01:37:08,071
And if some of the men... pass out,
why, hell, they'll just have to pass out.

712
01:37:11,719 --> 01:37:13,516
All right.

713
01:37:13,599 --> 01:37:14,998
They could...

714
01:37:15,079 --> 01:37:18,276
- They could die from it.
- They could die from enemy fire, too!

715
01:37:19,559 --> 01:37:21,754
They're all tough boys.

716
01:37:26,319 --> 01:37:31,234
Come on, men, let's go! You'll see
plenty more of those where we're going!

717
01:37:31,319 --> 01:37:33,787
Are we going up this hill or aren't we?

718
01:37:37,519 --> 01:37:41,307
John, I'm convinced that
the Japanese position can be broken now.

719
01:37:41,399 --> 01:37:46,268
All we have to do is keep going and we'll
have this hill. We'll have this hill by sundown.

720
01:37:46,359 --> 01:37:49,237
You see the spirit in these men?
D'you see the new spirit?

721
01:37:49,319 --> 01:37:54,268
Well, I want to take advantage of that before
something happens to sap their strength.

722
01:37:54,359 --> 01:37:57,112
To have this battalion relieved in a defeat,

723
01:37:57,199 --> 01:38:00,714
or even to have it reinforced
from troops from the reserves,

724
01:38:00,799 --> 01:38:03,836
if we were to stall
before reaching the top, well,

725
01:38:03,919 --> 01:38:07,992
Jesus Christ, that's just
a hell of a lot more than I could stand!

726
01:38:08,079 --> 01:38:10,354
I've waited all my life for this.

727
01:38:10,439 --> 01:38:14,796
I've worked, slaved, eaten... oh, untold
buckets of shit to have this opportunity!

728
01:38:14,879 --> 01:38:17,234
And I don't intend to give it up now.

729
01:38:20,279 --> 01:38:23,794
You don't know what it feels like
to be passed over.

730
01:38:23,879 --> 01:38:26,916
I mean, you're young.
You're just out of the Academy.

731
01:38:26,999 --> 01:38:32,437
You're, you know, you've got your war!
This 15 years, this is my first war!

732
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:40,876
John, some day you'll understand.

733
01:38:46,519 --> 01:38:48,510
You're like a son to me, John.

734
01:38:50,799 --> 01:38:52,790
You know what my son does?

735
01:38:53,679 --> 01:38:55,670
He's a bait salesman.

736
01:38:58,159 --> 01:39:00,150
You've done a hell of ajob, John.

737
01:39:00,239 --> 01:39:04,869
I'm gonna make sure that you get everything,
everything that you deserve.

738
01:39:07,039 --> 01:39:09,030
Thank you, sir.

739
01:39:11,039 --> 01:39:13,030
God...

740
01:39:14,039 --> 01:39:16,428
Goddamn it! I want three runners!

741
01:39:16,519 --> 01:39:18,111
Get me three runners!

742
01:39:18,199 --> 01:39:20,349
You go back to the rear to find water

743
01:39:20,439 --> 01:39:23,192
and get back here with it as fast as you can!

744
01:39:24,079 --> 01:39:27,151
We attack in one hour!
We'll throw everything we got at 'em.

745
01:39:27,239 --> 01:39:29,628
We're going all the way! Nothing'll stop us.

746
01:39:29,719 --> 01:39:31,710
It's high ground by nightfall!

747
01:39:54,879 --> 01:39:57,313
You seen many dead people?

748
01:39:58,079 --> 01:39:59,956
Plenty.

749
01:40:00,039 --> 01:40:02,553
They're no different than dead dogs,

750
01:40:03,239 --> 01:40:05,230
once you get used to the idea.

751
01:40:09,879 --> 01:40:11,870
They're meat, kid.

752
01:40:27,279 --> 01:40:30,112
Are you righteous? Kind?

753
01:40:33,079 --> 01:40:35,149
Does your confiidence lie in this?

754
01:40:38,439 --> 01:40:40,430
Are you loved by all?

755
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:44,630
Know that I was, too.

756
01:40:48,079 --> 01:40:52,550
Do you imagine your sufferings will be less
because you loved goodness?

757
01:40:53,159 --> 01:40:55,150
Truth?

758
01:44:43,719 --> 01:44:46,791
Get fucking on the ground!
Get down! Get down!

759
01:44:47,519 --> 01:44:49,510
Get down. Stay there.

760
01:44:57,639 --> 01:45:01,348
Get on the ground!
Get on the fucking ground!

761
01:45:01,439 --> 01:45:03,236
Now!

762
01:46:00,479 --> 01:46:02,470
This great evil.

763
01:46:05,119 --> 01:46:07,110
Where's it come from?

764
01:46:11,599 --> 01:46:13,590
How'd it steal into the world?

765
01:46:24,879 --> 01:46:28,269
What seed, what root did it grow from?

766
01:46:32,999 --> 01:46:34,990
Who's doing this?

767
01:46:37,479 --> 01:46:39,470
Who's killing us?

768
01:46:43,279 --> 01:46:45,668
Robbing us of life and light.

769
01:46:50,239 --> 01:46:53,515
Mocking us with the sight
of what we might have known.

770
01:47:18,439 --> 01:47:21,033
Does our ruin benefiit the Earth?

771
01:47:23,319 --> 01:47:26,789
Does it help the grass to grow
or the sun to shine?

772
01:47:32,719 --> 01:47:34,914
Is this darkness in you, too?

773
01:47:41,119 --> 01:47:43,349
Have you passed through this night?

774
01:47:49,319 --> 01:47:51,753
I'm gonna sink my teeth into your liver.

775
01:47:55,319 --> 01:47:57,310
You're dying.

776
01:48:08,759 --> 01:48:10,750
See them birds up there?

777
01:48:12,439 --> 01:48:14,634
You know they eat you raw?

778
01:48:19,359 --> 01:48:22,396
Where you're going,
you're not coming back from.

779
01:49:30,959 --> 01:49:32,950
What are you to me?

780
01:49:38,519 --> 01:49:40,510
Nothing.

781
01:51:55,919 --> 01:51:57,910
Have a seat here.

782
01:52:07,759 --> 01:52:10,432
Staros, I'm relieving you of your command.

783
01:52:13,679 --> 01:52:15,954
Lieutenant Band will take over for you.

784
01:52:17,599 --> 01:52:19,590
I already told him.

785
01:52:29,559 --> 01:52:31,754
It's a hard thing to do.

786
01:52:32,519 --> 01:52:34,510
Difficult decision to make.

787
01:52:37,519 --> 01:52:39,589
I don't think you're tough enough.

788
01:52:41,039 --> 01:52:45,829
You're too soft. You're just too softhearted.
You're not tough-fibred enough.

789
01:52:50,199 --> 01:52:53,987
Anyway, it's my decision to make.
I've already made it.

790
01:52:54,679 --> 01:52:57,068
I don't like to see my men get killed, sir.

791
01:53:04,999 --> 01:53:08,071
Have you ever had anyone
die in your arms, sir?

792
01:53:08,159 --> 01:53:10,354
Have you?

793
01:53:22,479 --> 01:53:25,312
I don't see any reason
to make a scandal out of this.

794
01:53:25,399 --> 01:53:30,598
I don't want it in the records of the battalion.
There's no reason for you to have it on yours.

795
01:53:30,679 --> 01:53:34,115
This has nothing to do with
cowardice or inefficiency.

796
01:53:37,279 --> 01:53:39,474
Look at this jungle.

797
01:53:39,559 --> 01:53:44,679
Look at those vines, the way they twine
around the trees, swallowing everything.

798
01:53:46,999 --> 01:53:49,194
Nature's cruel, Staros.

799
01:53:58,079 --> 01:54:03,392
I'm going to let you apply for reassignment
to the Judge Advocate General Corps

800
01:54:03,479 --> 01:54:05,276
for reasons of ill health.

801
01:54:05,359 --> 01:54:06,678
You're a lawyer.

802
01:54:06,759 --> 01:54:09,034
- You had malaria yet?
- No, I haven't.

803
01:54:09,119 --> 01:54:11,394
Doesn't matter. I can fix that.

804
01:54:11,479 --> 01:54:13,629
Anyway, you probably will have it.

805
01:54:14,279 --> 01:54:17,191
I'm also recommending you
for the Silver Star.

806
01:54:17,279 --> 01:54:21,272
And I'll recommend it in such a way
it definitely won't be refused.

807
01:54:22,159 --> 01:54:24,673
Might as well have the Purple Heart, too.

808
01:54:27,239 --> 01:54:28,831
Why?

809
01:54:28,919 --> 01:54:34,312
Because of that scratch on your face
and because of those cuts on your hands.

810
01:54:34,399 --> 01:54:35,991
Listen to me, Staros.

811
01:54:36,079 --> 01:54:39,958
I think it's best you go back with
the next batch of wounded and prisoners.

812
01:54:40,039 --> 01:54:43,668
It is no goddamn good for you
to keep hanging around.

813
01:54:43,759 --> 01:54:47,149
The quieter we keep this,
the better it'll be for all.

814
01:55:20,399 --> 01:55:22,549
This is from Colonel Tall.

815
01:55:23,999 --> 01:55:27,355
"Our victory gives us
the highest reasons for pride."

816
01:55:28,399 --> 01:55:31,789
"It will prove a milestone
in the battle for Guadalcanal."

817
01:55:33,079 --> 01:55:37,869
"Tomorrow the division commander
will arrive to make an inspection of the line."

818
01:55:37,959 --> 01:55:42,987
"After the inspection we're to be relieved by a
battalion of the division's reserve regiment."

819
01:55:44,399 --> 01:55:48,472
"I've secured for the battalion
a week's rest off the line."

820
01:55:52,559 --> 01:55:53,958
That's all.

821
01:57:44,639 --> 01:57:46,630
Hours like months.

822
01:57:49,279 --> 01:57:51,270
Days like years.

823
01:57:54,479 --> 01:57:56,470
Walked into the golden age.

824
01:58:00,279 --> 01:58:02,747
Stood on the shores of the New World.

825
01:58:13,239 --> 01:58:16,072
I wouldve come by
and paid you guys a visit,

826
01:58:16,159 --> 01:58:17,751
but...

827
01:58:20,759 --> 01:58:23,273
I just felt like being alone, you know?

828
01:58:24,999 --> 01:58:26,990
Yeah?

829
01:58:36,759 --> 01:58:38,750
We wanted to thank you, sir.

830
01:58:42,639 --> 01:58:45,028
For asking to make that flanking move.

831
01:58:47,039 --> 01:58:49,030
For watching out for us.

832
01:58:50,999 --> 01:58:52,990
Keeping us together.

833
01:58:57,959 --> 01:58:59,950
We're all sorry to see you go.

834
01:59:00,039 --> 01:59:02,109
We feel like you got a rotten deal.

835
01:59:04,279 --> 01:59:07,316
Well, I'm not sure that you're right.

836
01:59:09,959 --> 01:59:11,756
Tough part is...

837
01:59:13,599 --> 01:59:15,954
not knowing if you're doing any good.

838
01:59:17,759 --> 01:59:19,750
That's the hard part.

839
01:59:21,439 --> 01:59:23,953
But it doesn't matter. I don't care.

840
01:59:24,759 --> 01:59:26,750
I'm glad to be going.

841
01:59:27,959 --> 01:59:29,836
I'm glad.

842
01:59:29,919 --> 01:59:33,548
- There's still time. We could file a complaint.
- For what?

843
01:59:34,599 --> 01:59:36,749
What good would that do?

844
01:59:38,399 --> 01:59:39,991
Anyway, I wanna go.

845
01:59:42,799 --> 01:59:45,154
Leave it alone. Let it lay.

846
01:59:57,239 --> 01:59:59,230
What does that mean, sir?

847
02:00:01,839 --> 02:00:04,069
It means "You've been like my sons".

848
02:00:14,879 --> 02:00:16,870
You are my sons.

849
02:00:18,079 --> 02:00:20,070
My dear sons.

850
02:00:23,799 --> 02:00:25,790
You live inside me now.

851
02:00:29,639 --> 02:00:31,630
I'll carry you wherever I go.

852
02:00:46,999 --> 02:00:49,672
Can't nothing make you forget it.

853
02:00:53,239 --> 02:00:55,628
Each time you start from scratch.

854
02:01:01,199 --> 02:01:03,713
War don't ennoble men.

855
02:01:04,719 --> 02:01:06,914
It turns 'em into dogs.

856
02:01:12,479 --> 02:01:14,470
Poisons the soul.

857
02:02:15,839 --> 02:02:17,830
My dear wife,

858
02:02:20,479 --> 02:02:26,793
you get something twisted out of your
insides by all this blood, fiilth, and noise.

859
02:02:35,879 --> 02:02:38,393
I wanna stay changeless for you.

860
02:02:40,879 --> 02:02:43,757
I wanna come back to you
the man I was before.

861
02:02:51,439 --> 02:02:54,033
How do we get to those other shores?

862
02:02:57,719 --> 02:02:59,710
To those blue hills.

863
02:03:09,519 --> 02:03:11,111
Love.

864
02:03:20,279 --> 02:03:22,270
Where does it come from?

865
02:03:30,359 --> 02:03:32,350
Who lit this flame in us?

866
02:03:39,119 --> 02:03:41,110
No war can put it out,

867
02:03:42,559 --> 02:03:44,550
conquer it.

868
02:03:52,079 --> 02:03:54,070
I was a prisoner.

869
02:03:58,359 --> 02:04:00,350
You set me free.

870
02:04:04,319 --> 02:04:06,753
No matter how much training you got,

871
02:04:07,839 --> 02:04:09,830
how careful you are,

872
02:04:11,159 --> 02:04:14,469
it's a matter of luck
whether or not you get killed.

873
02:04:14,559 --> 02:04:19,587
Makes no difference who you are,
or how tough a guy you might be,

874
02:04:21,559 --> 02:04:25,791
if you're in the wrong spot
at the wrong time, you're gonna get it.

875
02:04:36,079 --> 02:04:38,434
I look at that boy dying,

876
02:04:39,879 --> 02:04:41,870
I don't feel nothing.

877
02:04:44,999 --> 02:04:47,559
I don't care about nothing any more.

878
02:04:52,039 --> 02:04:54,030
Sounds like bliss.

879
02:04:58,319 --> 02:05:00,310
I don't have that feeling yet.

880
02:05:01,679 --> 02:05:03,670
That numbness.

881
02:05:04,679 --> 02:05:06,670
Not like the rest of you guys.

882
02:05:10,839 --> 02:05:13,034
Maybe cos I knew what to expect.

883
02:05:16,119 --> 02:05:18,269
Maybe I was just frozen up already.

884
02:06:00,279 --> 02:06:03,635
I haven't touched another woman
since I was called up.

885
02:06:04,679 --> 02:06:06,670
Or talked to one.

886
02:06:10,519 --> 02:06:12,510
I don't wanna...

887
02:06:13,199 --> 02:06:15,633
I don't wanna feel the desire.

888
02:06:51,199 --> 02:06:52,791
All right. Abrahams!

889
02:06:52,879 --> 02:06:54,471
Abrahams. Here you go.

890
02:06:54,559 --> 02:06:56,356
Stack! Where's Stack?

891
02:06:56,439 --> 02:06:58,395
Bring him out.

892
02:06:58,479 --> 02:07:00,470
Bell?

893
02:07:00,559 --> 02:07:02,356
Bell!

894
02:07:03,359 --> 02:07:05,748
Another one for Bell. Another one for Bell.

895
02:07:08,399 --> 02:07:10,390
Dear Jack,

896
02:07:12,119 --> 02:07:17,068
I've met an Air Force captain.
I've fallen in love with him.

897
02:07:19,679 --> 02:07:21,874
I want a divorce to marry him.

898
02:07:27,959 --> 02:07:31,395
I know you can say no,
but I'm asking you anyway,

899
02:07:31,479 --> 02:07:34,152
out of the memory of what we had together.

900
02:07:40,639 --> 02:07:42,630
Forgive me.

901
02:07:43,559 --> 02:07:46,027
It just got too lonely, Jack.

902
02:08:05,519 --> 02:08:07,510
We'll meet again some day.

903
02:08:11,159 --> 02:08:14,947
People who have been as close as we've been
always meet again.

904
02:08:23,079 --> 02:08:25,798
I have no right to speak to you this way.

905
02:08:25,879 --> 02:08:28,074
I can't stop myself.

906
02:08:28,559 --> 02:08:30,550
A habit so strong.

907
02:08:32,639 --> 02:08:35,153
Oh, my friend of all those shining years.

908
02:08:39,119 --> 02:08:41,110
Help me leave you!

909
02:10:04,799 --> 02:10:06,790
What's your name?

910
02:11:15,879 --> 02:11:17,870
We were a family.

911
02:11:20,999 --> 02:11:23,467
How'd it break up and come apart?

912
02:11:26,599 --> 02:11:29,955
So that now we're turned against each other.

913
02:11:31,759 --> 02:11:34,227
Each standing in the other's light.

914
02:11:43,079 --> 02:11:45,593
How did we lose the good that was given us?

915
02:11:47,319 --> 02:11:49,310
Let it slip away?

916
02:11:51,999 --> 02:11:53,990
Scatter it careless?

917
02:12:13,839 --> 02:12:16,148
What's keeping us from reaching out?

918
02:12:16,759 --> 02:12:18,750
Touching the glory?

919
02:12:20,719 --> 02:12:24,314
I'd have had you, Witt, if you was a Jap,

920
02:12:24,399 --> 02:12:26,390
long ago.

921
02:12:27,919 --> 02:12:29,910
They leave you here?

922
02:12:31,399 --> 02:12:32,798
Yup.

923
02:12:32,879 --> 02:12:34,870
I slowed 'em up.

924
02:12:35,519 --> 02:12:37,350
Don't mind, really.

925
02:12:38,319 --> 02:12:40,992
The medic fixed me up pretty good.

926
02:12:41,119 --> 02:12:43,110
I got plenty of ammo.

927
02:12:45,679 --> 02:12:48,193
Somebody'll be along for me eventually.

928
02:12:53,079 --> 02:12:55,274
- They got you good.
- Right in the knee.

929
02:12:55,359 --> 02:12:56,997
Yeah.

930
02:12:57,079 --> 02:12:59,547
I'm out of this war for good, Witt.

931
02:13:04,639 --> 02:13:08,075
- What you doin' down here?
- Just, you know,

932
02:13:08,159 --> 02:13:10,354
I'm heading back to the company.

933
02:13:10,999 --> 02:13:12,591
Yeah.

934
02:13:13,399 --> 02:13:15,594
Well, you give all them boys my best.

935
02:13:15,679 --> 02:13:18,034
You can come with me if you want.

936
02:13:18,119 --> 02:13:20,155
I'll help you along.

937
02:13:21,719 --> 02:13:24,187
No, it's nice and quiet.

938
02:13:24,279 --> 02:13:26,270
Peaceful up here.

939
02:13:28,559 --> 02:13:31,596
I'd just slow you up.
There'll be somebody along.

940
02:13:35,319 --> 02:13:37,310
I'll remind 'em.

941
02:13:37,759 --> 02:13:39,750
OK.

942
02:15:11,079 --> 02:15:13,070
Hey, Witt.

943
02:15:17,439 --> 02:15:19,509
Who you making trouble for today?

944
02:15:20,519 --> 02:15:22,510
What dyou mean?

945
02:15:23,239 --> 02:15:26,276
Well, isn't that what you like to do?

946
02:15:26,359 --> 02:15:28,919
Turn left when they say go right?

947
02:15:35,439 --> 02:15:37,828
Why are you such a troublemaker, Witt?

948
02:15:40,159 --> 02:15:42,593
You care about me, don't you, Sergeant?

949
02:15:43,919 --> 02:15:45,910
I always felt like you did.

950
02:15:47,679 --> 02:15:50,273
Why do you always
make yourself out like a rock?

951
02:15:51,519 --> 02:15:53,794
One day I can come up and talk to you,

952
02:15:54,799 --> 02:15:58,508
by the next day it's like we never even met.

953
02:16:12,279 --> 02:16:14,270
Lonely house now.

954
02:16:16,839 --> 02:16:18,830
You ever get lonely?

955
02:16:18,919 --> 02:16:20,910
Only around people.

956
02:16:22,759 --> 02:16:24,750
Only around people.

957
02:16:29,199 --> 02:16:32,475
You still believing in the beautiful light,
are you?

958
02:16:39,759 --> 02:16:41,750
How do you do that?

959
02:16:43,359 --> 02:16:45,350
You're a magician to me.

960
02:16:54,039 --> 02:16:56,030
I still see a spark in you.

961
02:17:20,279 --> 02:17:25,592
One man looks at a dying bird and
thinks there's nothing but unanswered pain.

962
02:17:28,199 --> 02:17:30,190
But death's got the fiinal word.

963
02:17:33,159 --> 02:17:35,150
It's laughing at him.

964
02:17:44,079 --> 02:17:46,468
Another man sees that same bird,

965
02:17:49,279 --> 02:17:51,270
feels the glory.

966
02:17:56,119 --> 02:17:58,508
Feels something smiling through him.

967
02:18:53,479 --> 02:18:55,834
We need to get out of here right now.

968
02:18:55,919 --> 02:19:00,310
- You explain to... headquarters the situation?
- No.

969
02:19:00,399 --> 02:19:04,312
Do they know where we are?
Cos we're sitting ducks out here.

970
02:19:05,439 --> 02:19:08,829
Well, I think that's...
up to me to judge, Sergeant.

971
02:19:10,399 --> 02:19:15,757
I think we just need to send somebody
up there and find out how close they are. OK?

972
02:19:15,839 --> 02:19:17,636
It's easy.

973
02:19:17,719 --> 02:19:20,950
Hey, Weld...
get headquarters on that thing.

974
02:19:21,039 --> 02:19:22,870
The fire's coming closer, sir.

975
02:19:22,959 --> 02:19:23,948
Line's cut!

976
02:19:26,839 --> 02:19:30,832
We need to send somebody out there
to find out where that line is being cut.

977
02:19:30,919 --> 02:19:33,433
And we need to find out how close they are.

978
02:19:33,519 --> 02:19:34,998
Come on.

979
02:19:35,079 --> 02:19:37,513
OK. OK.

980
02:19:41,479 --> 02:19:43,470
Hey, you.

981
02:19:44,079 --> 02:19:45,273
You go.

982
02:19:46,239 --> 02:19:47,831
You're going, Fife.

983
02:19:53,239 --> 02:19:56,117
Coombs. You go, too.

984
02:19:56,199 --> 02:19:57,791
Come on!

985
02:19:57,879 --> 02:20:02,236
I'll go. I want you to know
I think the whole thing's a bad idea, though.

986
02:20:02,319 --> 02:20:07,154
If they come down here in any strength,
Lieutenant, they'll knock our position to hell.

987
02:20:07,239 --> 02:20:09,594
You don't have to go. Others'll volunteer.

988
02:20:09,679 --> 02:20:14,594
No, I wanna go, sir. In case
something bad happens, I wanna be there.

989
02:20:14,679 --> 02:20:17,068
All right. You stay by the river.

990
02:20:17,159 --> 02:20:19,957
That jungle's too thick. And be very careful.

991
02:20:20,039 --> 02:20:22,030
I will.

992
02:20:22,119 --> 02:20:23,996
Good luck, Witt.

993
02:20:24,079 --> 02:20:26,115
You OK, Fife?

994
02:21:49,679 --> 02:21:52,193
A reinforce battalion.

995
02:21:53,719 --> 02:21:55,311
We need to go back.

996
02:21:55,399 --> 02:21:57,196
Tell the lieutenant.

997
02:22:00,839 --> 02:22:02,636
Let's go.

998
02:22:19,199 --> 02:22:21,190
I'm hit!

999
02:23:17,719 --> 02:23:20,392
One of us needs to stay here and hold 'em off.

1000
02:23:27,239 --> 02:23:29,230
We'll be all right.

1001
02:23:34,039 --> 02:23:36,917
My friend here doesn't have long,

1002
02:23:36,999 --> 02:23:39,797
so... you go.

1003
02:23:40,959 --> 02:23:42,358
You go on ahead.

1004
02:24:04,639 --> 02:24:06,630
Witt!

1005
02:24:50,559 --> 02:24:52,550
They're coming.

1006
02:24:53,959 --> 02:24:57,156
I gotta go. I don't want you to be afraid.

1007
02:24:57,879 --> 02:25:01,872
Just hide out here till you hear firing,
then push on down the river.

1008
02:25:01,959 --> 02:25:03,358
No.

1009
02:25:41,959 --> 02:25:45,474
- Where's Coombs?
- Get back. Get back, they're coming.

1010
02:25:46,399 --> 02:25:48,390
Fall back.

1011
02:25:49,839 --> 02:25:52,273
Where's Witt? Fife, where's Witt?

1012
02:25:58,239 --> 02:26:00,230
Fife, where's Witt?

1013
02:26:03,799 --> 02:26:06,677
Fife. Fife, where's Witt?

1014
02:27:45,759 --> 02:27:47,556
America.

1015
02:30:29,839 --> 02:30:31,830
Where's your spark now?

1016
02:30:53,639 --> 02:30:57,552
Now, I know you men have been
making and drinking this goddamn swipe.

1017
02:30:57,639 --> 02:30:58,833
That's OK by me.

1018
02:30:58,919 --> 02:31:00,557
Everything a lie.

1019
02:31:00,639 --> 02:31:04,154
Any man in my outfit
can get as drunk as he wants to every night.

1020
02:31:04,239 --> 02:31:06,275
Everything you hear and see.

1021
02:31:06,359 --> 02:31:10,352
As long as he's in shape to make reveille
and carry out any assignment given.

1022
02:31:10,439 --> 02:31:14,148
If he can't do that,
he's gonna have trouble from me.

1023
02:31:14,239 --> 02:31:17,914
- So much to spew out.
- I prefer to think of myself as a family man,

1024
02:31:17,999 --> 02:31:21,071
and that's what we all are here,
whether we like it or not.

1025
02:31:21,159 --> 02:31:23,150
We are a family.

1026
02:31:24,199 --> 02:31:26,269
I'm the father.

1027
02:31:26,919 --> 02:31:29,877
Guess that makes
Sergeant Welsh here the mother.

1028
02:31:29,959 --> 02:31:32,553
They just keep coming, one after another.

1029
02:31:32,639 --> 02:31:35,790
That makes you all the children in this family.

1030
02:31:35,879 --> 02:31:39,269
Now, a family can have only one head,
and that is the father.

1031
02:31:39,359 --> 02:31:43,830
Father's the head, mother runs it.
That's the way it's gonna work here.

1032
02:31:43,919 --> 02:31:47,468
- If any of you wanna see me about anything,
- You're in a box.

1033
02:31:47,559 --> 02:31:49,595
- Anything at all,
- A moving box.

1034
02:31:49,679 --> 02:31:51,670
You will find that I am available.

1035
02:31:51,759 --> 02:31:54,592
This war is not gonna be over
by next Christmas.

1036
02:31:54,679 --> 02:31:57,512
It's gonna be a long time
before we get home...

1037
02:31:57,599 --> 02:31:59,590
They want you dead.

1038
02:32:01,879 --> 02:32:03,870
Or in their lie.

1039
02:32:08,879 --> 02:32:10,870
Only one thing a man can do.

1040
02:32:13,759 --> 02:32:15,750
Find something that's his.

1041
02:32:18,879 --> 02:32:20,870
Make an island for himself.

1042
02:32:33,799 --> 02:32:36,188
If I never meet you in this life,

1043
02:32:37,559 --> 02:32:39,550
let me feel the lack.

1044
02:32:47,759 --> 02:32:51,991
A glance from your eyes,
and my life will be yours.

1045
02:33:39,119 --> 02:33:42,998
Somethin' I can come back to.
Some kind of foundation.

1046
02:33:43,159 --> 02:33:47,550
I mean, I don't know what, you know,
what your plans are, but...

1047
02:33:47,639 --> 02:33:51,427
I'm determined now.
I've been through the thick and thin of it.

1048
02:33:51,519 --> 02:33:54,716
You know, I may be young,
but I've lived plenty of life.

1049
02:33:55,399 --> 02:33:57,549
I'm ready to start living it good.

1050
02:33:57,639 --> 02:34:02,394
You know, my daddy always told me it's
gonna get a lot worse before it gets better.

1051
02:34:02,479 --> 02:34:06,836
You know, cos life ain't supposed to be
that hard when you're young.

1052
02:34:06,919 --> 02:34:10,434
Well, I figure after this
the worst is gonna be gone.

1053
02:34:11,119 --> 02:34:14,555
It's time for things to get better.
That's what I want.

1054
02:34:15,519 --> 02:34:17,510
That's what's gonna happen.

1055
02:34:18,599 --> 02:34:20,590
I'm getting older now.

1056
02:34:21,399 --> 02:34:23,788
By no means old, but older.

1057
02:34:24,559 --> 02:34:27,596
Where is it that we were together?

1058
02:34:30,639 --> 02:34:32,834
Who were you that I lived with?

1059
02:34:37,359 --> 02:34:39,350
Walked with?

1060
02:34:46,199 --> 02:34:48,190
The brother.

1061
02:34:54,439 --> 02:34:56,430
The friend.

1062
02:35:21,679 --> 02:35:23,670
Darkness from light.

1063
02:35:25,119 --> 02:35:27,110
Strife from love.

1064
02:35:28,239 --> 02:35:31,231
Are they the workings of one mind?

1065
02:35:32,559 --> 02:35:35,198
The features of the same face?

1066
02:35:49,479 --> 02:35:51,470
Oh, my soul,

1067
02:35:53,039 --> 02:35:55,030
let me be in you now.

1068
02:36:00,839 --> 02:36:03,034
Look out through my eyes.

1069
02:36:04,279 --> 02:36:06,668
Look out at the things you made.

1070
02:36:11,399 --> 02:36:13,594
All things shining.
