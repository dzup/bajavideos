Directed by Akira Kurosawa

12
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:52,422
I don't understand...
I just don't understand.

13
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:40,095
<i>I don't understand it at all.</i>

14
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:44,558
I just don't understand.

15
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,331
What's wrong?

16
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,294
What don't you understand?

17
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,926
I've never heard
such a strange story.

18
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,303
Why don't you tell me about it?

19
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:27,351
We happen to have
a wise priest in our midst.

20
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:34,858
No, not even the renowned,
wise priest from Kiyomizu Temple

21
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:39,446
has heard a story
as strange as this.

22
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:43,909
So you know something
about this strange story?

23
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:49,581
This man and I have just seen it
and heard it ourselves.

24
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:54,002
- Where?
- In the courthouse garden.

25
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:55,712
The courthouse?

26
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:59,758
A man was murdered.

27
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:03,095
Just one? So what?

28
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:11,895
On top of this gate, you'll find
at least five or six unclaimed bodies.

29
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,982
You're right.

30
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:20,028
War, earthquake, winds,

31
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:25,158
fire, famine, the plague...

32
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,495
Year after year,
it's been nothing but disasters.

33
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:38,338
And bandits descend upon us
every night.

34
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:47,347
I've seen so many men
getting killed like insects,

35
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:55,397
but even I have never heard
a story as horrible as this.

36
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:05,073
Yes. So horrible.

37
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:14,917
This time, I may finally lose
my faith in the human soul.

38
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:20,464
It's worse than bandits,
the plague,

39
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:27,304
famine, fire, or war.

40
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:30,807
Look here, priest.

41
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:33,560
Enough with the sermon.

42
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,606
It sounded interesting,
at least while I kept out of the rain.

43
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:42,277
But if it's a sermon,
I'd sooner listen to the rain.

44
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:19,481
Hear me out. Maybe you can
tell me what it means.

45
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:23,819
I don't understand
any of those three.

46
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:26,780
- Which three?
- Well...

47
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:30,117
I'll tell you about them.

48
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,578
Calm down and tell me slowly.

49
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:37,374
The rain's not going to stop
any time soon.

50
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,961
RASHOMON

51
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,563
It was three days ago.

52
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:04,109
I went into the mountains
to get wood.

53
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:48,500
<i>I ran as fast as I could</i>
<i>to tell the police.</i>

54
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:53,839
<i>Then, three days later-- today--</i>
<i>I was called to testify.</i>

55
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,136
Yes. That's right.

56
00:12:03,182 --> 00:12:08,812
I was the one
who first found the body.

57
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:12,274
What? Did I see a sword
or something?

58
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:15,152
No, nothing at all.

59
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:20,199
Just a woman's hat
caught on a branch,

60
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:25,078
and the cap of a samurai
that had been trampled on.

61
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:29,458
There was a cut-up piece of rope
near the body,

62
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:38,467
and further along in the leaves,
a shiny amulet case with red lining.

63
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,260
Yes.

64
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:47,226
That was all I found, yes.

65
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:50,521
Yes.

66
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:57,027
I met the murdered man
before his death.

67
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:03,534
It was three days ago,
in the afternoon.

68
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:05,577
On the road

69
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:09,998
from Sekiyama to Yamashina.

70
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:34,523
<i>The woman had a veil,</i>
<i>so I couldn't see her face.</i>

71
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:42,447


72
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:53,417
Little did I expect
that he would meet such a fate.

73
00:13:55,836 --> 00:14:02,509
A human life is truly as frail
and fleeting as the morning dew.

74
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:09,183
What a shame
that his should end this way.

75
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,102
I'm sorry.

76
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:20,277
This man I caught is Tajomaru.

77
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:26,533
Yes, the notorious bandit
everyone speaks of.

78
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:33,916
The last time I almost caught him,
he looked the same

79
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:36,460
and he carried that same sword.

80
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:43,133
It was two days ago at dusk,
by the banks of the Katsura...

81
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:03,987
What's wrong?

82
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:19,127
<i>There were 17 arrows</i>
<i>with eagle feathers,</i>

83
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:23,757
<i>a leather bow, and a horse.</i>

84
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:28,554
All these belonged
to the dead man, yes.

85
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:36,019
The irony of Tajomaru being
thrown off his stolen horse,

86
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:38,772
this had to be fateful retribution.

87
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:51,910
I fell off the horse?
You fool!

88
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:57,541
On that day...

89
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:09,094
I was riding that horse
and I was suddenly very thirsty.

90
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:12,681
So around Osaka,
I drank from a spring.

91
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:28,614
There must have been
a dead poisonous snake upstream.

92
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:32,409
After a while, I got
an incredible stomachache.

93
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:37,831
By the time I came to the river,
I couldn't hold it any longer.

94
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:42,794
So I got off the horse
and crouched in the field.

95
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:50,344
I fell off?

96
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,597
Obviously, a fool can think only
foolish thoughts.

97
00:16:57,017 --> 00:17:00,270
I know sooner or later
you'll have my neck,

98
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:03,398
so I'm not going to hide anything.

99
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:09,321
It was this Tajomaru
who killed that man.

100
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:15,953
I saw that couple three days ago.
It was a hot afternoon.

101
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:20,499
Suddenly a cool breeze
rustled the leaves.

102
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:26,630
If it hadn't been for that wind,
I wouldn't have killed him.

103
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:04,955
I caught a glimpse
and then she was gone.

104
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:07,958
Maybe that's why.

105
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,712
I thought I saw a goddess.

106
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:15,591
At that moment I decided to capture her,
even if I had to kill her man.

107
00:20:19,178 --> 00:20:24,308
But if I could have her
without killing, all the better.

108
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:29,938
My intention then was to take her
without killing the man.

109
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:35,777
But I couldn't do it
on that road to Yamashina.

110
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:54,296
What do you want?

111
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:09,061
What do you want?

112
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:21,323
What is it?

113
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,762
Don't be suspicious.

114
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:49,393
See? Isn't this nice?

115
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:54,356
Take a good look at it.

116
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:05,158
There are some ruins over there.

117
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:11,665
When I dug up the mound, I found
a heap of swords and mirrors.

118
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:16,587
I buried them in a grove behind the mountain
so no one else would find them.

119
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:21,508
If you're interested,
I'll sell them to you cheap.

120
00:23:57,271 --> 00:23:58,981
It's over there.

121
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:02,943
Walk ahead of me.

122
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:50,449
It's here. Beyond those pines.

123
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:49,359
Your husband
has taken sick.

124
00:26:57,117 --> 00:27:04,041
Her face turned pale.
She stared at me with frozen eyes,

125
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:08,086
her expression intense like a child's.

126
00:27:09,505 --> 00:27:13,926
When I saw that, I envied the man
and I suddenly hated him.

127
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:18,931
I wanted to show her how pathetic
he looked tied to that pine tree.

128
00:27:19,473 --> 00:27:23,810
These thoughts that weren't there
before filled my head.

129
00:28:59,198 --> 00:29:01,241
<i>I had never seen</i>
<i>such fierceness in a woman.</i>

130
00:31:24,468 --> 00:31:28,847
And so I had succeeded in having her
without killing her husband.

131
00:31:33,602 --> 00:31:38,273
I still had no intention
of killing him.

132
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,693
But then...

133
00:31:43,612 --> 00:31:45,280
Wait!

134
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,325
Stop!

135
00:31:49,326 --> 00:31:53,789
Either you die or my husband dies.

136
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,834
One of you must die.

137
00:32:07,594 --> 00:32:12,808
To have my shame known to two men
is worse than dying.

138
00:32:16,144 --> 00:32:24,486
I will go with the survivor.

139
00:35:19,828 --> 00:35:22,789
So I had to kill him,
but I wanted to do it honorably.

140
00:35:23,332 --> 00:35:27,711
He fought very well.
We crossed swords 23 times.

141
00:35:29,046 --> 00:35:33,634
I remember this
because I'm still impressed.

142
00:35:34,468 --> 00:35:37,888
No one had ever crossed swords
with me more than 20 times.

143
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:45,395
What? The woman?

144
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:49,441
I don't know.

145
00:35:49,942 --> 00:35:55,739
When the man died,
I turned to her. She was gone.

146
00:35:57,324 --> 00:36:01,703
The fighting must have scared her
and she ran away.

147
00:36:02,788 --> 00:36:05,332
I ran out to the mountain road.

148
00:36:05,707 --> 00:36:08,585
All I found was her horse
grazing calmly.

149
00:36:10,128 --> 00:36:13,966
I was attracted to her fierce spirit,

150
00:36:14,424 --> 00:36:17,928
but, after all, she was just
like other women.

151
00:36:18,554 --> 00:36:20,472
I didn't even look for her.

152
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:26,520
What? His sword?

153
00:36:28,355 --> 00:36:30,941
I exchanged it in town for liquor.

154
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:35,487
What? Her dagger?

155
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:44,371
It had pearl inlay.
Looked very valuable.

156
00:36:45,205 --> 00:36:50,586
I totally forgot about it.
That was foolish.

157
00:36:51,086 --> 00:36:53,130
The biggest mistake I ever made!

158
00:37:15,569 --> 00:37:21,074
Even amongst the bandits,
Tajomaru is famous for being a womanizer.

159
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:28,081
Why, last fall, a young wife went
to the temple and she and her maid

160
00:37:28,248 --> 00:37:33,921
were found dead in the mountains.
That must have been him too.

161
00:37:41,094 --> 00:37:45,390
Who knows what really happened
to that woman who left her horse?

162
00:37:47,226 --> 00:37:48,894
Well,

163
00:37:51,647 --> 00:37:54,942
that woman showed up
at the courthouse.

164
00:37:58,403 --> 00:38:04,201
She was hiding in the temple
when the police found her.

165
00:38:04,576 --> 00:38:06,078
It's a lie.

166
00:38:06,995 --> 00:38:11,041
It's all a lie.
Tajomaru's story and the woman's.

167
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,336
It's human to lie.

168
00:38:18,549 --> 00:38:21,802
Most of the time we can't even
be honest with ourselves.

169
00:38:22,135 --> 00:38:23,929
That may be.

170
00:38:29,768 --> 00:38:38,360
But it's because men are weak
that they lie, even to themselves.

171
00:38:38,569 --> 00:38:40,487
Not another sermon.

172
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:46,034
I don't care if it's a lie,
as long as it's entertaining.

173
00:38:48,996 --> 00:38:51,248
What story did the woman
come up with?

174
00:38:52,499 --> 00:38:57,421
Well, it's completely different
from Tajomaru's story.

175
00:38:59,715 --> 00:39:07,139
So different that her face didn't even
show the fierceness he spoke of.

176
00:39:14,605 --> 00:39:17,649
She was so docile,
she was almost pitiful.

177
00:39:46,637 --> 00:39:48,680
That man in the blue kimono,

178
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,937
after forcing me to yield to him,

179
00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:01,818
proudly announced that
he was the infamous Tajomaru,

180
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:09,368
and laughed mockingly at my husband
who was tied up.

181
00:40:20,462 --> 00:40:28,178
How horrified my husband
must have been.

182
00:40:31,723 --> 00:40:34,852
The more he struggled,

183
00:40:37,646 --> 00:40:44,903
the tighter the ropes dug in.

184
00:40:47,614 --> 00:40:54,580
I ran to his side. Or rather, I tried to.

185
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:48,944
Even now, when I think of his eyes,

186
00:42:50,445 --> 00:42:54,366
my blood turns cold in my veins.

187
00:42:58,203 --> 00:43:02,666
What I saw in them was neither anger,

188
00:43:04,001 --> 00:43:05,502
nor sorrow,

189
00:43:07,087 --> 00:43:16,013
but a cold light, a look of loathing.

190
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,189
Don't.

191
00:43:26,064 --> 00:43:28,192
Don't look at me like that.

192
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,740
It's too cruel.

193
00:43:36,366 --> 00:43:38,452
Beat me,

194
00:43:39,453 --> 00:43:46,210
kill me, but don't look at me like that.
Please, stop.

195
00:45:10,878 --> 00:45:13,005
Now kill me.

196
00:45:14,089 --> 00:45:16,508
Kill me at once.

197
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:52,044
Stop.

198
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:55,214
Don't.

199
00:46:00,802 --> 00:46:02,304
Please don't.

200
00:46:46,348 --> 00:46:52,187
I must have fainted after that.

201
00:47:01,572 --> 00:47:04,324
When I came to
and looked around...

202
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:15,502
Imagine my shock.

203
00:47:32,227 --> 00:47:40,569
I saw my dagger
in my dead husband's chest.

204
00:47:55,209 --> 00:47:58,670
I was in shock

205
00:48:01,673 --> 00:48:04,635
and I don't remember
how I left the woods.

206
00:48:10,724 --> 00:48:13,101
But when I came to,

207
00:48:16,897 --> 00:48:18,941
I was standing by the pond,

208
00:48:20,567 --> 00:48:22,402
at the foot of the hill.

209
00:48:29,743 --> 00:48:31,912
I threw myself into the pond.

210
00:48:34,122 --> 00:48:38,085
I tried many different things.

211
00:48:39,962 --> 00:48:44,299
But I failed to kill myself.

212
00:48:56,687 --> 00:49:08,156
What should a poor,
helpless woman like me do?

213
00:49:43,692 --> 00:49:47,154
I see. The more I hear,
the more confused I get.

214
00:49:49,865 --> 00:49:53,285
But women use their tears
to fool everyone.

215
00:49:53,619 --> 00:49:55,746
They even fool themselves.

216
00:49:56,997 --> 00:50:00,584
So you have to beware
of the woman's story.

217
00:50:02,628 --> 00:50:05,214
When you hear
the dead man's story--

218
00:50:05,797 --> 00:50:11,178
He's dead.
How can he tell his story?

219
00:50:11,803 --> 00:50:13,931
He spoke through a medium.

220
00:50:15,766 --> 00:50:19,728
Lies. His story was also lies.

221
00:50:22,314 --> 00:50:26,610
But dead men don't lie.

222
00:50:27,569 --> 00:50:29,446
Why is that?

223
00:50:31,198 --> 00:50:34,284
I refuse to believe
that man would be so sinful.

224
00:50:35,911 --> 00:50:37,496
Suit yourself.

225
00:50:38,372 --> 00:50:40,374
But is there anyone who's
really good?

226
00:50:41,291 --> 00:50:44,253
Maybe goodness is just make-believe.

227
00:50:44,294 --> 00:50:46,129
What a frightening--

228
00:50:47,089 --> 00:50:49,716
Man just wants to forget
the bad stuff

229
00:50:50,509 --> 00:50:52,719
and believe in the made-up
good stuff.

230
00:50:52,761 --> 00:50:55,764
- It's easier that way.
- Ridiculous.

231
00:50:59,393 --> 00:51:00,894
Nevermind.

232
00:51:01,144 --> 00:51:03,814
Let's hear the dead man's story.

233
00:51:51,653 --> 00:51:54,990
I am in darkness now.

234
00:51:55,073 --> 00:51:59,536
I am suffering in the dark.

235
00:52:00,412 --> 00:52:05,250
Cursed be those who cast me
into this dark hell.

236
00:52:43,372 --> 00:52:50,337
After the bandit attacked my wife,
he tried to console her.

237
00:52:51,964 --> 00:52:57,344
<i>She sat on the leaves,</i>
<i>staring down at her knees.</i>

238
00:52:58,554 --> 00:53:01,515
<i>The bandit was cunning.</i>

239
00:53:02,391 --> 00:53:04,685
<i>Now that her virtue was stained,</i>

240
00:53:04,893 --> 00:53:06,937
<i>she could no longer be</i>
<i>with her husband.</i>

241
00:53:07,104 --> 00:53:11,108
<i>Leave the husband</i>
<i>and why not marry him instead?</i>

242
00:53:11,441 --> 00:53:15,237
<i>He said he only attacked her</i>
<i>out of his love for her.</i>

243
00:53:16,989 --> 00:53:21,577
<i>When she heard that, my wife</i>
<i>raised her face as if in a trance.</i>

244
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:33,839
She had never looked so beautiful.

245
00:53:40,596 --> 00:53:47,311
<i>And what was my beautiful wife's</i>
<i>response to the bandit</i>

246
00:53:48,687 --> 00:53:50,647
<i>in front of her helpless husband?</i>

247
00:53:54,109 --> 00:53:55,777
Wherever.

248
00:53:58,447 --> 00:54:00,991
Take me wherever you want.

249
00:54:03,035 --> 00:54:05,204
That's what she said.

250
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:11,168
But that wasn't her only sin

251
00:54:12,002 --> 00:54:16,173
or I wouldn't be suffering
in the dark like this.

252
00:54:31,313 --> 00:54:32,898
Please kill him.

253
00:54:33,607 --> 00:54:36,318
While he's alive,
I cannot go with you.

254
00:54:37,361 --> 00:54:38,987
Kill him!

255
00:54:40,656 --> 00:54:44,785
Those words were like a wind that

256
00:54:45,202 --> 00:54:48,497
threatened to blow me
into the depths of darkness.

257
00:54:53,752 --> 00:55:01,510
Has such a hateful thing
ever been uttered by a human before?

258
00:55:01,885 --> 00:55:05,848
Even the bandit turned pale
at those words.

259
00:55:07,391 --> 00:55:12,020
Please kill him.

260
00:55:47,431 --> 00:55:50,559
What do you want me
to do with her?

261
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:56,982
Kill her or save her?
You only have to nod.

262
00:56:01,069 --> 00:56:07,242
<i>For these words alone,</i>
<i>I was ready to pardon his crime.</i>

263
00:56:10,412 --> 00:56:15,959
Kill her or let her go?

264
00:56:44,613 --> 00:56:47,449
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>how many hours passed.</i>

265
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:34,162
She got away. Now I'll have
to worry about my own fate.

266
00:58:00,522 --> 00:58:02,357
<i>Everything was silent.</i>

267
00:58:04,276 --> 00:58:07,779
<i>I heard someone crying.</i>

268
00:58:08,739 --> 00:58:11,450
<i>Someone is crying.</i>

269
00:58:12,284 --> 00:58:14,244
<i>Who is that?</i>

270
01:00:40,057 --> 01:00:41,767
Everything was silent.

271
01:00:43,936 --> 01:00:45,979
How quiet it was.

272
01:00:48,106 --> 01:00:50,234
Suddenly the sun went away.

273
01:00:52,861 --> 01:00:56,782
I was enveloped in deep silence.

274
01:00:59,618 --> 01:01:04,456
I lay there in the stillness.

275
01:01:07,376 --> 01:01:12,381
Then someone quietly approached me.

276
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:23,976
That someone gently withdrew
the dagger from my heart.

277
01:01:53,255 --> 01:01:54,882
It's not true!

278
01:01:54,965 --> 01:01:58,969
There was no dagger.
He was killed by a sword.

279
01:02:37,591 --> 01:02:39,718
Now it's getting interesting.

280
01:02:40,469 --> 01:02:45,015
It seems you saw the whole thing.

281
01:02:49,895 --> 01:02:52,231
So why didn't you tell the court?

282
01:02:53,857 --> 01:02:56,109
I didn't want to get involved.

283
01:02:56,527 --> 01:02:58,487
You can talk about it here, right?

284
01:02:59,947 --> 01:03:02,533
Tell me, then.

285
01:03:02,699 --> 01:03:04,868
Your story seems to be
the most interesting.

286
01:03:05,077 --> 01:03:09,122
I don't want to hear it.
No more horror stories.

287
01:03:10,457 --> 01:03:12,960
They are common stories
these days.

288
01:03:13,335 --> 01:03:16,463
I even heard that the demon living
here in Rashomon

289
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:19,132
fled in fear of the ferocity of man.

290
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:27,057
Come on.
How much do you know?

291
01:03:32,604 --> 01:03:35,983
I found the woman's hat
in the mountains.

292
01:03:36,316 --> 01:03:38,110
You already said that.

293
01:03:40,821 --> 01:03:45,450
About 20 yards further,
I heard a woman crying.

294
01:03:46,743 --> 01:03:50,998
From behind a bush,
I saw a man tied up,

295
01:03:51,373 --> 01:03:54,209
a woman crying and Tajomaru.

296
01:03:54,251 --> 01:03:55,919
So you lied

297
01:03:56,128 --> 01:04:00,507
when you said
you found the body.

298
01:04:00,632 --> 01:04:02,593
I didn't want to get involved.

299
01:04:02,676 --> 01:04:04,303
All right, then.

300
01:04:05,888 --> 01:04:10,392
Go on.
What was Tajomaru doing?

301
01:04:14,521 --> 01:04:19,318
He was down on his knees,
begging the woman for forgiveness.

302
01:04:22,279 --> 01:04:26,909
Until now, whenever I wanted
to do something bad, I did it.

303
01:04:27,242 --> 01:04:29,703
That way I suffered less.

304
01:04:31,163 --> 01:04:33,707
But today, it's different.

305
01:04:33,916 --> 01:04:39,296
I already had you, but I only
want you more. It's very hard.

306
01:04:40,214 --> 01:04:42,633
I beg you to be my wife.

307
01:04:47,095 --> 01:04:54,102
The notorious bandit Tajomaru
is begging you on his hands and knees.

308
01:04:58,607 --> 01:05:01,860
If you wish, I'll even stop
being a bandit.

309
01:05:02,736 --> 01:05:05,572
I have enough stashed away
to give you a lavish life.

310
01:05:06,949 --> 01:05:10,994
And if you don't want my dirty money,
I'll even work.

311
01:05:11,537 --> 01:05:17,835
I'll stoop to selling odds and ends
on the street to support you.

312
01:05:18,502 --> 01:05:21,880
I'll do anything
if you come with me.

313
01:05:21,922 --> 01:05:24,716
Marry me, please.

314
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:29,805
If you say no,
I have no choice but to kill you.

315
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:35,727
Please, say yes.

316
01:05:39,898 --> 01:05:42,526
Stop crying and answer me.

317
01:05:43,235 --> 01:05:44,862
Tell me you'll be my wife!

318
01:05:45,571 --> 01:05:48,282
Say it!

319
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,461
It's impossible.

320
01:06:03,422 --> 01:06:08,510
How could I, a woman,
say anything?

321
01:06:29,031 --> 01:06:32,326
I get it. You mean
it's up to us men to decide.

322
01:06:35,454 --> 01:06:36,663
Hold it!

323
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:42,211
I refuse to risk my life
for such a woman.

324
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:13,492
You've been with two men.
Why don't you kill yourself?

325
01:07:19,790 --> 01:07:21,208
Hopeless.

326
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:28,423
I don't want this shameless whore.
You can have her.

327
01:07:30,342 --> 01:07:35,013
At this stage, I'd rather lose her
instead of the horse.

328
01:08:30,736 --> 01:08:32,946
- Wait!
- Don't follow me!

329
01:08:46,710 --> 01:08:50,339
Stop crying.
It's not going to work anymore.

330
01:08:52,925 --> 01:08:56,428
Stop it. Don't bully her.

331
01:08:57,179 --> 01:08:59,556
Women are weak by nature.

332
01:09:26,834 --> 01:09:28,335
It's you who are weak.

333
01:09:31,588 --> 01:09:33,465
If you are my husband,

334
01:09:34,383 --> 01:09:37,094
why don't you kill this man?

335
01:09:38,053 --> 01:09:40,681
Then you can tell me to kill myself.
That's a real man.

336
01:09:42,933 --> 01:09:45,269
You're not a real man either.

337
01:09:53,861 --> 01:09:57,322
When I heard you were Tajomaru,
I stopped crying.

338
01:09:57,990 --> 01:10:00,325
I was sick of this tiresome daily farce.

339
01:10:01,994 --> 01:10:07,791
I thought, "Tajomaru might
get me out of this."

340
01:10:08,208 --> 01:10:13,672
If he'd only save me,
I'd do anything for him.

341
01:10:13,922 --> 01:10:15,799
I thought to myself.

342
01:10:20,512 --> 01:10:23,932
But you were just as petty
as my husband.

343
01:10:25,767 --> 01:10:30,689
Just remember: A woman loves a man
who loves passionately.

344
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:34,526
A man has to make a woman his
by his sword.

345
01:16:15,158 --> 01:16:17,452
I don't want to die!

346
01:19:04,786 --> 01:19:06,997
So that's the real story.

347
01:19:07,539 --> 01:19:10,209
I don't tell lies.
I saw it with my own eyes.

348
01:19:10,709 --> 01:19:12,211
I doubt it.

349
01:19:12,628 --> 01:19:15,088
It's true. I don't lie.

350
01:19:15,339 --> 01:19:17,382
No one lies after he says
he's going to do so.

351
01:19:17,549 --> 01:19:19,301
It's horrifying.

352
01:19:19,510 --> 01:19:22,262
If men don't trust each other,
this earth might as well be hell.

353
01:19:22,513 --> 01:19:24,139
That's right. This world is hell.

354
01:19:24,306 --> 01:19:25,974
No, I believe in men.

355
01:19:28,185 --> 01:19:30,312
I don't want this place to be hell.

356
01:19:31,230 --> 01:19:33,232
Shouting doesn't help.

357
01:19:33,815 --> 01:19:37,945
Think about it. Out of these three,
whose story is believable?

358
01:19:38,237 --> 01:19:39,613
No idea.

359
01:19:40,656 --> 01:19:42,032
No idea.

360
01:19:43,242 --> 01:19:47,246
In the end, you cannot understand
the things men do.

361
01:20:49,766 --> 01:20:51,310
What are you doing?

362
01:20:55,564 --> 01:20:56,940
What's it to you?

363
01:21:00,110 --> 01:21:02,529
- That's terrible!
- Terrible?

364
01:21:03,113 --> 01:21:07,618
Someone else would have taken
the kimono. Why shouldn't I?

365
01:21:09,328 --> 01:21:11,788
- It's evil.
- Evil?

366
01:21:12,497 --> 01:21:14,750
What about this kid's parents?

367
01:21:15,501 --> 01:21:21,215
They had their fun and then they
throw out the kid? They're evil.

368
01:21:21,965 --> 01:21:24,343
No, you're wrong.

369
01:21:25,511 --> 01:21:31,350
Look at the amulet on the kimono.
It was left to protect the baby.

370
01:21:32,267 --> 01:21:35,062
Think about what they went through
to abandon this baby.

371
01:21:35,562 --> 01:21:37,731
I don't have time to mind
everyone's feelings.

372
01:21:37,898 --> 01:21:40,317
- You selfish...
- What's wrong with that?

373
01:21:41,235 --> 01:21:43,695
Dogs are better off in this world.

374
01:21:44,488 --> 01:21:47,533
If you're not selfish,
you can't survive.

375
01:21:56,875 --> 01:21:59,002
Damn it.

376
01:21:59,837 --> 01:22:02,673
Everyone is selfish and dishonest.

377
01:22:03,465 --> 01:22:06,510
Making excuses.

378
01:22:07,678 --> 01:22:15,936
The bandit, the woman,
the man and you!

379
01:22:22,276 --> 01:22:25,904
And you aren't? That's funny.

380
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:31,076
You may have fooled the court,
but not me.

381
01:22:47,968 --> 01:22:50,429
So what did you do
with the dagger?

382
01:22:51,263 --> 01:22:54,558
The valuable one
with the pearl inlay

383
01:22:54,933 --> 01:22:56,852
that Tajomaru was talking about?

384
01:22:57,311 --> 01:23:00,022
What happened to it?
Did it disappear in the grass?

385
01:23:01,148 --> 01:23:04,610
If you didn't, who stole it?

386
01:23:08,614 --> 01:23:10,282
It seems I'm right.

387
01:23:13,744 --> 01:23:18,207
A bandit calling another a bandit.
Now that's selfish.

388
01:23:32,221 --> 01:23:35,057
Do you have anything else to say?

389
01:23:36,350 --> 01:23:38,060
If not, I'll be going.

390
01:24:55,929 --> 01:24:59,099
What are you doing?
Taking what little it has left?

391
01:25:09,651 --> 01:25:13,614
I have six kids of my own.

392
01:25:15,449 --> 01:25:22,497
Another one
wouldn't make a difference.

393
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:36,386
I am ashamed of what I said.

394
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:47,439
It's inevitable to be suspicious of others
on a day like this.

395
01:25:51,652 --> 01:25:53,654
I'm the one
who should be ashamed.

396
01:25:55,906 --> 01:26:00,369
I don't understand my own soul.

397
01:26:00,911 --> 01:26:03,956
No, I'm grateful to you.

398
01:26:17,010 --> 01:26:19,012
Thanks to you,

399
01:26:19,930 --> 01:26:26,687
I think I can keep
my faith in man.

400
01:26:27,855 --> 01:26:29,481
Don't mention it.

401
01:28:06,411 --> 01:28:10,999
THE END
