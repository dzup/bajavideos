THIS FILM IS BASED ON REAL
CHARACTERS AND EVENTS...

4
00:01:17,472 --> 00:01:20,805
A FEWCHANGES HAVE BEEN
INTRODUCED WHICH DO NOTALTER...

5
00:01:20,876 --> 00:01:26,110
THE SPIRIT OR THE AUTHENTICITY
OF THESE EVENTS.

LA PLATA, SEPTEMBER 1975

7
00:01:29,886 --> 00:01:32,184
Stop it!
Let him speak!

8
00:01:33,089 --> 00:01:35,489
- Chicken!
- Strike-breaker!

9
00:01:35,558 --> 00:01:37,185
Quiet, "compañeros"!

10
00:01:37,593 --> 00:01:39,220
No more delays!

11
00:01:42,632 --> 00:01:44,224
C'mon! Quiet, please!

12
00:01:44,466 --> 00:01:46,366
Silence!

13
00:01:46,434 --> 00:01:49,096
"Compañero" Crivelli
still has the floor.

14
00:01:50,405 --> 00:01:53,738
I believe in dialogue,
it's still open.

15
00:01:54,142 --> 00:01:55,770
Fuck off, you asshole!

16
00:02:00,516 --> 00:02:04,919
I insist! We should give
dialogue a chance.

17
00:02:05,454 --> 00:02:08,184
And talk to who?
The Pope?

18
00:02:09,892 --> 00:02:12,325
It's simply a question
of money!

19
00:02:12,394 --> 00:02:15,420
Many of us can't
even buy books!

20
00:02:19,935 --> 00:02:23,234
Finished, Crivelli?
"Compañera" Falcone has the floor.

21
00:02:24,973 --> 00:02:28,967
Let's not be naive!
This dialogue is just another delay.

22
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:30,944
- Right, Claudia!
- That's right!

23
00:02:31,514 --> 00:02:32,378
No more talking!

24
00:02:35,184 --> 00:02:38,847
We, the high school delegates
of La Plata, are here...

25
00:02:38,921 --> 00:02:42,515
to give in orto fight?

26
00:02:43,725 --> 00:02:46,057
- The UES is taking over the meeting.
- What can we do?

27
00:02:46,127 --> 00:02:47,424
Justwatch.

28
00:02:47,495 --> 00:02:51,158
The student pass is at stake.

29
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,794
At Fine Arts, we believe
the main issue is...

30
00:02:55,136 --> 00:02:58,334
if we demonstrate
tomorrow or not.

31
00:03:00,042 --> 00:03:03,978
Not all of us at Fine Arts
think that!

32
00:03:04,647 --> 00:03:06,205
Shut up, you nerd!

33
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:09,849
The question is, will there
be police repression?

34
00:03:10,952 --> 00:03:14,489
Probably... and infiltrates, too.

35
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:20,052
In that case, we could ask
the guerrilla for protection.

36
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,827
- No way!
- Bullshit!

37
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:26,658
Order, order!

38
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:29,601
Not a bad idea!

39
00:03:29,705 --> 00:03:31,900
- Right!
- Yes, that's right!

40
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,207
Silence!

41
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,072
Silence!

42
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,847
Please, think before you speak.

43
00:03:46,821 --> 00:03:51,019
"Compañeros", with
orwithout repression...

44
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:55,455
tomorrow we'll march
to the Ministry together...

45
00:03:57,866 --> 00:04:01,894
to demand a student pass.

46
00:04:07,642 --> 00:04:11,169
Silence, please!
Let's vote.

47
00:04:11,613 --> 00:04:14,673
Those in favor of a demonstration,
raise your hand.

63
00:07:34,147 --> 00:07:36,082
Díaz, to the front of the class.

64
00:08:14,655 --> 00:08:17,419
I demand respect.

65
00:08:18,692 --> 00:08:22,093
Sit up straight.
Stop holding up the wall.

66
00:08:22,162 --> 00:08:24,096
It's a run-down school.

67
00:08:24,197 --> 00:08:25,926
The fucking wall might fall.

68
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:29,594
Out! I won't stand
for rudeness.

69
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:33,167
Sorry I said "fucking".

70
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,366
Out!

71
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:37,403

Enough!

74
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:55,457
Why don't you concentrate
on your studies...

75
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:58,692
instead of demonstrating?

76
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:02,427
Are you practicing
with a machine gun?

77
00:09:20,687 --> 00:09:22,086
Some beating!

78
00:09:22,789 --> 00:09:23,949
C'mon.

79
00:09:28,061 --> 00:09:30,256
- After you, sir.
- Please, doctor.

80
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,860
After you, engineer.

81
00:09:43,477 --> 00:09:45,240
Look... Claudia Falcone.

82
00:09:45,645 --> 00:09:48,739
She's lost her head for you.

83
00:09:49,449 --> 00:09:52,350
Claudia, give him a chance.

84
00:09:52,586 --> 00:09:54,713
Tell her you love her.

85
00:09:56,256 --> 00:09:59,248
Is she dating a Fine Arts student?

86
00:09:59,826 --> 00:10:02,454
I know everything about Claudia,

87
00:10:03,497 --> 00:10:05,555
but I'm no rat.

88
00:10:05,798 --> 00:10:08,631
Oh, yeah?
Get off it.

89
00:10:09,536 --> 00:10:11,561

92
00:10:29,322 --> 00:10:31,552
Stop it!
It hurts when I laugh.

93
00:10:35,628 --> 00:10:37,220
Boy, did they get you!

94
00:10:37,997 --> 00:10:42,059
Tell the others it was
worthwhile, anyhow.

95
00:10:42,169 --> 00:10:45,366
We know the matter is being
carefully reviewed.

96
00:10:45,672 --> 00:10:48,800
Sure, we'll have our pass.

97
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:10,861
Pablo, what are you doing here?

98
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:13,762
Nothing... justwalking.
And you?

99
00:11:13,867 --> 00:11:16,665
- Me? School's finished.
- Sure.

100
00:11:17,537 --> 00:11:19,368
- You're...
- What?

101
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:21,134
Got something to do?

102
00:11:21,608 --> 00:11:24,008

They're fobbing us off again.

113
00:12:02,982 --> 00:12:05,450
- We'll have to wait.
- How long?

114
00:12:05,885 --> 00:12:07,580
Afew days.

115
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:10,515
If there's no answer
we'll demonstrate again.

116
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:20,228
In politics,
one must be patient.

117
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:23,325
Sure, Dad.
Where did patience get you?

118
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:25,396
Leave her alone, Dad.

119

In politics, nothing is free.

a high price.

- Ok, Mom.

- That's different. He...

Claudia and Jorge Falcone.</i>

165
00:17:30,141 --> 00:17:34,544
<i>As usual a parching sun
shone on Mulé Island.</i>

166
00:17:34,979 --> 00:17:36,378
<i>Look!</i>

167
00:17:40,418 --> 00:17:42,181
<i>Someone's shipwrecked!</i>

168
00:17:43,554 --> 00:17:45,215
What a clown!

169
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,423
<i>Sorry, I want to meditate.</i>

170
00:17:47,658 --> 00:17:49,148
<i>Sorry, sir?</i>

171
00:17:49,961 --> 00:17:52,657
<i>The revolution
is like a bicycle,</i>

172
00:17:53,398 --> 00:17:56,856
<i>if it stops, it falls down.</i>

173
00:18:03,074 --> 00:18:04,542
Sure?

174
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,169
Positive.

175
00:18:06,744 --> 00:18:09,304
I've been to the Congress.
The coup's a fact.

176
00:18:10,181 --> 00:18:12,046
Isabelita Perón will fall tonight.

177
00:18:17,288 --> 00:18:19,119
What are we waiting for?

178
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:25,018
Yes. Social exploitation,
the will to change. It's a fact!

179
00:18:26,364 --> 00:18:28,798
The Mulattos read the book.

180
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,633
I found a secondary contradiction.

181
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:34,330
While I burn,
you enjoy your hat.

182
00:18:38,442 --> 00:18:41,605
Stop it,
you underdeveloped savages!

183
00:18:41,979 --> 00:18:45,847
Never analize reality
like the ruling classes do.

184
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:49,214
Rebel against Western culture!

185
00:18:49,487 --> 00:18:52,047
It's over!
Dad was right.

186
00:18:52,456 --> 00:18:55,584
Each people has
the government it deserves.

187
00:19:08,573 --> 00:19:11,440
MARCH 24, 1976

188
00:19:11,709 --> 00:19:14,507
<i>Communiqué Num. 1
of the Military Junta.</i>

189
00:19:15,046 --> 00:19:16,843
<i>As of today...</i>

190
00:19:16,914 --> 00:19:20,441
<i>the country is under
the operational control...</i>

191
00:19:20,518 --> 00:19:22,917
<i>of the Military Junta.</i>

192
00:19:24,421 --> 00:19:27,448
A new era has begun.

193
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:32,727
An era with a very
clear objective...

194
00:19:33,264 --> 00:19:35,357
National Reorganization.

195
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:39,496
And the schools,
which cannot be islands...

196
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:44,269
...will start their
own reorganization.

197
00:19:44,508 --> 00:19:46,601
The high schools...

198
00:19:46,711 --> 00:19:49,144
...will never again
become trade unions...

199
00:19:49,212 --> 00:19:51,271
or political committees.

200
00:19:51,514 --> 00:19:56,178
Schools will never
again encourage...

201
00:19:56,252 --> 00:20:00,587
...the diffusion of atheistic,
antinational ideas.

202
00:20:01,025 --> 00:20:02,856
I hope these words...

203
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,952
will serve as a calm,
but firm warning.

204
00:20:06,464 --> 00:20:08,364
That is all for now.

205
00:20:09,066 --> 00:20:11,227
Welcome to the new era...

206
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,360
of National Reorganization.

207
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,800
Wonderful, Corchito.

208
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:36,458
- Hi, Pablin.
- Hi.

209
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:39,394
A super hotdog from Panchito.

210
00:20:39,463 --> 00:20:41,226
Very funny!

211
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:43,557
No, thanks.
Too dangerous.

212
00:20:43,634 --> 00:20:46,227
You're kidding.
I'm an expert.

213
00:20:48,838 --> 00:20:50,567
Who's the blonde with Horacio?

214
00:20:51,007 --> 00:20:53,999
María Clara?
She's from Bahía Blanca.

215
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,445
She left cause things
were getting heavy.

216
00:20:57,814 --> 00:20:59,407
Don't spread it.

217
00:21:00,184 --> 00:21:01,811
Not bad, huh?

218
00:21:02,286 --> 00:21:03,844
Yeah.

219
00:21:07,091 --> 00:21:09,525
- I'm a lousy dancer.
- Me too.

220
00:21:09,694 --> 00:21:11,355
No, you're good.

221
00:21:11,862 --> 00:21:13,761
Don't believe him.

222
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:22,835
What's your perfume?

223
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,231
Jasmin.

224
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,672
- What's so funny?
- Mom uses it.

225
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:31,476
I stole it from mine.

226
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:35,075
- Tell me something.
- Yes.

227
00:21:35,152 --> 00:21:37,814
Rememberthe meeting
about the pass?

228
00:21:38,355 --> 00:21:40,686
Why did you mention
the guerrilla?

229
00:21:41,691 --> 00:21:44,091
Just had to say something.

230
00:21:44,828 --> 00:21:47,490
You wouldn't let
anyone else speak.

231
00:21:47,864 --> 00:21:49,695
You wanted to be heroes.

232
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,256
That's silly.

233
00:21:51,668 --> 00:21:53,932
But I did shock them.

234
00:22:00,644 --> 00:22:03,511
Look... don't I resemble Evita?

235
00:22:07,318 --> 00:22:10,013
Claudia, I like you a lot.

236
00:22:11,988 --> 00:22:13,819
No, Pablo.

237
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:19,720
You're very nice, but no.

238
00:22:20,764 --> 00:22:22,732
Stop the music!

239
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:33,702
- Let go, you beast!
- Keep still!

240
00:22:37,881 --> 00:22:40,315
- The bastards...
- Calm down.

241
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,068
Darling...

242
00:23:04,741 --> 00:23:08,438
Be sensible.
Things are getting difficult.

243
00:23:08,945 --> 00:23:11,436
What am I supposed to do?

244
00:23:14,717 --> 00:23:19,177
I've been Mayor here.

245
00:23:19,389 --> 00:23:22,756
The military put me in prison.
I almost didn't make it.

246
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:25,354
I know what I'm talking about.

247
00:23:25,962 --> 00:23:28,692
Stop sticking your head out.

248
00:23:29,532 --> 00:23:32,865
You can't ask me that.

249
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:37,531
You've always said
one has to fight.

250
00:23:38,074 --> 00:23:41,669
I'm not asking you to give up...

251
00:23:42,312 --> 00:23:44,542
but don't be foolish.

252
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,974
What then?

253
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,650
Should I take up embroidery?

254
00:24:05,835 --> 00:24:08,633
Don't rush things.

255
00:24:09,272 --> 00:24:11,103
You've got time.

256
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:13,236
No, Dad.

257
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,468
I haven't.

258
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:20,940
You just said things
are difficult.

259
00:24:21,618 --> 00:24:24,485
One has to take sides.

260
00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:36,330
What if the police is inside?

261
00:24:36,633 --> 00:24:38,396
C'mon, you dummy.

262
00:25:22,945 --> 00:25:24,344
Let's go.

263
00:25:25,647 --> 00:25:28,275
REINTEGRATE FIRED TEACHERS

264
00:25:32,321 --> 00:25:34,983
GIVE US THE STUDENT PASS BACK

265
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:39,023
LIBERATION OR DEPENDENCY

266
00:25:39,095 --> 00:25:41,791
DOWN WITH DICTATORSHIP
IN SCHOOLS

267
00:25:41,864 --> 00:25:43,297
DOWN WITH THE COPS

268
00:25:48,037 --> 00:25:50,129
The face of the witch!

269
00:25:50,472 --> 00:25:53,930
Go ahead, laugh.
You'll get us all screwed.

270
00:25:54,576 --> 00:25:56,134
Shut up, big mouth.

271
00:25:56,678 --> 00:25:59,010
You know how many
teachers they fired?

272
00:26:00,082 --> 00:26:01,413
Fifty eight.

273
00:26:01,817 --> 00:26:04,911
Won't you have anything else?

274
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,453
No, thanks, Aunt... really.

275
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,985
They'll abolish the pass.

276
00:26:13,496 --> 00:26:18,455
They can't. The whole town
will come down on them.

277
00:26:18,734 --> 00:26:22,135
They want us to stick
our heads out.

278
00:26:22,304 --> 00:26:24,135
We already have.

279
00:26:24,239 --> 00:26:26,969
But now the kids are scared.

280
00:26:27,342 --> 00:26:29,401
They don'twant to fight.

281
00:26:29,478 --> 00:26:31,343
They will forthe pass.

282
00:26:31,613 --> 00:26:35,049
It isn't easy.
We're being watched.

283
00:26:35,584 --> 00:26:38,145
I was warned yesterday.

284
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,781
We're all for it, aren'twe?

285
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,688
Yes, slogan-painting
and leaflets.

286
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,284
Then we'll see.

287
00:26:47,529 --> 00:26:51,795
Three students are missing.
The cops deny everything.

288
00:26:57,139 --> 00:27:01,041
Let's meet tomorrow.
We'll see things more clearly.

289
00:27:13,622 --> 00:27:14,782
Some mess!

290
00:27:15,524 --> 00:27:16,786
Claudia...

291
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,621
You better leave your
house for a while.

292
00:27:21,196 --> 00:27:22,857
Stay here with me.

293
00:27:23,598 --> 00:27:25,429
It's safer.

294
00:27:27,436 --> 00:27:29,870
Everybody knows
Aunt Rosa lived alone.

295
00:27:30,105 --> 00:27:32,164
Now kids come and go
all the time.

296
00:27:32,741 --> 00:27:35,039
Remember, María Clara
went underground.

297
00:27:35,143 --> 00:27:37,270
We're not that stupid.

298
00:27:37,379 --> 00:27:41,009
Maybe. But your
security is lousy.

299
00:27:41,616 --> 00:27:43,083
Meet somewhere else.

300
00:27:46,021 --> 00:27:48,114
A revolution takes more
than five minutes.

301
00:27:48,657 --> 00:27:50,056
Bye, brother.

302
00:27:50,892 --> 00:27:53,793
Claudia, you can't rush things.

303
00:27:54,563 --> 00:27:56,793
See? You talk like Dad.

304
00:28:13,515 --> 00:28:15,642
Stop it.

305
00:28:15,884 --> 00:28:17,511
C'mon, Mom.

306
00:28:18,587 --> 00:28:21,078
- What's come over you?
- Guess.

307
00:28:23,892 --> 00:28:27,623
- How much?
- Got to buy things for school.

308
00:28:29,331 --> 00:28:31,959
- Baby...
- Not again, Mom!

309
00:28:32,434 --> 00:28:35,426
You know what's going on.
Be careful.

310
00:28:35,504 --> 00:28:37,164
I am.

311
00:28:39,206 --> 00:28:41,937
Well. Gotta go.

312
00:28:43,044 --> 00:28:44,204
Claudia.

313
00:28:46,681 --> 00:28:48,148
How's your aunt?

314
00:28:48,617 --> 00:28:52,144
- Better than she'll admit.
- How's that?

315
00:28:52,254 --> 00:28:54,381
Really. She likes
one of my friends.

316
00:28:54,456 --> 00:28:55,923
Nonsense.

317
00:28:55,991 --> 00:28:58,653
She tried to seduce Horacio.

318
00:28:59,294 --> 00:29:00,955
It's a pity, though.

319
00:29:01,263 --> 00:29:04,925
The difference in age...
his parents object.

320
00:29:05,866 --> 00:29:08,596
If your poor aunt heard you.

321
00:29:10,271 --> 00:29:13,730
- Bye.
- So soon?

322
00:29:13,909 --> 00:29:15,501
They're waiting for me.

323
00:29:16,945 --> 00:29:18,173
Take care.

324
00:29:21,183 --> 00:29:22,810
We better stop meeting.

325
00:29:23,451 --> 00:29:25,646
I think a cop followed me here.

326
00:29:26,321 --> 00:29:29,085
They want to frighten us.

327
00:29:30,392 --> 00:29:32,484
Can I stay here tonight?

328
00:29:33,594 --> 00:29:35,118
I'm leaving.

329
00:29:39,466 --> 00:29:40,899
Can I take it?

330
00:29:41,001 --> 00:29:43,128
As soon as I finish it.

331
00:29:44,906 --> 00:29:46,737
- Bye, Danny.
- Bye.

332
00:29:47,175 --> 00:29:48,836
I'll see you out.

333
00:29:52,314 --> 00:29:54,441
- Take care.
- Yes, Mom.

334
00:29:54,683 --> 00:29:56,583
You look great today.

335
00:30:11,198 --> 00:30:11,332
Afight to death.
A double lock...

336
00:30:11,332 --> 00:30:14,928
Afight to death.
A double lock...

337
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:17,597
Mercenary Joe
is about to surrender.

338
00:30:17,906 --> 00:30:19,635
Stop it, you blockheads!

339
00:30:19,941 --> 00:30:22,569
Joe's mother tries
to stop the fight!

340
00:30:22,644 --> 00:30:24,942
It's obviously a trick!

341
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,248
Behave and I'll make pancakes.

342
00:30:38,392 --> 00:30:39,757
Do you like Horacio?

343
00:30:40,761 --> 00:30:42,092
Do you like Pablo?

344
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,367
You do like Horacio.

345
00:30:56,043 --> 00:30:58,409
It's late, Claudio.
Go to sleep.

346
00:30:59,046 --> 00:31:00,513
Yes, Mom.

347
00:31:24,872 --> 00:31:26,703
Open up, open up!

348
00:31:27,741 --> 00:31:29,402
Don't move!

349
00:31:31,378 --> 00:31:32,777
What's going on?

350
00:31:33,514 --> 00:31:35,141
Quiet or I'll bust you!

351
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:38,448
- What is it?
- Don't move!

352
00:31:47,562 --> 00:31:49,496
Let go of me!

353
00:32:11,352 --> 00:32:14,116
Pablito, Claudia's mother
is on the phone.

354
00:32:44,351 --> 00:32:46,945
María Clara, Claudia
and Horacio...

355
00:32:48,254 --> 00:32:51,224
And Daniel and Panchito.

356
00:32:52,226 --> 00:32:53,853
And Claudio too.

357
00:32:53,927 --> 00:32:55,189
What do you think?

358
00:32:56,263 --> 00:32:59,289
Must have been the cops.

359
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:04,660
They want to frighten them
and then let them go.

360
00:33:05,406 --> 00:33:07,169
I hope so.

361
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:11,539
C'mon, help me.

362
00:33:14,515 --> 00:33:16,505
If the owner sees you, I'm fired.

363
00:33:17,817 --> 00:33:19,445
Besides... where?

364
00:33:29,997 --> 00:33:31,487
Hey, shorty!

365
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,459
- Get me some water.
- Yes, sir.

366
00:33:44,977 --> 00:33:46,410
Careful, you idiot!

367
00:33:46,946 --> 00:33:49,506
Sorry, I fell asleep.

368
00:33:57,925 --> 00:33:59,392
Hurry up.

369
00:34:11,704 --> 00:34:13,331
Go back to sleep.

370
00:35:08,594 --> 00:35:11,119
- In this Che Guevara group...
- Che Guevara Youth, Dad.

371
00:35:11,364 --> 00:35:15,460
What did you do, apart from
fighting for the pass?

372
00:35:15,935 --> 00:35:18,267
Same as the kids they took away.

373
00:35:18,571 --> 00:35:21,699
Paint walls, hand out leaflets,
work in the slums.

374
00:35:21,874 --> 00:35:23,240
Okay.

375
00:35:24,578 --> 00:35:28,571
If they come for you,
we can explain everything.

376
00:35:29,216 --> 00:35:30,774
Will there be time?

377
00:35:31,018 --> 00:35:33,213
You've got nothing to hide.

378
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:36,713
Go back home,
and tomorrow to school.

379
00:35:36,822 --> 00:35:38,915
Please, not to school now.

380
00:35:39,859 --> 00:35:42,851
All right. But return home.

381
00:35:44,096 --> 00:35:46,257
You'll be better there
than anywhere else.

382
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,827
C'mon, baby. Keep still!

383
00:36:26,306 --> 00:36:27,933
- Are you Pablo Diaz?
- Yes.

384
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:30,338
- Where are the guns?
- What guns?

385
00:36:30,443 --> 00:36:33,003
- Don't play dumb.
- I don't know anything.

386
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:35,013
I swear I don't.

387
00:36:36,082 --> 00:36:39,313
- I swear I don't.
- Talk, you asshole!

388
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:54,297
Talk, you mother fucker!

389
00:36:58,871 --> 00:37:00,031
Take him away.

390
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,232
Sir, listen please...

391
00:37:02,675 --> 00:37:04,666
It's a mistake.

392
00:37:04,744 --> 00:37:06,905
Please, sir, please!

393
00:37:07,346 --> 00:37:11,043
We'll question him
and send him back.

394
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:13,643
Please, let me go!

395
00:37:13,986 --> 00:37:15,886
Please, sir, let me go!

396
00:38:18,451 --> 00:38:21,783
Take it easy!
We're going to talk.

397
00:38:25,523 --> 00:38:27,184
Walk!

398
00:38:28,894 --> 00:38:33,558
Don't budge.

399
00:38:53,918 --> 00:38:55,749
Don't touch the wall!

400
00:38:58,356 --> 00:39:02,418
Can't you see?
She's just a high school kid.

401
00:39:03,529 --> 00:39:05,622
Calm down, madam.

402
00:39:06,332 --> 00:39:09,028
Perhaps herfriends
took her away.

403
00:39:10,603 --> 00:39:14,164
Officer, all the neighbors saw it.

404
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,536
We're not idiots.

405
00:39:16,608 --> 00:39:18,166
Be respectful...

406
00:39:18,943 --> 00:39:21,070
and lower your voice.

407
00:39:23,915 --> 00:39:25,007
Very well.

408
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:27,881
You know my father wrote this.

409
00:39:28,386 --> 00:39:30,013
Dr. Delfor Méndez.

410
00:39:30,422 --> 00:39:32,822
- You're his daughter?
- Yes, I am.

411
00:39:33,592 --> 00:39:35,184
A great man.

412
00:39:35,528 --> 00:39:40,761
Go to the Police Headquarters
and ask. Don't mention my name.

413
00:39:41,634 --> 00:39:43,295
And go alone.

414
00:39:44,335 --> 00:39:45,962
Thank you.

415
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,511
Jorge, calm down.

416
00:40:12,564 --> 00:40:14,031
Don'twaste my time.

417
00:40:15,366 --> 00:40:18,927
What's your group and rank?

418
00:40:20,104 --> 00:40:21,969
What's all this?

419
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,937
What organization?

420
00:40:25,476 --> 00:40:27,137
UES?

421
00:40:27,779 --> 00:40:29,872
- "Montoneros"?
- No, sir.

422
00:40:31,884 --> 00:40:33,408
Bring him.

423
00:40:36,121 --> 00:40:37,713
What about your school?

424
00:40:40,124 --> 00:40:41,648
What are you up to?

425
00:40:42,026 --> 00:40:44,085
I'm in the students' council.

426
00:40:48,433 --> 00:40:51,231
- What magazines do you read?
- I read nothing...

427
00:40:55,006 --> 00:40:57,099
You don't know
what I'm talking about?

428
00:40:57,575 --> 00:40:59,270
No, I swear.

429
00:41:06,952 --> 00:41:09,385
What's Pablo Diaz up to?

430
00:41:11,055 --> 00:41:13,649
I... nothing.

431
00:41:17,161 --> 00:41:19,459
C'mon, don't act stupid.

432
00:41:21,466 --> 00:41:22,956
You know...

433
00:41:23,935 --> 00:41:25,960
He was the school delegate.

434
00:41:28,006 --> 00:41:31,635
He fought for the pass.
That's all.

435
00:41:40,051 --> 00:41:42,645
OK, you're off the hook.

436
00:41:44,055 --> 00:41:45,955
But get this into your head.

437
00:41:47,158 --> 00:41:50,321
You'll live, if I want you to.

438
00:41:51,462 --> 00:41:53,157
Got it?

439
00:41:54,399 --> 00:41:57,596
- Yes.
- Yes... sir.

440
00:41:57,835 --> 00:42:00,167
Yes, sir.

441
00:42:07,412 --> 00:42:10,006
I'm fed up with you two.

442
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:15,977
Diamanti, come here
with your things.

443
00:42:20,525 --> 00:42:22,425
This'll be your seat.

444
00:42:23,061 --> 00:42:25,120
You, Chirom, take his place.

445
00:42:26,297 --> 00:42:28,663
C'mon gentlemen, move.

446
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:45,645
Pisani, come over here.

447
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:48,641
Sir, Pablo Diaz sits there.

448
00:42:48,886 --> 00:42:50,649
Obey, young lady.

449
00:43:38,803 --> 00:43:40,361
Move over, shitheads!

450
00:43:41,372 --> 00:43:43,101
Out of the way, Jewish pig!

451
00:43:46,778 --> 00:43:48,575
Where are you taking me?

452
00:44:04,361 --> 00:44:06,727
- What's this?
- Shut up.

453
00:44:07,731 --> 00:44:09,495
Whatwill you do to me?

454
00:44:09,634 --> 00:44:11,829
You won't feel like
fucking around anymore.

455
00:44:15,339 --> 00:44:18,001
Please... What is this?

456
00:44:19,577 --> 00:44:21,568
Whatwill you do to me?

457
00:44:29,486 --> 00:44:32,922
Why did you fuck things up?

458
00:44:33,557 --> 00:44:35,286
Whatwill you do to me?

459
00:44:36,193 --> 00:44:37,751
Heard of the truth machine?

460
00:44:39,363 --> 00:44:41,797
Well, now you will.

461
00:44:43,734 --> 00:44:45,895
A lie detector will show
I'm not lying.

462
00:44:46,471 --> 00:44:49,668
So you want the machine?
Fine.

463
00:45:18,502 --> 00:45:22,370
If you want to talk,
open your hands.

464
00:45:26,109 --> 00:45:30,307
Give us a name.
C'mon, open your hands.

465
00:45:44,262 --> 00:45:45,922
Your superior.

466
00:45:46,897 --> 00:45:48,660
Be smart.

467
00:45:49,166 --> 00:45:51,225
The name and we'll stop.

468
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:55,435
Open your hands.

469
00:46:08,218 --> 00:46:11,449
I have no superior.

470
00:46:11,621 --> 00:46:13,816
Are you screwing with us, shithead?

471
00:46:13,924 --> 00:46:16,085
I haven't got one.

472
00:46:25,502 --> 00:46:27,470
I'm going to break you.

473
00:46:27,671 --> 00:46:29,798
You won't feel like
fucking around anymore.

474
00:46:43,386 --> 00:46:43,987
I can't, Jorge.

475
00:46:43,987 --> 00:46:45,113
I can't, Jorge.

476
00:46:46,122 --> 00:46:49,216
But you've known
Claudia for years.

477
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,355
Do you know how many lawyers
disappeared...

478
00:46:52,462 --> 00:46:54,862
for invoking habeas corpus?

479
00:46:54,998 --> 00:46:56,989
- Do you?
- No.

480
00:46:57,067 --> 00:46:58,500
Twelve.

481
00:47:01,404 --> 00:47:03,895
They know I've been in politics.

482
00:47:04,641 --> 00:47:08,577
You'd have to get
another lawyer...

483
00:47:08,778 --> 00:47:10,711
but for me.

484
00:47:13,315 --> 00:47:14,476
I'm sorry.

485
00:47:32,269 --> 00:47:33,395
Water...

486
00:47:34,537 --> 00:47:35,868
Water...

487
00:47:36,705 --> 00:47:37,967
Easy now.

488
00:47:40,843 --> 00:47:42,333
Water, please.

489
00:47:42,411 --> 00:47:44,106
Not after the electric prod.

490
00:47:44,781 --> 00:47:46,681
I'm desperate.

491
00:47:47,984 --> 00:47:50,885
If you drink you'll
burst like a toad.

492
00:47:52,856 --> 00:47:54,323
What's your name?

493
00:47:56,660 --> 00:48:00,255
Don't be afraid.
I'm Carozo Schunk.

494
00:48:01,898 --> 00:48:03,866
Pablo Díaz.

495
00:48:05,067 --> 00:48:06,466
I know you.

496
00:48:07,269 --> 00:48:08,827
I saw you at the meeting.

497
00:48:09,505 --> 00:48:12,133
I'm the one that mentioned
the money, remember?

498
00:48:13,475 --> 00:48:14,965
Where are we?

499
00:48:15,912 --> 00:48:17,675
In Campo de Arana.

500
00:48:24,187 --> 00:48:26,781
Other students were here before.

501
00:48:27,324 --> 00:48:29,588
The kids of the
night of the pencils.

502
00:48:30,226 --> 00:48:31,591
What?

503
00:48:32,028 --> 00:48:33,824
The soldiers call it like that.

504
00:48:33,896 --> 00:48:37,059
The night they
grabbed the students.

505
00:48:37,533 --> 00:48:40,661
Who? Claudia Falcone?
Horacio Ungaro?

506
00:48:40,736 --> 00:48:42,499
Panchito Lopez Muntaner?

507
00:48:42,604 --> 00:48:45,402
Yes. They took them away
before you arrived.

508
00:48:45,541 --> 00:48:47,169
How were they?

509
00:48:48,011 --> 00:48:49,945
They've been through hell.

510
00:49:06,095 --> 00:49:08,893
My son, I'm a priest.

511
00:49:09,498 --> 00:49:11,728
I've come for your confession.

512
00:49:12,601 --> 00:49:13,863
I didn't do anything.

513
00:49:13,969 --> 00:49:16,995
Confess your sins, my son.

514
00:49:19,309 --> 00:49:22,403
Confess, there'll be
more executions.

515
00:49:23,413 --> 00:49:26,143
I don't want to die, Father.

516
00:49:26,383 --> 00:49:28,247
Resign yourself, my son.

517
00:49:28,317 --> 00:49:30,979
The tree must be pruned
to give better fruits.

518
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,856
Please, Father...
I don't want to die.

519
00:49:35,924 --> 00:49:39,382
Confess your sins.

520
00:49:39,728 --> 00:49:43,892
Your life depends on God
and on your cooperation.

521
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,961
Who is your superior?

522
00:49:51,908 --> 00:49:53,603
C'mon, up!

523
00:49:54,177 --> 00:49:56,269
C'mon, c'mon, quickly!

524
00:49:59,348 --> 00:50:01,009
God, no. God... Lord!

525
00:50:01,483 --> 00:50:05,385
Why mention God, old fart?
We are god.

526
00:50:05,854 --> 00:50:09,449
Filthy Jew!
I'll kill you myself.

527
00:50:09,892 --> 00:50:11,450
To make soap!

528
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:14,328
Repeat: I'm a filthy Jew.

529
00:50:16,365 --> 00:50:19,358
Say it or I'll bust you.
I'm a filthy Jew.

530
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:24,628
I'm a filthy Jew.

531
00:50:51,233 --> 00:50:52,825
Don't cry, children.

532
00:50:53,035 --> 00:50:56,732
You'll be better off
where you're going.

533
00:51:02,945 --> 00:51:04,344
Get ready.

534
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:09,540
We pray to God, our Father,
for our brothers.

535
00:51:10,085 --> 00:51:11,643
Aim!

536
00:51:12,387 --> 00:51:14,082
Don't kill me!

537
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:17,590
So that you may comfort
them, Father...

538
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:20,986
and fortify them.

539
00:51:22,764 --> 00:51:24,356
Long live Argentina!

540
00:51:24,466 --> 00:51:26,832
- Mother!
- And the "Montoneros"!

541
00:51:27,135 --> 00:51:28,659
Fire!

542
00:51:34,843 --> 00:51:38,870
My sons, you've been spared
this time.

543
00:51:39,481 --> 00:51:41,449
And you, subversive
motherfucker,

544
00:51:41,517 --> 00:51:43,747
you won't feel like
yelling anymore.

545
00:52:04,406 --> 00:52:06,374
How do you do, madam?

546
00:52:06,508 --> 00:52:08,271
- Good morning.
- Allow me.

547
00:52:13,682 --> 00:52:15,342
Take a seat.

548
00:52:15,416 --> 00:52:17,976
So you're Dr. Méndez's daughter.

549
00:52:18,152 --> 00:52:23,216
I was a cadetwhen I first read...

550
00:52:24,326 --> 00:52:29,593
"ln sports, we were
always the winners...

551
00:52:29,932 --> 00:52:36,531
to defend the Argentine flag."

552
00:52:37,706 --> 00:52:41,198
The club's anthem.
Also written by your father.

553
00:52:41,543 --> 00:52:43,737
A great man.

554
00:52:45,947 --> 00:52:48,211
What can I do for you, madam?

555
00:52:48,416 --> 00:52:53,582
I came to inquire about
Dr. Méndez's granddaughter.

556
00:52:54,022 --> 00:52:56,252
Claudia Falcone, my daughter.

557
00:52:57,793 --> 00:53:01,923
She was kidnapped ten days
ago, apparently by the police.

558
00:53:02,564 --> 00:53:05,727
I only hope she's
in some police station.

559
00:53:06,201 --> 00:53:07,691
Surely you know about it.

560
00:53:11,639 --> 00:53:14,938
Who told you the police
kidnapped someone?

561
00:53:16,077 --> 00:53:17,908
Tell me, who said that?

562
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:19,803
Different people.

563
00:53:20,014 --> 00:53:22,642
Give me a list.
We'll investigate.

564
00:53:23,484 --> 00:53:26,648
I don'twant to get them involved.

565
00:53:27,255 --> 00:53:30,588
What? Someone slanders
our institution...

566
00:53:30,859 --> 00:53:33,851
and you don't want me
to investigate.

567
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:39,191
Don't let Marxists
give you ideas.

568
00:53:40,167 --> 00:53:44,035
I'm sure the subversives
kidnapped your daughter.

569
00:53:45,206 --> 00:53:47,902
They disguise themselves
as policemen and soldiers...

570
00:53:48,042 --> 00:53:50,567
so that people
may go around saying...

571
00:53:50,645 --> 00:53:54,240
we don't respect human rights.

572
00:53:55,484 --> 00:53:58,578
Captain, is my daughter alive?

573
00:54:24,779 --> 00:54:26,407
C'mon, help me.

574
00:54:26,948 --> 00:54:28,848
Another lamb for the collection?

575
00:54:42,229 --> 00:54:44,197
But never a real guerrilla.

576
00:54:44,265 --> 00:54:46,130
You only get the sissies.

577
00:54:46,467 --> 00:54:48,958
Go get yourself fucked!

578
00:54:49,303 --> 00:54:52,761
You motherfuckers
have a real good time.

579
00:54:58,146 --> 00:54:59,238
Let's go.

580
00:56:50,357 --> 00:56:51,847
Who are you? Tell me!

581
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:57,621
Don't be afraid.
Who are you?

582
00:57:00,366 --> 00:57:02,562
Pablo Díaz.

583
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:07,864
Is it you, Pablo?

584
00:57:08,909 --> 00:57:10,137
I'm Horacio.

585
00:57:11,879 --> 00:57:13,642
Hey, Pablo is here!

586
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:15,671
Pablo!

587
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:21,779
Panchito?

588
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:24,653
Sure, you nerd...

589
00:57:24,958 --> 00:57:26,482
It's me.

590
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:28,455
You're all here?

591
00:57:28,561 --> 00:57:29,994
Yes. Hi, Pablo.

592
00:57:30,997 --> 00:57:32,761
Claudio here.

593
00:57:32,867 --> 00:57:35,995
- You're all here?
- Yes, María Clara.

594
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:39,896
I'm Daniel.

595
00:57:43,344 --> 00:57:46,336
Is Claudia here?

596
00:57:46,647 --> 00:57:49,672
Yes... I'm here.

597
00:57:56,522 --> 00:57:58,752
Can you hear me?

598
00:58:22,382 --> 00:58:24,350
Ladies, to the corridor.

599
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:27,018
You're through?

600
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:29,452
Yes. A list of missing people.

601
00:58:29,522 --> 00:58:32,491
Under arrest.
No one's missing here.

602
00:58:33,694 --> 00:58:35,025
My daughter isn't there.

603
00:58:35,663 --> 00:58:37,688
We can't do anything.

604
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:40,829
You all say the same.

605
00:58:41,001 --> 00:58:43,492
If you'd looked after
your daughter...

606
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:45,560
she'd be all right now.

607
00:58:45,705 --> 00:58:47,935
I've always looked after her.

608
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:51,167
- Have you?
- As if one wasn'tArgentine.

609
00:58:51,311 --> 00:58:53,939
You are, not your daughter.

610
00:58:55,214 --> 00:58:57,944
Yes, Captain, she is.

611
00:59:00,853 --> 00:59:05,723
- You asked about the Falcone girl?
- Yes.

612
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,985
- Claudia Falcone?
- Yes, my daughter.

613
00:59:09,563 --> 00:59:11,894
She and my son
Horacio were friends,

614
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:16,364
they disappeared
the same night.

615
00:59:24,610 --> 00:59:29,013
You're out of luck, Pablo.
You got the bad guards.

616
00:59:29,415 --> 00:59:31,246
One almost strangled me.

617
00:59:31,851 --> 00:59:33,375
He's a beast.

618
00:59:34,287 --> 00:59:37,280
I bet the Mulattos Mule...

619
00:59:37,458 --> 00:59:41,291
could free us.

620
00:59:42,395 --> 00:59:43,794
Horacio.

621
00:59:44,864 --> 00:59:46,525
Tell me how to do it.

622
00:59:48,067 --> 00:59:50,627
Relax, there's plenty of time
in here.

623
00:59:52,105 --> 00:59:53,663
Hey, Claudia...

624
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,240
the night you were grabbed?

625
00:59:57,210 --> 00:59:58,643
I slept in Corchito's fridge.

626
00:59:58,978 --> 01:00:00,411
The fridge?

627
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,415
Like Walt Disney in the freezer.

628
01:00:05,151 --> 01:00:09,747
The torturers asked me
about him but I kept silent.

629
01:00:10,590 --> 01:00:11,887
You held on.

630
01:00:12,291 --> 01:00:15,454
I was so scared
I forgot his name.

631
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,260
The lucky asshole!

632
01:00:20,166 --> 01:00:23,397
I was no hero.

633
01:00:24,937 --> 01:00:27,371
My head wasn't straight.

634
01:00:30,676 --> 01:00:32,109
Got it, Horacio.

635
01:00:32,912 --> 01:00:35,209
Take one hand out.

636
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:38,041
Careful, don't untie it.

637
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:14,247
- Stop it!
- No way!

638
01:01:23,129 --> 01:01:24,528
He's a swine.

639
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,161
Is anyone else here?

640
01:01:29,869 --> 01:01:32,462
Two pregnant girls
and a guerrilla.

641
01:01:33,205 --> 01:01:37,301
- "Montonero"?
- ERP. A leader.

642
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:55,657
Come on, baby.

643
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:19,281
Come on, you shithead.

644
01:02:29,828 --> 01:02:33,594
- Dany, are you eating?
- Yes.

645
01:02:38,537 --> 01:02:40,129
Double helping, baby.

646
01:02:40,907 --> 01:02:43,307
You can't say I'm a swine.

647
01:03:27,552 --> 01:03:29,520
"Our Father who art in Heaven...

648
01:03:29,921 --> 01:03:32,082
hallowed be Thy name...

649
01:03:32,958 --> 01:03:36,860
Thy kingdom come,
Thy word be done...

650
01:03:37,095 --> 01:03:39,563
on Earth as it is in Heaven...

651
01:03:40,432 --> 01:03:43,869
give us this day
our daily bread...

652
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:46,631
and forgive us our trespasses...

653
01:03:46,872 --> 01:03:50,500
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

654
01:03:52,177 --> 01:03:56,773
2736, 2737, 2738...

655
01:03:56,948 --> 01:03:59,940
2739, 2740.

656
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,718
2741, 2742,

657
01:04:04,956 --> 01:04:07,925
2743, 2744...

658
01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:12,996
Pablo.

659
01:04:14,667 --> 01:04:16,464
Pablo, are you asleep?

660
01:04:17,469 --> 01:04:20,063
No, good morning.

661
01:04:21,439 --> 01:04:22,770
Good morning...

662
01:04:24,075 --> 01:04:26,441
I haven't heard that in ages.

663
01:04:28,046 --> 01:04:32,915
Don't come. They're nasty
and you can't stand it.

664
01:04:34,819 --> 01:04:39,051
Women can get away
with a lot more.

665
01:04:41,059 --> 01:04:42,492
Do it for me.

666
01:04:44,730 --> 01:04:46,390
I suffer when they humiliate you.

667
01:04:47,098 --> 01:04:49,828
But you can't go alone!

668
01:04:50,568 --> 01:04:52,263
I'm not alone.

669
01:05:14,525 --> 01:05:15,652
Ready.

670
01:05:19,164 --> 01:05:21,928
- Claudia.
- C'mon, kid!

671
01:05:27,405 --> 01:05:30,863
Hey, blockheads,
do some exercises.

672
01:05:32,210 --> 01:05:34,144
You organize everything.

673
01:05:47,192 --> 01:05:48,716
OK, let's stretch.

674
01:05:49,461 --> 01:05:50,894
I'm too weak.

675
01:05:50,962 --> 01:05:52,395
I'm for it.

676
01:05:52,797 --> 01:05:56,096
Come on, Horacio.
I'll start.

677
01:06:00,405 --> 01:06:02,373
One...

678
01:06:04,442 --> 01:06:05,807
C'mon.

679
01:06:06,678 --> 01:06:08,702
Two...

680
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:11,672
C'mon, Horacio.

681
01:06:12,516 --> 01:06:14,143
Three.

682
01:06:15,986 --> 01:06:18,547
Remember "Papillon."

683
01:06:19,290 --> 01:06:21,952
He stuck a tube up his ass.

684
01:06:22,594 --> 01:06:24,118
Five...

685
01:06:25,630 --> 01:06:28,394
Six...

686
01:06:36,174 --> 01:06:37,868
Eight...

687
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:42,240
Dany, c'mon...

688
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:47,741
Just a little.

689
01:06:47,986 --> 01:06:50,853
Leave me alone!
I hate exercises.

690
01:06:57,829 --> 01:07:00,764
Claudia, are you with us?

691
01:07:03,868 --> 01:07:05,266
Hey, what's wrong?

692
01:07:06,737 --> 01:07:10,036
Cheer up, they'll let us out.

693
01:07:12,309 --> 01:07:16,006
They can't keep us here for good.

694
01:07:17,915 --> 01:07:20,282
We'll get out, trust me.

695
01:07:23,788 --> 01:07:26,052
Then I'll take you out to dinner.

696
01:07:28,159 --> 01:07:30,024
I dream of a steak...

697
01:07:30,762 --> 01:07:35,027
two eggs and lots
of French fries.

698
01:07:37,034 --> 01:07:39,832
Or better, you invite me...

699
01:07:40,838 --> 01:07:42,829
and you cook.

700
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:44,237
But only hamburgers.

701
01:07:44,608 --> 01:07:46,906
That's fine.

702
01:07:47,478 --> 01:07:51,210
Orwe'll look for a recipe.

703
01:07:53,351 --> 01:07:54,978
An easy one.

704
01:07:55,053 --> 01:07:57,613
A difficult one, I'll help you.

705
01:07:58,189 --> 01:08:01,555
I'll be your assistant.
That'll be something.

706
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:08,791
Claudia, sing a song.

707
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:11,527
Sing with María Clara.

708
01:08:12,569 --> 01:08:15,299
- You sing too.
- I can't sing.

709
01:08:15,606 --> 01:08:18,404
If you sing, I'll cook.

710
01:08:18,842 --> 01:08:20,367
OK.

711
01:08:21,513 --> 01:08:24,539
<i>Once I was beautiful...</i>

712
01:08:25,483 --> 01:08:26,916
C'mon, María Clara.

713
01:08:28,085 --> 01:08:30,747
<i>Once I was beautiful...</i>

714
01:08:31,321 --> 01:08:34,154
<i>and truly free.</i>

715
01:08:35,092 --> 01:08:36,582
You too, Pablo.

716
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:41,529
<i>I kept all my dreams
in a crystal castle.</i>

717
01:08:43,333 --> 01:08:45,062
That's dreadful!

718
01:08:47,237 --> 01:08:48,966
Yes, it is.

719
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:56,306
<i>They vanished
like soap bubbles.</i>

720
01:08:57,614 --> 01:09:03,484
<i>I'll find you one morning
in my room...</i>

721
01:09:04,121 --> 01:09:08,455
<i>and you'll make
the bed for two.</i>

722
01:09:31,381 --> 01:09:33,110
Clean his wound.

723
01:09:34,952 --> 01:09:37,580
Then get back in your cell.

724
01:09:46,463 --> 01:09:49,955
Do as Dr. Mengele says.

725
01:09:55,038 --> 01:09:58,064
C'mon, be a man.

726
01:10:03,113 --> 01:10:06,913
I can't use this, it's filthy.

727
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:09,946
Never mind, just do it.

728
01:10:25,335 --> 01:10:26,666
How many shots?

729
01:10:27,537 --> 01:10:28,765
Three.

730
01:10:32,976 --> 01:10:34,273
How does it feel?

731
01:10:35,012 --> 01:10:36,411
Why do you ask?

732
01:10:48,491 --> 01:10:51,790
Osvaldo, will they let us go?

733
01:10:52,495 --> 01:10:56,125
Sure, they didn't nail you...

734
01:10:57,768 --> 01:11:00,066
on anything big.

735
01:11:00,370 --> 01:11:03,237
- Then why bring us here?
- This is a depot.

736
01:11:05,809 --> 01:11:08,869
They'll have to make a decision.

737
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:14,442
They'll release you,
you're no use to them.

738
01:11:17,186 --> 01:11:18,551
And you?

739
01:11:19,789 --> 01:11:21,484
What about me?

740
01:11:24,126 --> 01:11:25,594
Will they release you?

741
01:11:25,662 --> 01:11:29,564
I'm a hostage.
I may be useful to them.

742
01:11:34,371 --> 01:11:36,862
Officially, I was killed
in a clash.

743
01:11:39,142 --> 01:11:41,372
That's why I'm not blindfolded.

744
01:11:44,146 --> 01:11:46,478
Don't worry!

745
01:11:49,585 --> 01:11:51,075
Bye, Osvaldo.

746
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:52,987
Come here.

747
01:11:53,923 --> 01:11:59,191
Remember: "The makers
of revolutions are the people,

748
01:11:59,896 --> 01:12:01,887
not individuals."

749
01:12:02,299 --> 01:12:04,164
I'll remember.

750
01:12:38,601 --> 01:12:39,966
Claudia.

751
01:12:45,341 --> 01:12:46,899
You're so thin.

752
01:12:48,244 --> 01:12:49,734
I look horrible.

753
01:12:50,279 --> 01:12:52,008
No, you look pretty.

754
01:12:53,415 --> 01:12:55,440
Remember I said I liked you?

755
01:12:57,553 --> 01:12:59,078
I like you even more.

756
01:13:00,891 --> 01:13:02,256
Liar...

757
01:13:02,526 --> 01:13:05,051
No, it's true.

758
01:13:05,728 --> 01:13:08,492
- Thank you, Pablo.
- Why?

759
01:13:09,765 --> 01:13:13,633
I thought... well...
if you want...

760
01:13:13,769 --> 01:13:15,532
when we're out...

761
01:13:15,604 --> 01:13:17,299
We'll never get out.

762
01:13:17,973 --> 01:13:21,170
Yes, we will.

763
01:13:22,378 --> 01:13:27,145
I'd like to go outwith you.

764
01:13:33,823 --> 01:13:35,791
I have nothing to give.

765
01:13:36,292 --> 01:13:39,022
Why? Don't say that!

766
01:13:39,762 --> 01:13:41,593
- A guard.
- Be careful.

767
01:14:13,796 --> 01:14:15,661
You guys stink!

768
01:14:16,765 --> 01:14:18,164
You... out!

769
01:14:26,342 --> 01:14:27,604
Silence!

770
01:14:40,923 --> 01:14:42,185
You!

771
01:14:53,969 --> 01:14:55,300
Dry up!

772
01:15:16,425 --> 01:15:20,156
So you're a wise guy.
Trying to peep, huh?

773
01:15:21,063 --> 01:15:22,928
We're no fools either.

774
01:15:33,309 --> 01:15:34,970
What an idiot, Pablo!

775
01:15:37,279 --> 01:15:39,304
I can't stand it anymore!

776
01:15:41,784 --> 01:15:43,684
Remember there are pardons...

777
01:15:43,953 --> 01:15:45,545
for Christmas, surely.

778
01:15:45,688 --> 01:15:48,213
Leave me alone!

779
01:15:51,593 --> 01:15:54,652
Don't touch me!

780
01:15:55,663 --> 01:15:57,096
Let go of her!

781
01:15:57,165 --> 01:15:58,530
Leave her alone!

782
01:15:58,666 --> 01:16:00,429
Stop it, please!

783
01:16:04,873 --> 01:16:06,340
Drop dead, you crazy bitch!

784
01:16:06,442 --> 01:16:08,774
I want to die!

785
01:16:09,745 --> 01:16:12,578
Stop, please...

786
01:16:13,649 --> 01:16:16,277
I want to die!
I want to die!

787
01:16:17,186 --> 01:16:18,778
Stop it, María Clara!

788
01:16:18,921 --> 01:16:20,820
I want to die!

789
01:16:22,156 --> 01:16:23,851
Please, stop it.

790
01:16:27,195 --> 01:16:30,255
I want to die.
I want to die.

791
01:16:41,577 --> 01:16:45,570
The Armed Forces know
nothing about your children.

792
01:16:49,017 --> 01:16:50,609
Tell us the truth.

793
01:16:50,718 --> 01:16:53,516
Madam, you don't know
what your son was up to.

794
01:16:53,621 --> 01:16:55,179
Captain, they're just kids.

795
01:16:55,256 --> 01:16:58,851
So what?
You don't know the UES,

796
01:16:58,926 --> 01:17:00,917
the Che Guevara Youth,
the GESA.

797
01:17:01,029 --> 01:17:04,965
They're the hotbeds
of subversion,

798
01:17:05,033 --> 01:17:07,195
the guerrilla's logistic support.

799
01:17:08,337 --> 01:17:09,895
I don't understand.

800
01:17:10,372 --> 01:17:13,933
First you know nothing,
now they're subversive.

801
01:17:14,576 --> 01:17:16,304
Don't misunderstand me.

802
01:17:16,611 --> 01:17:18,374
Your daughter has probably
gone underground...

803
01:17:18,446 --> 01:17:22,041
or abroad, it's quite common.

804
01:17:22,116 --> 01:17:23,743
I know my daughter.

805
01:17:25,153 --> 01:17:27,587
She'd get in touch with me.

806
01:17:29,223 --> 01:17:30,690
I know her.

807
01:17:30,758 --> 01:17:33,454
That'll be all.
Good day.

808
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:39,692
Ivana?

809
01:17:41,203 --> 01:17:42,636
I prefer Patricia.

810
01:17:42,704 --> 01:17:44,500
It's old fashioned.

811
01:17:44,972 --> 01:17:46,530
So? It's cute.

812
01:17:46,641 --> 01:17:47,972
It's horrible.

813
01:17:48,309 --> 01:17:51,745
- Laura? - An old witch
I know is called Laura.

814
01:17:53,781 --> 01:17:55,146
It'll be a boy.

815
01:17:57,452 --> 01:17:59,249
It hurts.

816
01:18:00,021 --> 01:18:01,921
Relax.

817
01:18:03,057 --> 01:18:05,116
It'll soon be over.

818
01:18:05,193 --> 01:18:08,630
When it's born,
they'll let you go.

819
01:18:11,066 --> 01:18:17,004
Yes, they promised
they'd let me keep it.

820
01:18:20,374 --> 01:18:23,070
At a farm.

821
01:18:25,813 --> 01:18:27,246
It hurts!

822
01:18:27,348 --> 01:18:30,875
Some midwife you have.

823
01:18:31,119 --> 01:18:33,246
Not you, klutz!

824
01:18:33,921 --> 01:18:35,684
It hurts!

825
01:18:36,524 --> 01:18:38,186
It's the contractions.

826
01:18:38,393 --> 01:18:40,587
- Do something!
- Do what?

827
01:18:43,698 --> 01:18:46,565
It's coming! Help me!

828
01:18:47,235 --> 01:18:50,363
- What do I do?
- Take it easy.

829
01:18:50,805 --> 01:18:55,208
It hurts!
Help me, it's coming!

830
01:18:57,345 --> 01:18:59,176
What do I do, Eugenia?

831
01:18:59,747 --> 01:19:03,444
Easy. Count the contractions.

832
01:19:04,585 --> 01:19:06,416
- What?
- Count them!

833
01:19:06,621 --> 01:19:08,019
How?

834
01:19:08,555 --> 01:19:11,081
Somebody call the guards!

835
01:19:11,325 --> 01:19:13,384
Quickly! The guards!

836
01:19:13,661 --> 01:19:16,357
Guards! Guards!

837
01:19:20,134 --> 01:19:23,365
The baby's coming, guards!

838
01:19:23,504 --> 01:19:25,665
Make the guards come!

839
01:19:30,344 --> 01:19:32,175
The guards, please!

840
01:19:34,981 --> 01:19:37,040
Relax, we're taking you.

841
01:19:41,289 --> 01:19:43,086
Good luck, Moni!

842
01:20:31,805 --> 01:20:35,263
The Archbishop cannot see you.
His secretary will.

843
01:20:39,412 --> 01:20:41,175
Did you mention my name?

844
01:20:41,682 --> 01:20:44,947
When my husband was Mayor...

845
01:20:45,386 --> 01:20:48,082
the Archbishop asked
him some favors.

846
01:20:48,456 --> 01:20:53,189
An Archbishop sees
so many people.

847
01:20:56,330 --> 01:20:57,888
Well...

848
01:20:58,398 --> 01:21:04,268
as it'll soon be Christmas
we thought the Church...

849
01:21:05,005 --> 01:21:06,666
Tell me.

850
01:21:06,740 --> 01:21:12,042
Your children were taken away
on September 16th?

851
01:21:13,447 --> 01:21:15,312
Yes.

852
01:21:18,552 --> 01:21:20,952
Accept it with
Christian resignation, ladies.

853
01:21:22,590 --> 01:21:24,251
You'll never see them again.

854
01:21:25,293 --> 01:21:26,816
What?

855
01:21:29,729 --> 01:21:31,287
What's that?

856
01:21:32,032 --> 01:21:33,863
I can't deceive you.

857
01:21:34,134 --> 01:21:35,931
There must be a mistake.

858
01:21:36,236 --> 01:21:38,204
There's no mistake.

859
01:21:38,271 --> 01:21:40,501
Only God is infallible.
It can't be.

860
01:21:41,141 --> 01:21:43,075
Aterrible injustice.

861
01:21:43,177 --> 01:21:45,202
Accept the facts.

862
01:21:46,213 --> 01:21:47,908
They won't be back.

863
01:22:18,312 --> 01:22:19,779
For you.

864
01:22:28,521 --> 01:22:30,045
Blockheads!

865
01:22:30,557 --> 01:22:32,525
Think of yourfamilies.

866
01:22:33,526 --> 01:22:36,552
It's Christmas Eve.

867
01:22:47,041 --> 01:22:50,203
Claudia, will you pray with me?

868
01:22:51,678 --> 01:22:53,669
- Will it help you?
- Yes.

869
01:22:54,581 --> 01:22:56,014
All right.

870
01:22:56,116 --> 01:22:57,811
<i>Why pray?</i>

871
01:22:57,917 --> 01:23:00,181
If God existed,
he'd get us out.

872
01:23:00,253 --> 01:23:01,948
He's too busy.

873
01:23:02,188 --> 01:23:03,780
What?

874
01:23:04,324 --> 01:23:07,191
Either that, or he's a fascist.

875
01:23:07,594 --> 01:23:09,186
Don't say that.

876
01:23:09,262 --> 01:23:11,230
Don't argue.

877
01:23:12,165 --> 01:23:13,996
Let's sing something together.

878
01:23:14,868 --> 01:23:16,461
Come on, Claudia.

879
01:23:17,637 --> 01:23:19,264
If we all sing.

880
01:23:19,873 --> 01:23:21,670
I'll sing if I know the lyrics.

881
01:23:21,741 --> 01:23:24,107
Haven't you learned them yet?

882
01:23:24,978 --> 01:23:27,503
<i>Behind the walls</i>

883
01:23:27,580 --> 01:23:31,516
<i>that were risen yesterday</i>

884
01:23:32,185 --> 01:23:37,623
<i>I beg you to keep breathing</i>

885
01:23:39,092 --> 01:23:45,189
<i>I lean on my back and
wait for your embrace</i>

886
01:23:45,664 --> 01:23:50,967
<i>through the wall
of my days.</i>

887
01:23:51,738 --> 01:23:58,007
<i>And scratch the stones,
scratch the stones...</i>

888
01:23:58,845 --> 01:24:05,978
<i>scratch the stones
until you get to me.</i>

889
01:24:20,467 --> 01:24:22,594
Let's make a toast.

890
01:24:24,604 --> 01:24:28,665
To our families...
and to freedom.

891
01:24:29,375 --> 01:24:30,501
To us.

892
01:24:32,312 --> 01:24:33,540
To us.

893
01:24:33,613 --> 01:24:35,080
To us...

894
01:24:36,049 --> 01:24:37,209
but free.

895
01:24:37,317 --> 01:24:39,080
Here's to Mum...

896
01:24:39,953 --> 01:24:41,749
to Dad...

897
01:24:43,021 --> 01:24:44,750
and to Jorge.

898
01:25:09,381 --> 01:25:11,178
He's in bad shape.

899
01:25:16,221 --> 01:25:19,350
Don't open your eyes.

900
01:25:26,132 --> 01:25:29,795
Let's see if you're a man.

901
01:25:42,581 --> 01:25:45,744
Don't look.

902
01:25:55,562 --> 01:25:59,623
Let's see.

903
01:26:00,266 --> 01:26:02,461
C'mon... men don't cry.

904
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:06,094
Some photo we'll take.

905
01:26:06,371 --> 01:26:09,499
- Shall I comb him?
- Don't be a fool.

906
01:26:10,809 --> 01:26:12,777
Put that away!

907
01:26:14,179 --> 01:26:15,737
Is he ready?

908
01:26:31,831 --> 01:26:33,161
Don't open your eyes.

909
01:26:36,335 --> 01:26:41,238
Look kid,
you're with the NEP now.

910
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:43,635
- What?
- Say "sir".

911
01:26:43,709 --> 01:26:45,609
He's a Lieutenant Colonel.

912
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:50,443
You're going to live.

913
01:26:53,386 --> 01:26:58,187
We'll take you away
but I'm warning you...

914
01:26:59,092 --> 01:27:01,651
and I want it to be crystal clear.

915
01:27:02,127 --> 01:27:04,357
You must forget everything.

916
01:27:04,963 --> 01:27:08,296
Better still,
you were never here.

917
01:27:09,334 --> 01:27:11,097
Understand?

918
01:27:14,973 --> 01:27:20,741
The bastards!
Who do they think they are?

919
01:27:27,653 --> 01:27:30,019
Remember, you're leaving tonight.

920
01:27:38,130 --> 01:27:40,121
Horacio, what's the NEP?

921
01:27:40,999 --> 01:27:43,058
- Why?
- What about the NEP, Pablo?

922
01:27:43,735 --> 01:27:45,498
I'm with the NEP now.

923
01:27:46,204 --> 01:27:48,798
Then you're legalized.

924
01:27:49,107 --> 01:27:52,167
It's the National Executive Power.

925
01:27:52,511 --> 01:27:54,480
Now you're legally arrested.

926
01:27:55,148 --> 01:27:56,774
That's wonderful!

927
01:27:57,015 --> 01:28:00,678
I told you, blockheads,
they'd let you out.

928
01:28:01,353 --> 01:28:03,617
No, we'll be killed.

929
01:28:04,222 --> 01:28:05,814
No, no!

930
01:28:09,327 --> 01:28:12,160
Claudia, can you hear me?

931
01:28:14,533 --> 01:28:16,262
Claudia!

932
01:28:36,555 --> 01:28:37,715
Let's go.

933
01:28:46,098 --> 01:28:47,258
Wait!

934
01:28:47,733 --> 01:28:49,257
I have to see Claudia.

935
01:28:50,268 --> 01:28:53,566
Please, before I leave.

936
01:28:54,038 --> 01:28:55,734
OK, only a minute.

937
01:28:56,308 --> 01:28:57,866
Or they'll kill me.

938
01:29:09,154 --> 01:29:10,883
Look at me.

939
01:29:15,127 --> 01:29:16,526
Remember me.

940
01:29:18,963 --> 01:29:21,227
I never tortured you or anything.

941
01:29:23,134 --> 01:29:24,658
It's my job.

942
01:29:26,270 --> 01:29:29,763
I treated you like a human being.

943
01:29:52,263 --> 01:29:56,222
Don't cry.
They'll let you out too.

944
01:29:58,303 --> 01:29:59,964
You're leaving?

945
01:30:02,741 --> 01:30:04,299
Listen...

946
01:30:05,677 --> 01:30:07,577
you'll all get out.

947
01:30:08,814 --> 01:30:10,372
No.

948
01:30:11,850 --> 01:30:13,875
We're going to be killed.

949
01:30:14,385 --> 01:30:15,943
Don't say that.

950
01:30:16,821 --> 01:30:18,584
Go see my parents.

951
01:30:19,557 --> 01:30:21,457
Tell them I'm fine.

952
01:30:23,027 --> 01:30:24,585
Sure, I will.

953
01:30:25,763 --> 01:30:27,958
What about us?

954
01:30:30,368 --> 01:30:33,633
Will you be my girl
when you're out?

955
01:30:37,676 --> 01:30:40,543
I was raped in Arana...

956
01:30:42,613 --> 01:30:45,878
When they tortured me.

957
01:30:46,016 --> 01:30:49,144
They raped me front...

958
01:30:49,687 --> 01:30:51,985
and back.

959
01:30:52,056 --> 01:30:54,251
I've nothing to give you.

960
01:30:54,792 --> 01:30:56,589
Claudia...

961
01:30:57,962 --> 01:31:00,329
Who will I talk to now?

962
01:31:02,534 --> 01:31:04,365
You'll be out too.

963
01:31:04,669 --> 01:31:07,365
We're already dead.

964
01:31:09,507 --> 01:31:11,531
On New Year's Eve...

965
01:31:12,910 --> 01:31:15,037
drink to us.

966
01:31:18,249 --> 01:31:19,944
C'mon, Pablo.

967
01:31:21,385 --> 01:31:24,821
Don't forget me... Pablo!

968
01:31:26,457 --> 01:31:27,947
Goodbye, Pablo!

969
01:31:28,058 --> 01:31:29,582
Bye.

970
01:31:30,896 --> 01:31:32,557
Good luck, Pablo!

971
01:31:34,065 --> 01:31:35,965
I'll be seeing you outside!

972
01:31:36,067 --> 01:31:38,091
<i>See me at the café!</i>

973
01:31:39,103 --> 01:31:40,730
<i>Take care!</i>

974
01:31:41,071 --> 01:31:43,471
Pablo!

975
01:31:43,874 --> 01:31:44,608
You'll all be free!

976
01:31:44,608 --> 01:31:46,439
You'll all be free!

977
01:31:46,510 --> 01:31:50,344
They'll let you go... they will!

978
01:31:51,548 --> 01:31:57,721
ON DECEMBER 28, 1976, PABLO DIAZ
WAS PLACED IN CUSTODY
OF THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE POWER...

979
01:31:57,721 --> 01:32:03,388
ACCUSED OF HAVING BEEN CAUGHT THAT
VERY DAY DISTRIBUTING SUBVERSIVE LEAFLETS.

980
01:32:04,296 --> 01:32:08,026
HE WAS IN PRISION FOR ALMOST FOUR YEARS
WTHOUT A TRIAL AND WAS SET FREE
ON NOVEMBER 19, 1980.

01:32:39,763 --> 01:32:42,960
ARE STILL MISSING.

986
