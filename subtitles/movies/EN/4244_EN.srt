1
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,037
First Avenue, Kabuki-cho

2
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,837
- Are you sure, Mr Fujiwara?
- You know what the boss said.

3
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,639
He doesn't need a bodyguard.

4
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,110
At least not in the apartment.

5
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,238
But why not let me keep
a look-out outside his door?

6
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,470
While he's fucking a girl?

7
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,029
That's not what I mean.

8
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,320
You're only a bodyguard, so just
shut the fuck up until you're needed.

9
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,794
Hello.

10
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,552
Is that you, Takeshi?

11
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,757
You're coming home soon, aren't you?

12
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,071
You're not leaving too, are you?

13
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,993
No Takeshi, I won't leave you.
I'm at work.

14
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,754
- I'll call back later.
- Dad, Dad...

15
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,599
Tadanobu Asano

16
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,117
Hideo Yamamoto

17
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,519
Takashi Miike

18
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,431
Stop it. No!

19
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,839
No!

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,956
Cut it out.

21
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,148
No.

22
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,673
Stop.

23
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,712
How does that feel?

24
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,194
Who's there? Who the hell...!

25
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:34,910
Ichi The Killer

26
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,353
It's me,

27
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,030
- Inoue, don't!
- I thought I'd strengthen my resolve

28
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,033
No need.
Ichi will take care of everything.

29
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,993
Lately we only go in
to clean up after Ichi.

30
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,639
Found it.

31
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,117
I thought I told you to quit.

32
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,159
What the hell?

33
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,676
If I can't shoot up,
you can't use my phone.

34
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,793
Let's go.

35
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,234
He did it again. As gross as ever.

36
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,475
What's this guy Ichi like, anyway?

37
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,956
Let's get started.

38
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,551
What the hell happened here?

39
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,513
You were guarding
the boss last night.

40
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,672
- So was Kaneko.
- Don't try and pass the blame.

41
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,832
Sorry. My apologies.

42
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,554
Mr Kaneko,
any idea where he might be?

43
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,830
Has Anjo really disappeared?

44
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,310
How much money is missing?

45
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,878
About 3 million yen.

46
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,033
Then I guess Anjo took the money...
and ran off with the girl.

47
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:57,473
Sir, the boss
would never do such a thing. Never.

48
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:04,273
All that time he spent in jail...
must have softened his brain.

49
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,353
A guy grows old
gets obsessed with a broad

50
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,916
and can't even tell
his ass from a hole in the ground.

51
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,913
Probably some other gang
is behind it, sir.

52
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,469
There are many who bear us a grudge.

53
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,154
It's not Anjo who made enemies.
You did.

54
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,359
The boss is not dead.

55
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,359
Please excuse us.

56
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,799
- Don't you have a girlfriend?
- No. It gets lonely, you know.

57
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,078
- Why don't you get yourself a pet?
- I used to have an alligator

58
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,835
but they get hard to handle
so I flushed it down the toilet.

59
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,718
I see.

60
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,478
- What kind?
- A mongrel.

61
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,676
He was so cute.

62
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,229
But this bloke next door...

63
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,155
He made fun of it.

64
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,276
So I started praying.

65
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,034
Welcome.

66
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,555
- Is Karen here?
- She's there. Follow me.

67
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,631
- My wish was fulfilled.
- Really?

68
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,877
It died.

69
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,037
It did?

70
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,790
C'mon, have another.

71
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,916
- Masa.
- Did you hear?

72
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,997
The boss has disappeared.

73
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,272
If he ran off at all
it would've been with you.

74
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,317
Another gang have got him.

75
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,871
What are you going to do now?

76
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,549
He's not dead. I'll find him.

77
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,391
Yes, I'm sure you will.

78
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,231
Don't fool with me, Karen.

79
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,356
He's alive. I'm dead sure of it.

80
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,715
He's just waiting for me to find him.

81
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,758
Yeah, but...

82
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,316
You're the boss's woman.

83
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,357
What are you talking about?

84
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,393
I'm sorry.

85
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,392
- It's my birthday.
- Today's your birthday?

86
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,916
- Then this is your present.
- I thought I told you to quit.

87
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,678
Kakihara of the Anjo gang.

88
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,109
Murder, arson, smuggling and rape.

89
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,876
How have you been?

90
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,196
So you're back in Shinjuku, huh?

91
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,750
This is the only place...
where guys like us can make a living.

92
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,434
Did you hear
what happened at our place?

93
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,039
More or less.

94
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,670
When you hear anything,
I want to know. There'll be a reward.

95
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,398
I see.

96
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,833
Kill yourself.

97
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,759
I'm sorry.

98
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,352
I can't hear you.

99
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,990
Hurry up and die. Hurry up and die.

100
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,639
I'm sorry.

101
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,394
I have no use
for your stupid apologies.

102
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,919
Stop crying.

103
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,310
You can shed all the tears you want.

104
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,437
I'll only forgive you
when you're dead.

105
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,634
You stupid son of a bitch.

106
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,634
I don't want to hear
that you haven't found him yet.

107
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,518
Give me that.

108
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,116
I want you
to turn Shinjuku inside out

109
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,910
until you find the boss!
Don't show your face until you do.

110
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,513
Chief, so far
we haven't found any clues.

111
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,871
That doesn't mean, of course...
that I've abandoned all hope.

112
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,315
I'll find him. Just leave it to me.

113
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,359
I'll get it.

114
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,470
It's just a rumour.

115
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,710
Hard to say how much of it is true.

116
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,149
But the Funakis belong to
the Sanko syndicate, just like us.

117
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,595
They even share the building with us.

118
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,558
Exactly.
That way they can keep tabs...

119
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,472
on who's coming and going.

120
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,950
- They probably staked out your boss.
- Why do that?

121
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,192
Well, Mr Kakihara...
three years ago you yourself

122
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,478
cut Mr Suzuki of the Funaki family
out of a porn video sales racket.

123
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,552
Word has it that he hasn't forgotten.

124
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,513
So, you think Suzuki
is behind all this?

125
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,797
It's only a rumour.

126
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,555
But behind your back
Mr Suzuki is bad-mouthing you.

127
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,712
He's spread
some pretty ridiculous stories.

128
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:50,032
Such as that
you had a crush on boss Anjo.

129
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,153
What the hell are you talking about?

130
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,198
Takayama, bring him here.

131
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,992
Bring who?

132
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,071
Suzuki, of course.

133
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,639
But...

134
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,995
You got cold feet?

135
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,276
That's not the problem.

136
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,317
We don't have any proof.

137
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,871
Since when do you care about proof?

138
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,918
If he lies
we'll give his corpse to Funaki.

139
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,391
Get on with it, Takayama.

140
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,429
OK.

141
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,593
Jijii, go buy some shrimps.

142
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,398
Shrimps?

143
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,988
Kakihara?

144
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,599
Tempura?

145
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,478
What the hell's going on here?

146
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:30,116
Kakihara! What the fuck is this?

147
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,999
You look fantastic, Mr Suzuki.

148
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,239
Where is the boss?

149
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,598
The boss? You mean Anjo?

150
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,912
He and that girl bolted.
Made off with your money, right?

151
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,349
I don't get what you say.

152
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,512
Wait. Stop, damn it!

153
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,309
You think I took boss Anjo?

154
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,952
I know you're pissed off because
I dealt you out of that video deal.

155
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,953
You've been going around
bad-mouthing us.

156
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,712
No, I haven't.

157
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,474
Yes, you have.
Ain't that right, Jijii?

158
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,710
Who the hell are you?

159
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,714
You say you didn't dub adult videos
behind Mr Kakihara's back?

160
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,917
That proves you can't be trusted.

161
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,878
OK, it's true about the videos.
I'll admit that.

162
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,554
But I know nothing about your boss.

163
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,676
You have to believe me, please.

164
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,640
I'll ask you again.
Where is the boss?

165
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,996
I don't know. I really have no idea.

166
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,636
- Chief, that's too...
- Wait.

167
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,430
Hey, wait!

168
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,199
I wonder how Jijii managed
to get a camera and a mike in there?

169
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,669
- I put them there.
- You did?

170
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:59,550
Jijii talked me into it before
I was kicked out of the Anjo gang.

171
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,589
So you were buddies with Kakihara?

172
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,309
He wouldn't recognise me now.
I had a face job.

173
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,752
Plastic surgery?

174
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,991
Why did you choose this face?

175
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,633
Shut up!

176
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,431
Right, I have to make a call.

177
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,311
You about ready to come clean?

178
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,356
I'm going to kill all of you.

179
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,477
Once again. Where is the boss?

180
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,192
How would I know?

181
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,238
Somebody's already killed him!

182
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,272
He's still alive.

183
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,759
So what?

184
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,515
If you won't talk,
maybe your little one will.

185
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,989
No. Don't do that.

186
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:17,438
Give me a break, damn it! I'll do
anything you want if you just stop.

187
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,839
What the hell?

188
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,832
Is that you, Suzuki?

189
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,636
Kakihara! What the fuck
do you think you are doing?

190
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,832
Just a little torture.

191
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,958
- What did Suzuki do?
- Don't!

192
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,190
Put that back, Mr Kaneko.

193
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,752
Who the hell are you?

194
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,913
You tell us first
what you are doing here, Mr Funaki.

195
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,312
Someone called to say Suzuki
was in big trouble with your gang.

196
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,996
He thinks I kidnapped his boss.

197
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,833
Suzuki would never
do such a stupid thing.

198
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,433
Let him go.

199
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,114
- In this together, are you?
- What?

200
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,957
We were tipped off
that Suzuki had taken the boss.

201
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,031
By who?

202
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,633
That guy there.

203
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,074
- Well, who?
- That guy Jijii.

204
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,872
What guy?

205
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,671
You! Go and find him!

206
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,434
Hello.

207
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,272
So you came back.

208
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,711
You are the only one

209
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,435
who enjoys seeing a girl's body
all black-and-blue.

210
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,679
How...?

211
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,039
What do you mean, 'how'?

212
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,158
Tell me about the beating
you got yesterday?

213
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,072
What do you mean?

214
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,719
Did it hurt?

215
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,391
I thought I was going to die.

216
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,712
The bastard. I wish he would die.

217
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,869
Die...

218
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,271
Yes, I wish he would die.

219
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,439
Shall I kill him for you?

220
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,354
- Ten million yen?
- No, you idiot. A hundred million!

221
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,159
That seems like a fair sum.

222
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,992
We don't have that much.

223
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:57,438
So hand the video business over to us
and that'll settle the matter.

224
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,433
All of our money
disappeared with the boss.

225
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,070
Take our video business too
and we'll have to fold.

226
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,629
You think
I'd let you off that easily?

227
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:13,199
Throw this guy out of the syndicate.
That makes it a lot easier.

228
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,998
Maybe you're right.

229
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,712
I'll make a sincere apology.

230
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,070
This is not a matter
of cutting one or two fingers.

231
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,993
- I have a taste for sweet things.
- So what?

232
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,436
To apologise,
I'll cut my source of pleasure.

233
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,238
What do you mean?

234
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,959
Ka-en?

235
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,914
All right, I'm on my way.

236
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,394
I'm going to look for the boss.

237
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,588
Boss!

238
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,196
I had to stop at the hospital.

239
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,431
The hospital?

240
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,879
That's disgusting.

241
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,513
Look, it's amazing.

242
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,870
It's all right.
The human body regenerates itself.

243
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,395
If I keep talking it'll get better.

244
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,759
Who is it?

245
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,150
It's Karen, from the Hirando club.

246
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,639
Good morning.

247
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,472
Have you heard from him?

248
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,396
I don't owe you a thing
so why should I tell you anything?

249
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,313
If you're not here to score,
just fuck off.

250
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,033
How dare you come here empty-handed
and ask me for a favour.

251
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,430
Who the hell do you think you are?

252
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,192
This is Kakihara.

253
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,477
The guy with the body piercings
from the Anjo gang.

254
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,631
Hey, who said you could come in?

255
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,471
I don't care who he is.

256
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,234
I don't associate
with the likes of you.

257
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,952
The boss is going to die.

258
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,709
What's this guy talking about?

259
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,155
If I don't hurry, the boss will die.

260
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,795
Like I said, if you're not here
to score you're in the way.

261
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,552
So get the hell out. Scram!

262
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,198
Do you know
what'll happen if he dies?

263
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:10,153
Jijii, hurry back here
and give me a hit.

264
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,315
He was already in there
when we arrived.

265
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,153
I taped it up
in case he tries to escape.

266
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,232
Where's the boss, Jijii?

267
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,999
What's this?

268
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,112
That's our office.

269
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,273
Look what I found.

270
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,919
Boss Anjo...

271
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,397
So you guys kidnapped him.

272
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,598
Where is boss Anjo?

273
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,190
I'll tell you
if you shoot me up first.

274
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,515
I'm asking you. Where's the boss?

275
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,271
He's long dead and buried.

276
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:45,276
If I'm not getting a shot then hurry
up and kill me, brother Kakihara.

277
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,999
Who are you?

278
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,957
I know your methods.
If you're going to kill me anyway

279
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,829
just get it over with,
brother Kakihara.

280
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,998
Kano?

281
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,513
Jackpot.

282
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,834
Kano?

283
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,234
Are you Kano?

284
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,118
But your face is different.

285
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,792
So you killed the boss?

286
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,155
It was Ichi who did it.

287
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,992
Who is this 'lchi'?

288
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,799
I only cleaned up after him.

289
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,750
It seems that Ichi's next target
is you, brother Kakihara.

290
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,629
You had the hots for Anjo,
didn't you?

291
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:44,396
Not because you're queer
or because you admired his balls.

292
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:49,075
It was because you relished
the pain that he inflicted

293
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,673
when he beat you up.

294
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:55,994
That's why you want
to find him so badly.

295
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,639
Am I right?

296
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,554
You need him to hurt you again.

297
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,640
Kakihara,
I'm going to get you for this.

298
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,791
I'll never forget what you did.

299
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,034
I'm going to kill you, you bastard.

300
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,309
What did you do with the girl?

301
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,235
He asked where Anjo's girl is.

302
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,473
The girl?

303
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,359
We want the girl
you took along with Anjo.

304
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,311
Return her to us right now.

305
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,233
Wait a minute.

306
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,834
You're also making a mistake.

307
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,551
We'll kill you. If you don't say
something, we'll kill the whole gang.

308
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,594
Will you listen, damn it?
I didn't do it.

309
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,637
I've got nothing to do with it.

310
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,916
I'm innocent.

311
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,713
Believe me, please.

312
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,597
Ask somebody else, please.

313
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,069
- Time is running out.
- Time's up.

314
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,118
What do you mean?

315
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,793
We'll cut you here.

316
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,632
It won't hurt much.

317
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,357
No, please. Help!

318
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,914
Hello?

319
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,232
I understand.

320
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,992
Someone says he saw a man with
a torn mouth attack Anjo's office.

321
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,757
That's Kakihara. I knew it!

322
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,990
I can't breathe in this mask.

323
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,796
I should've cut the eyes
a little higher.

324
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,916
It fogs up when I breathe.

325
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,038
Hi Myu-Myu. How are you?

326
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,839
- This is it?
- Stop it!

327
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,269
- You know what I'm saying?
- Stop hitting me!

328
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,955
Tell me.

329
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,829
You can suck dicks, you have a cunt
and this is all you earn?

330
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,108
How can I get clients
if you keep busting my face?

331
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,838
Shut up, you bitch!

332
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,598
How does that feel?

333
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,159
Who the fuck are you?

334
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,876
Come in here, you little shit.

335
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,272
What the fuck are you doing?
Are you some kind of pervert?

336
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,391
What the fuck is this costume?

337
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,993
Say something.

338
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,752
Can't you talk, asshole?

339
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,114
I'm sorry.

340
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,029
I'm sorry.

341
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,589
Don't bullshit me saying 'I'm sorry'.

342
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,033
Why are you crying?

343
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,795
- I'm not crying.
- Yes, you are.

344
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,674
- No, I'm not.
- I can see it.

345
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,838
- You're fucking crying!
- No, I'm not!

346
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,191
What the fuck?

347
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,514
What did you do?

348
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:30,037
I killed him for you.

349
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:47,270
I promised I'd kill him for you.

350
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,352
But don't worry.

351
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,996
From now on I'll beat you up.

352
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,275
You'll beat me up instead?

353
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,159
Thank you.

354
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,708
Kakihara, you are expelled
from the Syndicate.

355
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,315
The Syndicate came to this decision

356
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,474
due to the arrogance shown
in your actions and those of your men

357
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,791
during the search for Anjo,
your torture of Suzuki

358
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:16,149
and your refusal
to bargain with Funaki.

359
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,918
Have you anything to say?

360
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,111
Are you listening?

361
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,754
Kakihara!

362
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,517
Is that all you wanted to say?

363
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,039
I guess so.

364
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,756
Then I thank you for everything.

365
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,752
That was a piece of cake.

366
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,638
Hey, Suzuki.

367
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,833
Are you sure
we're doing the right thing?

368
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,993
It's strange
the way he took it lying down.

369
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,116
You think he's bent on revenge?

370
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,798
- I forgot to mention one thing.
- What?

371
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,190
I'm taking over the Anjo gang.

372
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,077
So we've been expelled?

373
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,159
That's right.

374
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,595
Every yakuza in Shinjuku is after us.

375
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,149
Whoever wants out, better say now.

376
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:55,479
I'm sorry.
I'd like to hand back the sake cup

377
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,957
- With which I pledged allegiance.
- Do you, now?

378
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,476
They expelled Kakihara.

379
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,839
Where's the money?

380
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,949
- I've put half into the account.
- Only half? That wasn't the deal.

381
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:09,556
I'll deposit the rest
when you've carried out our deal.

382
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,111
3 million yen is a lot of money.

383
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,431
What if you blow it?

384
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,157
In the next three or four days

385
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:25,438
you kick everyone out
of that yakuza apartment.

386
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,672
They'll only get in the way.
Can you do it alone?

387
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,639
Don't worry.

388
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,472
I'll get on it right away!

389
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,318
Make sure you squash Kakihara,
good and proper.

390
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,836
Where are you going?
What do you want me to do?

391
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,755
Just wait here. Don't move.

392
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:37,989
Ichi...

393
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,634
Ichi!

394
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:07,511
I dreamt about Ms Tachibana.

395
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,913
Who helped you when they bullied you?
The girl that got raped?

396
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:19,390
When they raped her
she cried for me to help her.

397
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:25,873
But my legs were shaking so violently
that I couldn't move.

398
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,114
I still dream
about how she cried out.

399
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:37,553
You wanted to save Ms Tachibana
so badly?

400
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,672
I felt like raping her.

401
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,155
Surely you wanted to save her?

402
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,877
She wanted me to rape her.

403
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,719
Ichi! Open your eyes, damn it!

404
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,874
Why would Sailor
do such a thing to me?

405
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,912
Who are you talking about?

406
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,314
Why would Sailor
do such a thing to me?

407
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,637
Get a grip on yourself, Ichi.

408
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,475
Huh? What's the matter?

409
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,438
You've been expelled
from the Syndicate, haven't you?

410
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,915
Letting you in puts me in jeopardy.

411
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,390
Who do you think you're talking to?

412
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,474
That hurts.

413
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,438
Mr Kakihara, please stop.

414
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:30,350
You'll tear it off. It's stretching.

415
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,357
Karen, Karen!

416
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:39,717
Karen, do something, please!

417
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,393
Help me!

418
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,629
Karen!

419
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,952
Can I join in?

420
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:16,914
That hurts.
What the hell are you doing, Karen?

421
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,559
Masa, you know what?

422
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:27,599
What do you want?
I'll tell you everything.

423
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:02,115
Take off your shoes!
You're so fucking slow!

424
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,834
- Hurry up.
- Go and get it.

425
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,479
Get a move on.

426
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,549
- Hey, give it back to me.
- What?

427
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:22,636
Your father got fired from the police
because he lost his gun.

428
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,189
What an idiot.

429
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:26,918
He's as big an idiot as his dad.

430
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:29,799
Those guns are paid for
with tax money.

431
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:32,030
Give us our money back, asshole.

432
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,760
Hurry up and bring it back.

433
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,994
Hurry up and bring it back.

434
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,390
Can't you hear what I'm saying?

435
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:14,954
Hey, you.

436
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,833
Quit staring.

437
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,559
Get lost, you jerk.

438
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,956
You want to be my woman, don't you?

439
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:51,350
Then give it to me
like you did before.

440
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,790
- Does that hurt?
- Keep going.

441
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,559
Listen, when you're hurting someone

442
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:06,871
don't think of the pain
that he feels.

443
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:11,876
Only concentrate
on the pleasure of causing him pain.

444
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:17,114
That's the only way to show
true compassion for your partner.

445
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,514
It's OK.
Do it like you want to kill me.

446
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,750
The boss was a lot better at this.

447
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,953
That's enough.

448
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:10,398
You let me down.

449
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:15,638
Hey, come back!

450
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,910
These guys need to be killed.

451
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,636
Go in fast, and finish them off.

452
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:41,198
- I can't.
- Sure you can.

453
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:44,397
They're all bullies. They work for
the guy you killed before.

454
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:48,439
It's easy. Just go in
and do your thing.

455
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:53,037
- No way. There's too many of them.
- Come on.

456
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,350
You want revenge, don't you?

457
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:59,479
Weren't you going to rid the world
of all the bullies?

458
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:01,995
Those guys extort money
from the poor.

459
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,197
They beat up on the weak
and pretend to own the world.

460
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,078
Vengeance is yours.

461
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:12,034
See the guy with the shaved head?

462
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:15,875
Doesn't he look like
that kid lmamura...

463
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:19,589
who bullied you back in high school?

464
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,830
And isn't the guy next to him

465
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,560
the spitting image of that kid Tokito

466
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:28,156
who scribbled all over
your textbooks?

467
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,550
Well, Ichi?

468
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,791
He does look like him.

469
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,315
You must take revenge.

470
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,072
Killing is bad.

471
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,511
I told you not to worry.

472
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:35,194
They're just a big bunch of bullies.

473
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,079
The people I just killed

474
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,629
were not the ones
who used to bully me.

475
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,517
They're bad people.
Of course they had to die.

476
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,432
How did it feel today?

477
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,756
I don't want to kill any more.

478
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,315
Don't be a fool.

479
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:58,153
If you don't kill the bad guys,
who will?

480
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,151
I don't want to kill.

481
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,990
You'll go on killing, won't you?

482
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:09,310
I don't want to any more.

483
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,436
Kill the bad guys.

484
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,033
Kill.

485
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,949
Thank you for protecting me
back there.

486
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:02,717
What's wrong?

487
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,916
Are you all right?

488
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,991
What's your name?

489
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,236
Ichi.

490
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:18,032
We're friends, aren't we?

491
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,511
Shit.

492
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:07,997
What the hell happened?

493
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,794
Chief, what happened?

494
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,915
He showed up, finally.

495
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:22,190
Isn't this amazing.

496
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,237
I'm scared.

497
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,836
Hey, all of you! Don't run away!

498
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,673
Everyone is bolting.

499
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,231
You're not running?

500
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,716
Not until we avenge the boss.

501
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:46,510
Well...

502
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:51,151
This is really something.

503
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:00,193
Look at this.

504
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:03,875
The human body is made out of a
single tube like this.

505
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:06,476
I'm sorry, chief.

506
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,039
They've all gone.

507
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,509
Don't bother.

508
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:14,832
Takayama, call the East Shinjuku
police station.

509
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,437
- You're reporting this?
- No, I'll get them to help us.

510
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:19,674
I was being bullied when this strong
guy turned up and kicked their asses.

511
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:28,831
Teach me, too.

512
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:35,430
- Go back home.
- I'll grow strong and get revenge.

513
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,919
Takeshi.

514
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,116
Takeshi!

515
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:51,514
I'm on a very important job now.

516
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,993
It may be that one day
I won't be able to come home.

517
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:58,991
If something should happen to me,

518
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:02,789
promise me you'll go and live
with your mum.

519
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,474
I won't.

520
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:09,995
Don't worry.

521
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,315
I can take care of myself.

522
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:24,150
Takeshi.

523
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:31,190
What's taking you so long?
Go and find Ichi.

524
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,834
I don't know what he looks like.

525
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43,109
Find anyone who smells of blood.

526
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:47,678
Now go and get him!

527
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,754
What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

528
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:17,954
Got it?

529
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:20,873
First you puke all over
one of our girls

530
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:23,315
and then you say you've no money?

531
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:29,598
Who the fuck do you think you are?

532
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,671
Answer me, you bastard.

533
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:37,272
What's so funny?

534
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,829
Give us our money back right now.

535
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:43,875
Just sell off your kidneys.

536
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:48,438
As long as we get our money, asshole.

537
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,996
How much does he owe you?

538
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:57,314
Who the hell are you, anyway?

539
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,835
How much did he borrow?

540
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,433
500,000 yen.

541
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:07,437
- Who do you work for?
- None of your business.

542
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,516
Watch your mouth.

543
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,800
What are you looking at?

544
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:20,030
Hasn't he had enough?

545
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:28,996
In that case,
why don't you pay off his debts?

546
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:31,116
Watch out, or you'll get hurt.

547
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:34,272
- What gang are you with?
- The Anjo gang.

548
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:44,116
I don't know what backwater
you're from,

549
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:48,671
but you have "sitting duck"
written all over your forehead.

550
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:53,594
Aren't you Japanese?

551
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:56,518
Don't you understand
what I am saying?

552
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:03,952
Anyhow, get out of here.

553
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:08,831
Get a move on, I said.

554
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:35,479
Don't be shy. Eat up.

555
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:53,957
Boss Anjo, he's the cop
who lost his gun.

556
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:58,190
He became known as
an Olympic marksman.

557
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:07,871
You must be hungry.

558
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:09,598
Go ahead and eat.

559
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:18,633
Mom won't come back, will she?

560
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:27,392
She left you for another man.

561
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:38,313
But I'll always stay with you.

562
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:43,356
Stop jabbering and eat.

563
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:02,073
Where are you from? China?

564
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:07,070
This is no place for you.

565
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:08,992
You understand?

566
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:14,271
Don't be so jittery.
I'm not bullying you.

567
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:20,192
You remind me of myself
a long time ago.

568
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:26,359
The guy who picked me up
when I was down has been murdered.

569
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:31,514
He took me in when I drifted
with nowhere to go.

570
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:36,514
I must find his killers
and avenge him.

571
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:42,553
Eat up, or the noodles will go soft.

572
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,919
How are you feeling?

573
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:32,350
Where are we?

574
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:36,237
Seems you had bad dreams.

575
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:43,674
You'll find photos inside.

576
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:46,673
Taken of the biggest bullies.

577
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:58,837
The ones that bullied me?

578
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:03,234
Just like them.

579
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:08,520
They are even worse than the boys
who bullied you.

580
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:12,797
Those were not
the only bad people around.

581
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:16,873
The ones that stood by and did
nothing are even worse.

582
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:20,156
You must go after all of them.

583
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,709
That's why you grew strong, isn't it?

584
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,916
But...

585
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:28,991
Ms Tachibana tried to help me.

586
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:31,833
Back then you were too weak
to help her.

587
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:38,394
But now you are strong enough
to defeat all of them.

588
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,869
You can have your revenge.

589
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:44,878
Revenge...

590
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:49,029
You mean killing people?

591
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:51,993
Right.

592
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:56,359
I mean to kill.

593
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:00,877
- I don't want to kill any more.
- What?

594
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:05,794
I hate killing people.

595
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:11,719
Running away from things
will never make you a man!

596
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,633
My dick's hard.

597
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:38,517
- Since when?
- I don't know.

598
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:42,468
Why didn't you tell me?
lt'll start to rot.

599
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:50,833
That's what you get for not doing
what I tell you.

600
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:56,438
Take some tranquillizers.
They'll calm you down for a while.

601
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:09,234
What's wrong? Take the damn things.

602
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:13,756
I don't want to kill any more people.

603
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:17,276
We'll talk about that later.
Just take the damn pills.

604
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:19,317
No!

605
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:21,550
Ichi!

606
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:42,228
I've been a detective forever but
I've never seen anything like this.

607
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,960
Even you can't do that, brother.

608
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:49,116
I could, if I wanted to.

609
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:56,072
There's something inhuman
to this carnage.

610
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:59,550
Most people have a touch of both
sadism and masochism inside them

611
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:04,832
I can't wait to meet him.

612
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,514
But he'll come here anyway, won't he?

613
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:11,514
There's no pattern to it.
It's all just a game.

614
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:13,875
If I'm not ready to die
when he comes,

615
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:16,429
I'll become increasingly desperate.

616
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,830
But if I know he's coming,

617
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,719
I'll do all I can
to stop him from killing me.

618
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:25,509
So you will tell me where this Ichi
is even if you don't want to.

619
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:28,274
Do you have any clues?

620
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:32,353
Somebody I know stumbled upon
this Chinese pal of Ichi

621
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:35,592
who goes around pimping.

622
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:38,115
Find him
and you'll discover much more.

623
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,430
A Chinese pimp, huh?

624
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:43,433
I picked it up
from a girl in this club.

625
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,875
Well, big brother?

626
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:49,032
We can't turn down a request
from Kakihara, can we?

627
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:53,591
Without him we wouldn't even be
detectives. We owe him a lot.

628
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:56,069
We'll find that dickhead
soon enough.

629
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:59,550
There aren't so many
Chinese pimps around.

630
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:09,715
Hey, it's Kaneko.

631
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:13,919
Damned if it isn't. The cop
who got fired for losing his gun.

632
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:16,435
What are you doing here?

633
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:25,398
- I'm a gunman.
- You're kidding!

634
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:29,519
A guy loses his gun and next thing
you know, he becomes a gunman.

635
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:33,389
Are you? Really?

636
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:40,838
What are you waiting for?
Go find him.

637
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,912
I want to fuck, fuck, fuck.

638
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:58,957
No use.

639
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:08,199
Hello. Myu-Myu? It's me, Longie.

640
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:11,875
Can I come over right now?

641
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:24,435
Did you plant the information
about that girl?

642
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:26,511
I did.

643
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:29,240
Then it's only a matter of time...

644
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,436
before Long gets caught.

645
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:35,834
What happens next?

646
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,913
- Ichi is going through a bad patch.
- A bad patch?

647
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:44,153
He gets hard,
but he cannot ejaculate.

648
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:48,074
Really? That's weird.

649
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:52,119
Tell me, what is this Ichi like?

650
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:00,116
I can't tell you that.

651
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:04,114
Come on, tell me about him.

652
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:11,270
OK, if you insist.

653
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:24,034
- He's kind of cute.
- Your type?

654
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,353
Not especially.

655
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:32,071
- He is a crybaby.
- What's that?

656
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:34,310
He was bullied when he was a kid.

657
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:38,359
Even now, when he gets mad
he starts to cry.

658
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:43,594
At first he keeps it under control,
then suddenly he lashes out to kill.

659
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:47,669
So he's sick, isn't he?

660
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:52,470
Most of the time,
he's quite a nice young man.

661
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:55,837
But when he loses it,
he turns into a killer.

662
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,151
I sort of understand that.

663
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:05,589
But he was never really bullied,
you see.

664
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:15,230
After he killed his parents,
I messed around with his memory.

665
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:19,188
I made him believe
that he used to be bullied.

666
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:23,558
So now every time I need him
for a job, I feed him more stories.

667
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:25,392
And he believes all of that?

668
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:28,472
Does that post-hypnosis stuff
really work?

669
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:32,679
Yes, but I think I overdid it
on that rape story.

670
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,514
I told him he was bullied
in high school

671
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:40,315
and that the girl who stood by him
ended up getting raped.

672
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:42,789
That got him terribly excited.

673
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:45,833
Rape?

674
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,992
Yes, a story about a girl
who was raped.

675
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:04,158
Can I ask you something?

676
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:05,833
What?

677
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:14,079
Did you also put me under
some kind of hypnosis?

678
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:22,157
I wouldn't dare.

679
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:49,358
No!

680
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:55,592
Shut up!

681
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:37,317
I feel sorry for you, Kaneko.

682
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:40,119
First you lose your gun
and get kicked of the force.

683
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:42,111
Then you become a yakuza,
which is OK.

684
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:45,113
But now you have a killer
on your heels.

685
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,316
You're an unlucky monkey.

686
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:50,591
I have no regrets.

687
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:55,991
I've got lots of them.

688
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:01,192
The only reason I ended up in this
business is because I was tough.

689
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:07,554
Sometimes I look at those
salary slaves...

690
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:14,837
imagining I could have easily ended
up that way, living such a life.

691
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:21,189
What will you do
when all this is over?

692
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:29,914
I only want revenge for boss Anjo.

693
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:32,958
There will be no one left
to taste our revenge.

694
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,076
Think about your son.

695
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:38,397
He'll have to manage on his own.

696
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:41,120
I have only one thing on my mind.

697
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:54,433
I've never seen such a tough bitch.

698
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:58,509
Jiro, you've lost your touch.

699
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:01,035
She's just too tough.

700
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:07,275
Time for sleuthhound Saburo
to step into the ring.

701
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:15,360
That brings back memories.

702
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:36,758
- OK, I know where to find Long.
- I'm impressed.

703
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:44,479
Takayama, keep an eye on the girl.

704
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:52,473
Where are you going?

705
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:57,917
Did I tell you to come?

706
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:03,151
But...

707
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:11,274
I didn't ask you to come, did I?

708
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:16,189
Can't you sense my mood?

709
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:36,795
I'm sorry, Longie.

710
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:39,155
God, this is terrible.

711
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:47,077
Are you all right?

712
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:49,913
I'm so sorry, Longie.

713
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,511
You want some water?

714
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,995
I said, do you want some water?

715
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:03,436
Do you want some or not?

716
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:10,837
I'm so sorry, Longie.

717
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:23,356
Hey.

718
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,912
Say something!

719
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:34,116
Cut it out.

720
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:41,236
Cut it out!

721
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:00,034
How come Jijii doesn't answer?

722
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:01,956
Kakihara.

723
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:08,952
Good evening.

724
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,150
This one's for Inoue!

725
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:33,352
Put some feeling into it!
Giving pain is a serious business.

726
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:50,479
There's no love in your punches.

727
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:11,995
What's taking him so long?

728
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:18,432
What the fuck?

729
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,309
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

730
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:37,630
Are you all right?

731
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:39,950
Are you hurt?

732
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:44,435
Ichi?

733
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:51,356
Don't you remember me?

734
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:59,272
It's me, Tachibana.

735
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,317
Long time no see.

736
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:26,351
It's been a long time.

737
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:32,712
Yes, it has, Ms Tachibana.

738
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:36,271
Is it really you?

739
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:40,798
I told you so.

740
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,036
I'm sorry.

741
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:07,358
Then why didn't you
come to my rescue?

742
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:09,476
I'm sorry.

743
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:20,395
I wanted to die.

744
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:36,470
- Despair.
- Despair.

745
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,271
That's right, despair.

746
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:57,992
I like to be abused.

747
01:30:02,120 --> 01:30:06,591
I met someone through the Internet
who said he was a sadist.

748
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:20,399
I was so disappointed.

749
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:30,313
Slice me up neatly.

750
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:33,437
Slice you up?

751
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:22,869
What? You have a hard-on, already?

752
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:35,117
You wanted me to rape you?

753
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:59,513
You really wanted me to rape you,
Ms Tachibana?

754
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:22,151
You wanted to be raped because
you didn't want to be raped.

755
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:28,038
You didn't want me to do it
because you wanted me to do it.

756
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:30,998
Of course.
Like Sailor didn't want me to do it

757
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:33,151
cos she wanted me to do it.

758
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:38,310
That's it, Ms Tachibana.

759
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:47,077
What's the matter?

760
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:56,671
I will slice you to pieces,
Ms Tachibana.

761
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:58,592
What?

762
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:07,711
Ms Tachibana.

763
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:23,593
I understand now.

764
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:26,399
You don't want this
because you want it.

765
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:31,032
Myu-Myu?

766
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:35,116
Myu-Myu?

767
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:44,513
What happened? Why is she dead?

768
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:49,838
I guess he wanted to get something
from her

769
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,991
but just went a little too far.

770
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:57,198
That's right, isn't it, Kaneko?

771
01:35:57,360 --> 01:35:59,874
Don't get in my way all the time.

772
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:17,196
I told you it wouldn't be pretty.

773
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:22,991
I'll ask you again. Where is Ichi?

774
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:30,471
I told you, I don't know.

775
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:41,989
Ichi is even more depraved
than you could ever imagine.

776
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:47,839
He's a monster who kills
without any feeling for his victims.

777
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,956
Is that so hard to understand?

778
01:36:57,400 --> 01:36:59,391
Hello?

779
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:03,553
Do you think that what you're doing
will make everything inevitable?

780
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:10,238
No matter how hard you try,
it'll all be in vain, you asshole.

781
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:15,030
People like you who can only watch
know absolutely nothing.

782
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:19,557
I'm pulling the strings. Even yours.
I'm controlling everything.

783
01:37:19,720 --> 01:37:23,156
Don't you feel it's all running
a bit too smoothly, you creep?

784
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:25,993
Your fate
is without a shred of meaning.

785
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:31,758
You'll be killed senselessly by Ichi.
No more, no less, asshole.

786
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:55,156
Your penalty for not knowing Ichi.

787
01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:59,670
A split and pierced penis.

788
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:02,636
Great. Let's do it.

789
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:06,117
Takayama, get some scissors.

790
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:11,517
This'll put an end to your pimping.

791
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:15,789
No!

792
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:18,474
I'll try to remember about Ichi!

793
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:24,550
I'll be outside.
Call me when it's over.

794
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:47,675
Really?

795
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:49,558
You feel up to it again?

796
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:55,995
OK, come to the yakuza apartment.

797
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:59,350
There's lots of work to do.

798
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:08,871
I can't stand that stuff.

799
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:23,591
That bastard Jijii.

800
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:58,036
Where's Ichi?

801
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:12,314
Behind you.

802
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:36,549
Ichi has no time to be playing
with a dumb gorilla like you.

803
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:24,918
No! If you do that, I'll die.

804
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:32,637
What was that?

805
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:04,755
Takayama...

806
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:17,471
He's all broken up.

807
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,911
Hold it.

808
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:31,349
Don't. You'll never make it.

809
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:34,473
Hey!

810
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:37,756
Bastard.

811
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:43,951
This Ichi's a real monster.

812
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:47,476
Even big brother Jiro
couldn't do this.

813
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:49,517
Watch what you say.

814
01:42:50,920 --> 01:42:53,718
I'm getting scared.

815
01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:56,678
We'll go look for him, too.

816
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:00,993
You stay here.

817
01:43:06,720 --> 01:43:09,234
It's you and me guarding the coop.

818
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:31,038
Do you think it's possible
to yank someone's arm off

819
01:43:31,200 --> 01:43:33,111
with your bare hands?

820
01:43:36,280 --> 01:43:41,912
I said, is it possible to yank
an arm off with your bare hands?

821
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:44,469
Of course not.

822
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:46,517
That's impossible.

823
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:48,398
I can't hear you.

824
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:50,790
- It's impossible.
- Really?

825
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:55,875
I'll have little Saburo
shaking in his boots.

826
01:43:56,040 --> 01:43:58,713
Ready? I'm going to try now.

827
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:45,795
So you're back?

828
01:44:48,360 --> 01:44:51,272
Where are the bullies, Jijii?

829
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:53,351
First, listen carefully.

830
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:58,354
That man who treated you
to a bowl of noodles -

831
01:44:58,520 --> 01:45:01,353
he's your long, lost brother.

832
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:06,718
So the next time you see him,
make sure you pay him your respect.

833
01:45:08,040 --> 01:45:10,554
My brother?

834
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:17,188
My big brother?

835
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:21,478
Damn, the whole world
looks down on me.

836
01:45:21,640 --> 01:45:23,471
I can do it!

837
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:28,318
I'm sure I can kill Ichi. Ichi!

838
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:38,678
My brother.

839
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:06,270
Who's there?

840
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:14,557
Saburo, what kind of guy
is this Ichi?

841
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:18,508
- He must be some kind of monster.
- I'm scared.

842
01:46:18,680 --> 01:46:20,989
Even the infamous Kakihara
is scared now?

843
01:46:21,160 --> 01:46:23,230
No, I'm scared of myself.

844
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:26,831
All this anticipation.

845
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:30,879
It's been years since I felt such
a mix of anxiety and anticipation.

846
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:34,112
The few times I've felt this,
I was let down in the end.

847
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:36,840
I really want to lose myself
in desperation.

848
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,195
What if Ichi also lets me down?

849
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:40,998
What's the matter?

850
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:44,596
- It's Jiro. He's dead.
- Really?

851
01:46:44,760 --> 01:46:48,389
It's exactly the same feeling
as when our big brother Ichiro died.

852
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:50,710
Are you sure? Then let's go back.

853
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,230
Kaneko. Ichi has arrived.

854
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:40,597
Damn.

855
01:47:40,760 --> 01:47:43,877
I was looking forward to
killing Jiro myself one day.

856
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:49,829
That's interesting.

857
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:06,392
Oh, fuck!

858
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:15,957
The same as ever.

859
01:48:34,120 --> 01:48:35,997
Takeshi.

860
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:56,674
He looks like that guy...

861
01:48:56,840 --> 01:48:59,513
He's called Ichi.

862
01:48:59,680 --> 01:49:02,069
- What did you say?
- Ichi.

863
01:49:02,240 --> 01:49:04,800
He's the guy who used karate
to help me.

864
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:13,198
Damn! Damn!

865
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,592
Takeshi.

866
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:19,030
Don't move an inch.

867
01:50:03,240 --> 01:50:06,118
Wait a minute.

868
01:50:06,280 --> 01:50:09,078
You're scaring me. Wait.

869
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:20,799
You're so fucking scary!
You're coming at me again?

870
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:23,155
Ichi!

871
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:47,478
Hey.

872
01:50:55,320 --> 01:50:57,072
What will you do now?

873
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:04,872
Don't let me down.

874
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,355
Why are you doing this to me,
brother?

875
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:18,150
Why?

876
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:22,391
Why?

877
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:27,875
Hey, wait a minute.

878
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:34,032
Tell me, brother.

879
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:37,839
Tell me.

880
01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:43,312
Why?

881
01:51:45,400 --> 01:51:46,992
Why?

882
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:50,318
Why, brother?

883
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:54,071
Stop right there!

884
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:34,989
Daddy.

885
01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:39,796
Takeshi...

886
01:52:48,840 --> 01:52:50,876
Takeshi...

887
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:26,230
I'm sorry.

888
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:32,951
I'm sorry.

889
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:53,191
Your mind is in chaos.

890
01:53:55,080 --> 01:53:57,150
You are truly demented.

891
01:53:59,080 --> 01:54:01,594
Get up, Ichi.

892
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:02,954
Get up.

893
01:54:12,280 --> 01:54:14,510
What's the matter with you?

894
01:54:21,960 --> 01:54:23,951
Come on, damn it!

895
01:54:25,680 --> 01:54:27,830
Do you hear me?

896
01:54:31,160 --> 01:54:32,912
Get up.

897
01:54:41,160 --> 01:54:43,196
Come on.

898
01:54:48,520 --> 01:54:50,511
Stop fucking around.

899
01:54:53,800 --> 01:54:55,791
What are you playing at?

900
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:02,919
How can we have our challenge match,
if you act this way?

901
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:06,911
Come on, Ichi.

902
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:16,318
Get up and fight. Come on.

903
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:55,193
You're so selfish.

904
01:55:55,360 --> 01:55:58,113
What are you doing?

905
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:40,549
Damn...

906
01:56:45,600 --> 01:56:47,989
Nobody left to kill me.

907
01:58:35,720 --> 01:58:40,191
Wow, this is amazing!

908
01:58:40,360 --> 01:58:42,316
