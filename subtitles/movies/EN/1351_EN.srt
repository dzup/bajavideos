1
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:54,866
Brother Man, we're here

2
00:02:55,881 --> 00:02:57,822
I'm sorry to be such a bother

3
00:02:58,352 --> 00:02:59,764
Don't mention it

4
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:05,102
This place has been idle for a few months.
I've informed the owners, they are nice folks

5
00:03:05,763 --> 00:03:08,983
Thank you

6
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:10,748
Is this suitable for your school?

7
00:03:18,248 --> 00:03:19,615
Wow, this place is huge!

8
00:03:19,735 --> 00:03:20,718
Is this ok?

9
00:03:20,838 --> 00:03:21,642
Yes, yes

10
00:03:23,994 --> 00:03:26,215
Very spacious...

11
00:03:40,761 --> 00:03:41,480
Master Yip

12
00:03:42,678 --> 00:03:44,808
You haven't gotten any disciples yet?

13
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:49,257
What's up, 3rd Aunt?

14
00:03:49,377 --> 00:03:53,033
You have such a big place here.
I'd like to hang my laundry here

15
00:03:54,292 --> 00:03:55,762
Sure, no problem

16
00:04:40,794 --> 00:04:41,640
Yong

17
00:04:43,805 --> 00:04:46,040
Sigh, I told you before... let me do this

18
00:04:48,323 --> 00:04:49,671
I don't know what to do with you

19
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:52,550
There'll be no more water left by the time you come

20
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,938
Then I'll come back earlier 
next time. Let me do these chores

21
00:04:58,914 --> 00:05:01,737
I've told you not to exert yourself

22
00:05:02,278 --> 00:05:04,879
How are you feeling?

23
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,384
Mama, I need to pay school fees

24
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,366
Ok, hang on

25
00:05:18,758 --> 00:05:19,936
Who's that?

26
00:05:20,056 --> 00:05:21,544
Pay your rent! Mr and Mrs Yip!

27
00:05:21,817 --> 00:05:25,465
Don't open the door. We don't have enough money for rent

28
00:05:25,585 --> 00:05:28,105
Mr and Mrs Yip! Pay your rent

29
00:06:05,457 --> 00:06:10,081
Master Yip, still no students?

30
00:06:10,201 --> 00:06:13,955
I'll go hang my laundry...

31
00:06:14,075 --> 00:06:18,613
Let me help you...

32
00:06:18,734 --> 00:06:25,567
Thank you very much!

33
00:06:45,495 --> 00:06:51,636
Hey, are you the one teaching Wing Chun?

34
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:57,706
Master Yip! Someone's here to learn kung fu!

35
00:07:01,412 --> 00:07:02,542
You wish to learn Wing Chun?

36
00:07:02,662 --> 00:07:06,212
I don't even know what Wing Chun is

37
00:07:06,332 --> 00:07:10,482
Then let me tell you. Wing Chun is the Southern art of close combat....

38
00:07:10,602 --> 00:07:17,771
Enough! Spar with me. If I lose, I'll be your student

39
00:07:19,711 --> 00:07:21,053
Fine

40
00:07:33,158 --> 00:07:37,499
Wing Chun. Yip Man

41
00:07:52,912 --> 00:07:55,135
So, what do you think?

42
00:07:55,255 --> 00:07:58,735
You haven't won yet

43
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:25,557
Do you yield?

44
00:08:25,677 --> 00:08:30,321
Yield? I don't even know what you're doing

45
00:08:40,627 --> 00:08:43,238
Do you know now?

46
00:08:51,141 --> 00:08:56,612
Master Yip, I didn't know
you're so skilful! Fantastic!

47
00:08:56,732 --> 00:09:02,858
Hey, young man! You should be his disciple!

48
00:09:02,978 --> 00:09:06,635
I think you can start paying tuition fees now

49
00:09:11,611 --> 00:09:14,646
Hey! How can you leave like that?

50
00:09:14,766 --> 00:09:25,274
Master Yip, what now? Your potential student is gone

51
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,590
That's him

52
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:46,661
How good can his kung fu be?

53
00:09:46,781 --> 00:09:47,755
Would I lie to you?

54
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,402
He looks like he couldn't even hurt a fly

55
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,250
If you hadn't told me, I'd have 
thought he's just a laundryman

56
00:09:54,673 --> 00:10:00,084
You're not really here to learn kung fu. Please leave

57
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:04,307
Ok, then we'll fight you

58
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:06,257
No need to take them off

59
00:10:06,377 --> 00:10:07,916
Why not?

60
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,799
Oh, nevermind

61
00:10:12,586 --> 00:10:13,045
The Yip Man Palm

62
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,868
Told you not to take off your shirts...

63
00:10:38,988 --> 00:10:44,271
Master! I am Huang Liang, please take me as a disciple!

64
00:10:54,824 --> 00:10:58,212
- Master, I am Xiu Shi Chang!
- Wei Guo Jian
- Wang Kun

65
00:10:58,332 --> 00:11:00,012
Please accept us as students!

66
00:11:00,132 --> 00:11:04,617
Eh, I asked first. You must address
me as "Eldest Brother"

67
00:11:04,737 --> 00:11:06,240
Serve tea to Master!

68
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,746
No need to trouble yourselves

69
00:11:09,911 --> 00:11:13,510
Pay tuition fees first

70
00:11:18,221 --> 00:11:22,036
In Wing Chun, we attack and defend in one motion

71
00:11:22,156 --> 00:11:24,838
Attack, and defend

72
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,932
To disable an opponent in the shortest time

73
00:11:28,052 --> 00:11:29,627
This is block and attack

74
00:11:30,475 --> 00:11:31,534
Block and attack

75
00:11:32,315 --> 00:11:35,116
Follow up with a dozen quick punches

76
00:11:36,265 --> 00:11:37,501
Understand?

77
00:11:37,621 --> 00:11:38,813
(Blank looks)

78
00:11:41,738 --> 00:11:44,174
Who is Master Yip?

79
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,531
Master!

80
00:11:48,956 --> 00:11:53,299
Liang, did you ask them to come?

81
00:12:14,378 --> 00:12:18,465
Master, do you think you can fight off 10 men?

82
00:12:21,854 --> 00:12:24,149
The best thing is not to fight at all

83
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:25,561
Continue training

84
00:12:25,681 --> 00:12:29,763
What if they use weapons?

85
00:12:30,222 --> 00:12:32,164
Run

86
00:12:37,531 --> 00:12:39,756
Time to collect tuition fees

87
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,133
Ok

88
00:12:43,075 --> 00:12:45,724
You always say that

89
00:12:46,323 --> 00:12:48,160
I will collect soon

90
00:12:48,774 --> 00:12:50,787
Hang on a sec

91
00:12:50,907 --> 00:12:52,093
What's up?

92
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:57,531
It's time to pay tuition fees

93
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,085
What's happening?

94
00:12:59,205 --> 00:13:01,345
Time to pay tuition fees

95
00:13:01,577 --> 00:13:04,170
If you have the money, please pay up

96
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,183
Here you go Master

97
00:13:08,168 --> 00:13:13,174
Master, I can only pay $2... My mother...
she needs the money. I'll pay the rest later

98
00:13:13,951 --> 00:13:18,893
Pay next time... next time

99
00:13:19,013 --> 00:13:20,860
Go home for dinner

100
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,302
Bye Master

101
00:13:25,626 --> 00:13:29,087
It's so little... what shall we do?

102
00:13:29,617 --> 00:13:34,348
No choice. You also know things aren't so good now

103
00:13:34,468 --> 00:13:39,080
The students asked for help, I can't refuse

104
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,904
Then we need to appeal to the landlady

105
00:13:42,024 --> 00:13:48,507
Yes, things will work out eventually

106
00:13:49,178 --> 00:13:52,109
2 pieces of cake please

107
00:13:53,224 --> 00:13:56,579
- You want the egg tarts?
- No, thanks

108
00:13:56,699 --> 00:14:00,851
Stop! Hold it right there!

109
00:14:00,971 --> 00:14:04,840
Thief! Return it to me!

110
00:14:05,688 --> 00:14:08,584
Please don't beat up my dad

111
00:14:08,704 --> 00:14:11,549
No money? Then we'll get him

112
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:15,469
Please let him go!

113
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,211
Stop, stop! Don't beat him up

114
00:14:19,332 --> 00:14:20,483
What's happening?

115
00:14:20,603 --> 00:14:22,107
He stole our roasted duck

116
00:14:22,227 --> 00:14:23,378
I'll pay for him

117
00:14:23,498 --> 00:14:24,120
Give it here!

118
00:14:27,156 --> 00:14:28,110
Let's go

119
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:28,696
Jin Quan?

120
00:14:28,816 --> 00:14:30,793
Uncle Man, I know where Dad is

121
00:14:31,111 --> 00:14:32,361
Bring me to him

122
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,565
Here

123
00:14:59,671 --> 00:15:00,236
Jin Quan!

124
00:15:00,356 --> 00:15:03,555
Uncle Man, he doesn't recognise anyone

125
00:15:03,978 --> 00:15:08,074
The Japanese shot him in the head once. He doesn't recognise anyone anymore

126
00:15:16,796 --> 00:15:23,011
Jin Quan, I'm Yip

127
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:25,303
Jin Quan!

128
00:15:25,423 --> 00:15:30,261
Get away! Get out! Go! Go!

129
00:15:52,505 --> 00:15:56,212
Let's go, Uncle Man

130
00:16:00,577 --> 00:16:05,097
It's my fault. I did this to you

131
00:16:11,558 --> 00:16:12,830
Let's go

132
00:16:14,771 --> 00:16:21,021
My dad hasn't chased me away yet
That's why I'm still here

133
00:16:22,646 --> 00:16:29,954
On good days I can get odd jobs and buy food back

134
00:16:30,786 --> 00:16:34,387
On bad days, we starve

135
00:16:38,935 --> 00:16:42,323
Don't worry, Kwan

136
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:46,392
I'll help you take care of him

137
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,606
Since you are recommended by
Master Yip, I'll definitely hire you

138
00:16:49,727 --> 00:16:53,984
Kid, if you agree to half salary, you can start now

139
00:16:54,105 --> 00:16:54,867
No problem

140
00:16:54,987 --> 00:16:57,868
Have a seat. I'll arrange work for you

141
00:16:57,988 --> 00:17:00,675
Brother Man, don't leave. I'll treat you to tea

142
00:17:01,274 --> 00:17:01,946
Thank you

143
00:17:02,066 --> 00:17:02,899
Don't mention it

144
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:04,417
Have a seat

145
00:17:04,537 --> 00:17:06,501
This is good

146
00:17:06,621 --> 00:17:08,054
Thank you Uncle Man

147
00:17:08,174 --> 00:17:11,267
Kwan, you must work hard

148
00:17:11,387 --> 00:17:12,680
I will

149
00:17:22,531 --> 00:17:25,038
What do you think? I can bring you there later

150
00:17:25,158 --> 00:17:28,710
I'm from Hong School. I don't need to learn from you!

151
00:17:33,584 --> 00:17:36,974
Since you aren't interested, why tear my posters down?

152
00:17:37,094 --> 00:17:42,412
I don't care what you learn. You're blocking my poster

153
00:17:46,472 --> 00:17:48,662
Want to know what Wing Chun is?

154
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,250
You're looking for trouble?

155
00:17:57,771 --> 00:17:58,689
We won't bully you

156
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:00,773
One on one. No helping!

157
00:18:00,893 --> 00:18:01,323
Ok

158
00:18:01,443 --> 00:18:03,068
Also, don't poke eyes

159
00:18:03,188 --> 00:18:05,444
Enough talk. I'm in a hurry

160
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:55,290
So you yield?

161
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,158
No!

162
00:18:56,278 --> 00:18:56,925
No?

163
00:18:57,877 --> 00:18:58,643
Do you yield?

164
00:19:06,287 --> 00:19:09,036
When you strike, don't move from this line

165
00:19:09,828 --> 00:19:10,901
Relax

166
00:19:11,794 --> 00:19:12,677
Relax more

167
00:19:18,404 --> 00:19:19,726
Who is Yip Man?

168
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:20,875
Yes?

169
00:19:22,082 --> 00:19:24,007
Your disciple Liang has beaten up our brother

170
00:19:24,127 --> 00:19:28,117
We took him hostage. Bring money to rescue him at the fish market

171
00:19:28,864 --> 00:19:29,668
Let's go

172
00:21:00,712 --> 00:21:01,999
Brother Jin

173
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,967
Are you his Master?

174
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,346
That's right

175
00:21:17,915 --> 00:21:22,089
I believe it's just a misunderstanding

176
00:21:22,413 --> 00:21:23,792
Let's talk it over

177
00:21:24,473 --> 00:21:26,827
Can you release my disciple?

178
00:21:26,947 --> 00:21:27,636
Release him!

179
00:21:37,761 --> 00:21:40,170
Are you all right?

180
00:21:41,881 --> 00:21:43,279
I'm fine

181
00:21:43,399 --> 00:21:45,541
Why did you beat him up?

182
00:21:45,661 --> 00:21:48,869
We sparred and he lost. It's not my fault

183
00:21:48,989 --> 00:21:50,654
What? I can't beat you?

184
00:21:50,774 --> 00:21:52,290
Don't be rash

185
00:21:53,076 --> 00:21:54,886
You're all young men

186
00:21:55,006 --> 00:21:58,650
Sometimes you get minor injuries during sparring

187
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:02,443
Next time I'll come specially to
clarify things with your Master

188
00:22:02,564 --> 00:22:04,024
May I know who your Master is?

189
00:22:04,144 --> 00:22:08,392
You don't need to know who he is.
He's better than you

190
00:22:08,908 --> 00:22:11,466
Enough talk. Did you bring the money?

191
00:22:12,616 --> 00:22:13,161
No

192
00:22:17,673 --> 00:22:19,167
Don't be rash

193
00:22:21,321 --> 00:22:22,470
Attack!

194
00:22:30,602 --> 00:22:31,579
Behind you!

195
00:22:47,121 --> 00:22:48,845
Chop him up!

196
00:23:41,446 --> 00:23:42,424
Master!

197
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,214
Liang!

198
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:43,369
Master! I'm here

199
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:59,113
Master, you really can beat up more than 10 men!

200
00:25:00,664 --> 00:25:02,331
Only if we can escape

201
00:25:11,095 --> 00:25:12,565
Stay close to me

202
00:25:16,176 --> 00:25:17,626
Follow me!

203
00:25:54,946 --> 00:25:56,325
Go, Liang

204
00:25:57,216 --> 00:25:57,992
Go!

205
00:26:04,845 --> 00:26:05,846
Jin Shan Zhao?

206
00:26:18,863 --> 00:26:20,075
Nobody move!

207
00:26:21,722 --> 00:26:23,347
What are you doing?

208
00:26:28,288 --> 00:26:31,019
Master Yip, you are free to go

209
00:26:39,109 --> 00:26:40,145
Thanks

210
00:26:42,594 --> 00:26:43,570
You're asking for it!

211
00:26:45,148 --> 00:26:46,924
Break it up!

212
00:26:56,737 --> 00:26:57,785
Master!

213
00:27:03,002 --> 00:27:04,026
You stirring up trouble again?

214
00:27:04,146 --> 00:27:05,686
No, Master

215
00:27:05,922 --> 00:27:09,347
I was sparring with him, but he brought
his Master here to intimidate us

216
00:27:12,895 --> 00:27:13,555
Ji

217
00:27:15,297 --> 00:27:16,580
You trying to be Big Brother here?

218
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,639
No of course not

219
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:21,276
Big Brother Hong, let's talk things over

220
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:24,279
You want to talk with a knife in your hand?

221
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:25,338
No, no

222
00:27:25,832 --> 00:27:29,846
That son of a bitch tried to cause
trouble on my turf. That's why I was....

223
00:27:30,287 --> 00:27:32,072
This isn't your turf

224
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:39,078
This is my road. Your patch of ground is mine.
So you tell me, whose turf is this?

225
00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:43,934
It's yours, of course

226
00:27:44,054 --> 00:27:47,244
You can leave now. It's not your concern

227
00:28:01,993 --> 00:28:04,570
Which style and school are you?

228
00:28:05,045 --> 00:28:09,339
Greetings Master Hong. I'm Yip Man
of the Wing Chun sect from Fo Shan

229
00:28:10,501 --> 00:28:14,619
The situation is like this. My disciple sparred with yours

230
00:28:15,244 --> 00:28:18,486
My disciple definitely went too far and injured your disciple

231
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:20,839
You're saying my Hong style is inferior?

232
00:28:20,959 --> 00:28:22,909
I didn't mean it like that

233
00:28:23,591 --> 00:28:26,321
Who allowed you to teach martial arts? Do you know the rules?

234
00:28:26,662 --> 00:28:27,955
I don't know of any rules

235
00:28:28,075 --> 00:28:30,951
Ok I'll tell you the rules now

236
00:28:31,448 --> 00:28:34,371
You must accept challenges from the various schools

237
00:28:34,491 --> 00:28:38,893
If you win, then you are fit to teach martial arts

238
00:28:43,226 --> 00:28:47,013
So now you know the rules for opening a martial arts school

239
00:28:54,641 --> 00:29:00,845
Enough talk. There are rules for martial
arts schools, and then there are rules of Law

240
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,721
Now that you're done

241
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:05,809
Wan, Po! Take these 2 into custody

242
00:29:05,929 --> 00:29:07,603
I have a spare set of handcuffs. Arrest him too

243
00:29:07,723 --> 00:29:08,558
Huh? Me too?

244
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:09,250
Master!

245
00:29:09,617 --> 00:29:10,927
Stop squirming! Let's go

246
00:29:13,115 --> 00:29:14,615
Move it

247
00:29:15,982 --> 00:29:19,630
Settle your affairs, and let's go in. The Chief is waiting

248
00:29:28,781 --> 00:29:29,649
Sir

249
00:30:00,834 --> 00:30:03,376
The Chief is asking about the manpower and security arrangements

250
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:06,207
Everything is arranged. No problems

251
00:30:08,761 --> 00:30:11,925
So how much will I get for the competition?

252
00:30:15,321 --> 00:30:17,802
Please excuse us a moment

253
00:30:19,449 --> 00:30:22,155
Don't worry, I'll take care of it

254
00:30:30,972 --> 00:30:34,630
So how much is his cut? You
tell me, I'll tell Master Hong

255
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:49,758
Speak!

256
00:30:49,878 --> 00:30:51,088
Are you going to tell me?

257
00:30:51,112 --> 00:30:54,370
Don't worry. These cops are just strutting around acting tough

258
00:30:55,569 --> 00:30:57,533
It'll be ok once we make bail

259
00:31:00,368 --> 00:31:04,109
Master Jin, I'm sorry to get you involved

260
00:31:05,686 --> 00:31:07,408
I'm sorry to get you involved today

261
00:31:07,528 --> 00:31:08,078
Hang on a bit

262
00:31:08,561 --> 00:31:11,125
I'm deaf in this ear after you wacked me there the other time

263
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:11,843
So what were you saying?

264
00:31:11,963 --> 00:31:15,455
I said, I'm sorry to get you involved today

265
00:31:15,818 --> 00:31:16,689
It's nothing

266
00:31:17,006 --> 00:31:22,229
If it weren't for your wake up call the other time
I don't know what I'll do here in Hong Kong

267
00:31:24,547 --> 00:31:27,500
Open up, Police!

268
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:30,505
Open up!

269
00:31:32,445 --> 00:31:33,551
What's wrong?

270
00:31:33,672 --> 00:31:34,892
Any of Yip Man's relatives here?

271
00:31:35,012 --> 00:31:36,021
I'm his wife

272
00:31:36,597 --> 00:31:39,432
Your husband is arrested for fighting

273
00:31:39,552 --> 00:31:41,456
Bring money to bail him out

274
00:31:49,142 --> 00:31:52,588
Mr Liang! Mr Liang!

275
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:54,905
Mr Liang!

276
00:31:55,281 --> 00:31:56,328
What's wrong, Mrs Yip?

277
00:31:56,449 --> 00:32:02,036
Please save my husband! I don't
have enough money for bail

278
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:06,059
Wait here

279
00:32:06,422 --> 00:32:09,892
It's very troublesome to open
a martial arts school here in Hong Kong

280
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:12,445
There's too many schools, too many masters

281
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:13,868
Too many rules too

282
00:32:14,327 --> 00:32:16,586
And that Master Hong has many supporters

283
00:32:16,706 --> 00:32:18,451
Many disciples, and a lot of money

284
00:32:19,357 --> 00:32:24,533
So what? I'll get him once I'm out of here

285
00:32:25,198 --> 00:32:28,921
I'll destroy his fish stall and poison all his fish!

286
00:32:31,121 --> 00:32:34,039
What's the difference between you and them, then?

287
00:32:34,415 --> 00:32:39,003
Hey kid, you fight pretty good

288
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:41,638
I'm not a kid!

289
00:32:41,855 --> 00:32:43,101
Which part of me looks like a kid?

290
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:45,189
Liang! Don't use that tone

291
00:32:45,483 --> 00:32:46,553
Master Jin is your elder

292
00:32:46,578 --> 00:32:48,424
It's all right, he's young

293
00:32:49,573 --> 00:32:52,726
He reminds me of myself when I was young

294
00:32:53,055 --> 00:32:55,632
If you want him to turn out well, get him a wife

295
00:32:55,926 --> 00:33:00,975
Just like me... wife, kids, family. It changes a man

296
00:33:08,358 --> 00:33:10,147
I want to post bail for my husband

297
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:11,558
What's his name?

298
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:12,641
Yip Man

299
00:33:13,935 --> 00:33:15,112
Did you bring the money?

300
00:33:15,232 --> 00:33:16,300
Yes, here

301
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:22,088
Yip Man, you're free to go

302
00:33:27,447 --> 00:33:28,882
Hurry up

303
00:33:47,531 --> 00:33:49,049
I'm here to bail Jin out

304
00:33:49,367 --> 00:33:50,519
Wife!

305
00:33:50,837 --> 00:33:53,061
Brother, please open the door

306
00:33:53,181 --> 00:33:55,037
Quickly!

307
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:58,890
That's my wife

308
00:34:07,222 --> 00:34:11,599
Liang, is anyone coming for you?

309
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,175
No

310
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:25,383
Don't worry Master. They'll release
me in a couple of days

311
00:34:25,924 --> 00:34:27,159
You go on

312
00:34:28,827 --> 00:34:30,616
I won't be able to see you out

313
00:34:42,683 --> 00:34:45,754
Brother Geng, I need to impose on you again

314
00:34:46,165 --> 00:34:48,165
I want to bail my disciple out

315
00:34:49,393 --> 00:34:50,946
Is it ok?

316
00:34:52,851 --> 00:34:55,381
Brother Man, I didn't bring enough money

317
00:34:55,937 --> 00:34:56,772
Master Yip

318
00:34:57,737 --> 00:35:00,078
Master Yip, wait a bit

319
00:35:00,843 --> 00:35:03,007
Wife, do you have any money?

320
00:35:03,231 --> 00:35:04,607
What do you need it for?

321
00:35:05,325 --> 00:35:06,618
It's an emergency

322
00:35:06,983 --> 00:35:09,053
You're always like this. No money!

323
00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:11,901
Help people out here, Wife

324
00:35:13,489 --> 00:35:14,878
This is the last time

325
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:16,959
Mum's the best!

326
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:19,941
Master Yip, here's the money

327
00:35:21,145 --> 00:35:23,181
I'll return it to you as soon as I can. Thank you

328
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:23,934
No problem, don't mention it

329
00:35:34,505 --> 00:35:40,007
It's so difficult to open a school here.
Why don't you just give up?

330
00:35:46,443 --> 00:35:51,184
I'll just have to go visit the other masters. It's nothing

331
00:35:52,642 --> 00:35:55,823
I don't want to worry every day like before

332
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:10,407
We made it through the war,
there's nothing to worry about

333
00:36:12,595 --> 00:36:19,064
Don't dwell on it. Go to sleep

334
00:36:35,024 --> 00:36:38,294
I've fought this type of matches many times before

335
00:36:38,414 --> 00:36:42,212
They were blades below then, not stools

336
00:36:42,596 --> 00:36:45,784
Have you heard of this Yip Man before?

337
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:49,513
The name means nothing to me. No

338
00:36:50,267 --> 00:36:53,863
I'm sure he's no match for you, Master Luo

339
00:36:53,886 --> 00:36:55,405
Likewise, Master Zhang

340
00:36:57,157 --> 00:36:58,440
Will you be going up there?

341
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,075
I'll go if you go

342
00:37:00,558 --> 00:37:02,722
Enough talk. Let's drink tea

343
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,245
Cheers

344
00:37:09,792 --> 00:37:11,133
Master

345
00:37:16,751 --> 00:37:18,245
He's here

346
00:37:24,432 --> 00:37:25,810
Fellow Masters

347
00:37:27,177 --> 00:37:28,800
This is Yip Man

348
00:37:29,659 --> 00:37:32,377
He wants to establish his sect here in Hong Kong

349
00:37:32,695 --> 00:37:36,636
That's why he's here today to accept your challenges

350
00:37:37,707 --> 00:37:38,483
Yip Man

351
00:37:39,729 --> 00:37:41,424
If you surrender, you lose

352
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:43,447
If you leave the table, you lose

353
00:37:43,567 --> 00:37:47,156
If you're the last man standing on
the table after all the challenges

354
00:37:47,533 --> 00:37:49,815
I'll greet you as "Master Yip"

355
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:52,829
If there are no questions, we can begin

356
00:38:06,537 --> 00:38:09,573
What, he's just going to walk up to the table?

357
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:14,019
He's not supposed to touch the ground

358
00:38:27,189 --> 00:38:29,830
Greetings fellow masters. I am Yip Man

359
00:38:30,442 --> 00:38:33,406
I'm from Wing Chun sect from Fo Shan

360
00:38:33,794 --> 00:38:35,947
I hope my fellow masters will
go easy on me

361
00:38:36,067 --> 00:38:38,172
Which master will have a go?

362
00:38:39,031 --> 00:38:41,689
Master Luo, aren't you going?

363
00:38:42,795 --> 00:38:45,785
I'll wait and see if anyone else is going first

364
00:38:53,946 --> 00:38:57,922
Fine then, I'll be the first

365
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:18,205
Please

366
00:39:19,334 --> 00:39:19,805
Please

367
00:39:23,021 --> 00:39:24,757
Lightning Kick

368
00:39:24,758 --> 00:39:25,781
Beware, brother

369
00:40:15,263 --> 00:40:17,357
Are you all right Master Luo?

370
00:40:17,922 --> 00:40:18,510
I'm fine!

371
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:22,848
He'd be dead if it were blades below

372
00:40:23,273 --> 00:40:24,884
This is too much

373
00:40:25,872 --> 00:40:27,954
The table is really slippery!

374
00:40:29,554 --> 00:40:30,872
Thank you for going easy

375
00:40:30,992 --> 00:40:33,112
Come on, don't let him stop

376
00:40:33,124 --> 00:40:36,429
Master Zhang, your turn

377
00:40:38,666 --> 00:40:41,842
Master Zhang, go on... go on

378
00:40:49,811 --> 00:40:53,906
Master Zhang, the table is really very slippery

379
00:41:02,045 --> 00:41:02,693
Please

380
00:41:04,469 --> 00:41:05,304
Please

381
00:42:17,686 --> 00:42:19,003
I yield!

382
00:42:28,906 --> 00:42:30,211
Thank you for showing mercy

383
00:42:30,623 --> 00:42:31,871
Thank you for going easy on me

384
00:42:33,337 --> 00:42:35,690
Any other masters want to have a go?

385
00:43:24,178 --> 00:43:24,729
Please

386
00:43:26,384 --> 00:43:26,861
Please

387
00:45:23,699 --> 00:45:25,360
Master Yip

388
00:45:25,854 --> 00:45:26,886
Master Hong

389
00:45:29,175 --> 00:45:34,336
To join this association, you must pay a monthly fee

390
00:45:34,456 --> 00:45:35,816
What fees?

391
00:45:35,936 --> 00:45:40,350
It's the rules. Everyone pays $100 a month

392
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:42,503
Pay and you'll have no trouble

393
00:45:47,888 --> 00:45:54,171
If there's any masters that still think
I'm not worthy, I'm game anytime

394
00:45:54,753 --> 00:46:00,362
But I won't fulfil your personal financial 
interests by paying this "fee"

395
00:46:01,798 --> 00:46:06,285
As you wish. Don't look for me
if you're in trouble next time

396
00:46:07,318 --> 00:46:09,606
You may go now

397
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,058
Medication

398
00:46:31,193 --> 00:46:34,110
Master, here's the medication

399
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:48,125
Are you insane? Drawing these on my newspaper?

400
00:46:48,245 --> 00:46:51,124
I just wanted readers to understand the content

401
00:46:51,245 --> 00:46:52,610
Is the feedback that bad?

402
00:46:54,595 --> 00:46:58,036
Everyone in Hong Kong now wants to learn Wing Chun!

403
00:46:58,156 --> 00:46:58,910
This is fantastic!

404
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:02,660
Continue the drawings. I'm counting on you

405
00:47:03,616 --> 00:47:04,086
Get back to work!

406
00:47:04,718 --> 00:47:07,218
Well done! Good job!

407
00:47:10,548 --> 00:47:14,959
(Wing Chun fights Hong Style to a stalemate)

408
00:47:19,099 --> 00:47:21,864
Mei, stop doing your homework. Eat

409
00:47:22,349 --> 00:47:23,128
Eat first, ok?

410
00:47:23,457 --> 00:47:25,208
Wife, more porridge please

411
00:47:27,222 --> 00:47:31,163
You've not been eating well lately. Eat more

412
00:47:33,895 --> 00:47:34,869
Where are you going?

413
00:47:34,989 --> 00:47:38,435
You blind? I'm going up to do my laundry

414
00:47:39,081 --> 00:47:40,625
Are you really just doing your laundry?

415
00:47:40,626 --> 00:47:44,550
What do you think this big basin
is for? Washing my head?

416
00:47:44,551 --> 00:47:46,697
151.... 152...

417
00:47:46,698 --> 00:47:47,801
Where are you headed?

418
00:47:47,818 --> 00:47:48,972
To learn Wing Chun

419
00:47:49,219 --> 00:47:51,477
Wing Chun? It's not here

420
00:47:51,907 --> 00:47:52,907
The newspapers say it's here

421
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:54,401
No it's not. Go away!

422
00:47:54,425 --> 00:47:55,531
You're better off learning Hong style

423
00:47:56,189 --> 00:47:56,836
Hey!

424
00:47:58,259 --> 00:48:00,448
You bunch of rascals are preventing
people from learning Wing Chun!

425
00:48:00,471 --> 00:48:01,615
You son of a bitch!

426
00:48:01,638 --> 00:48:02,556
Come down!

427
00:48:02,676 --> 00:48:04,615
What are you doing?

428
00:48:04,735 --> 00:48:06,006
You deaf?

429
00:48:06,126 --> 00:48:07,335
Come down!

430
00:48:08,476 --> 00:48:10,041
What? No, you come up

431
00:48:10,064 --> 00:48:11,370
Come down if you have the guts

432
00:48:20,016 --> 00:48:21,413
Come down if you dare!

433
00:48:21,436 --> 00:48:23,166
You're crazy! So unbecoming!

434
00:48:24,305 --> 00:48:25,695
Look, Wing Chun disciples!

435
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:26,975
Attack!

436
00:48:31,327 --> 00:48:31,998
They're coming down

437
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:32,433
Hurry

438
00:48:36,701 --> 00:48:38,419
Come out!

439
00:49:22,713 --> 00:49:25,395
The owners are thinking twice after what happened today

440
00:49:25,688 --> 00:49:26,218
I understand

441
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:28,912
They've decided not to lend this rooftop to you anymore

442
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:30,571
I understand. I'm sorry

443
00:49:31,018 --> 00:49:33,088
I'm sorry too. I'll be going now

444
00:49:37,621 --> 00:49:38,445
Goodbye

445
00:49:38,891 --> 00:49:39,950
Bye, Brother Geng

446
00:50:08,841 --> 00:50:15,132
Master...

447
00:50:19,899 --> 00:50:21,594
I'm sure you know by now

448
00:50:25,052 --> 00:50:27,076
We can't train here anymore

449
00:50:27,726 --> 00:50:30,738
Master, it's not our fault! They started it!

450
00:50:30,973 --> 00:50:33,032
Yes they started it

451
00:50:33,385 --> 00:50:34,625
Let's go look for them to settle this

452
00:50:38,978 --> 00:50:40,307
Pack this place up before you go

453
00:50:41,172 --> 00:50:42,571
Bring the wooden men to my house

454
00:50:42,971 --> 00:50:45,818
Master...

455
00:51:02,038 --> 00:51:02,816
Ji

456
00:51:04,919 --> 00:51:08,390
Give these to the disciples. They've earned it

457
00:51:08,887 --> 00:51:09,579
Thank you Master

458
00:51:13,431 --> 00:51:15,137
- Here's yours.
- Thanks

459
00:51:15,257 --> 00:51:16,798
Good work everyone

460
00:51:18,593 --> 00:51:20,901
You still dare to show up here?

461
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:28,954
I'm here to see your Master

462
00:51:29,436 --> 00:51:33,024
Ji... you may all retire

463
00:51:43,978 --> 00:51:47,366
So, your school in a bit of a jam?

464
00:51:48,589 --> 00:51:53,966
I'm here to tell you that I'll continue
teaching martial arts even without a school

465
00:51:54,086 --> 00:51:56,232
And I'll never pay you a single cent!

466
00:51:56,586 --> 00:51:58,021
Don't ever harass my disciples again

467
00:51:58,035 --> 00:51:59,765
And don't get other people involved

468
00:51:59,885 --> 00:52:03,470
You are causing trouble by not following the rules

469
00:52:04,141 --> 00:52:05,893
If it weren't for me placating the Westerners

470
00:52:06,013 --> 00:52:09,633
Do you think everyone else can teach martial arts in peace?

471
00:52:09,753 --> 00:52:12,188
You chose to collude with the Westerners

472
00:52:12,308 --> 00:52:15,845
Yip Man, you only think about yourself

473
00:52:16,195 --> 00:52:20,183
You don't have 200 disciples, of course you
don't need the blessings of the Westerners

474
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:22,076
Of course you can take it easy

475
00:52:25,973 --> 00:52:29,138
I understand what you're saying

476
00:52:29,258 --> 00:52:34,356
As Masters, aren't we are obligated to guide our own disciples first?

477
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:37,591
My conscience is clear

478
00:52:38,168 --> 00:52:43,779
As you wish. If you're upset with
me in the future, come directly to me
Goodbye!

479
00:52:43,802 --> 00:52:44,920
Hold it!

480
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,449
You're not leaving that easily

481
00:52:47,685 --> 00:52:48,708
What do you want then?

482
00:52:49,155 --> 00:52:51,684
We did not finish our match earlier.
It's time to finish it

483
00:53:02,767 --> 00:53:04,320
Watch out!

484
00:53:09,253 --> 00:53:12,076
Husband, we've been waiting
for you to start dinner

485
00:53:12,196 --> 00:53:16,088
The children are hungry. Are you finished
discussing business?

486
00:53:30,063 --> 00:53:37,521
Master Hong, do you think it's more important to
have dinner with your family, or to finish the match?

487
00:53:41,832 --> 00:53:43,397
What does everyone want to eat?

488
00:53:43,517 --> 00:53:45,503
Ice cream!!

489
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:47,844
I'll bring you all out for ice cream after dinner

490
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,594
I'll take my leave, Master Hong

491
00:53:58,582 --> 00:54:01,029
Please see yourself out

492
00:54:20,164 --> 00:54:21,023
Master

493
00:54:21,282 --> 00:54:24,015
Come in

494
00:54:25,391 --> 00:54:26,862
Put it over there

495
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:28,921
Here, over here

496
00:54:28,933 --> 00:54:31,252
Why are the wooden men brought back home?

497
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:35,063
The rooftop is being rented
to someone else

498
00:54:35,616 --> 00:54:38,133
So I've brought them home

499
00:54:44,751 --> 00:54:49,951
Ok, you go on home. We'll start
training here tomorrow morning

500
00:54:50,233 --> 00:54:52,045
- Train here?
- Yes

501
00:54:52,374 --> 00:54:54,538
Be here early tomorrow morning

502
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:55,515
Bye Master

503
00:54:55,538 --> 00:54:56,303
Go home and relax

504
00:54:56,315 --> 00:54:58,056
Goodbye Master

505
00:55:06,148 --> 00:55:10,006
Master, I wish to talk to you

506
00:55:18,019 --> 00:55:21,630
Have some tea, Liang

507
00:55:26,045 --> 00:55:27,292
Have a seat

508
00:55:33,907 --> 00:55:39,284
Master, it's my fault that
you lost the school. I'm sorry

509
00:55:39,577 --> 00:55:42,848
Please, get up

510
00:55:43,486 --> 00:55:44,921
Get up

511
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:48,450
Come, sit down and we'll talk

512
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:01,011
Liang, do you think I'm very skilful?

513
00:56:01,894 --> 00:56:05,092
Of course! You can fight off 10 men!

514
00:56:05,188 --> 00:56:07,683
What about 20 years later?

515
00:56:08,474 --> 00:56:11,838
In 20 year's time, you can beat me easily

516
00:56:13,212 --> 00:56:15,363
People will grow old

517
00:56:15,915 --> 00:56:19,407
No one's invincible forever in this world

518
00:56:20,308 --> 00:56:25,050
Actually, you have a knack for martial arts

519
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:29,558
However, you're only focusing on the fighting techniques

520
00:56:30,168 --> 00:56:33,364
I want to you to understand the spirit in Chinese martial arts

521
00:56:33,484 --> 00:56:44,708
It enbodies the Chinese heart, mind and soul

522
00:56:51,171 --> 00:56:52,894
Understand?

523
00:56:56,233 --> 00:56:58,567
I'm trying to

524
00:57:03,238 --> 00:57:06,648
Want to hear a story?

525
00:57:08,157 --> 00:57:16,557
Years ago, I smacked the butt of that Master Jin we met in jail

526
00:57:17,562 --> 00:57:26,682
Back at Fo Shan, he came to my house
to fight me and messed my place up, so.....

527
00:57:41,811 --> 00:57:44,252
Are you practicing kung fu?

528
00:57:45,329 --> 00:57:48,739
Yes, I'll teach you when you grow up

529
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:50,599
Come on let's go

530
00:58:03,379 --> 00:58:04,708
Master, look

531
00:58:09,375 --> 00:58:11,780
Continue your practice

532
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,085
Fancy meeting you here

533
00:58:22,803 --> 00:58:25,065
I was in the neighbourhood

534
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:28,332
What do you want?

535
00:58:30,092 --> 00:58:34,436
I have extra tickets, and wondered
if you'd like to come too

536
00:58:34,556 --> 00:58:38,097
It's a Western boxing match

537
00:58:41,904 --> 00:58:43,841
Goodbye

538
00:58:44,667 --> 00:58:50,053
Master Hong, your eyes are red
Are you all right?

539
00:58:51,221 --> 00:58:54,814
Oh I've had it since morning. I'm
probably coming down with something

540
00:58:54,935 --> 00:58:56,821
I'll be fine after some herbal tea

541
00:58:57,253 --> 00:59:01,094
This is a nice place for training

542
00:59:09,926 --> 00:59:11,649
Place 3 rows here

543
00:59:11,769 --> 00:59:13,409
3 rows over there too

544
00:59:13,529 --> 00:59:14,773
Hurry up

545
00:59:23,712 --> 00:59:24,789
Master Hong

546
00:59:24,909 --> 00:59:27,668
Come over and say hi. I'll
introduce you to the Champion

547
00:59:32,885 --> 00:59:34,310
Hello

548
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:40,161
Ignore him. Westerners like to leave things around

549
00:59:41,885 --> 00:59:45,726
So when will we get our money?

550
00:59:46,731 --> 00:59:50,142
He keeps avoiding the subject

551
00:59:51,147 --> 00:59:53,050
Do it for free this time

552
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:57,418
Free? My men stopped working at
the fish stall to set this place up!

553
00:59:57,538 --> 01:00:03,668
Don't be upset, or else there'll be 
trouble. Take it as going on a diet

554
01:00:05,319 --> 01:00:06,756
This isn't the first time

555
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:08,155
Master Hong!

556
01:00:11,027 --> 01:00:12,320
Chief

557
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:16,341
It's ok not to pay me. However my men
need to eat. You have to pay them

558
01:00:16,461 --> 01:00:19,500
Don't speak to me about money now

559
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:21,726
If not money, then love?

560
01:00:34,244 --> 01:00:36,206
Now you've made him angry

561
01:00:36,326 --> 01:00:37,929
If he's not paying, I'm quitting

562
01:00:45,576 --> 01:00:48,161
If you quit, he'll take your 
fish stall too. Just bear with it

563
01:00:48,282 --> 01:00:50,674
Bear with it? I've tolerated it for a long time!

564
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,278
Speak Chinese, not English!

565
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:07,120
You heard him. Let's go

566
01:01:08,112 --> 01:01:09,491
We quit too! Let's go

567
01:01:09,611 --> 01:01:10,796
Let's go

568
01:01:10,916 --> 01:01:12,193
Hold on!

569
01:01:12,723 --> 01:01:15,899
Look, they'll get in trouble because of you

570
01:01:18,737 --> 01:01:20,595
You guys stay and work

571
01:01:23,467 --> 01:01:26,973
Let's get back to work

572
01:01:28,830 --> 01:01:30,030
Come on

573
01:01:32,173 --> 01:01:36,690
Don't be angry. He will get his retribution

574
01:02:03,431 --> 01:02:04,675
- Master Yip
- Master Hong

575
01:02:05,068 --> 01:02:06,040
Thank you for the tickets

576
01:02:06,303 --> 01:02:09,295
There will be a demonstration of kung fu
from every school on stage later

577
01:02:09,415 --> 01:02:11,366
Please ask your disciples to show yours off

578
01:02:11,752 --> 01:02:14,686
Let more people learn about your Wing Chun

579
01:02:15,475 --> 01:02:16,327
Yes of course

580
01:02:17,133 --> 01:02:17,939
See you later

581
01:02:33,845 --> 01:02:35,657
Hey you, get ready

582
01:02:36,692 --> 01:02:38,080
- You 2 go up too
- Ok

583
01:02:40,174 --> 01:02:41,692
Go up and join them

584
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:43,672
Let's go

585
01:02:45,331 --> 01:02:46,684
This isn't good

586
01:02:47,085 --> 01:02:51,470
It's not your money that is used to
promote Chinese martial arts

587
01:05:56,569 --> 01:05:58,005
Stop fighting!

588
01:05:59,322 --> 01:06:00,287
Stop fighting!

589
01:06:00,977 --> 01:06:03,082
Break it up! Stop fighting!

590
01:06:05,729 --> 01:06:06,200
What do we do?

591
01:06:13,323 --> 01:06:15,746
Everyone, stop fighting!

592
01:06:19,181 --> 01:06:19,876
Stop fighting!

593
01:06:21,624 --> 01:06:23,377
Break it up!

594
01:06:24,377 --> 01:06:25,460
Stop!

595
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:26,307
Stop fighting!

596
01:06:28,648 --> 01:06:29,307
Stop it!

597
01:06:30,118 --> 01:06:31,259
Calm down!

598
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:34,371
Stop fighting!

599
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:35,994
Calm down!

600
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:37,324
Everyone please calm down

601
01:06:39,747 --> 01:06:40,864
Liang!

602
01:06:42,634 --> 01:06:43,552
Bring him down

603
01:06:44,151 --> 01:06:45,139
Xin, help please

604
01:06:46,580 --> 01:06:48,786
Slowly! Slowly!

605
01:06:59,438 --> 01:07:00,720
Come here, MC

606
01:07:04,485 --> 01:07:07,814
If you don't like our demonstration,
you are free to leave

607
01:07:08,437 --> 01:07:10,990
But you've caused injuries, 
you need to apologise

608
01:07:44,671 --> 01:07:45,812
I will fight!

609
01:07:46,446 --> 01:07:47,481
I will flatten him to the ground!

610
01:07:47,482 --> 01:07:48,611
Until he apologises!

611
01:07:48,634 --> 01:07:49,470
Kill the Westerner!

612
01:07:49,988 --> 01:07:53,235
Fellow masters, leave this to me

613
01:07:54,609 --> 01:07:56,680
Everyone please stand down

614
01:07:57,138 --> 01:07:59,620
Fine, we'll stand down

615
01:09:27,841 --> 01:09:28,829
Thank you

616
01:09:35,005 --> 01:09:38,805
Master Hong, are you good?

617
01:09:40,354 --> 01:09:41,625
I'm good, no problem

618
01:09:43,625 --> 01:09:48,212
In the next round, don't go head on
with him. Attack his biceps

619
01:09:51,955 --> 01:09:53,896
It won't be that easy

620
01:11:48,669 --> 01:11:52,911
Oh no! Master's having an asthma attack

621
01:12:34,256 --> 01:12:36,268
Please stop the fight, Master Hong

622
01:12:38,609 --> 01:12:41,256
I won't let these Westerners belittle us

623
01:12:41,269 --> 01:12:42,881
Don't get maimed just for pride

624
01:12:43,822 --> 01:12:45,446
I can tolerate if it's only my life

625
01:12:46,296 --> 01:12:48,261
But not if it's the entire Chinese martial arts world

626
01:13:36,955 --> 01:13:38,472
Master...

627
01:14:35,794 --> 01:14:39,069
Master, yield!

628
01:14:41,912 --> 01:14:42,716
Master!

629
01:17:00,734 --> 01:17:09,990
Master Hong, I have the utmost respect for you

630
01:17:33,164 --> 01:17:39,123
(Master Hong of Hong style school killed in a Western boxing match)

631
01:18:12,136 --> 01:18:13,651
- What's happening?
- Sit down!

632
01:18:15,558 --> 01:18:19,316
None of your business. Sit down

633
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:26,665
Who's the editor?

634
01:18:29,021 --> 01:18:30,235
What's up?

635
01:18:30,355 --> 01:18:31,618
Arrest him

636
01:18:31,619 --> 01:18:33,193
Sir!

637
01:18:52,075 --> 01:18:52,884
Please don't!

638
01:18:53,413 --> 01:18:54,310
No, please!

639
01:18:55,530 --> 01:18:56,207
No!

640
01:19:01,133 --> 01:19:04,007
Sir!

641
01:19:06,488 --> 01:19:11,129
It won't look good for you. He'll continue
to give you bad press if you continue the beatings

642
01:19:11,249 --> 01:19:14,411
I will deal with him. Leave it to me

643
01:19:15,347 --> 01:19:19,043
Fat Aunt, you must set him straight

644
01:22:02,236 --> 01:22:05,143
How can he say such things?

645
01:22:05,263 --> 01:22:07,693
The Chinese don't use joss sticks just to mark time

646
01:22:13,259 --> 01:22:15,097
The Chinese practice of burning joss sticks

647
01:22:15,217 --> 01:22:20,427
Other than measuring time, and more
importantly, it is to honour our ancestors

648
01:22:21,016 --> 01:22:23,038
It's the Chinese culture

649
01:22:25,776 --> 01:22:28,810
Mr Milos

650
01:22:29,103 --> 01:22:30,353
I challenge you

651
01:23:06,990 --> 01:23:10,400
Chun, eat quickly. Don't let Mrs Fang wait

652
01:23:12,285 --> 01:23:15,472
I'll see you off later

653
01:23:37,717 --> 01:23:41,127
Mama, why must we stay over at Mrs Fang's?

654
01:23:41,891 --> 01:23:46,109
Because Daddy wants to train

655
01:23:48,398 --> 01:23:50,821
Here, let me

656
01:23:50,941 --> 01:23:53,469
- Sorry for the trouble
- It's no trouble

657
01:23:53,589 --> 01:23:55,713
The boy is Yip Chun

658
01:23:56,207 --> 01:23:58,764
Mr Yip, you must beat that Westerner!

659
01:24:00,066 --> 01:24:02,445
I'll bring these in first

660
01:24:18,314 --> 01:24:21,373
Don't worry about us. Concentrate on your training

661
01:24:22,373 --> 01:24:23,702
But don't stay up too late

662
01:24:24,408 --> 01:24:26,326
You must win

663
01:24:32,234 --> 01:24:33,598
Let's go

664
01:24:34,764 --> 01:24:35,716
You go on home

665
01:24:49,907 --> 01:24:53,366
Normally I live alone. Just make yourselves at home

666
01:24:54,848 --> 01:24:55,907
This is your bed

667
01:25:12,728 --> 01:25:13,877
It's ok. Continue

668
01:25:15,234 --> 01:25:17,849
I said, continue!

669
01:25:24,122 --> 01:25:25,087
What's wrong?

670
01:25:25,707 --> 01:25:27,545
Police!

671
01:25:29,499 --> 01:25:30,556
What are you writing?

672
01:25:31,544 --> 01:25:32,439
Still dare to write?

673
01:25:33,266 --> 01:25:34,944
Not afraid of another beating?

674
01:25:37,830 --> 01:25:42,196
"Wing Chun Master accepts challenge to a Western boxing match"

675
01:25:42,317 --> 01:25:44,218
Do you think that's good enough?

676
01:25:44,338 --> 01:25:47,503
Why not "Western Dog Soundly Defeated"?

677
01:25:53,131 --> 01:25:56,590
"Reporter endures Police brutality for the truth"

678
01:25:56,606 --> 01:25:58,651
But did you get the truth?

679
01:25:58,658 --> 01:25:59,563
I have the truth!

680
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:05,400
You have guts. I'll give you the truth
and you write about him till he is ruined

681
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:06,743
Ok, ok!

682
01:26:07,756 --> 01:26:11,390
That Chief hates us Chinese. Always bullies us

683
01:26:11,510 --> 01:26:15,212
I'll break the real news to you, 
you report it. It will finish him off!

684
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:43,204
Mrs Yip, what's wrong?

685
01:26:43,324 --> 01:26:45,797
Oh you're in labour! Chun, go fetch your father!

686
01:26:45,917 --> 01:26:48,056
No, I don't want to distract him

687
01:26:48,444 --> 01:26:49,950
Then I'll go get a midwife

688
01:26:50,070 --> 01:26:51,697
Chun, take care of your mom

689
01:27:12,504 --> 01:27:14,351
Master Zhang, over there!

690
01:27:20,204 --> 01:27:23,308
The Hong Kong Chinese-Western Boxing Match will start soon

691
01:27:23,538 --> 01:27:26,067
The hall is packed with both Chinese and Westerners

692
01:27:26,187 --> 01:27:27,761
It's very lively here

693
01:27:27,979 --> 01:27:31,108
There are Chinese judges in the judging panel this time

694
01:27:31,325 --> 01:27:34,465
Hopefully it will be a truly fair and impartial match

695
01:27:34,586 --> 01:27:36,559
Don't go away folks!

696
01:27:36,679 --> 01:27:38,700
I tell you, he'll go down in 3 strikes

697
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:41,753
No, I mean he'll defeat the Westener in 3 strikes

698
01:27:41,873 --> 01:27:45,284
Master Yip, are you confident of beating him?

699
01:27:45,404 --> 01:27:49,179
You must win!

700
01:27:49,299 --> 01:27:52,378
Are you fighting for yourself, or for Chinese martial arts?

701
01:28:21,743 --> 01:28:24,214
The Twister is making an entrance

702
01:29:27,525 --> 01:29:31,107
Good! Yip Man can't wait to kick his ass

703
01:29:35,056 --> 01:29:36,091
Master...

704
01:30:34,395 --> 01:30:37,913
Master Yip, kick his ass like how you kicked mine!

705
01:30:38,033 --> 01:30:39,289
Anyone can kick your ass

706
01:30:39,409 --> 01:30:40,233
Shut up!

707
01:30:44,157 --> 01:30:46,511
Both of them are sizing each other up

708
01:31:38,535 --> 01:31:40,429
Master Yip!

709
01:31:43,088 --> 01:31:43,746
Master!

710
01:31:44,052 --> 01:31:47,437
Master Yip has been knocked down! They're going to start the knockout count

711
01:31:48,708 --> 01:31:51,225
Master Yip! Get up!

712
01:31:51,345 --> 01:31:54,201
He appears to be injured. I'm not 
sure if he can even stand up

713
01:32:05,426 --> 01:32:07,602
Master Yip seems ok, and he's up

714
01:32:41,798 --> 01:32:44,798
This time it's The Twister that's knocked down

715
01:33:47,231 --> 01:33:47,890
Good work, Master!

716
01:33:48,010 --> 01:33:52,831
That bloody Westerner... still standing even after so many hits

717
01:34:15,090 --> 01:34:17,513
Master Yip is attacking with his Wing Chun

718
01:34:25,397 --> 01:34:42,546
(chanting) Master Yip! Master Yip! Master Yip!

719
01:34:54,070 --> 01:34:56,574
Hey that's cheating!

720
01:34:58,688 --> 01:35:01,353
You animal! The bell has gone!

721
01:35:07,006 --> 01:35:09,303
Master, Master!

722
01:36:52,591 --> 01:36:54,038
Master!

723
01:36:54,497 --> 01:36:55,600
Master!

724
01:36:55,720 --> 01:36:58,977
Oh my God! Master Yip is down after
a knockout blow from The Twister!

725
01:37:00,793 --> 01:37:02,700
Master, get up!

726
01:37:03,136 --> 01:37:05,480
Get up! Get up!

727
01:37:05,940 --> 01:37:08,720
Get up, Master!

728
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:11,801
"We cannot allow the Westerners to belittle us"

729
01:37:12,514 --> 01:37:14,628
"I can bear it if it's just my life"

730
01:37:15,064 --> 01:37:17,407
"But I cannot tolerate it if it's the entire Chinese martial arts world"

731
01:37:44,985 --> 01:37:48,385
"Master Hong, don't go head on with him. Attack his biceps"

732
01:37:48,505 --> 01:37:49,695
"It won't be that easy"

733

10!

740
01:39:25,948 --> 01:39:28,471
Daddy's won! Daddy's won! Yay!

741
01:40:04,123 --> 01:40:05,406
I know Yip Man!

742
01:40:05,527 --> 01:40:06,935
Dude, everyone here knows Yip Man

743
01:40:07,055 --> 01:40:11,353
Huo Yan Jia, Huang Fei Hong, Yip Man
and me. The 4 Dragons of Fo Shan!

744
01:42:26,634 --> 01:42:28,496
Master Yip!

745
01:42:29,323 --> 01:42:31,736
What do you want to do now?

746
01:42:33,987 --> 01:42:36,101
I want to go home

747
01:43:20,281 --> 01:43:21,775
He looks like you

748
01:43:24,257 --> 01:43:25,704
What shall we call him?

749
01:43:26,485 --> 01:43:27,405
How about Yip Ching?

750
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:30,480
I want him to be an upright person

751
01:43:30,738 --> 01:43:31,350
Ok

752
01:43:32,154 --> 01:43:32,990
He looks like you

753
01:44:02,681 --> 01:44:03,457
Uncle Man

754
01:44:03,782 --> 01:44:08,076
I have a new friend, and he
wants to learn kung fu from you

755
01:44:08,196 --> 01:44:09,299
Come in

756
01:44:14,489 --> 01:44:16,618
I want to learn from you. How much?

757
01:44:25,972 --> 01:44:26,842
What's your name?

758
01:44:26,962 --> 01:44:29,044
I'm Bruce Lee

759
01:44:30,548 --> 01:44:32,336
Why do you want to learn how to fight?

760
01:44:32,457 --> 01:44:34,972
So that I can beat up people I don't like

761
01:44:37,326 --> 01:44:38,667
Very spirited

762
01:44:41,409 --> 01:44:44,067
Come back when you've grown up

763
01:45:01,358 --> 01:45:06,946
(In 1956, 16 year-old Bruce Lee became Yip Man's disciple)

764
01:45:07,393 --> 01:45:13,998
(Bruce Lee studied Wing Chun extensively and helped promote it)

765
01:45:14,538 --> 01:45:20,531
(Yip Man spent the next 22 years teaching Wing Chun
and spreading it all over the world)

766
01:45:22,977 --> 01:45:26,964
(For the glory of Chinese martial arts)
