1
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:34,606
It's a cloud I live on,
and it up and down goes

2
00:00:35,151 --> 00:00:39,087
Although you can't see me,
I know what you want

3
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:43,648
I may not be too big,
but I am your buddy

4
00:00:44,194 --> 00:00:50,190
Should I see you crying,
I will come down flying

5
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:54,926
Call me if you need me,
go on, close your peepers

6
00:00:55,338 --> 00:00:59,331
If there's motivation,
you'll have my protection

7
00:00:59,943 --> 00:01:03,902
I turn myself unseen
when I come from heaven

8
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:10,545
Should I see you crying,
I will come down flying

9
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:20,723
I'm a tiny, tiny, tiny angel,
all the same I will take care of you

10
00:01:21,865 --> 00:01:31,137
Your Guardian Angel, sweet companion,
day or night you'll never be alone

11
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:39,243
It's a doll they say I resemble
'cause of cotton my wings are all made

12
00:01:39,783 --> 00:01:48,851
I can take a leap, right up to the sky,
run round all day never touch the ground

13
00:02:08,812 --> 00:02:10,609
December 24th

14
00:02:13,149 --> 00:02:16,050
Practiced plastic surgery
on my wife the other day.

15
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,947
Cut up all her credit cards.

16
00:02:23,193 --> 00:02:24,285
Doctor, doctor.

17
00:02:24,427 --> 00:02:27,225
Come on kids, closer together.
Right, that's it, there... OK.

18
00:02:31,768 --> 00:02:36,762
Grandma... Granny, give us a smile,
Granny... look over... there, there we go.

19
00:02:42,812 --> 00:02:44,643
Yeah, get down!

20
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:48,609
Louder!
Let's hear it!

21
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:54,583
When my Grandma turned sixty...

22
00:02:54,724 --> 00:02:58,319
the doctor advised her to walk
2 miles a day...

23
00:02:58,528 --> 00:03:01,190
she's now ninety
and we can't find her.

24
00:03:16,212 --> 00:03:19,272
OK.
Daniela... where's Daniela?

25
00:03:19,649 --> 00:03:21,082
I see 'ya.

26
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:25,017
Emilio, your uncle,
came all the way from Buenos Aires...

27
00:03:25,521 --> 00:03:28,319
to dedicate this song to you.

28
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,620
Emilio, come on up.

29
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,662
Emilio!

30
00:03:44,574 --> 00:03:48,237
Jaime says goodnight to you all,
see you the next Bat Mitzvah.

31
00:03:58,221 --> 00:04:03,887
Daniela, baby, with all my heart,
this song's just for you.

32
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,431
Juanchi.
Juanchi.

33
00:05:00,683 --> 00:05:05,052
I'd stay but I have to be at the airport
two hours before the flight.

34
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,149
It's OK, OK.
Don't worry.

35
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,870
Dani, this one's for you,
with all my heart.

36
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:27,642
And to you, Juan.

37
00:05:27,844 --> 00:05:31,371
You're off the hook 'cause of your arm,
otherwise you'd be out here dancing.

38
00:05:33,049 --> 00:05:38,180
And to all Rosario, to the musicians,
to you all.

39
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,755
Dani...

40
00:06:26,903 --> 00:06:30,839
- Should we sit him down there?
- Don't put him there, it's all pissed.

41
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,439
OK, there.

42
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:37,738
- This guy sure is heavy, man.
- On the floor.

43
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,111
There we go... watch the head.

44
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:50,118
Don't worry...

45
00:06:50,359 --> 00:06:53,817
Raise his legs.
Let's see, up we go... up, up...

46
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,691
There we are.

47
00:06:58,868 --> 00:07:00,597
Can't go so far.

48
00:07:00,703 --> 00:07:02,728
- Did you eat anything?
- No, nothing.

49
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,439
Bring a potato knish.

50
00:07:06,275 --> 00:07:09,142
No, what he needs is
something strong to drink.

51
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:11,406
Or some coffee, some...

52
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,206
How about we keep quiet for a while,
just relax a bit...

53
00:07:15,485 --> 00:07:18,818
I couldn't hold it in any longer.
I was grinding on my false teeth.

54
00:07:18,988 --> 00:07:20,615
- What's up, Jaime?
- What's up, Chubby?

55
00:07:20,723 --> 00:07:23,123
How you been?
Hey, long time no see.

56
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:29,459
Well, been at least thirty pounds.
Son of a gun, you never change.

57
00:07:29,632 --> 00:07:34,433
Hey, did you meet Zipora?
Jaime, Juancho Zipora.

58
00:07:34,837 --> 00:07:36,065
What's up?

59
00:07:36,806 --> 00:07:39,138
Hey, Emilio, we could get a move on, hu?

60
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:42,343
No, man. We said we'd leave
an hour and a half from now.

61
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:46,879
I know, but I gotta go home and get
my suitcase before going to the airport.

62
00:07:46,983 --> 00:07:50,942
- But we already knew that, Juan.
- Yeah, but something's come up, Emilio.

63
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,386
Listen to what I'm saying.
Do you get it?

64
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,894
Yes, but we said we'd leave
an hour and a half from now.

65
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:05,126
Yes, I know we said an hour and a half,

66
00:08:05,201 --> 00:08:08,364
but I am asking, as a favor,
because something's come up... now.

67
00:08:08,471 --> 00:08:12,373
- Yeah, I also have something to do now.
- And what if I miss my flight?

68
00:08:12,508 --> 00:08:16,069
No, no, serious,
what if there's a traffic jam?

69
00:08:16,179 --> 00:08:18,704
Juan, what can I say? We said we'd
leave an hour and a half from now,

70
00:08:18,781 --> 00:08:21,079
so what I say is, OK, let's leave
an hour and a half from now.

71
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:25,211
I'm asking you, please,
I need to get go Buenos Aires, now.

72
00:08:25,621 --> 00:08:28,089
I'm on my way to Buenos Aires,
if you want, I'll give you a lift.

73
00:08:28,224 --> 00:08:31,250
There we go, Jaime'll drive you. Good.

74
00:08:31,394 --> 00:08:34,329
- But, are you leaving right away?
- Right away, no.

75
00:08:35,331 --> 00:08:37,697
I gotta wait till I get paid,
then we're off.

76
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,338
- Thought we were losing him.
- Better?

77
00:08:44,507 --> 00:08:47,203
- Want me to drive you home?
- I think he still looks a little pale.

78
00:08:49,312 --> 00:08:52,543
But you said you had limos available,
why do you suddenly say you don't?

79
00:08:53,182 --> 00:08:55,742
Yes, to Buenos Aires...
I told you already!

80
00:08:56,419 --> 00:09:00,412
I know it's a holid... So what?
There are also emergencies on this date,

81
00:09:00,556 --> 00:09:05,391
man... come on... It doesn't take...
on the highway it's three hours.

82
00:09:05,494 --> 00:09:08,395
Look, if a driver had already picked me
up, we'd have gone and...

83
00:09:08,497 --> 00:09:13,161
he'd already be back to spend Christmas
Eve with his... How much is it?

84
00:09:13,369 --> 00:09:17,465
But I already told you that money
is no concern! I'll pay for it.

85
00:09:17,607 --> 00:09:19,973
Listen, I've got an emergency too.
I've got to get to Buenos Aires,

86
00:09:20,076 --> 00:09:22,840
I've a plane to catch,
I can't be... I can't wait...

87
00:09:22,945 --> 00:09:27,314
I can't wait for an hour,
I'd go with someone who's also going,

88
00:09:27,683 --> 00:09:31,619
listen, do you have a car?
Well, look, I'm on Córdoba street and...

89
00:09:32,922 --> 00:09:37,586
Juan Manuel de... at the Monument
to the Flag. Yes, where...

90
00:09:38,694 --> 00:09:41,094
No, I am not putting you on.

91
00:09:41,364 --> 00:09:44,299
And who's driving me?
Hu? Who'll drive me?

92
00:09:44,634 --> 00:09:45,532
Hello?

93
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,033
Hello!

94
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,771
Let's not spoil the fun, OK?

95
00:09:50,906 --> 00:09:52,840
A big hug to the "Mother Goose"
family from Ramallo...

96
00:09:52,975 --> 00:09:55,842
There's Rabbi Goldstein playing
this week's top song,

97
00:09:55,978 --> 00:09:59,778
let's play this...
it fits like a glove.

98
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:12,786
Total crap, man. Hey, we got everything
for drinking some "mates" later, OK?

99
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:18,425
Sure, why not? I got a mate, holly,
thermos, all back here, look.

100
00:10:19,735 --> 00:10:23,262
There's also a sandwich in the
glove compartment. You can have it.

101
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:31,404
- Tired, right?
- No, not tired. Stuff.

102
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,376
- Stuff.
- Stuff.

103
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:39,181
That girl, the one was watching you.
That then left with another guy.

104
00:10:39,455 --> 00:10:43,152
- Hu?
- A nice looking girl.

105
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:47,787
Well, holidays stink, you know?
You get stimuli from all quarters.

106
00:10:48,164 --> 00:10:50,132
- Right.
- Well, yeah.

107
00:10:50,266 --> 00:10:55,932
And relationships... well.
Gotta take it easy.

108
00:10:56,672 --> 00:11:01,609
- Then things happen.
- Sure.

109
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,940
Matters of the heart.

110
00:11:05,114 --> 00:11:08,208
Or of this one here, that demands and
demands and doesn't ever stop.

111
00:11:12,321 --> 00:11:15,984
Thing is... I miss her.

112
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:20,255
So, we'll go back. We turn back.
Hit reverse and go back.

113
00:11:22,865 --> 00:11:25,390
A nice girl.
If I were you...

114
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:34,440
- Got any smokes?
- No, I don't smoke.

115
00:11:35,511 --> 00:11:36,808
Then get off.

116
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:41,616
I'm fooling with 'ya.

117
00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:47,346
So you'll change that look on your face,
come on, no long face.

118
00:11:47,757 --> 00:11:49,315
But we gotta get some, OK?

119
00:11:49,425 --> 00:11:52,588
We gotta get some soon 'cause
I'll die if I don't have a smoke.

120
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,089
I'll die of cancer.

121
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,026
Well, grandpa, better?

122
00:12:01,704 --> 00:12:04,468
We're trying to get a hold
of your daughter. You just take it easy.

123
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,130
Sorry,

124
00:12:06,442 --> 00:12:10,674
even if it were the starter and I
put my battery, it'd be the same.

125
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,510
- Then, the bendix.
- The bendix?

126
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:17,085
Yeah. The way you left it you should've
gotten some fuel, get it?

127
00:12:17,219 --> 00:12:21,178
It's a good battery. I don't get it.
Now, you use it at night,

128
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:26,026
lights on, you know?
it'll use up more than it recharges.

129
00:12:26,128 --> 00:12:30,224
Then it's the alternator.
The fan belt... skids.

130
00:12:38,641 --> 00:12:41,007
Relax, everything went well, OK?

131
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,409
Your wife is fine and so is the baby.
So...

132
00:12:44,713 --> 00:12:46,772
Thank you, doctor.
God bless you.

133
00:12:47,082 --> 00:12:51,542
I'd ask you to please go wait downstairs
in a few minutes.

134
00:12:51,754 --> 00:12:54,746
I let you stay for a while,
it's dangerous now.

135
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:58,016
- Yes, of course, doctor. Of course.
- Thank you.

136
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,593
It's a boy!

137
00:13:07,503 --> 00:13:09,130
Merry Christmas, doctor.

138
00:13:17,513 --> 00:13:21,176
Nothing, he was doing better and...
all of a sudden, cardiac arrest.

139
00:14:54,243 --> 00:14:57,007
- Excuse me, sir. Can I help you?
- Hi, how are you? Yeah. Good evening,

140
00:14:57,112 --> 00:14:59,137
I'd like one of these please.

141
00:14:59,281 --> 00:15:04,776
- Yes, but that toy's all sold out.
- Serious? I can't believe it.

142
00:15:06,088 --> 00:15:08,488
No, you see, my son, that's the only
thing he asked Santa for.

143
00:15:08,591 --> 00:15:12,960
- Well, we're all out of stock,
not even one left. - Nothing?

144
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,799
What I can offer you is this rifle
that's just come out,

145
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,460
it shoots these ducks that are
projected on a screen,

146
00:15:20,603 --> 00:15:24,664
as the ducks fly by,
if you hit them, they fall.

147
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,601
- Got tons of realism.
- No, no thanks.

148
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:29,269
- It's got sound. - No, thank you.
- You also got Spiderman.

149
00:15:29,378 --> 00:15:32,108
- What's Spiderman do?
- I don't think he does anything.

150
00:15:32,214 --> 00:15:34,375
- Wait, let me ask my partner here.
- No, it's OK,

151
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:37,349
I'm looking for this robot that...

152
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,181
Yes, but I've just told you
we're all sold out.

153
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:44,884
- It releases smoke, the head opens...
- Yes, I know, but it's all sold out.

154
00:15:45,394 --> 00:15:47,328
Any idea where I might get one?

155
00:15:47,563 --> 00:15:50,623
No, it's real hard.
I don't have a clue.

156
00:15:53,302 --> 00:15:56,829
Nothing, what could be wrong?
What's with my voice?

157
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:00,967
No, hon, nothing's wrong with my voice.
No, nothing's wrong.

158
00:16:01,243 --> 00:16:05,976
I'll be there at ten.
Don't worry, everything's OK.

159
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:12,717
Absolutely. How could it upset me that
it's just the 3 of us if it was my idea?

160
00:16:13,355 --> 00:16:16,552
It was my idea.
No, not sooner, won't make it.

161
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,819
I haven't gotten Pini's present yet,
can't get it anywhere.

162
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:25,829
The robot. The one with
the smoke pouring out of his head.

163
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,296
- Hey guys.
- What's up?

164
00:16:28,303 --> 00:16:32,899
People don't have a dime, hu?
People are dead.

165
00:16:33,175 --> 00:16:35,769
These are the dead that buy.
Look at 'em buy.

166
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,808
Give me some candy?

167
00:16:39,548 --> 00:16:42,984
- You only got fruit?
- I got strawberry, coconut.

168
00:16:43,118 --> 00:16:44,608
- No coffee?
- No.

169
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,481
- Sure?
- No!

170
00:16:47,489 --> 00:16:49,320
Then I don't want any, thanks.

171
00:16:51,126 --> 00:16:54,289
- Ramón Díaz is Argentina's best
coach around. - If you say so.

172
00:16:54,396 --> 00:16:55,886
Happy holidays.

173
00:17:00,736 --> 00:17:03,068
Hey, can't we go a little faster?

174
00:17:04,173 --> 00:17:07,006
I'm bushed.
Haven't caught any shut eye in two days.

175
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:11,576
You'll have to serve me some mate, gimme
some jawing, anything to keep me up...

176
00:17:11,714 --> 00:17:16,208
- I'd drive but I busted my arm.
- No, I'm not sleeping any 'cause...

177
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:19,049
I got parties, birthdays,
something different every night.

178
00:17:19,154 --> 00:17:23,921
- Lucky thing. - Hey, ain't complaining.
I gotta live this streak to the max.

179
00:17:25,894 --> 00:17:28,454
- I like your show.
- Really?

180
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:34,095
I think it's crap, pure trash.
But I still do it.

181
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:37,295
I don't like it, but do it all the same.
It's a living.

182
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,543
I'm trying this other show out,
different, intelligent humor,

183
00:17:42,678 --> 00:17:45,943
social criticism,
touring the private neighborhoods.

184
00:17:46,048 --> 00:17:47,572
Still, what you do is...

185
00:17:47,683 --> 00:17:51,483
Look, I act the clown to stop being one,
do you catch my drift?

186
00:17:54,123 --> 00:17:56,091
I act the clown to stop being one.

187
00:17:57,426 --> 00:18:00,054
- Hey, Jaime, aren't we going a bit slow?
- No, not at all,

188
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,186
you have no idea what a
good grip these tires have.

189
00:18:02,264 --> 00:18:05,700
Besides, I've been driving since I was
ten. I've driven mail delivery vans too.

190
00:18:06,101 --> 00:18:10,538
- I've driven... camiones de caudales.
- Please face the front.

191
00:18:12,407 --> 00:18:19,711
I'm a tiny, tiny, tiny angel,
all the same I will take care of you,

192
00:18:20,649 --> 00:18:29,819
Your Guardian Angel, sweet companion,
day or night you'll never be all alone

193
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:37,162
Shivery Spring

194
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:28,945
What is it, "Quiet Beauty"?
Oh, "Shivery Spring", very good piece.

195
00:19:29,685 --> 00:19:32,654
Actually, one of the best novels
I've read lately.

196
00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:35,518
I've read it a few times.

197
00:19:35,858 --> 00:19:38,884
Oh. Where are you...? From...?

198
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:47,134
This ghost.

199
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,705
Hello.

200
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,372
You'll never guess what I have
in this box.

201
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:05,409
A kitty? - A kitty, it'd have to be
a tiny one. Let's see...

202
00:20:06,822 --> 00:20:12,385
- Let me see. No, it's not a kitty.
- A doggy?

203
00:20:13,996 --> 00:20:16,590
Oh, maybe.
Let's see.

204
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,105
No, that's not it.

205
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:29,176
Look, this girl has a bird tattooed
on her shoulder, take a good look,

206
00:20:29,912 --> 00:20:32,745
- That's a seagull.
- It's an albatross.

207
00:20:32,848 --> 00:20:35,976
Oh, OK, an albatross. She used to have
one on the other side, it flew off...

208
00:20:36,084 --> 00:20:41,147
and landed in my box.
So now I have it. You believe me?

209
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,792
Yes.

210
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,261
It's a very good book, it...

211
00:20:52,734 --> 00:20:57,933
the author has like, a naiveté and is at
the same time completely sensitive, right?

212
00:20:59,474 --> 00:21:01,271
No.

213
00:21:01,476 --> 00:21:04,843
Man uses electricity,
knows how to produce it but...

214
00:21:04,947 --> 00:21:07,973
what does he really know about
the origin of the phenomenon?

215
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:11,347
We don't even know anything
about ourselves. Right?

216
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,580
- Man doesn't know many things.
- How about a drink?

217
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,487
Sit down somewhere to have a drink?

218
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:20,925
Don't misunderstand me, I...
I'm going the same way you are.

219
00:21:21,096 --> 00:21:22,586
Don't think I'm following you,
or anything...

220
00:21:22,731 --> 00:21:24,562
- If you think...
- I don't think a thing.

221
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,029
Admit you're following me.

222
00:22:02,337 --> 00:22:07,331
- You... what's your name?
- I don't have a name.

223
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:11,905
Wow, what a good mystery.
Come on... what's your name?

224
00:22:13,782 --> 00:22:16,842
- What? Didn't you like mysteries?
- Yeah, but...

225
00:22:19,121 --> 00:22:22,522
- What do you have in the box?
- Mystery.

226
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:25,889
I'll tell you my name if you tell me
what you have in the box.

227
00:22:25,994 --> 00:22:29,157
- An albatross. What's your name?
- Albatross.

228
00:22:29,297 --> 00:22:32,027
Thing is, people are real shitty,
you know? The comedian, imitator...

229
00:22:32,134 --> 00:22:35,035
gagman, clown, it's all the same.

230
00:22:35,137 --> 00:22:37,867
'Cause, if they gotta cut someone's
head off, they just cut them all off.

231
00:22:37,973 --> 00:22:40,874
Like Herod, used to cut off kids' heads.

232
00:22:40,976 --> 00:22:43,570
Moses was saved in the nick of time.

233
00:22:44,413 --> 00:22:47,143
- Or was it Christ?
- Hu?

234
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,744
- Moses.
- Right, 'cause Christ...

235
00:22:50,886 --> 00:22:54,014
played Little League soccer,
well, they all wore beards those days.

236
00:22:57,526 --> 00:23:00,791
The craziest thing is that I think up
better clown's stuff every day,

237
00:23:01,329 --> 00:23:03,627
it's real weird, real weird.

238
00:23:04,766 --> 00:23:09,794
- Hey, was this here this morning?
- I don't know.

239
00:23:26,421 --> 00:23:29,447
Murderers!
Cut it out!

240
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:32,059
What is this?
Beasts!

241
00:23:32,427 --> 00:23:37,558
Learn some respect. Yeah, you! Geek!
Please, mister, do me a favor,

242
00:23:37,766 --> 00:23:41,532
won't you get me out of here? Gimme a
hand, I beg 'ya, I'm truly surrounded.

243
00:23:41,603 --> 00:23:44,902
- Yes, of course. Let's see.
- Yeah, laugh on! Pardon miss,

244
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:49,670
I didn't mea... you, yeah...
deep-dyed, ya look like a doll.

245
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:53,445
This is the Argentina we have,
sir.

246
00:23:53,648 --> 00:23:57,243
- They're just kids. - They're kids,
yeah, but they'll grow up sometime.

247
00:23:57,385 --> 00:23:59,649
Afterwards we can't...
this is the country we have.

248
00:23:59,754 --> 00:24:02,416
Woah, pal, Cachoi,
you're busting up my chair.

249
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:07,624
Yeah, well, Planet Earth isn't a bad place
to be in, quite the contrary,

250
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:11,097
it's a great place,
the problem here is us...

251
00:24:11,633 --> 00:24:14,329
as the General used to say,
"The more I observe human beings,

252
00:24:14,402 --> 00:24:17,667
the more I love my dogs." We're rushing
along a bit fast for my taste, OK?

253
00:24:17,906 --> 00:24:19,669
Woah, woah, hold it, Cachoi, hold it.

254
00:24:20,475 --> 00:24:23,842
How about if we go sit down somewhere?

255
00:24:25,614 --> 00:24:28,447
- Didn't you say you were on call?
- Yeah, it's true, but...

256
00:24:29,284 --> 00:24:33,015
later I could get away for a while...
enough to get something to drink.

257
00:24:33,922 --> 00:24:38,256
Avermouth, how tasty.
Whoa, hold it, hold it!

258
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:43,194
Hold it, Cachoi. Let's see, princess,
you pull back.

259
00:24:43,632 --> 00:24:46,328
- All together now. There we go.
- Sorry.

260
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:53,970
- How tasty, a vermouth.
- No, don't shake it. Don't.

261
00:24:56,011 --> 00:24:57,444
Would you carry it for me, please?

262
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,946
- Sorry.
- Watch it, watch it.

263
00:25:01,616 --> 00:25:04,779
- When you're not used to drivin'
one of these. - Don't shake it.

264
00:25:04,953 --> 00:25:06,750
- Is it a turtle?
- No.

265
00:25:06,888 --> 00:25:08,617
We turn here.

266
00:25:10,058 --> 00:25:13,789
- I go straight ahead.
- Well, me too, I'm going that way.

267
00:25:13,962 --> 00:25:17,693
No, hey, just a few feet, I'm real
close, you won't leave me like this...

268
00:25:17,832 --> 00:25:21,199
But...
Uhh... I... fine. OK.

269
00:25:22,237 --> 00:25:24,296
Well then,
what do you think we should...?

270
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:28,637
I'll pick you up wherever you say,
it could be fun, we'll go for a drink.

271
00:25:29,044 --> 00:25:33,572
Don't miss up the chance, miss.
Have a vermouth with the fella.

272
00:25:33,982 --> 00:25:35,449
Sorry, just butting in...

273
00:25:37,385 --> 00:25:39,148
- Thirty seven eighty nine.
- Excuse me?

274
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,778
Thirty seven eighty nine along
this road, second floor, apartment "A".

275
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:43,881
Oh, OK. Great.

276
00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:46,994
Uh, no, better if you keep it. L, would
you give it to me when I come over?

277
00:25:47,095 --> 00:25:50,428
- Sure. See you.
- Bye, so long.

278
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,434
Take the ramp, these are new,
they're well made.

279
00:25:53,568 --> 00:25:54,865
What'd she say,
thirty seven eighty nine?

280
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,803
Nah, two hundred eighty, my place is
on the fifth floor. Real close.

281
00:26:04,012 --> 00:26:05,707
Left or right?

282
00:26:09,184 --> 00:26:11,175
- Left.
- No...

283
00:26:13,855 --> 00:26:15,413
No, no, I don't think so.

284
00:26:16,024 --> 00:26:18,219
But, if we go right we just get
farther from the highway.

285
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,495
But the left doesn't look like a road.

286
00:26:23,198 --> 00:26:26,326
Go there, right there.
...

287
00:26:27,535 --> 00:26:29,332
come on, take the right.

288
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:37,709
Out of order

289
00:26:37,812 --> 00:26:41,646
It's those kids on the seventh floor,
you know? Open and close, open, close...

290
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,978
bust it all up.
Whatever they touch they bust up.

291
00:26:47,622 --> 00:26:53,822
Well. What's there to be done?
Oh, well, just a matter of waiting.

292
00:26:55,096 --> 00:26:56,927
Someone's bound to show up.

293
00:26:57,065 --> 00:27:01,297
No, no, I stick around for three hours
and someone will carry me up.

294
00:27:01,503 --> 00:27:04,199
- Come on, come.
- OK, I really appreciate it.

295
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,967
Whoa, hold it! Take it easy, easy.

296
00:27:07,175 --> 00:27:12,772
Easy 'cause I'm real heavy and till we
get to the fifth... it's gonna be long.

297
00:27:14,482 --> 00:27:18,441
There we go, yeah, come on, come on.
Piano piano...

298
00:27:19,087 --> 00:27:22,113
"Dress me slowly 'cause I'm in a hurry",
as General Perón used to say.

299
00:27:22,924 --> 00:27:24,414
I think you'll have to rest up
here a bit,

300
00:27:24,526 --> 00:27:27,290
pal, you ain't gonna make to the
fifth floor even with logistic support.

301
00:27:28,163 --> 00:27:32,600
There we go. I'll give you a fresh
glass of cider once we get upstairs.

302
00:27:32,701 --> 00:27:36,159
- Hi Héctor. - Hi, how are you?
You're looking pretty!

303
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:41,640
I used to tutor this girl in maths,
the poor thing,

304
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:45,873
the father a gambler, was totally broke,
old lady's a slut,

305
00:27:46,181 --> 00:27:48,706
but, boy, did she grow up, hu?
She's cute, ain't she?

306
00:27:49,884 --> 00:27:54,651
OK, OK, there we go. Watch it, hold it,
no rush, is there?

307
00:27:58,026 --> 00:28:01,553
You're so lucky you get carried.
Think he's wanna carry me?

308
00:28:01,896 --> 00:28:05,024
Nobody wants to carry the flag when
the procession's long, Emilia.

309
00:28:05,133 --> 00:28:07,397
Ain't you funny? Happy holidays, Héctor.

310
00:28:08,136 --> 00:28:11,105
- There's this kinda spicy smell, hu?
- Yeah, maybe.

311
00:28:11,673 --> 00:28:14,198
Poor thing, such as you see her,
but she's got cancer.

312
00:28:14,376 --> 00:28:19,575
Got a tit taken out, takes it so well,
so well, always looking ahead.

313
00:28:19,714 --> 00:28:22,911
Such joy...
she's just dying to live.

314
00:28:23,518 --> 00:28:25,076
Hold it, hold it.

315
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:30,358
You OK? I can manage on my own.

316
00:28:30,525 --> 00:28:34,154
You'd really have to move to...
a ground floor.

317
00:28:35,497 --> 00:28:36,691
If I don't make it...

318
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,358
Take it easy, we'll be there in an hour,
hour and a half tops.

319
00:28:39,501 --> 00:28:41,230
I got a party
in a couple of hours.

320
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,634
I gotta be there 'cause otherwise,
you know.

321
00:28:44,172 --> 00:28:48,074
- I got an animal routine tonight.
- Awhat routine?

322
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,578
I tell stories about animals,
look like an animal.

323
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,642
- What do you do? How do you do it?
- People just go nuts.

324
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,480
Look. What's this?

325
00:29:02,457 --> 00:29:03,947
A boa.

326
00:29:07,529 --> 00:29:10,157
Aturtle. Pay attention, asshole.

327
00:29:13,701 --> 00:29:15,168
And this?

328
00:29:17,972 --> 00:29:18,996
Blow.

329
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,940
Hey, do you think we're going
in the right direction?

330
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:32,119
Think maybe I was wrong?
I don't... don't see any cars around.

331
00:29:32,253 --> 00:29:33,083
Why don't you turn back
to the crossroads?

332
00:29:33,221 --> 00:29:36,588
OK, now say: "Flipper's trying
to tell us something, grandpa"

333
00:29:37,392 --> 00:29:39,986
- Say it, come on.
- Flipper's trying to tell us something.

334
00:29:40,128 --> 00:29:43,564
- Grandpa - Flipper's trying
to tell us something, grandpa.

335
00:30:01,015 --> 00:30:02,243
What?

336
00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:09,051
What is it?

337
00:30:17,131 --> 00:30:18,758
I can't believe it.

338
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:30,904
What happened?

339
00:30:33,615 --> 00:30:35,048
It's a...

340
00:30:38,953 --> 00:30:40,420
What?

341
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:46,859
So what is it?

342
00:30:50,064 --> 00:30:52,259
These things,
I don't understand one shit.

343
00:30:54,502 --> 00:30:57,437
Check that out, it's not a problem
of the contact that doesn't...

344
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:01,168
There... check it out with the key.

345
00:31:05,013 --> 00:31:06,480
Does it?

346
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:09,448
What is it?

347
00:31:11,019 --> 00:31:12,782
We ran out of gas.

348
00:31:19,994 --> 00:31:25,796
Don't you have a membership ID...?
Don't you belong to any of those...?

349
00:31:26,568 --> 00:31:28,536
Wow, look, found myself a smoke.

350
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:30,797
But, how can you be so calm, brother?

351
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,609
You see there's no one around, nobody
going by, not one car, there's no...

352
00:31:38,179 --> 00:31:41,171
The fact that I take it easy
doesn't mean I gave up.

353
00:31:43,284 --> 00:31:47,118
There are some lights out there.
There should be a gas station.

354
00:31:48,356 --> 00:31:50,551
I'll go get some gas with the container.

355
00:31:52,527 --> 00:31:55,758
- Wait up, I'll go with you.
- Nah, I can't leave the car on its own.

356
00:31:57,932 --> 00:31:59,194
You stay, I'll go.

357
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,427
No, look at what
I'm putting you through, come here!

358
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:04,505
- Stay, I'll go.
- OK, take some cash. Come on, come.

359
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:13,904
- It's gonna rain, don't leave me here,
hanging, OK? - I won't leave you.

360
00:32:17,585 --> 00:32:21,248
Buy some sodas, and smokes too,
and matches!

361
00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:32,960
Here it is.

362
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:40,307
I knew it had to be there somewhere, if
you save stuff, it'll always be there.

363
00:32:40,908 --> 00:32:44,344
Look at the cute little mouse.
Watch him run.

364
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:49,482
Yes... maybe I didn't make myself clear.
I'm not really looking for a mouse,

365
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:54,886
what I'm looking for is something else,
a robot. The Miki Master.

366
00:32:55,189 --> 00:32:59,523
It's the one that... well, a robot
that spouts smoke... through the head.

367
00:32:59,794 --> 00:33:03,127
This is it, the Smokuno Miki Master,
kids ask for it a lot,

368
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,563
my son asks for it all the time
because he sees it on TV.

369
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:10,864
I have them in the basement, but
I have to send my grandson to get it,

370
00:33:11,372 --> 00:33:14,034
if you'd like to come around
in an hour...

371
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:18,636
- And why don't... why don't you go?
- Because I can't, sir. I'm too tired.

372
00:33:19,047 --> 00:33:23,507
I could put it in the window, when you
come by, if you're still interested...

373
00:33:24,118 --> 00:33:26,177
I don't know, whatever.

374
00:33:27,522 --> 00:33:30,457
If you want to come by,
I'll have him look for it.

375
00:33:38,566 --> 00:33:41,831
We're just like husband and wife
on our first night, don't we, fella?

376
00:33:45,239 --> 00:33:46,536
There we go.

377
00:33:49,243 --> 00:33:51,006
There we are.

378
00:33:57,185 --> 00:34:01,349
Smells like gas.
I'll go get the chair.

379
00:34:31,052 --> 00:34:33,612
Can I get some service here?
Anybody there?

380
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:42,660
Hello?
Hello!

381
00:34:46,467 --> 00:34:48,332
Anybody there?

382
00:34:56,277 --> 00:34:57,972
Excuse me, are you closed?

383
00:34:58,112 --> 00:35:03,607
Look, I'd need a couple of gallons,
my car's stopped, on the road.

384
00:35:04,485 --> 00:35:08,285
Gas, at least enough to get out
to the highway, where can I get some?

385
00:35:16,097 --> 00:35:18,258
- I'm afraid.
- What

386
00:35:27,074 --> 00:35:29,941
- I'll get you that cider in a minute.
- No, thanks, I'm on my way.

387
00:35:30,478 --> 00:35:33,311
Hey, smells like something's burning.
What's your name?

388
00:35:34,248 --> 00:35:38,207
You're just like me, nuts about smells.

389
00:35:40,488 --> 00:35:47,326
- My name's Héctor. Héctor Flota. You?
- Rodolfo.

390
00:36:01,809 --> 00:36:03,868
There we are.

391
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:18,323
- Here, you deserve it.
- No. Thanks, I'll be on my way.

392
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,287
- Have some nougat.
- No, thanks.

393
00:36:21,796 --> 00:36:23,263
You're gonna turn it down?

394
00:36:25,566 --> 00:36:26,965
Here.

395
00:36:27,902 --> 00:36:30,063
Have some nougat. It's from Córdoba.

396
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,945
It's real nectar, hu?

397
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:45,051
How stupid, plants conform themselves
with just water and sunlight.

398
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:49,387
- This is flat.
- Well, welcome, this is my world.

399
00:36:50,191 --> 00:36:53,126
It's not much, but of what's available,
there's nothing missing, right?

400
00:36:53,527 --> 00:36:56,894
- Why don't you open a window?
It's suffocating in here? - Why?

401
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:07,331
- Well, I'll be going. - Wow...
Iook at where I come across this,

402
00:37:07,508 --> 00:37:11,376
Been looking for it like crazy. I need
you to do me a little favor later.

403
00:37:12,513 --> 00:37:14,674
You met that chick around here,
right?

404
00:37:14,782 --> 00:37:17,080
I see her every time I do my shopping...

405
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:21,144
I don't mean to be sour grapes,
but I think the chick's a bit...

406
00:37:21,255 --> 00:37:23,155
Why don't you tell me what you need?

407
00:37:23,257 --> 00:37:25,384
then I can give you a hand,
cause I'm kind of in a hurry.

408
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:29,293
Seriously, what pleasure do you
find in those casual relationships,

409
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:32,627
with someone you don't...
with someone you've just met?

410
00:37:32,733 --> 00:37:36,863
All that effort, what's there to talk
about when you've nothing in common?

411
00:37:37,538 --> 00:37:42,134
I mean, if you at least go to bed with
a guy, you can talk about soccer later.

412
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,872
Well, I'm off.

413
00:37:46,981 --> 00:37:49,108
Wait, you wanted to know why
I can't open the window.

414
00:37:49,216 --> 00:37:51,309
- No, it's OK.
- Yeah, feel, feel it.

415
00:37:53,854 --> 00:38:01,192
- Feel it. Come here. That smell.
- Yeah, I catch various odors.

416
00:38:01,429 --> 00:38:03,294
No, smells like an abandoned
church or something.

417
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,561
Know what it is?

418
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:12,699
The apartment's flooded,
some pipe broke or something.

419
00:38:14,575 --> 00:38:18,443
It's the bats.
They've been here for a year and a half.

420
00:38:19,347 --> 00:38:20,746
A problem in the whole building.

421
00:38:20,848 --> 00:38:23,840
If we were in the United States
we'd file a damn lawsuit,

422
00:38:23,918 --> 00:38:25,579
but here...

423
00:38:26,487 --> 00:38:29,684
Listen, listen, listen to that...
they start coming out about now.

424
00:38:30,624 --> 00:38:31,955
Look.

425
00:38:33,094 --> 00:38:34,652
Sorry.

426
00:38:36,831 --> 00:38:38,196
Look at this.

427
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:41,534
Let's say this is the typical bat,
right?

428
00:38:41,669 --> 00:38:44,035
You'll see him coming out in a sec.

429
00:38:44,505 --> 00:38:47,736
There... that's the little head here...
the wings.

430
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:52,107
This is where they placed the nests.
And here's where they lay their young.

431
00:38:52,213 --> 00:38:53,976
Here he's got something like time-share.

432
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:57,448
And these are the cables they
constantly pee on...

433
00:38:57,551 --> 00:39:00,019
and that bloated the wood up, you know.

434
00:39:00,154 --> 00:39:02,554
Why don't those companies that
specialize in this sort of thing?

435
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:08,151
they get rig of them in a jiffy with
ultrasound. - Nah! That lasted 15 days.

436
00:39:08,229 --> 00:39:12,427
They were back again in no time. Besides,
they've been shitting here for a year.

437
00:39:12,566 --> 00:39:15,262
There's accumulated dried blood
excrement down there.

438
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:19,701
'Cause these suckers suck on blood.
Did you know they sucked blood?

439
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:25,910
- No, they eat bugs... they eat...
- No, no! They suck blood.

440
00:39:26,414 --> 00:39:28,405
The other day one fell off the nest,

441
00:39:28,549 --> 00:39:31,780
was rolling around and I'd throw down
the plastic bag meat comes in,

442
00:39:31,886 --> 00:39:36,016
- You wouldn't believe how he sucked on
that blood, serious. - Well, bye.

443
00:39:36,557 --> 00:39:39,219
Did you know the female bat can keep
the semen for a year...

444
00:39:39,326 --> 00:39:41,760
- And use it whenever she wants to?
- No.

445
00:39:41,862 --> 00:39:44,695
Hey, Cachoi,
you gotta do me that little favor!

446
00:40:06,187 --> 00:40:08,212
ID, police.
ID, boy.

447
00:40:14,028 --> 00:40:15,791
What the...? What...?

448
00:40:18,032 --> 00:40:19,863
Fuck.

449
00:40:26,373 --> 00:40:28,170
ID, please.
Police.

450
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:29,900
- Could I have your ID, please?
- Yes, what's wrong?

451
00:40:30,044 --> 00:40:31,272
- If you'd be so kind.
- What is it?

452
00:40:31,879 --> 00:40:33,676
Routine.
ID, please.

453
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,907
- What is it?
- Standard procedure.

454
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:38,007
- What's wrong?
- Public service, pops.

455
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:40,485
Could I have that ID for a second?
Very kind of you, thanks.

456
00:40:40,921 --> 00:40:45,984
But, my daughter's waiting for me,
can't you call someone else?

457
00:40:47,495 --> 00:40:50,191
- Listen, my daughter's waiting for me.
- No, no problem with that, pops.

458
00:40:50,331 --> 00:40:52,925
Yes there is a problem, because,
besides, I can't be on my feet,

459
00:40:53,067 --> 00:40:55,297
I've got bad circulation.

460
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,633
- Excuse me, where is it we have to go?
- Right across the street,

461
00:40:57,738 --> 00:40:59,672
it's proceedings for Dr. Pescardi...

462
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:03,073
- How long will it take?
- 5, 3 minutes, how long could it take?

463
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,770
- Could I have my ID back?
- Okay, please come with me?

464
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,575
- Are you Argentinian?
- Yes.

465
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,080
Come with me.

466
00:41:11,418 --> 00:41:16,082
- ¿ Well Olivera? - These gentlemen are the
witnesses, and this is Subinspector Cueto.

467
00:41:19,927 --> 00:41:25,126
- Do you have the IDs? - You should never
leave home without them.

468
00:41:32,606 --> 00:41:36,133
Look, officer, excuse me...
I'm all for cooperating with you guys,

469
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:40,043
I'd love to help out. Thing is, it's a
bit late for me, I still have to...

470
00:41:41,315 --> 00:41:44,807
We are carrying out proceedings
in this apartment,

471
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:48,912
which belongs to a person called Britos,
this man is a delinquent, con artist,

472
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:54,159
ouch! He is now in prison, we are trying
to carry out a search...

473
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:57,253
to see if we find anything inside. It's
important that we do find something.

474
00:41:57,364 --> 00:42:00,458
Is that clear?
Huh? Got it?

475
00:42:00,568 --> 00:42:04,368
- Hey, isn't there anything else we can
use? -Aguilera, go check in the car...

476
00:42:04,505 --> 00:42:06,268
- See if there is anything.
- Yes, you get me?

477
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,137
Yes, let's see if there's a...

478
00:42:10,544 --> 00:42:14,446
- What are you, cops?
- Any idea who might have the key?

479
00:42:14,748 --> 00:42:20,709
Nah... I can see the future.
I was talking to my mom just yesterday,

480
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:24,718
told her, how come they haven't come
search this apartment yet?

481
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:27,192
You were bound to come here
sooner or later, for sure.

482
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:32,493
Been living here for 28 years, in this
neighborhood, right? Been here for 14,

483
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,263
in this apartment, wait, this here used
to be a classy building,

484
00:42:36,337 --> 00:42:39,534
but they scrimp on the condo fees,
so, what can you expect?

485
00:42:40,074 --> 00:42:44,170
You guys are always too late. You come
in when the widow's already married.

486
00:42:45,846 --> 00:42:49,077
Yo, it was a joke.
Manaciano, Alfredo.

487
00:42:49,583 --> 00:42:53,144
What I got that might help is a
metal cutting hammer, there.

488
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,388
- Okay, go get it.
- How's it going, alright?

489
00:43:00,728 --> 00:43:02,923
You guys do your job, right?

490
00:43:04,031 --> 00:43:07,933
Good thing, my God, 'cause this guy,
the screaming, I can't...

491
00:43:09,703 --> 00:43:12,137
I can't say anything, I'm like...

492
00:43:12,873 --> 00:43:17,276
This guy had this thing, you know?
There's this something you feel... A...

493
00:43:17,978 --> 00:43:19,138
Could you get us that metal cutter?

494
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,181
Excuse me, officer,
this man's not feeling well.

495
00:43:23,284 --> 00:43:25,809
I tell you, this man's not feeling well,
seriously, he's got to go.

496
00:43:25,953 --> 00:43:27,011
Easy kid, it's just a few minutes.

497
00:43:27,121 --> 00:43:30,921
No, I'm telling you, he can't stay, if
the door's not open in five minutes...

498
00:43:31,058 --> 00:43:33,117
he's gotta go, he can't stay.

499
00:43:45,072 --> 00:43:46,733
Okay. I'll be on my way.

500
00:43:47,074 --> 00:43:49,508
No, wait, you gotta do me
another little favor.

501
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:53,473
See that little box there, it's food
for the fish, could you feed him?

502
00:43:53,981 --> 00:43:55,380
But... you can...

503
00:43:57,151 --> 00:43:59,585
Come on, last one, come on.

504
00:44:09,129 --> 00:44:16,365
The poor thing. He's awful lonely.
I should get him a mate.

505
00:44:17,271 --> 00:44:22,504
He's so cute. The fins look like wings,
look at him go.

506
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:27,912
You gotta change the water, it's too
dirty. They're very delicate, he could-

507
00:44:28,048 --> 00:44:32,610
That's it, delicate, that's the word!
You got delicate hands.

508
00:44:32,886 --> 00:44:37,346
Artist's hands. - You know what?
Everything's a bit dirty, your house too.

509
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,419
What do you do?

510
00:44:39,793 --> 00:44:43,593
You should clean up a bit,
pay attention to your appearance...

511
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:46,392
- Get a shave, get yourself a girlfriend.
- Girlfriend? Stop!

512
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:47,995
Don't feed him anymore.

513
00:44:49,169 --> 00:44:53,469
Girlfriend? I suffered
a great disappointment, you know?

514
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:57,335
You understand, don't you?
Yeah, sure, you're just like me.

515
00:44:59,046 --> 00:45:03,710
The world is going real cheap on us,
Cachoi. There's no real nobility.

516
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:09,517
We get to the Windsor Palace,
we rip off the silver spoons,

517
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:14,250
but the majority goes nuts
over the detergent.

518
00:45:15,562 --> 00:45:18,360
- Where are the men?
- Huh?

519
00:45:18,899 --> 00:45:23,700
The Little Prince asked.
"I feel all alone in the desert."

520
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:29,469
"You can also feel alone amongst men",
answered the snake.

521
00:45:31,178 --> 00:45:34,579
"What a weird animal,
you have no legs".

522
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:42,782
"Fine as a finger. But as powerful as
the finger of a king," said the snake.

523
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:48,488
My girlfriend, used to read me
"The Little Prince."

524
00:45:55,235 --> 00:46:00,263
Well, Héctor, I'll be off... I gotta get
going, man. A pleasure. Honestly.

525
00:46:01,408 --> 00:46:04,172
- Happy holidays, maybe one day...
- May I? - What?

526
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:12,084
You... you're around people that suffer,
right? You like doing things for people.

527
00:46:14,121 --> 00:46:19,354
Sensitive, affectionate.
Very passionate.

528
00:46:22,496 --> 00:46:28,958
But you get discouraged very easily, and
you're very lonely, have been for long.

529
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:32,104
You've been alone for a long time.

530
00:46:32,306 --> 00:46:36,003
Narrow phalanx... refined.

531
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:43,482
You had so many different talents,
and didn't pay any attention to them.

532
00:46:47,955 --> 00:46:51,049
- What happened?
- I don't know.

533
00:46:51,458 --> 00:46:55,519
Did you let yourself go?
Too bad.

534
00:46:58,966 --> 00:47:04,063
You're scared.
You're scared of those who suffer.

535
00:47:06,874 --> 00:47:10,002
Let's see... the texture.

536
00:47:15,816 --> 00:47:19,217
- You'll soon be getting a surprise.
- I gotta go.

537
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:22,278
Wait, just another little favor,
I gotta go to the john now.

538
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:27,621
No, Héctor, I'm sorry, I have to go,
I'm already late, I can't stay.

539
00:47:28,462 --> 00:47:32,922
- Otherwise, I'd love to.
- You're a diamond, Cachoi.

540
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:40,536
Have a good time, man.
Happy holidays.

541
00:47:58,759 --> 00:48:02,456
- Ouch, monkeyfucking asshole!
- Be careful.

542
00:48:02,596 --> 00:48:06,123
Pisses me off, hitting myself like that,
I get so pissed off I could kill myself.

543
00:48:07,568 --> 00:48:11,026
Thing is, this was done,
architect who did the Barolo passage,

544
00:48:11,104 --> 00:48:14,972
and these are all,
these French locks.

545
00:48:23,216 --> 00:48:26,117
- Who are you?
- It's me, grandma, Fredi.

546
00:48:26,253 --> 00:48:30,451
- The police, granny.
- Thank god.

547
00:48:33,393 --> 00:48:38,023
- OK, OK... okay, Aguilera.
- Almost there.

548
00:48:51,912 --> 00:48:53,743
Are you alright, Aguilera?

549
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:02,146
You two, come along.
The machine, please.

550
00:49:03,991 --> 00:49:07,290
Come along, easy,
we'll be out of here in five minutes.

551
00:49:09,262 --> 00:49:13,995
Wow, look at how the son of a bitch
lived. Just look at this son of a bitch.

552
00:49:14,267 --> 00:49:16,258
That's all acrylic.

553
00:50:04,484 --> 00:50:05,644
Sir,

554
00:50:05,886 --> 00:50:09,049
sir!

555
00:50:12,726 --> 00:50:17,595
Good evening, excuse me. Look,
our car's stopped right near by,

556
00:50:17,964 --> 00:50:21,730
- I need a little gas.
- You're the guy who had a little girl.

557
00:50:24,337 --> 00:50:29,036
No, no, I'm not from this
company. I'm an outsider.

558
00:50:29,409 --> 00:50:31,274
We were on our way to Buenos Aires.

559
00:50:32,012 --> 00:50:33,343
What's that?

560
00:50:35,148 --> 00:50:37,480
- What is that?
- What?

561
00:50:37,918 --> 00:50:39,545
It's 'cause of the static.

562
00:50:41,254 --> 00:50:43,313
Come with us.

563
00:50:52,999 --> 00:50:54,489
Careful.

564
00:51:02,275 --> 00:51:06,712
- ¿So Starosta?
- Nothing!

565
00:51:11,885 --> 00:51:17,755
What a cynical son of a bitch, this
is Miami and this is Brito's chick.

566
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:22,454
- If I get my hands on this one.
- The chick's a real slut.

567
00:51:22,696 --> 00:51:27,827
These orgiastic parties took place here,
till six in the morning...

568
00:51:27,968 --> 00:51:31,563
they once started dancing lambada,
when that was fashionable,

569
00:51:31,705 --> 00:51:35,072
I had to go after them with a squirt gun,
fucking blasted them.

570
00:51:37,611 --> 00:51:42,105
Watch it, I mean slutty.
And she reeked of dope.

571
00:51:42,215 --> 00:51:44,911
You get in the elevator and feel
the smell on this chick...

572
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:48,784
and the chick smells of dope, not that
I know dope, right?

573
00:51:48,889 --> 00:51:52,154
well, somehow I did, we got this
cousin with a little problem...

574
00:51:52,292 --> 00:51:54,590
- I say we because...
- Officer... officer.

575
00:51:54,728 --> 00:51:57,595
...he later became a cop.
- Excuse me, officer, I'd have to leave.

576
00:51:57,697 --> 00:51:59,528
I can't stay any longer,
it's getting late.

577
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:02,159
I gotta go by a toy store, still
gotta pick up a present for my kid,

578
00:52:02,269 --> 00:52:07,605
and this gentleman too, his family's
waiting for him. Could we? I gotta go.

579
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:10,301
And you think I was born
out of an incubator?

580
00:52:11,645 --> 00:52:15,638
I got family too,
I also wanna be at home,

581
00:52:16,016 --> 00:52:17,142
get it?

582
00:52:17,284 --> 00:52:20,515
Nevertheless I am here cleaning up
everybody else's shit.

583
00:52:21,521 --> 00:52:24,217
I too want to be home having some cider.

584
00:52:25,125 --> 00:52:26,592
Do you understand?

585
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:33,491
The police works around the clock.

586
00:52:40,207 --> 00:52:41,868
This...

587
00:52:44,110 --> 00:52:46,305
this is what drug addicts use
in North America,

588
00:52:46,446 --> 00:52:50,883
they get stoned and stare at this
for an hour or two, a vase, a flower...

589
00:52:51,985 --> 00:52:54,044
vice.

590
00:52:59,192 --> 00:53:03,424
Mister Burgos, please report
to platform number three.

591
00:53:04,865 --> 00:53:06,492
See that door over there?

592
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:09,599
Go in and tell Mr. Burgos
to get you some gas.

593
00:53:10,237 --> 00:53:11,499
But, what should I say?

594
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:15,006
Tell him I sent you.
To give you some gas, tell him.

595
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:18,300
Which door?

596
00:53:29,173 --> 00:53:31,107
Mister Burgos!

597
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:38,444
Burgos!

598
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:52,051
SECURITY RELATED SYSTEMS

599
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:56,222
Mister!

600
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:05,068
Burgos!

601
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:10,744
Mister Burgos!

602
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,425
- Hello.
- Hello, what's up?

603
00:54:32,903 --> 00:54:35,838
I came down to get you, came to tell you
the intercom's not working.

604
00:54:36,073 --> 00:54:38,439
Oh, right... I.
And this guy?

605
00:54:39,343 --> 00:54:41,208
- That's Arthur.
- Hello Arthur.

606
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:46,981
I love boxers.
This one's striped.

607
00:54:51,155 --> 00:54:52,645
- Well...
- Want me to get your box?

608
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:57,022
Okay. And, are we...
will we go somewhere?

609
00:54:58,428 --> 00:54:59,952
Okay.

610
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:02,428
- Let's go, inside.
- Okay.

611
00:55:02,566 --> 00:55:04,864
- Let's go, Arthur.
- Oh.

612
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:10,499
Okay... come in, come on in, same thing.

613
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:18,874
- Hello, baby.
- Oh, and this guy? Who's this?

614
00:55:19,283 --> 00:55:21,649
That's Fito. Love of my life.

615
00:55:26,857 --> 00:55:28,825
Come on in, give me a minute.

616
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:33,354
Sir!
Gasoline!

617
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:37,492
Here, we... our car stopped here!
Could I please have some gas?

618
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:42,638
I'd be glad to, but I got gas oil,
that's the thing.

619
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:47,339
- Ready back there?
- Wait up, Hugo Luis taking a piss.

620
00:55:47,744 --> 00:55:49,109
Which way are you headed?

621
00:55:50,214 --> 00:55:55,277
- No, I'm... I'm going to Buenos Aires.
- Me too.

622
00:55:56,386 --> 00:56:00,482
There's a gas station
about 10 miles from here.

623
00:56:01,325 --> 00:56:05,591
You can get some gas and then
get a ride back.

624
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:11,557
- Sorry, you got a smoke?
- No.

625
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:16,968
Are you... Bolivian?

626
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:20,267
They're Bolivian, I'm Marplatense.

627
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:26,246
From Mar del Plata.

628
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:35,858
Check it out.

629
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,460
But, what are you doing with that?

630
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:44,033
But, who knows where that's been,
what are you doing? Take that off.

631
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:49,171
Pops, what's your last name?
Estene... Estana...

632
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:51,534
Stanoievich.

633
00:56:51,675 --> 00:56:56,476
- What origin is that?
- Serbia. - Holy moly!

634
00:57:00,117 --> 00:57:03,780
I think there might be another way
to do things... I mean.

635
00:57:06,056 --> 00:57:08,957
- How's that? - I'm just thinking.
- Why do you say that?

636
00:57:10,494 --> 00:57:14,089
Well, what if this guy's maybe hiding
some swags?

637
00:57:15,232 --> 00:57:22,729
- What swags?
- Jewels, stuff... jewelry, checks...

638
00:57:24,308 --> 00:57:27,175
And... what could happen?

639
00:57:31,315 --> 00:57:33,215
We're all friends here.

640
00:57:36,086 --> 00:57:39,487
- Yeah.
- We're all friends here, right?

641
00:57:43,994 --> 00:57:49,796
You know why I say this?
Cause it'd be a real shame, you know?

642
00:57:50,334 --> 00:57:52,962
Well, yes. Yes, it'd be a shame.

643
00:57:53,904 --> 00:57:57,533
- The man here understands me.
- So?

644
00:58:03,046 --> 00:58:06,914
So it'd be a shame for all these things
to go to waste, don't you think?

645
00:58:07,751 --> 00:58:09,810
No problem by me.

646
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,810
No problem with me either.

647
00:58:11,922 --> 00:58:16,086
- Besides, this guy...
- No, this guy... this guy's a thief.

648
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:19,252
I can tell you now that all the things
you'll find here are looted.

649
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:24,526
- So, any of you got a problem?
- Me? What problem could I have with it?

650
00:58:24,634 --> 00:58:27,467
If you don't have a problem,
I'm at your service.

651
00:58:28,205 --> 00:58:32,938
Didn't you see some nice suits around?
Real nice, too. Italian silk.

652
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:38,112
No, no, count me out, hu.
No, I don't agree to this.

653
00:58:38,215 --> 00:58:39,239
Sorry, but I just don't agree.

654
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:43,445
Let's go into the bedroom where there's
tons of things. No, sir. It's not legal.

655
00:58:44,154 --> 00:58:47,988
Officer, you know perfectly well
that this isn't legal, you know it.

656
00:58:51,395 --> 00:58:53,920
- Here's your box.
- Thanks.

657
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:01,595
- Would you like something to drink?
- Okay.

658
00:59:01,805 --> 00:59:04,672
- I got tea, coffee, some wine?
- Yes, please.

659
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:07,067
- Yes please, what?
- Wine.

660
00:59:12,249 --> 00:59:14,240
Fito!
Did you see what he's doing?

661
00:59:17,087 --> 00:59:19,817
Come, Fito. Fito!

662
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:23,187
- I gotta tell you something later.
- Okay.

663
00:59:27,597 --> 00:59:29,565
- ¡Arthur!
- No, leave him.

664
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:32,393
Come along, always bothering the guests.

665
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:49,244
- Hello.
- Hello.

666
00:59:49,986 --> 00:59:53,046
My name's Laura.
What's in the box?

667
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:56,054
It's a... the box is a present
for a little kid.

668
00:59:56,159 --> 01:00:00,687
But, what's in it?

669
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:02,754
It's a present. Need I say more?

670
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:25,319
Aspirin.

671
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:32,187
- Do you have plans for Christmas Eve?
- No.

672
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:36,797
You know what I had to tell you?

673
01:00:38,101 --> 01:00:41,161
I saw you the other day,
well, I'd already seen you.

674
01:00:41,571 --> 01:00:46,304
I saw you the other day at the bar
across the street from the hospital.

675
01:01:08,932 --> 01:01:10,399
You were very handsome all dressed up
like a doctor. You looked very formal.

676
01:01:12,702 --> 01:01:14,897
Hi, this is Laura...

677
01:01:18,108 --> 01:01:21,441
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm coming!
Hang on, wait up!

678
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:32,011
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- I need to use the restroom.

679
01:01:32,289 --> 01:01:33,381
In winter this is like a little poncho,
perfect for riding my motorbike.

680
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:40,292
Try the shoe on.

681
01:01:40,397 --> 01:01:43,366
Is there any chance I could maybe take
the silk shorts?

682
01:01:44,301 --> 01:01:48,931
- This? It's too small for you.
- Well, may be small now.

683
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:51,940
Otherwise, I'll sell it.
Silk is silk.

684
01:01:52,275 --> 01:01:54,869
I gotta stop fucking around
and lose this potbelly.

685
01:01:54,945 --> 01:01:56,674
Here, too small for me.

686
01:01:56,780 --> 01:02:01,114
No, there's this old lady here that
massages you, takes out all your fluids.

687
01:02:01,484 --> 01:02:04,851
She gives you this massage
and moves all your jejunum around.

688
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:06,884
You know, you shit
like mad.

689
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:09,515
Do it once and you're reborn.

690
01:02:15,265 --> 01:02:18,894
Aguilera, Aguilera, what are you doing?
not that.

691
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:22,098
Don't take pictures here.
Gimme that camera.

692
01:02:22,706 --> 01:02:25,266
Aguilera, don't keep the perfumes, hu?
Put em all right here.

693
01:02:25,442 --> 01:02:30,106
- Look at these rags. - Is there any
chance I could take the bedspread?

694
01:02:30,347 --> 01:02:32,907
If I take the bedspread to my mom,
she'll die. - Yeah, go ahead.

695
01:02:33,016 --> 01:02:35,382
Not that I want her to die...
but... the bedspread...

696
01:02:39,055 --> 01:02:41,182
Son of a bitch, he's got a damn helm.

697
01:02:47,163 --> 01:02:49,859
Officer... officer.

698
01:02:52,402 --> 01:02:56,896
Days like these you realize we really
are 70% water.

699
01:02:57,507 --> 01:03:01,807
Yeah, I wanted to say it seems...
it's enough, you know, we did our part.

700
01:03:02,012 --> 01:03:06,949
More than that... but if, if you need
two witnesses, I wanted to suggest...

701
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:11,118
that the neighbor and I stay on,
but that we let the gentleman go...

702
01:03:11,421 --> 01:03:15,482
he is an older man and, evidently,
he's not feeling well. - You're right.

703
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:19,326
- What do you to?
- Me? Odontologist.

704
01:03:19,729 --> 01:03:22,391
- Dental mechanic.
- Dentist.

705
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,961
So, I don't really understand
what we're still doing here.

706
01:03:26,069 --> 01:03:29,470
I imagine there's people you want to see
in your practice and people you don't.

707
01:03:29,873 --> 01:03:32,740
People whose rotten mouths you don't
wanna stick your hands in,

708
01:03:32,842 --> 01:03:35,003
poking around in all that rot, hu?

709
01:03:38,048 --> 01:03:41,017
This is the stuff I don't really like.

710
01:03:42,419 --> 01:03:45,013
Honest,
I don't like this one bit.

711
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:48,354
I got a different opinion on this.

712
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:51,755
But every job, everything has its
good side and its bad side.

713
01:03:54,531 --> 01:03:57,227
In my case, if I don't like something,
I just don't do it.

714
01:03:57,867 --> 01:04:00,563
I got a bullet in my
spinal column.

715
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:05,068
But hey, somebody's gotta do it.

716
01:04:10,113 --> 01:04:13,844
In life, we do more things we don't
like than things we do.

717
01:04:14,718 --> 01:04:16,549
Get it?

718
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:20,053
Sure, it'd be much better for you to
have to see a hot chick's mouth,

719
01:04:20,156 --> 01:04:21,521
right?

720
01:04:21,658 --> 01:04:24,320
This chick you touch here and there,
you pet a little if you can,

721
01:04:24,494 --> 01:04:26,928
touch her... put your hand here,
stick your hand there.

722
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:32,561
But you're the respected doctor.
How are you, sir? This and that.

723
01:04:33,603 --> 01:04:38,302
But, what do they know? What do they
know you're not really thinking:

724
01:04:39,242 --> 01:04:42,268
"Why don't you just go fuck yourself?"

725
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:47,278
See how it works? Somebody's gotta
stick their hand in the muck, you too.

726
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:49,649
We're here to clean up all the shit.

727
01:04:49,786 --> 01:04:52,550
No, well, actually, no, I can't say
I agree with that.

728
01:04:53,256 --> 01:04:59,661
With these hands, I've done such
things, I really...

729
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:06,426
tell you the truth... I sometimes
think it wasn't me, you know.

730
01:05:07,237 --> 01:05:09,205
If I were to tell you...
what's your name?

731
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:14,968
Uhh, I'm Julio DeBiasi.

732
01:05:15,111 --> 01:05:18,603
If I were to tell you, Julito,
all the things I've done.

733
01:05:18,815 --> 01:05:20,942
But then, you get used to it.

734
01:05:22,152 --> 01:05:28,057
I once wanted to get away from this,
open up a grill. Didn't work out either.

735
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:33,985
Well, the important thing is not to give
up, to never give up the joy of living.

736
01:05:35,498 --> 01:05:38,092
Never kill that
child we carry inside.

737
01:05:39,636 --> 01:05:42,662
What?
What are you looking at?

738
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:49,902
The neck, my neck's killing me.

739
01:07:08,625 --> 01:07:09,717
¿Fito?

740
01:07:12,929 --> 01:07:14,419
Fito.

741
01:07:51,267 --> 01:07:54,430
The road, that carries us
into Christmastime,

742
01:07:55,104 --> 01:07:59,200
- Is a star, it illuminates us
- Can I borrow your phone for a sec?

743
01:07:59,809 --> 01:08:03,677
let's drive down the road,
to Christmas...

744
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:08,684
if the star will light my way
I got to make it there

745
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:20,555
Hello, hello. It's me, Juanchi.

746
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:25,397
Well, I'm on my way to the airport
'cause in the end I do have to travel...

747
01:08:26,736 --> 01:08:31,730
since I had a little time, I wanted to
come by and see you. You there, Laura?

748
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:38,608
Look, I'll only be out for a week,
then I'm coming back.

749
01:08:40,016 --> 01:08:46,285
But, l, uh, would like to talk.
I think it's worth it, right?

750
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:51,085
Three months is a long time.

751
01:08:52,996 --> 01:08:58,434
And I... miss you so much,
I love you so much.

752
01:09:00,503 --> 01:09:02,630
I'm willing to change.

753
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:09,539
What am I saying? I already did!
I'm taller... I grew...

754
01:09:50,086 --> 01:09:53,783
- ¿Laura?
- Yes, be right out.

755
01:10:09,672 --> 01:10:12,607
- Thought you were gone.
- No, I was right here.

756
01:10:12,909 --> 01:10:16,777
- Want something to drink?
- No, thanks a lot.

757
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:20,148
Sorry I had to use the bathroom,
I'm... well...

758
01:10:20,283 --> 01:10:22,183
No, don't worry.

759
01:10:25,922 --> 01:10:32,293
Laura, I wanted to say something
that l, can't...

760
01:10:35,932 --> 01:10:37,797
don't know how to tell you.

761
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:46,069
- I'm totally...
- I love it that you're so shy.

762
01:10:52,014 --> 01:10:55,450
This is amazing, really amazing.

763
01:10:56,519 --> 01:10:59,818
I should call home, at least talk
to my wife, let her know,

764
01:11:00,022 --> 01:11:01,751
but, she won't understand anything.

765
01:11:01,891 --> 01:11:09,388
I still have to get my medicine,
and then go on to Palomar.

766
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:14,029
Well, you can take a cab to
get to Palomar.

767
01:11:14,804 --> 01:11:19,070
With what money?
Will you pay for the medicine?

768
01:11:21,744 --> 01:11:25,043
Well, I have to go out West,
If you want, I can give you a lift.

769
01:11:27,683 --> 01:11:34,111
I'm such a freaking asshole.
I should've gone on walking.

770
01:11:39,695 --> 01:11:43,324
- Do you fell okay?
- It's too hot here.

771
01:11:46,536 --> 01:11:50,563
Okay, take it easy, we'll leave here
together, I'll drive you.

772
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:25,940
- Are you okay?
- Laura, I'd have to...

773
01:12:30,546 --> 01:12:35,347
Uh... I don't have any condoms,
I gotta go get some.

774
01:12:40,923 --> 01:12:45,690
Take the keys,
the intercom's not working.

775
01:14:11,814 --> 01:14:14,578
Boy do I like 3-D pictures,
don't you?

776
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:18,516
and if it's babes, better.
And naked, better yet.

777
01:14:19,889 --> 01:14:24,451
This perfume here's an aphrodisiac
'cause it's made out of monkey's semen.

778
01:14:24,694 --> 01:14:28,630
- Did you know that...
- Sorry, this gentleman here needs...

779
01:14:28,731 --> 01:14:31,666
to make a call and talk to his daughter,
let her know he's here.

780
01:14:31,801 --> 01:14:34,929
- Call from here.
they do sexual tourism.

781
01:14:35,271 --> 01:14:40,072
- So they use this perfume...
- Better if we don't call my daughter.

782
01:14:42,211 --> 01:14:44,736
And this stuff they make with drugs...

783
01:14:44,914 --> 01:14:50,875
No, no! 'cause I gotta take this
...the bedspread.

784
01:14:52,455 --> 01:14:57,984
Since you're not doing anything, pops,
why don't you go get a soda? A Coke.

785
01:14:59,462 --> 01:15:03,489
No it's okay, I'll go.
I'll go get the Coke.

786
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:07,791
- We can't let him go alone.
- Could we get an orange Fanta?

787
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:09,768
- Come on, come're, try this on.
- No, I don't want to.

788
01:15:09,905 --> 01:15:14,569
- Try this on, don't be scared.
- Don't be shy...

789
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:19,637
things sometimes work out like that,
take 'em.

790
01:15:20,816 --> 01:15:23,512
- I like how it looks on you.
- Looks good.

791
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:25,646
Looking good.

792
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:28,755
- Let's see.
- No! Why?

793
01:15:29,325 --> 01:15:30,519
Why?

794
01:15:30,726 --> 01:15:33,194
- Why?
- Don't be greedy.

795
01:15:33,295 --> 01:15:35,820
It's not that I don't wanna give you,
thing is I wanted it 'cause...

796
01:15:35,965 --> 01:15:37,694
I wanna go jogging with...

797
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:40,996
I can't lose weight 'cause I gotta jog,
I run with this on,

798
01:15:41,137 --> 01:15:43,901
listen to the radio
and time just goes by,

799
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:46,030
I get bored jogging, you see?

800
01:15:54,283 --> 01:15:55,580
No, he's keeping it.

801
01:15:55,751 --> 01:15:57,446
I don't... I don't want anything.
I don't want anything that's not mine.

802
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:59,145
- There we go.
- Okay.

803
01:16:01,791 --> 01:16:04,487
- I'll go get it.
- Excuse me.

804
01:16:04,894 --> 01:16:06,418
Britos!

805
01:16:09,698 --> 01:16:11,529
Britos!

806
01:16:13,536 --> 01:16:15,970
No, 'cause maybe it's one of the guys
come looking for the dude.

807
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:17,504
- Go on, go on.
- No...

808
01:16:19,809 --> 01:16:23,301
Why do I gotta go?
How the fuck should I know who it is?

809
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:26,511
No...

810
01:16:38,027 --> 01:16:40,552
- What's up, Platense fan?
- What are you doing here, Fredi?

811
01:16:40,729 --> 01:16:46,224
Uhh... I... uh...

812
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:50,068
Any idea whether the cable guys came by?

813
01:16:50,773 --> 01:16:53,333
No, these guys aren't it... no.

814
01:16:55,177 --> 01:16:57,202
What do you want cable for?

815
01:16:57,379 --> 01:16:59,313
to see the goal get
loaded with cucumbers?

816
01:16:59,415 --> 01:17:02,282
Why don't you join some club
and start rooting for them?

817
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:07,912
- What's up, Fredi?
- What's up with what?

818
01:17:08,691 --> 01:17:10,522
There, the door?

819
01:17:15,164 --> 01:17:18,691
This guy had a nervous breakdown, see?
Got himself locked up,

820
01:17:20,269 --> 01:17:23,864
wanted to slit his wrists, we're keeping
an eye on him, guy was doing real bad.

821
01:17:24,039 --> 01:17:26,701
We had to call a locksmith.

822
01:17:27,743 --> 01:17:32,874
His car was stolen with his dog inside,
you know? And the guy couldn't take it.

823
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:35,510
What dog? Britos doesn't have a dog.

824
01:17:35,918 --> 01:17:42,016
That's it, if he doesn't have a dog,
there's the problem, right?

825
01:17:43,225 --> 01:17:47,753
Not everybody can spend Christmas with
the folks, like we can, that love 'em,

826
01:17:48,764 --> 01:17:53,258
truth is, well, gotta go, okay,
Merry Christmas.

827
01:17:53,469 --> 01:17:55,801
Happy hollidays, bye.

828
01:17:59,275 --> 01:18:00,264
Let's go.

829
01:18:00,376 --> 01:18:03,937
No, ten minutes, in twenty five minutes
I got a truck here, take it all,

830
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:06,479
it's a shame, who's gonna take all this?

831
01:18:06,649 --> 01:18:09,015
Twenty five minutes is all I ask,
half an hour, we take it all...

832
01:18:09,118 --> 01:18:13,248
leave it all next door and then
you guys can come back for it.

833
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:47,420
The following signatures,
that is, yours and the old man's,

834
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:50,116
of their own free will,
make an appearance...

835
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:53,888
declare to be Argentinian...
sign here.

836
01:18:54,063 --> 01:18:59,365
- Babe, this is mine.
- Okay, I think it's fair.

837
01:18:59,602 --> 01:19:02,901
If you happen to find the bedspread,
maybe in some bag...

838
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:05,206
check it out later...

839
01:19:05,341 --> 01:19:07,366
- Hey, where's the old man?
- Should be downstairs.

840
01:19:07,476 --> 01:19:09,307
- Get a move on.
- Do you have my ID?

841
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:10,708
Aguilera!

842
01:19:10,846 --> 01:19:13,974
Turn off the lights, and don't forget
to close the door and cordon off the area.

843
01:19:27,796 --> 01:19:31,061
- Are you alright, sir?
- Would you like a glass of water?

844
01:19:32,368 --> 01:19:34,632
- Better?
- Doesn't seem like it.

845
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:36,863
- Wasn't there any Coke?
- What is it?

846
01:19:37,006 --> 01:19:38,871
- You need anything, sir?
- What happened?

847
01:19:38,974 --> 01:19:40,236
- Are you together, sir?
- Yes, he's with me.

848
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:43,411
Well, he wasn't feeling well, maybe
the heat made his blood pressure go up.

849
01:19:43,512 --> 01:19:46,572
Easy.
It's okay, okay. I'm in charge.

850
01:19:46,682 --> 01:19:51,779
- Okay. What is it, pops?
- He almost fell.

851
01:19:53,222 --> 01:19:57,625
Are you on some kind of medication?
Fuck. Lets see, get up a bit.

852
01:19:57,860 --> 01:20:01,023
No, let's let him catch his breath,
some air might do him good.

853
01:20:01,230 --> 01:20:04,427
Aguilera, got the keys to the car?

854
01:20:12,274 --> 01:20:16,472
So, how's it going, old man?
How's it going? Easy, we're almost there.

855
01:20:18,547 --> 01:20:20,572
- Turn here?
- Go on, straight ahead.

856
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:26,818
You know... you know I also gotta
go in for a check up,

857
01:20:27,122 --> 01:20:32,321
I get these pains here in the chest,
I don't know... real painful... serious,

858
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:36,097
- Don't know what is could be.
- Could be gases. Watch it.

859
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:40,632
Grandpa, you gotta sign here, almost
forgot, let's not screw it up

860
01:20:44,373 --> 01:20:46,068
Let's go.

861
01:20:48,777 --> 01:20:54,409
There's an old saying that goes:
"Witnesses are the eyes of justice."

862
01:20:57,052 --> 01:20:58,986
Well done, grandpa.

863
01:21:21,577 --> 01:21:24,808
Excuse me, any idea whether
the doctor is in there?

864
01:21:25,314 --> 01:21:28,181
- You gotta knock and wait.
- Yeah, but, is...?

865
01:21:31,286 --> 01:21:33,686
Are you alright?
want to call your daughter?

866
01:21:44,333 --> 01:21:45,960
Sorry...

867
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:56,203
Yes, I'm here with an emergency,

868
01:21:56,311 --> 01:21:59,576
do you, do you know where I might
find a doctor because I can't find...?

869
01:22:08,991 --> 01:22:12,859
Are you waiting for a doctor?
You know where... where I can...?

870
01:22:28,210 --> 01:22:32,306
Excuse me, could you tell me
where I can find a doctor, please?

871
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:24,658
- I'll find a doctor in a minute, okay?
- Relax...

872
01:24:25,794 --> 01:24:30,163
they'll come. Take it easy.

873
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:56,389
- Are you feeling okay?
- Yes, I'm okay now. I feel better.

874
01:25:01,129 --> 01:25:06,431
But, you, go on home,
go on to your family and celebrate.

875
01:25:09,871 --> 01:25:12,101
Go celebrate.

876
01:25:14,209 --> 01:25:17,838
- Are you sure you're feeling alright?
- Yes.

877
01:26:06,695 --> 01:26:10,062
Bye, my man, happy holidays.

878
01:26:12,501 --> 01:26:16,801
You forgot something, Julio.
This here's yours.

879
01:26:18,573 --> 01:26:23,272
Remember our conversation, never forget
the joy of living. Bye... good luck!

880
01:26:26,948 --> 01:26:29,075
Come on! Come on, start it up.

881
01:26:33,855 --> 01:26:38,053
Yeah, come on.

882
01:26:39,828 --> 01:26:41,455
No, wait, wait up, you'll flood it...

883
01:26:42,130 --> 01:26:44,030
Whoa, whoa...

884
01:26:49,871 --> 01:26:52,840
- Let's see?
- You do it, man.

885
01:26:54,810 --> 01:26:58,541
- No, hold it, hold it.
- So, you come and do it.

886
01:27:32,714 --> 01:27:34,204
Are they open?

887
01:27:34,583 --> 01:27:37,416
- Thought I saw someone inside.
- Yeah.

888
01:27:37,986 --> 01:27:39,920
Walking towards us, right?

889
01:27:41,890 --> 01:27:47,192
- Oh, well... that's it.
- Too bad.

890
01:27:48,530 --> 01:27:52,967
- Gotta be patient.
- It is kinda late.

891
01:28:16,324 --> 01:28:17,552
Come on, come on.

892
01:28:17,692 --> 01:28:19,523
Get on, boy.

893
01:28:26,868 --> 01:28:36,573
Silent night,
Holy night

894
01:28:38,547 --> 01:28:49,424
All is calm,
all is bright

895
01:28:53,461 --> 01:29:01,926
'Round yon virgin
Mother and Child

896
01:29:05,006 --> 01:29:13,846
Holy infant
so tender and mild

897
01:29:16,017 --> 01:29:23,219
Sleep in heavenly peace...

898
01:29:25,994 --> 01:29:28,292
Relax, everything went well, OK?

899
01:29:29,231 --> 01:29:31,358
Your wife is fine and so is the baby.
So...

900
01:29:31,766 --> 01:29:33,859
Thank you, doctor. God bless you.

901
01:29:34,069 --> 01:29:38,472
I'd ask you to please go wait downstairs
in a few minutes.

902
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:41,641
I let you stay for a while,
it's dangerous now.

903
01:29:41,876 --> 01:29:44,572
- Yes, of course, doctor. Of course.
- Thank you.

904
01:29:48,250 --> 01:29:49,774
It's a boy!

905
01:29:54,089 --> 01:29:55,886
Merry Christmas, doctor.

906
01:30:00,929 --> 01:30:04,831
Nothing, he was doing better and...
all of a sudden, cardiac arrest.

907
01:30:13,541 --> 01:30:21,141
Heav'nly hosts
sing Alleluia

908
01:30:24,653 --> 01:30:31,217
Christ the savior is born

909
01:30:34,796 --> 01:30:41,258
Christ the savior is born

910
01:30:47,275 --> 01:30:55,876
Silent night,
Holy night

911
01:30:58,953 --> 01:31:01,751
Son of God,
love's pure light...

912
01:31:02,324 --> 01:31:04,383
- Ready to run?
- Yeah, everything's cool.

913
01:31:08,330 --> 01:31:10,195
Come on... run.

914
01:31:10,365 --> 01:31:11,855
Come on... come on?

915
01:31:12,067 --> 01:31:18,563
Radiant beams from
Thy holy face

916
01:31:21,676 --> 01:31:29,105
With the dawn of
redeeming grace

917
01:31:31,619 --> 01:31:38,855
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth...

918
01:31:47,502 --> 01:31:49,902
Well, almost midnight all over the
country, everybody's got a glass...

919
01:31:50,004 --> 01:31:52,495
watch it with the alcohol, don't
overdo it, huh? It's Christmastime.

920
01:31:58,012 --> 01:32:04,315
Well, to you, Mom...
to Mary... Ruben,

921
01:32:07,989 --> 01:32:10,219
well, for a better world.

922
01:33:33,541 --> 01:33:36,942
Flipper's trying to tell us something,
grandpa.
