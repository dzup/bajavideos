1
00:00:44,523 --> 00:00:47,074
Quick! We can't
hold him back much longer.

2
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,378
Hurry!

3
00:00:54,632 --> 00:00:55,906
Come on!

4
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:04,574
Quick!

5
00:01:09,422 --> 00:01:10,479
Faster!

6
00:01:23,058 --> 00:01:24,694
Up on the balcony!
Come on! Quickly!

7
00:01:51,555 --> 00:01:54,351
Just read them
the sentence!

8
00:01:57,081 --> 00:01:58,968
The sentence of the court...

9
00:01:59,281 --> 00:02:01,095
is that in two days hence...

10
00:02:01,591 --> 00:02:05,628
the perfumer journeyman:
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille...

11
00:02:06,212 --> 00:02:08,453
shall be bound
to a wooden cross...

12
00:02:08,643 --> 00:02:11,667
with his face raised
towards heaven!

13
00:02:13,124 --> 00:02:15,236
And whilst still alive...

14
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,455
be dealt twelve blows
with an iron rod...

15
00:02:21,768 --> 00:02:24,587
breaking the joints
of his arms...

16
00:02:25,783 --> 00:02:26,695
his shoulders...

17
00:02:27,457 --> 00:02:28,787
his hips...

18
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,173
his legs!

19
00:02:32,407 --> 00:02:36,469
He shall then be raised up
to hang until dead.

20
00:02:36,983 --> 00:02:40,143
And all customary acts of mercy...

21
00:02:40,251 --> 00:02:43,161
are expressly forbidden
the executioner.

22
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:54,003
In 18th century France...

23
00:02:54,104 --> 00:03:00,011
there lived a man who was one of the most gifted
and notorious personages of his time.

24
00:03:00,453 --> 00:03:03,373
His name was
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille.

25
00:03:04,075 --> 00:03:08,174
And if his name has been forgotten today,
it is for the sole reason...

26
00:03:08,215 --> 00:03:11,089
that his entire ambition
was restricted to a domain...

27
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,838
that leaves no trace in history:

28
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:21,178
to the fleeting realm of scent.

29
00:03:21,179 --> 00:03:26,750
PERFUME
The Story of a Murderer

30
00:03:34,388 --> 00:03:36,364
In the period of which we speak...

31
00:03:36,465 --> 00:03:41,983
there reigned in the cities a stench
barely conceivable to us modern men and women.

32
00:03:43,058 --> 00:03:46,032
Naturally, the stench
was foulest in Paris...

33
00:03:46,067 --> 00:03:49,008
for Paris was
the largest city in Europe.

34
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:52,738
And nowhere in Paris was that stench
more profoundly repugnant...

35
00:03:52,839 --> 00:03:55,023
than in the city's fish market.

36
00:03:56,586 --> 00:03:59,867
Here we are.
I'll get another box.

37
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:04,518
It was here then,
on the most putrid spot in the whole kingdom...

38
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,142
that Jean-Baptiste Grenouille was born...

39
00:04:07,145 --> 00:04:09,938
on the 17th of July, 1738.

40
00:04:33,285 --> 00:04:35,178
It was his mother's fifth birth.

41
00:04:35,527 --> 00:04:38,217
She delivered them all here
under her fish stand.

42
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:40,868
And all had been stillbirths,
or semi-stillbirths.

43
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,042
Are you alright?

44
00:04:42,993 --> 00:04:45,511
And by evening, the whole mess
had been shoveled away...

45
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:47,301
with the fish guts
into the river.

46
00:04:48,053 --> 00:04:49,951
It would be much the same today...

47
00:04:50,738 --> 00:04:52,158
but then...

48
00:04:52,746 --> 00:04:55,559
Jean-Baptiste chose differently.

49
00:05:27,989 --> 00:05:29,144
What's that noise?

50
00:05:29,774 --> 00:05:31,575
It's... it's a baby.

51
00:05:31,576 --> 00:05:32,882
What's going on here?

52
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:39,502
- It's a newborn.
- Where's his mother?

53
00:05:40,952 --> 00:05:42,160
She was just here.

54
00:05:44,634 --> 00:05:49,810
She tried to kill it, her own child.
She tried to kill a baby!

55
00:05:51,628 --> 00:05:53,225
There! There she is!

56
00:05:53,476 --> 00:05:55,941
- Stop! Stop where you are!
- Murderer!

57
00:05:56,026 --> 00:05:59,554
Thus, the first sound
to escape Grenouille's lips...

58
00:06:00,137 --> 00:06:01,815
sent his mother
to the gallows.

59
00:06:05,609 --> 00:06:08,157
And Jean-Baptiste,
by official order...

60
00:06:09,049 --> 00:06:11,335
to the orphange
of Madame Gaillard.

61
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:19,397
- How many today?
- Four, well... three and a half.

62
00:06:23,345 --> 00:06:28,744
- As usual, more dead than alive.
- Just take the money and sign!

63
00:06:35,672 --> 00:06:39,273
- Make room!
- Where?

64
00:06:39,308 --> 00:06:40,213
Move!

65
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:55,956
Is he dead?

66
00:07:21,871 --> 00:07:25,429
- That's not staying in my bed.
- Let's throw it out then.

67
00:07:25,624 --> 00:07:29,301
- What if it screams?
- It's just a kiddie.

68
00:07:47,652 --> 00:07:49,804
Harder! Push!

69
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:53,368
What are you doing?

70
00:08:01,342 --> 00:08:02,207
For Madame Gaillard...

71
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:05,326
Grenouille was a source of income
just like any other.

72
00:08:06,056 --> 00:08:11,694
The children, however, sensed at once
that there was something different about him.

73
00:08:27,593 --> 00:08:31,975
By the age of five, Jean-Baptiste
still could not talk.

74
00:08:33,021 --> 00:08:37,510
But he had been born with a talent
that made him unique among their kind.

75
00:09:37,914 --> 00:09:40,411
It was not that the other children
hated him...

76
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,980
they felt unnerved
by him.

77
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:51,826
Increasingly, he became aware
that his phenomenal sense of smell...

78
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:54,270
was a gift that had been give to him...

79
00:09:54,646 --> 00:09:56,235
and him alone.

80
00:10:04,249 --> 00:10:07,562
When Jean-Baptiste did
finally learn to speak...

81
00:10:07,822 --> 00:10:09,881
he soon found
that everyday language...

82
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:15,071
proved inadequate for all the olfactory experience
he's accumulating within himself.

83
00:10:19,294 --> 00:10:20,718
Wood.

84
00:10:26,408 --> 00:10:27,702
Warm wood.

85
00:10:29,023 --> 00:10:32,745
Grass... wet grass.

86
00:10:33,608 --> 00:10:36,944
Stones... warm stones.

87
00:10:39,756 --> 00:10:44,003
Water... cold water.

88
00:10:50,298 --> 00:10:51,454
Frog.

89
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:55,648
Wet stones.

90
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:59,833
Big wet frog stones.

91
00:11:01,403 --> 00:11:02,936
Something...

92
00:11:04,847 --> 00:11:07,770
something, something.

93
00:11:09,212 --> 00:11:13,882
By the age of thirteen, Madame Gaillard
no longer had room for Jean-Baptiste...

94
00:11:14,228 --> 00:11:15,691
and therefore decided
to sell him.

95
00:11:15,692 --> 00:11:16,853
Come on!

96
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,117
Ten francs.

97
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:26,104
From his first breath
of the odor enveloping this man...

98
00:11:26,284 --> 00:11:28,265
Seven, it's not worth so much.

99
00:11:28,581 --> 00:11:31,525
Grenouille knew that his life
in Grimal's tannery...

100
00:11:31,712 --> 00:11:33,175
would be worth precisely
as much...

101
00:11:33,298 --> 00:11:35,015
as the work
he could accomplish.

102
00:11:38,418 --> 00:11:40,207
Unfortunately for Madame Gaillard...

103
00:11:43,732 --> 00:11:46,467
the bargain was short-lived.

104
00:11:52,315 --> 00:11:55,694
Life expectancy in the tannery
was a mere five years.

105
00:11:56,311 --> 00:12:00,100
But Jean-Baptiste proved to be
as tough as a resilient bacterium.

106
00:12:00,913 --> 00:12:02,582
He adjusted to
his new fate...

107
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:05,594
and became a paragon
of docility and diligence...

108
00:12:05,897 --> 00:12:09,881
slaved 15, 16 hours a day,
summer and winter.

109
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:15,608
Gradually, he became aware
of a world beyond the tannery...

110
00:12:16,596 --> 00:12:20,951
where utopia of unexplored smells
lay in store for him.

111
00:12:44,414 --> 00:12:45,461
Grenouille.

112
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:52,449
Come with us.
I'm taking you to town for delivery.

113
00:12:53,485 --> 00:12:57,759
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille
had triumphed. He was alive.

114
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:01,580
And at last, he was in his element.

115
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,967
He was not choosing.

116
00:13:41,502 --> 00:13:44,231
He did not differentiate between
what is commonly considered to be...

117
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:46,293
good smells from bad.

118
00:13:47,638 --> 00:13:50,394
At least, not yet.

119
00:13:52,662 --> 00:13:54,737
He was very greedy.

120
00:13:55,175 --> 00:13:57,036
The goal was to possess...

121
00:13:57,093 --> 00:14:00,463
everything the world had to offer
in the way of odors.

122
00:14:01,194 --> 00:14:05,146
His only condition being...
that they were new ones.

123
00:14:07,725 --> 00:14:11,337
Thousands upon thousands of odors
formed an invisible gruel...

124
00:14:11,478 --> 00:14:15,702
which he dissected into its
smallest and most remote parts of pieces.

125
00:14:31,792 --> 00:14:33,076
Grenouille!

126
00:14:36,872 --> 00:14:38,339
Come on!

127
00:14:42,153 --> 00:14:43,822
Your ass over here.

128
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,275
- What is it called?
- "Amor and Psyche", madame.

129
00:15:58,581 --> 00:16:00,108
My little creation.

130
00:16:00,662 --> 00:16:04,750
- May I try it?
- If you allow me, mademoiselle.

131
00:16:12,148 --> 00:16:14,563
Sheer heaven...

132
00:16:17,057 --> 00:16:20,951
Monsieur P¨¦lissier, you are
truly an artiste.

133
00:18:43,697 --> 00:18:44,912
What do you want?

134
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:54,872
Want to buy some?

135
00:19:08,187 --> 00:19:09,457
Two for a sou.

136
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:08,816
That's for you
running off like that.

137
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:10,761
I'll kill you!

138
00:25:14,428 --> 00:25:17,141
That night, he could not sleep.

139
00:25:18,008 --> 00:25:22,473
The intoxicating power of the girls's scent
suddenly made it clear to him...

140
00:25:22,526 --> 00:25:26,674
why he had come to his own life
so tenaciously, so savagely.

141
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:29,564
The meaning and purpose...

142
00:25:29,656 --> 00:25:32,561
of his miserable existence
had a higher destiny.

143
00:25:33,887 --> 00:25:36,648
He would learn
how to preserve scent...

144
00:25:36,864 --> 00:25:41,043
so that never again would he lose
such sublime beauty.

145
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:07,785
There were about a dozen perfumers
in Paris in those days.

146
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:13,147
One of them, the one celebrated
Italian perfumer, Giuseppe Baldini,

147
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,232
had set up shop
in the center of the bridge,

148
00:26:15,298 --> 00:26:19,680
called "the Pont au Change" on his arrival
in Paris over thirty years ago.

149
00:26:20,397 --> 00:26:22,993
To be sure,
at one time in his youth,

150
00:26:23,173 --> 00:26:28,128
Baldini had created several truly great perfumes
to which he owed his fortune.

151
00:26:29,886 --> 00:26:34,384
But now, Baldini was out of touch,
out of fashion,

152
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,565
and spent his days
waiting for customers that no longer came.

153
00:26:40,294 --> 00:26:42,175
- Ch¨¦nier! There you are!
- Monsieur Baldini.

154
00:26:42,176 --> 00:26:43,480
Put on your wig.

155
00:26:44,056 --> 00:26:45,472
Put on your wig!

156
00:26:47,828 --> 00:26:48,792
You going out?

157
00:26:49,587 --> 00:26:51,626
I will retire to my study
for a few hours,

158
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,332
and do not want to be disturbed
under any circumstances.

159
00:26:54,436 --> 00:26:56,449
Will you be creating
a new perfume, Monsieur Baldini?

160
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,746
Correct.
For Count Verhamont.

161
00:26:59,256 --> 00:27:01,585
He's asked for something like...

162
00:27:01,638 --> 00:27:05,531
I think he said it was called...
"Amor and Psyche"?

163
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:08,171
That swindler in the
rue Saint-Andr¨¦-des-Arts.

164
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:11,758
- P¨¦lissier.
- P¨¦lissier! That's him.

165
00:27:13,311 --> 00:27:14,644
"Amor and Psyche"ê.

166
00:27:19,377 --> 00:27:21,321
- Do you know it?
- Oh, yes.

167
00:27:21,405 --> 00:27:23,400
You can smell it everywhere
these days, monsieur.

168
00:27:24,316 --> 00:27:25,622
Every street corner.

169
00:27:27,115 --> 00:27:30,385
In fact, I just purchased
you a sample.

170
00:27:32,265 --> 00:27:33,976
In case you wanted
to test it.

171
00:27:36,438 --> 00:27:39,624
What on earth makes you think
I'd be interested in testing it?

172
00:27:41,313 --> 00:27:43,631
You're right.
It's nothing special.

173
00:27:44,244 --> 00:27:46,921
Actually, it's a very
common scent.

174
00:27:47,612 --> 00:27:50,535
I believe the head cord
contains lime oil.

175
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:55,432
Really? And the heart cord?

176
00:27:56,084 --> 00:27:58,342
Orange blossom, I believe.

177
00:27:58,874 --> 00:28:03,211
And civet in the base cord,
but I cannot say for sure.

178
00:28:03,373 --> 00:28:07,080
Well, I couldn't care less what that bungler
P¨¦lissier slops into his perfumes.

179
00:28:07,438 --> 00:28:08,700
Naturally not, monsieur.

180
00:28:09,226 --> 00:28:12,450
And I am thinking of creating something
for Count Verhamont...

181
00:28:12,751 --> 00:28:16,083
that will cause
a veritable sensation.

182
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:18,166
I'm sure it will, Monsieur Baldini.

183
00:28:19,258 --> 00:28:23,259
Take charge of the shop, Ch¨¦nier.
And don't let anyone come near me.

184
00:28:23,373 --> 00:28:26,383
Inspiration requires
peace and tranquility.

185
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:30,315
Vanessa! Bring me the handkerchiefs!

186
00:28:59,672 --> 00:29:01,076
Here are your handkerchiefs.

187
00:29:01,205 --> 00:29:03,797
Grazie... grazie... grazie!

188
00:29:06,583 --> 00:29:08,478
Is there anything else
you need?

189
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:11,240
Inspiration, perhaps.

190
00:29:11,501 --> 00:29:12,891
Come on, Giuseppe!

191
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:18,211
You're still
the great perfumer Baldini.

192
00:30:09,731 --> 00:30:12,579
Bellissimo...
Wonderful...

193
00:30:16,504 --> 00:30:18,176
He did it again.

194
00:30:24,171 --> 00:30:27,208
Lime oil, yes indeed.

195
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:33,280
Orange blossom, to be sure.

196
00:30:37,364 --> 00:30:39,374
And a hint of cloves, perhaps.

197
00:30:41,499 --> 00:30:42,557
No...

198
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:45,656
Well, could be cinnamon.

199
00:30:48,017 --> 00:30:48,848
It's gone.

200
00:30:52,469 --> 00:30:53,600
Cinnamon.

201
00:30:54,486 --> 00:30:55,857
It's not cinnamon...

202
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,699
Cloves.

203
00:31:01,209 --> 00:31:01,670
No...

204
00:31:02,592 --> 00:31:03,566
Musk?

205
00:31:03,775 --> 00:31:04,736
No.

206
00:31:43,757 --> 00:31:44,502
Who's there?

207
00:31:45,234 --> 00:31:46,713
I'm from Grimal's tannery.

208
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:52,253
I've brought
the goatskins you ordered.

209
00:31:57,938 --> 00:31:59,128
Follow me.

210
00:32:05,164 --> 00:32:06,350
This way.

211
00:32:39,197 --> 00:32:41,919
There. Leave them there.

212
00:32:50,808 --> 00:32:52,525
Tell your master
the skins are fine.

213
00:32:53,045 --> 00:32:55,305
I'll come by the next few days
and pay for them.

214
00:32:56,453 --> 00:32:57,823
Yes, monsieur.

215
00:33:03,935 --> 00:33:06,821
You want to make this leather
smell good, don't you?

216
00:33:08,192 --> 00:33:13,302
- Why, of course.
- With "Amor and Psyche" by P¨¦lissier?

217
00:33:17,107 --> 00:33:21,017
Whatever gave you the absurb idea
I would use someone else's perfume?

218
00:33:22,152 --> 00:33:22,979
It's all over you.

219
00:33:23,451 --> 00:33:25,716
It's on your forehead,
your nose, your hands.

220
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:30,528
It's bad, "Amor and Psyche" is, master.
There's too much rosemary in it, and too much of...

221
00:33:32,193 --> 00:33:34,337
that and that.

222
00:33:37,005 --> 00:33:40,499
Bergamot and patchouli.

223
00:33:40,554 --> 00:33:41,565
Pa...

224
00:33:42,383 --> 00:33:44,856
- Patchouli.
- Patchou...

225
00:33:49,939 --> 00:33:51,131
What else?

226
00:33:54,136 --> 00:33:55,611
That and that.

227
00:33:57,469 --> 00:33:58,686
That and that.

228
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:09,283
Orange blossom.

229
00:34:10,866 --> 00:34:11,956
Lime.

230
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:14,662
- Musk.
- Musk.

231
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:19,347
And cloves.

232
00:34:19,661 --> 00:34:21,168
And this.

233
00:34:29,306 --> 00:34:32,027
- Storax?
- That's in it too.

234
00:34:32,102 --> 00:34:34,903
- Storax. Storax.
- Storax. Storax.

235
00:34:41,343 --> 00:34:43,989
You have, it appears,
a fine nose, young man. But...

236
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:47,857
My nose knows all the smells in the world.
It's the best nose in Paris.

237
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,296
Only I don't know the names.
I need to learn the names...

238
00:34:50,329 --> 00:34:52,149
- learn them all...
- No! No! No! Basta!

239
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,972
You don't interrupt me when I'm speaking.

240
00:34:54,019 --> 00:34:56,270
You're both impertinent
and insolent!

241
00:34:57,229 --> 00:34:59,534
Even I don't know every scent.

242
00:35:01,673 --> 00:35:04,955
I, of course, know for some time
the ingredients of "Amor and Psyche".

243
00:35:04,956 --> 00:35:08,892
But all it needs to find that out
is a passably fine nose, nothing else.

244
00:35:10,866 --> 00:35:14,083
But it needs the craft
of a true perfumer...

245
00:35:14,913 --> 00:35:16,707
to detect the exact formula.

246
00:35:17,142 --> 00:35:21,542
Which notes, which cords.
And in what precise measurements.

247
00:35:22,956 --> 00:35:25,949
Could you tell me the exact formula
of "Amor and Psyche"ê?

248
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:30,215
"Best nose in Paris".

249
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:36,886
Speak up!

250
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:40,832
You see, you can't, can you?
And I'll tell you why.

251
00:35:42,081 --> 00:35:44,616
Because talent means
next to nothing!

252
00:35:46,752 --> 00:35:49,251
While experience, acquired in humility...

253
00:35:49,762 --> 00:35:53,038
and hard work, means everything.

254
00:35:57,294 --> 00:35:59,765
I don't, I don't know
what a formula is.

255
00:35:59,967 --> 00:36:02,797
But I can make
"Amor and Psyche" for you now.

256
00:36:04,084 --> 00:36:07,158
And you think I'll just let you
slop around in my laboratory...

257
00:36:07,259 --> 00:36:09,153
with essential oils
that are worth a fortune?

258
00:36:09,489 --> 00:36:10,400
You?

259
00:36:11,506 --> 00:36:13,921
- Yes.
- Now pay attention!

260
00:36:17,172 --> 00:36:18,581
What is your name, anyway?

261
00:36:20,535 --> 00:36:22,217
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille.

262
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:27,343
Very well, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille.

263
00:36:29,096 --> 00:36:32,371
You shall have the opportunity now,
this very moment, to prove your assertion.

264
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:35,460
Your grandiose failure will also be
an opportunity for you to learn...

265
00:36:35,506 --> 00:36:38,697
- the virture of humility.
- How much do you want me to make?

266
00:36:38,747 --> 00:36:42,137
- How much of... what?
- How much "Amor and Psyche" do you want?

267
00:36:44,837 --> 00:36:48,667
- Shall I fill this flask?
- No! You shall not!

268
00:36:57,644 --> 00:37:00,206
- You may fill this one.
- Yes, master.

269
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:05,254
- But, Master Baldini,
- Hmm?

270
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:08,160
you must let me do it
in my own way.

271
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:10,377
As you please.

272
00:37:16,608 --> 00:37:18,847
Don't drop that!
That's pure alcohol!

273
00:37:18,919 --> 00:37:21,061
You want to blow up
the entire building?

274
00:37:23,503 --> 00:37:25,132
You have to measure it first!

275
00:38:12,144 --> 00:38:15,456
Stop! Stop it!
That's enough! Basta!

276
00:38:15,841 --> 00:38:17,075
You know nothing!

277
00:38:17,546 --> 00:38:22,045
Essential oils are always to be
mixed first, then the alcohol added.

278
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,225
And never ever let this perfume
to be shaken like that.

279
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:28,697
I must've been insane
to listen to your asinine gibberish.

280
00:38:30,555 --> 00:38:32,115
Yes, we're done.

281
00:39:00,745 --> 00:39:02,375
Mamamiya...

282
00:39:16,194 --> 00:39:18,424
This is "Amor and Psyche".

283
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:21,484
But it's not a good perfume, master.

284
00:39:22,998 --> 00:39:26,351
If you let me again, master,
I'll make it more better.

285
00:40:38,341 --> 00:40:40,486
That's a really good perfume.

286
00:40:47,106 --> 00:40:49,216
Don't you want
to smell it, master?

287
00:40:49,267 --> 00:40:51,023
I'm not in the mood
to test it now.

288
00:40:51,072 --> 00:40:53,765
I have other things
on my mind. Go now.

289
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:57,984
- But, master...
- Go now!

290
00:41:12,624 --> 00:41:15,524
Can't I come to work
for you, master, can't I?

291
00:41:17,635 --> 00:41:19,698
- Let me think about it.
- Master!

292
00:41:21,311 --> 00:41:24,315
I have to learn
how to keep smell.

293
00:41:25,743 --> 00:41:29,962
- What?
- Can you teach me that?

294
00:41:30,478 --> 00:41:32,661
I shall have to think
about it. Now go.

295
00:42:17,158 --> 00:42:18,672
I love you.

296
00:42:24,944 --> 00:42:27,377
I'll give you 50 francs for him.

297
00:42:34,429 --> 00:42:35,988
Grenouille!

298
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:39,731
Grimal's transaction had
a profound effect on all three parties.

299
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:40,811
Hey, watch out!

300
00:42:44,378 --> 00:42:47,370
Now at least, upon
Monsieur Grimal himself.

301
00:42:50,131 --> 00:42:51,831
As for Giuseppe Baldini,

302
00:42:51,899 --> 00:42:56,423
the acquisition of Grenouille miraculously
transformed his dwindling business,

303
00:42:56,489 --> 00:42:59,315
even surpassing
its former glory.

304
00:43:07,038 --> 00:43:09,094
While at last, for Jean-Baptiste,

305
00:43:09,408 --> 00:43:13,979
the mysterious secret
of the perfumers' craft began to unfold.

306
00:43:20,088 --> 00:43:22,570
Now, pay careful attention
to what I tell you.

307
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,088
Just like a musical cord,

308
00:43:24,146 --> 00:43:27,899
a perfume cord contains
four essences, or notes,

309
00:43:27,958 --> 00:43:31,085
carefully selected
for their harmonic affinity.

310
00:43:31,142 --> 00:43:36,386
Each perfume contains three cords:
the head, the heart and the base,

311
00:43:36,423 --> 00:43:38,972
necessitating twelve notes in all.

312
00:43:39,567 --> 00:43:42,470
The head cord contains
the first impression,

313
00:43:42,528 --> 00:43:45,992
lasting only a few minutes,
before giving way to the heart cord:

314
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:49,646
the theme of the perfume,
lasting several hours.

315
00:43:49,684 --> 00:43:52,307
Finally, the base cord:

316
00:43:52,627 --> 00:43:56,318
the trail of the perfume,
lasting several days.

317
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:05,309
Mind you, the ancient Egyptians believed
that one can only create a truly original perfume...

318
00:44:05,374 --> 00:44:11,744
by adding an extra note,
one final essence that will ring out...

319
00:44:12,234 --> 00:44:14,392
and dominate the others.

320
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:20,972
Legend has it that a jar
was once found in a pharaoh's tomb.

321
00:44:21,072 --> 00:44:24,595
And when it was opened,
a perfume was released.

322
00:44:24,715 --> 00:44:27,615
After all those thousands of years,

323
00:44:27,675 --> 00:44:31,581
a perfume of such subtle beauty,
and yet such power,

324
00:44:31,671 --> 00:44:34,491
that for one single moment,

325
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:38,970
every single person on earth
believed they were in paradise.

326
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:43,275
Twelve essences
could be identified.

327
00:44:44,258 --> 00:44:47,956
But the thirteenth,
the vital one...

328
00:44:49,413 --> 00:44:51,509
could never be determined.

329
00:44:53,221 --> 00:44:54,036
Why not?

330
00:44:56,442 --> 00:44:57,022
Why not??

331
00:44:57,244 --> 00:44:58,777
What do you mean why not?

332
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:02,435
Because it's a legend, numskull.

333
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:04,823
What's a legend?

334
00:45:07,394 --> 00:45:08,311
Never mind.

335
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:51,326
Jean-Baptiste. Jean-Baptiste.

336
00:45:56,946 --> 00:45:58,180
What's the matter?

337
00:45:58,734 --> 00:46:02,507
I... I have to learn
how to capture a scent.

338
00:46:05,077 --> 00:46:06,524
What are you talking about?

339
00:46:07,021 --> 00:46:11,578
I have to learn how... how to
capture a scent and "reprose" it forever.

340
00:46:11,823 --> 00:46:14,836
- You mean "preserve".
- Yes, teach me that.

341
00:46:15,186 --> 00:46:18,577
Calm down, my boy.
Calm down.

342
00:46:19,137 --> 00:46:20,678
We have work to do.

343
00:46:22,373 --> 00:46:27,554
The soul of beings is their scent.
You said that, master.

344
00:46:28,865 --> 00:46:29,749
Did I?

345
00:46:30,203 --> 00:46:34,062
I will make as many perfumes as you want.
But you have to teach me...

346
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:36,895
how to capture
the smell of all things.

347
00:46:38,263 --> 00:46:39,582
Can you do that?

348
00:46:40,926 --> 00:46:45,258
- Well, naturally.
- Then teach me everything you know.

349
00:46:48,452 --> 00:46:50,900
And I'll make you the best perfumer
in the whole world.

350
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:09,937
Imagine, Jean-Baptiste:

351
00:47:09,995 --> 00:47:16,354
ten thousand roses to produce
one single ounce of essential oil.

352
00:47:18,113 --> 00:47:24,001
Now, keep them flowing,
for the bottom petals will be given to stew,

353
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:25,827
while I set up the alembic.

354
00:47:25,871 --> 00:47:27,663
And take care.
Not to damage them.

355
00:47:27,924 --> 00:47:31,655
We have to let them go to
their deaths with their scent intact.

356
00:47:49,424 --> 00:47:52,777
Perfect! Now, help me
with the boiler set.

357
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:08,931
Temperature is vital.
When the quicksilver is here,

358
00:48:09,008 --> 00:48:13,702
the heat is precisely correct,
and the oil will gradually rise.

359
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:20,410
Note that this mechanism is
a remarkable invention of my own devising.

360
00:48:20,954 --> 00:48:26,621
You will observe how cold water
is pumped through here,

361
00:48:27,252 --> 00:48:32,101
allowing the essence
to condense here...

362
00:48:32,157 --> 00:48:34,022
until it finally...

363
00:48:35,185 --> 00:48:36,482
appears...

364
00:48:37,958 --> 00:48:39,213
here!

365
00:48:40,153 --> 00:48:46,253
Of course, out on the hillside above Grasse,
we had only to bellow pure fresh air.

366
00:48:47,256 --> 00:48:50,250
Ah, Grasse! What a town.

367
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:57,640
The Rome of scents.
The Promised Land of perfume.

368
00:48:58,984 --> 00:49:03,315
No man can rightly
call himself a perfumer,

369
00:49:03,662 --> 00:49:07,844
unless he has proved his worth
in that hallowed place.

370
00:49:10,176 --> 00:49:12,783
Not to worry!
It happens all the time.

371
00:49:14,356 --> 00:49:15,995
To Grasse.

372
00:49:33,226 --> 00:49:34,278
Master.

373
00:49:35,458 --> 00:49:36,432
Look.

374
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:44,000
The very soul of the rose.

375
00:50:35,981 --> 00:50:37,629
Jean-Baptiste.

376
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:41,447
What's wrong?

377
00:50:42,879 --> 00:50:44,251
Jean-Baptiste.

378
00:50:47,285 --> 00:50:50,070
- What have you done?
- You lied.

379
00:50:50,408 --> 00:50:53,512
- What?
- You lied to me.

380
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:56,872
How dare you
talk to me like that!

381
00:50:58,281 --> 00:51:00,888
You said I could capture
the scent of anything.

382
00:51:01,661 --> 00:51:03,047
And so you can!

383
00:51:06,928 --> 00:51:08,123
What do you smell?

384
00:51:09,314 --> 00:51:10,713
What do you smell?

385
00:51:15,932 --> 00:51:16,611
Nothing.

386
00:51:20,013 --> 00:51:23,333
- What were you expecting to smell?
- Glass.

387
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:27,932
- But glass doesn't smell.
- Of course it does. What's this?

388
00:51:32,988 --> 00:51:34,503
I don't smell a thing.

389
00:51:35,325 --> 00:51:36,016
Basta!

390
00:51:36,068 --> 00:51:38,358
- Did you smell that copper?
- Enough!

391
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:44,775
You were trying to distil
the smell of copper?

392
00:51:45,275 --> 00:51:46,111
iron...

393
00:51:46,164 --> 00:51:47,129
glass...

394
00:51:47,591 --> 00:51:48,854
copper...

395
00:51:52,365 --> 00:51:54,013
What else did you try?

396
00:51:57,774 --> 00:51:58,530
No!

397
00:52:00,718 --> 00:52:02,666
Have you gone completely insane?!

398
00:52:03,611 --> 00:52:05,650
You told me I had to experiment.

399
00:52:05,925 --> 00:52:10,906
Experiment? Experiment?
With a cat?!

400
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:15,806
What kind of a human being are youê é?

401
00:52:16,419 --> 00:52:17,977
Don't you know anything?

402
00:52:18,304 --> 00:52:20,452
You can no more distil
the scent of a cat...

403
00:52:20,506 --> 00:52:22,911
than you can distil
the scent of you and me!

404
00:52:33,426 --> 00:52:36,205
- I can't?
- Of course not!

405
00:52:43,153 --> 00:52:44,775
He's in stadio ultimo.

406
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:46,284
- What?
- He's dying.

407
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:47,832
Is there nothing you can do?

408
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:51,415
- I fear not.
- No! He cannot die.

409
00:52:51,472 --> 00:52:55,374
- Well, the fee is 50 francs.
- 50 francs? You're a charlatan!

410
00:53:01,112 --> 00:53:05,111
Oh dear, Jean-Baptiste!

411
00:53:06,192 --> 00:53:10,258
You cannot do this to me.
Please, don't die on me.

412
00:53:10,592 --> 00:53:12,823
Not now, not yet!

413
00:53:23,813 --> 00:53:26,005
Is there...

414
00:53:29,647 --> 00:53:31,593
any other way...

415
00:53:32,889 --> 00:53:35,708
to preserve smell
besides distil it?

416
00:53:36,107 --> 00:53:37,851
Jean-Baptiste...

417
00:53:42,617 --> 00:53:48,500
- Is there, master?
- Well, yes, I... I believe there is.

418
00:53:49,909 --> 00:53:51,789
What is ité?

419
00:53:53,545 --> 00:53:57,503
It is known as
the mysterious art of Enfleurage.

420
00:53:59,894 --> 00:54:01,508
Can you teach me?

421
00:54:04,518 --> 00:54:07,708
Not even I am intimate
with the secrets.

422
00:54:10,365 --> 00:54:12,782
But could I learn it in Grasse?

423
00:54:13,886 --> 00:54:16,635
- Well...
- Could I?

424
00:54:22,374 --> 00:54:25,529
Where else but in Grasse!

425
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:33,450
Within a week, Grenouille was well again.

426
00:54:33,802 --> 00:54:36,464
But in order to travel to Grasse,
and find a job,

427
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:39,066
he needed a journeyman's papers.

428
00:54:39,302 --> 00:54:41,118
Baldini agreed to provide them,

429
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:47,152
on condition that Grenouille left him
not less than 100 formulas for new perfumes.

430
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:52,048
Grenouille did not mind.
He could've given him a thousand.

431
00:54:57,379 --> 00:55:01,281
The morning of Grenouille's departure,
Baldini was pleased.

432
00:55:01,725 --> 00:55:05,666
At last, he felt rewarded
for his many years of hard work.

433
00:55:06,186 --> 00:55:09,271
He could not remember
a happier day.

434
00:55:09,469 --> 00:55:12,271
Deeply satisfied, he went
back to sleep...

435
00:55:12,756 --> 00:55:15,718
and awoke no more
in this life.

436
00:55:33,991 --> 00:55:38,726
With every step Grenouille took away
from the city, the happier he felt.

437
00:55:39,172 --> 00:55:43,886
The air above him grew
clearer, purer, cleaner.

438
00:55:44,016 --> 00:55:47,089
And at last, he was
able to breathe freely.

439
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:53,036
There were two ways
to reach Grasse.

440
00:55:53,237 --> 00:55:56,749
The first followed the winding road
through the villages...

441
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:59,758
while the second lay straight across
the hills and mountains,

442
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:01,925
down into Provence.

443
00:56:02,917 --> 00:56:05,183
The choice was quite easy.

444
00:56:08,905 --> 00:56:13,734
Thus, his nose led him ever higher,
ever further from mankind.

445
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:19,472
Ever more towards the magnetic pole
of the greatest possible solitude.

446
00:56:56,624 --> 00:56:57,997
Grenouille needed a moment...

447
00:56:58,049 --> 00:57:00,969
to believe that he had actually
found a spot on earth...

448
00:57:01,003 --> 00:57:03,824
where scent was almost absent.

449
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:10,036
Spread all around...

450
00:57:10,099 --> 00:57:13,177
lay nothing but the tranquil
scent of dead stone.

451
00:57:16,372 --> 00:57:19,450
There was something
sacred about this place.

452
00:57:22,965 --> 00:57:25,571
No longer distracted
by anything external,

453
00:57:26,294 --> 00:57:30,851
he was finally able
to bask in his own existence.

454
00:57:32,264 --> 00:57:35,462
And found it splendid!

455
00:57:42,413 --> 00:57:46,669
After a while, he almost forgot
his plans and obsessions.

456
00:57:47,994 --> 00:57:51,493
And indeed,
might've done so altogether.

457
00:58:05,873 --> 00:58:07,051
Helloá.

458
00:58:10,996 --> 00:58:12,355
Helloá.

459
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:16,438
Helloá.

460
00:58:33,235 --> 00:58:35,965
There were a thousand smells
in his clothes.

461
00:58:36,028 --> 00:58:38,942
The smell of sand, stone, moss...

462
00:58:38,981 --> 00:58:41,512
even the smell of the sausage
he'd eaten weeks ago.

463
00:58:41,982 --> 00:58:44,357
Only one smell was not there:

464
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:48,977
His own.

465
00:59:24,504 --> 00:59:27,064
For the first time in his life,
Grenouille realized...

466
00:59:27,124 --> 00:59:29,623
that he had no smell of his own.

467
00:59:30,889 --> 00:59:32,376
He realized that all his life...

468
00:59:32,452 --> 00:59:34,800
he had been a nobody
to everyone.

469
00:59:35,995 --> 00:59:39,674
What he now felt
was the fear of his own oblivion.

470
00:59:40,359 --> 00:59:41,981
It was as though...

471
00:59:42,144 --> 00:59:44,022
he did not exist.

472
00:59:49,202 --> 00:59:53,347
By the first light of next morning,
Grenouille had a new plan.

473
00:59:53,737 --> 00:59:56,550
He must continue
his journey to Grasse.

474
00:59:56,870 --> 01:00:00,267
There he would teach the world
not only that he existed...

475
01:00:00,338 --> 01:00:01,966
that he was someone...

476
01:00:02,293 --> 01:00:04,796
but that he was exceptional.

477
01:00:08,676 --> 01:00:10,326
And with this decision,

478
01:00:10,729 --> 01:00:14,832
it seemed that the gods
had at last begun to smile on him.

479
01:04:31,357 --> 01:04:32,621
Laura?

480
01:04:40,006 --> 01:04:41,241
Laura?

481
01:04:42,018 --> 01:04:43,784
Coming, papa.

482
01:05:18,875 --> 01:05:21,142
Haven't seen you here before.

483
01:05:22,623 --> 01:05:24,292
It's my first season.

484
01:05:25,721 --> 01:05:27,790
Picking together
is always more fun.

485
01:05:29,134 --> 01:05:31,277
They say you pick
everything you find.

486
01:06:13,916 --> 01:06:17,845
Idiot! How many times do I told you
not to cram the blossoms in...

487
01:06:17,881 --> 01:06:19,568
like you're stuffing a chicken?

488
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:22,733
Watch how Grenouille does it.

489
01:06:24,706 --> 01:06:28,647
Look how skillfully he handles them.
The whole art of Enflourage...

490
01:06:28,685 --> 01:06:32,607
is to allow the flowers to die slowly,
in their sleep as it were...

491
01:06:32,934 --> 01:06:37,687
handle them as you would a lady.
Wouldn't you agree with me, Druot?

492
01:06:38,136 --> 01:06:39,910
If you say so, madame.

493
01:06:42,433 --> 01:06:45,021
You! Check the jonquil blossoms.

494
01:06:48,407 --> 01:06:50,006
It need more time.

495
01:06:52,494 --> 01:06:54,199
Do what I say.

496
01:07:36,582 --> 01:07:37,781
Stop it!

497
01:07:38,679 --> 01:07:40,014
I'm not in the mood.

498
01:07:40,433 --> 01:07:41,620
Are you sure?

499
01:07:42,585 --> 01:07:44,219
Of course I'm sure.

500
01:07:50,275 --> 01:07:51,824
I said...

501
01:07:54,372 --> 01:07:55,800
"no".

502
01:08:06,546 --> 01:08:08,203
Suit yourself.

503
01:08:11,328 --> 01:08:12,767
Lucien?

504
01:08:15,953 --> 01:08:18,729
- Fetch me by the ladder!
- Fetch it yourself!

505
01:08:30,299 --> 01:08:31,706
Lucien?

506
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:36,222
Lucien!

507
01:08:46,654 --> 01:08:47,879
Lucien?

508
01:08:50,927 --> 01:08:52,346
Lucien?

509
01:09:10,255 --> 01:09:11,664
Lucien.

510
01:10:06,595 --> 01:10:07,628
Tuberoses.

511
01:10:08,022 --> 01:10:10,790
For Madame Arnulfi.
She hereá?

512
01:10:14,202 --> 01:10:15,039
She's busy.

513
01:10:22,648 --> 01:10:24,954
Seem such a waste to boil them!

514
01:10:26,027 --> 01:10:28,297
Or whatever you do with them.

515
01:10:33,037 --> 01:10:35,648
So, what do you do with them?

516
01:10:36,099 --> 01:10:39,817
- Warm them in animal fat.
- What for?

517
01:10:40,083 --> 01:10:42,460
The fat soaks up
their scent.

518
01:10:42,605 --> 01:10:43,851
Then what?

519
01:10:45,947 --> 01:10:49,533
Then I cool it
toward pomade, and...

520
01:10:50,145 --> 01:10:53,794
and then I filter it, before...

521
01:10:57,678 --> 01:10:58,944
Before what?

522
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:02,290
Before adding alcohol and other essences
to make perfume.

523
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:04,522
Don't touch anything!

524
01:11:09,748 --> 01:11:10,851
What's in there?

525
01:11:12,356 --> 01:11:13,854
Nothing, just flowers.

526
01:11:14,372 --> 01:11:15,542
- Can I look?
- No.

527
01:11:16,154 --> 01:11:18,384
Not now, I've got work to do.
You must go now.

528
01:11:18,409 --> 01:11:21,132
- Ah, come on, let me look.
- Don't touch!

529
01:11:24,081 --> 01:11:26,453
- Morning, madame.
- Morning.

530
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:32,297
Why do you cover the tank?

531
01:11:33,389 --> 01:11:36,267
It's an experiment, madame, to...

532
01:11:36,668 --> 01:11:40,155
to... protect the blossoms
from daylight,

533
01:11:40,415 --> 01:11:42,191
to preserve the scent better.

534
01:11:43,337 --> 01:11:45,437
Well, if you say so.

535
01:11:46,845 --> 01:11:50,396
Come with me.
I'll settle your master's account.

536
01:11:52,386 --> 01:11:54,805
To preserve their scent better, you say?

537
01:12:08,526 --> 01:12:10,013
I don't smell much.

538
01:12:16,091 --> 01:12:20,054
No. Then my experiment
was a failure.

539
01:12:23,232 --> 01:12:26,324
Make sure it's your time
you're wasting, not ours.

540
01:12:38,456 --> 01:12:40,147
How much must I pay?

541
01:12:42,235 --> 01:12:43,939
To be with youê.

542
01:12:44,507 --> 01:12:46,103
Depends what you want.

543
01:12:59,864 --> 01:13:01,257
What's that stuff?

544
01:13:04,387 --> 01:13:06,161
I'm creating a perfume.

545
01:13:09,232 --> 01:13:10,534
Lie down, please.

546
01:13:29,637 --> 01:13:31,009
They feels horrible.

547
01:13:32,171 --> 01:13:35,720
It's only animal fat.
To soak up your scent.

548
01:13:36,575 --> 01:13:38,850
Creating a perfume, mate?

549
01:13:39,029 --> 01:13:39,902
Come on, admit it.

550
01:13:39,986 --> 01:13:42,313
You're getting some sorta
bang out of this, aren't you?

551
01:13:42,966 --> 01:13:44,299
Aren't you?

552
01:13:45,123 --> 01:13:46,965
I enjoy my work.

553
01:13:48,486 --> 01:13:50,206
Keep your arm still.

554
01:13:57,534 --> 01:13:59,255
Don't think you're
gonna tie me up.

555
01:14:00,437 --> 01:14:02,325
Hold out your arm, please.

556
01:14:10,068 --> 01:14:11,970
I've come across
some strange men in my time...

557
01:14:11,973 --> 01:14:15,346
Just... relax!

558
01:14:22,275 --> 01:14:24,290
Holy Mother! What's that?

559
01:14:27,253 --> 01:14:29,978
- Just scraping off the fat.
- Are you mad?

560
01:14:30,035 --> 01:14:32,953
I said relax!
You'll ruin everything.

561
01:14:33,525 --> 01:14:37,209
Your frighten just stink,
your perfume will be spoiled.

562
01:14:37,351 --> 01:14:38,519
I've had enough!

563
01:14:39,779 --> 01:14:42,626
Get out!
Here, take your money!

564
01:14:43,233 --> 01:14:46,277
Baste me with all these goo.
What do you think I am? A Christmas goose?

565
01:14:46,724 --> 01:14:48,283
Get out of here!

566
01:18:06,124 --> 01:18:08,996
Quickly! Blow them out
before the roses melt.

567
01:18:09,487 --> 01:18:11,678
- Roses can't melt, papa.
- These ones can.

568
01:18:26,189 --> 01:18:29,929
Now I'd like to propose a toast
to our guest of honor...

569
01:18:30,684 --> 01:18:32,838
His Excellency, the Marquis de Montesquieu.

570
01:18:33,469 --> 01:18:35,789
May our trade continue to flourish!

571
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:42,793
I thank you all...

572
01:18:43,058 --> 01:18:45,624
and will ask of you the honor
to be the first to...

573
01:18:45,811 --> 01:18:48,064
offer my congratulations
to your beautiful daughter.

574
01:18:48,284 --> 01:18:50,978
And present her with
a small token of my affection.

575
01:19:15,984 --> 01:19:19,252
- I'm overwhelmed, Your Grace.
- Your Grace?

576
01:19:20,264 --> 01:19:23,008
I had hoped that it would be
on more familiar terms by now.

577
01:19:26,498 --> 01:19:30,441
- Let's have a game of hide-and-seek!
- Oh, yes! But everyone must play.

578
01:19:33,202 --> 01:19:34,750
Men catch the women.

579
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:38,818
Bravo! Bravo!

580
01:19:41,825 --> 01:19:43,525
Albine, wait!

581
01:20:16,112 --> 01:20:17,154
No!

582
01:21:09,463 --> 01:21:11,841
Put me down, please!

583
01:21:16,454 --> 01:21:18,231
Now there's no escape.

584
01:21:47,025 --> 01:21:48,870
Game's over, everybody!

585
01:21:51,438 --> 01:21:52,341
Laura!

586
01:21:54,138 --> 01:21:56,039
Time to go in now!

587
01:22:18,916 --> 01:22:20,271
Laura.

588
01:22:37,691 --> 01:22:40,116
Albine! Fran?oise!

589
01:22:45,690 --> 01:22:48,111
Laura, have you seen the twins?

590
01:22:48,501 --> 01:22:50,502
No, not since the game started.

591
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:54,925
Albine. Fran?oise.

592
01:23:05,597 --> 01:23:10,820
- Albine! Fran?oise!
- Jacques, take this way.

593
01:23:11,976 --> 01:23:13,031
You two, go with me.

594
01:23:13,164 --> 01:23:17,043
Your Excellency, through here.

595
01:24:32,211 --> 01:24:34,956
I've told that cretin ten times
to get these ready.

596
01:24:35,574 --> 01:24:37,068
Don't keep picking on the boy.

597
01:24:38,118 --> 01:24:40,818
I'll kill the useless little sewer rat!

598
01:24:41,232 --> 01:24:44,414
Grenouille! What are you doing?

599
01:24:44,982 --> 01:24:47,136
Why aren't the enfleurage frames...

600
01:24:53,861 --> 01:24:55,719
- Yes, master?
- I mean...

601
01:24:55,755 --> 01:24:59,428
would you be good enough to prepare
the enfleurage frames, Jean-Baptiste?

602
01:25:02,815 --> 01:25:04,781
Certainly, master.

603
01:25:14,675 --> 01:25:15,736
Hey, look!

604
01:25:17,436 --> 01:25:19,742
Sweet... There!

605
01:25:20,048 --> 01:25:22,547
A curfew? Are you mad?

606
01:25:22,879 --> 01:25:25,669
Jasmine can only be picked
before dawn. We all know that!

607
01:25:26,015 --> 01:25:28,883
This could mean the ruin
of our trade!

608
01:25:29,114 --> 01:25:32,079
Yours! And yours, and yours!

609
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:35,619
Supposing it's your daughter
next time?

610
01:25:37,351 --> 01:25:39,707
Of course, a curfew is necessary.

611
01:25:39,799 --> 01:25:41,083
But we also have to catch this man.

612
01:25:41,134 --> 01:25:43,733
And the only way to do that
is to understand how he thinks!

613
01:25:44,190 --> 01:25:47,122
- What he wants!
- I should've thought that was obvious.

614
01:25:47,515 --> 01:25:49,255
Use your imagination!

615
01:25:49,308 --> 01:25:51,466
And if I were to tell you
that all except the prostitute...

616
01:25:51,551 --> 01:25:54,336
went to their graves
with their chastity intact?

617
01:25:55,115 --> 01:25:58,227
- How would you know?
- The coroner had each girl examined.

618
01:25:58,493 --> 01:26:00,245
They were all found
to be virgins.

619
01:26:02,332 --> 01:26:04,779
Supposing there isn't
a next time...

620
01:26:04,874 --> 01:26:08,789
if we introduce a curfew,
we may all go bankrupt for nothing.

621
01:26:10,909 --> 01:26:15,145
So we wait until he's killed what...
Six? Seven? Eight?

622
01:26:39,650 --> 01:26:41,828
Curfew! Go back to your homes!

623
01:26:43,106 --> 01:26:45,219
- What's happening?
- It's a curfew. Back to your home.

624
01:26:56,741 --> 01:26:59,099
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

625
01:26:59,869 --> 01:27:03,631
We have to face the fact
that our police are helpless in this matter.

626
01:27:03,973 --> 01:27:08,555
- I suggest that we ask for support from Paris.
- Paris won't be smarter than we are.

627
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:12,805
Arrest every Gypsy and beggar!
And every man without a wife and family!

628
01:27:12,891 --> 01:27:14,482
Listen!

629
01:27:16,244 --> 01:27:19,699
We have to put ourselves
inside the mind of this man.

630
01:27:20,589 --> 01:27:24,740
Each of his victims
had an especial beauty.

631
01:27:25,365 --> 01:27:26,765
We know he doesn't want
their virginity.

632
01:27:26,856 --> 01:27:29,875
So, it seems to me
that it's that beauty itself...

633
01:27:29,939 --> 01:27:31,847
that he wants. It's almost as if...

634
01:27:31,888 --> 01:27:33,944
as if he's trying
to gather something.

635
01:27:34,851 --> 01:27:37,381
His ambitions of those
of a collector.

636
01:27:38,869 --> 01:27:42,786
- A collector of what?
- Their hair?

637
01:27:43,081 --> 01:27:44,520
Get out! Get out!

638
01:27:49,469 --> 01:27:50,880
Whatever it is...

639
01:27:51,633 --> 01:27:56,917
I fear he won't stop killing
until his collection is complete.

640
01:28:16,458 --> 01:28:17,747
Here you are! Next!

641
01:28:20,194 --> 01:28:20,847
You too!

642
01:28:20,914 --> 01:28:21,549
Monsieur?

643
01:28:24,830 --> 01:28:27,186
This man... this man is a demon!

644
01:28:27,899 --> 01:28:30,997
A phantom who cannot be fought
by human means!

645
01:28:31,489 --> 01:28:36,340
Now I insist that we call upon
our bishop to excommunicate him!

646
01:28:36,542 --> 01:28:39,008
What good would that do?

647
01:28:39,213 --> 01:28:42,477
Have you no faith in the power
of our Holy Mother Church?

648
01:28:43,971 --> 01:28:47,423
It's not a matter of faith!
There's a murderer out there!

649
01:28:47,435 --> 01:28:50,238
And we must catch him
by using our God-given wits.

650
01:28:51,525 --> 01:28:53,866
I say, until we submit him
to our church...

651
01:28:54,889 --> 01:28:56,968
these killings will not cease.

652
01:29:12,969 --> 01:29:14,615
Citizens of Grasse...

653
01:29:14,807 --> 01:29:17,533
we hereby declare
that this murderer...

654
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,829
is demon in our midst.

655
01:29:20,965 --> 01:29:24,590
Has incurred the sentence
of excommunication!

656
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:31,724
Not only has this depraved monster
robbed us of our daughters...

657
01:29:31,821 --> 01:29:35,467
the young and fair
blossom of the city...

658
01:29:35,771 --> 01:29:39,414
and by his wanton acts,
has brought our trade...

659
01:29:39,459 --> 01:29:43,884
our livelihood,
our very existence...

660
01:29:44,144 --> 01:29:47,363
to the brink
of eternal darkness!

661
01:29:48,958 --> 01:29:53,050
We therefore declare,
that this vile viper...

662
01:29:53,397 --> 01:29:59,291
this ignominious carbuncle,
this extricable evil in our midsts...

663
01:29:59,934 --> 01:30:04,647
shall henceforth be solemnly
banned from our Holy Presence...

664
01:30:05,261 --> 01:30:09,527
rejected from the Communion
of Holy Mother Church...

665
01:30:09,833 --> 01:30:12,377
as a disciple of Satan.

666
01:30:13,308 --> 01:30:15,159
Slayer of souls...

667
01:30:15,219 --> 01:30:17,287
Stand clear! Stand clear!

668
01:30:19,318 --> 01:30:21,074
outsider of the faith...

669
01:30:21,650 --> 01:30:25,567
a necromancer, a diabolist,
a sorcerer...

670
01:30:25,813 --> 01:30:27,966
a damned heretic!

671
01:30:29,479 --> 01:30:32,579
Oh, God! In thy most
merciful spirit,

672
01:30:33,898 --> 01:30:36,808
bring down thunderbolts
upon his head!

673
01:30:37,490 --> 01:30:42,240
And may the Devil make stope
of his bones! Amen!

674
01:30:42,326 --> 01:30:44,744
My Lord! My Lord!

675
01:30:45,309 --> 01:30:46,709
It's a miracle!

676
01:30:46,858 --> 01:30:48,764
He's been caught! He's been caught!

677
01:30:50,616 --> 01:30:52,883
My Lord, the fiend
has been caught.

678
01:30:54,169 --> 01:30:56,850
In the city of Grenoble.
He's confessed to everything.

679
01:30:57,947 --> 01:30:59,534
He's confessed to everything!

680
01:31:01,938 --> 01:31:05,317
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

681
01:31:06,285 --> 01:31:11,495
Thanks be to God. And we thank him
for listening to our prayers...

682
01:31:11,926 --> 01:31:16,809
and answering them. Amen!

683
01:31:17,145 --> 01:31:21,674
Amen! Amen!

684
01:31:35,036 --> 01:31:38,285
Just read the report. This cannot
possibly be the same man.

685
01:31:41,632 --> 01:31:45,934
He confessed to everything,
including the murders in Grasse.

686
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,496
Yes, and the torture.

687
01:31:49,644 --> 01:31:51,031
Look, here!

688
01:31:51,768 --> 01:31:54,048
He admits to strangling his victims...

689
01:31:54,407 --> 01:31:56,924
pulling out their hair,
and ravaging them.

690
01:31:56,992 --> 01:32:00,005
The girls of Grasse were killed
by a single blow to the back of their heads.

691
01:32:00,033 --> 01:32:03,215
Their hair was carefully cropped.
And not one of them was violated.

692
01:32:03,562 --> 01:32:05,121
Antoine...

693
01:32:05,839 --> 01:32:07,691
we're all happy it's over.

694
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:10,271
Let it go.

695
01:32:55,734 --> 01:32:58,674
- Papa, what's the matter?
- We're going home, now!

696
01:32:58,857 --> 01:33:01,010
- But why? I'm enjoying myself!
- Don't argue with me!

697
01:33:01,274 --> 01:33:02,227
Stop it! I'm grown-up...

698
01:33:10,605 --> 01:33:12,206
Laura!

699
01:33:13,036 --> 01:33:14,414
Laura!

700
01:33:17,286 --> 01:33:18,438
Out of my way!

701
01:33:19,108 --> 01:33:20,095
Laura!

702
01:34:14,750 --> 01:34:17,645
- Laura!
- Papa!

703
01:34:23,563 --> 01:34:25,564
I'm so sorry.

704
01:34:38,121 --> 01:34:40,978
I know you must think me
a very foolish man.

705
01:34:42,152 --> 01:34:44,002
But try to understand.

706
01:34:45,060 --> 01:34:48,427
- You're all I have left.
- You don't need to explain, papa.

707
01:34:48,471 --> 01:34:51,413
- If anything would happen to you...
- I know.

708
01:34:51,988 --> 01:34:54,335
But you must stop worrying
about me all the time.

709
01:35:14,848 --> 01:35:16,228
Sweet dreams, my love.

710
01:35:20,224 --> 01:35:21,668
Sweet dreams, papa.

711
01:36:19,609 --> 01:36:21,147
Laura!

712
01:36:30,891 --> 01:36:33,146
Papa, what's the matter?

713
01:36:37,830 --> 01:36:39,092
Did you open the window?

714
01:36:41,248 --> 01:36:43,453
No. Why?

715
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:50,072
Have this letter dispatched to
the Marquis de Montesquieu immediately.

716
01:36:50,978 --> 01:36:52,489
Marie, quickly!

717
01:37:37,564 --> 01:37:39,472
Stay on the road north,
into the mountains.

718
01:37:57,223 --> 01:37:59,533
- Did Monsieur Richis leave?
- He did.

719
01:38:00,065 --> 01:38:01,146
Which way?

720
01:38:02,158 --> 01:38:03,597
North.

721
01:38:09,726 --> 01:38:12,865
- You sure it wasn't south?
- I saw them with my own eyes!

722
01:38:13,243 --> 01:38:14,716
What do you want to know?

723
01:38:16,509 --> 01:38:19,312
I said north, north!

724
01:38:21,388 --> 01:38:22,673
Grenouille?

725
01:38:24,712 --> 01:38:26,032
Grenouille!

726
01:38:28,370 --> 01:38:29,658
Grenouille!

727
01:38:39,638 --> 01:38:40,985
Grenouille!

728
01:38:56,338 --> 01:38:57,790
Good God!

729
01:39:52,621 --> 01:39:54,399
- Good afternoon, monsieur.
- Good afternoon.

730
01:39:54,446 --> 01:39:56,066
Do you have anyone
else staying here?

731
01:39:57,402 --> 01:39:58,338
No, monsieur.

732
01:39:58,534 --> 01:40:00,934
Then I would like to take
all your rooms for the night.

733
01:40:00,999 --> 01:40:02,886
It will be a pleasure, monsieur.

734
01:40:04,738 --> 01:40:08,106
And tomorrow, first light,
we wish to be ferried to the Iles de L¨¦rins.

735
01:40:08,717 --> 01:40:11,249
- It's deserted except for a few...
- I'm aware of that.

736
01:40:13,033 --> 01:40:13,948
Very well, monsieur.

737
01:40:18,424 --> 01:40:20,253
Our finest room, mademoiselle.

738
01:40:22,952 --> 01:40:24,917
With the superb view of the sea.

739
01:40:25,719 --> 01:40:26,600
One moment.

740
01:40:33,027 --> 01:40:34,058
Very well.

741
01:40:35,146 --> 01:40:39,651
- Do you have a room next to this?
- Yes, but the view cannot be compared to...

742
01:40:39,930 --> 01:40:41,858
There have no interest
in the view.

743
01:40:58,137 --> 01:41:01,127
Oh, my God...

744
01:41:24,619 --> 01:41:25,520
Monsieur.

745
01:41:33,074 --> 01:41:36,957
Papa, will you please
tell me now what's happening.

746
01:41:37,656 --> 01:41:38,977
You haven't said a word all day.

747
01:41:39,924 --> 01:41:41,548
Why all the secrecy?

748
01:41:45,778 --> 01:41:47,682
Last night, I dreamt
you were dead...

749
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:51,823
murdered
like all the other girls.

750
01:42:00,237 --> 01:42:03,534
The truth is I'm convinced that
the killer is still here somewhere.

751
01:42:05,249 --> 01:42:09,315
All of his victims were young and beautiful,
and who is there more beautiful than you, Laura?

752
01:42:11,420 --> 01:42:16,318
Whatever his insane scheme,
it will surely be incomplete without you.

753
01:42:24,392 --> 01:42:27,538
I've written to the Marquis accepting
his proposal and marriage on your behalf,

754
01:42:27,597 --> 01:42:30,744
and requesting that it take place
as soon as possible.

755
01:42:31,942 --> 01:42:34,876
Until then, you stay
in the safety of the monastery.

756
01:42:36,576 --> 01:42:41,111
- And all this, because you had a bad dream?
- I've made my decision.

757
01:42:41,224 --> 01:42:45,306
- But I don't know whether I even love him!
- I'm afraid the circumstances leave us no choice.

758
01:42:45,384 --> 01:42:47,975
- Papa!
- It's all arranged, Laura.

759
01:48:23,606 --> 01:48:24,644
On your feet!

760
01:48:25,188 --> 01:48:26,185
Hands in the air!

761
01:49:10,282 --> 01:49:12,779
Why did you kill my daughter?

762
01:49:16,732 --> 01:49:17,783
Why?

763
01:49:20,958 --> 01:49:22,389
I needed her.

764
01:49:47,678 --> 01:49:49,917
Why did you kill my daughter?

765
01:49:54,185 --> 01:49:55,741
I just...

766
01:49:58,353 --> 01:49:59,823
needed her.

767
01:50:07,288 --> 01:50:08,551
Very well.

768
01:50:10,666 --> 01:50:12,895
But you remember this:

769
01:50:19,209 --> 01:50:21,030
I'll be looking at you...

770
01:50:23,575 --> 01:50:25,087
when you're laid on the cross,

771
01:50:25,150 --> 01:50:29,638
and the twelve blows are
crashing down on your limbs.

772
01:50:31,773 --> 01:50:37,175
When the crowd is finally tired
of your screams and wandered home...

773
01:50:38,346 --> 01:50:42,469
I will climb up
through your blood...

774
01:50:44,233 --> 01:50:46,413
and sit beside you.

775
01:50:47,992 --> 01:50:51,438
I will look deep
into your eyes...

776
01:50:52,431 --> 01:50:55,479
and drop by drop...

777
01:50:57,348 --> 01:51:01,192
I will trickle my digust into them...

778
01:51:02,864 --> 01:51:05,721
like burning acid...

779
01:51:07,467 --> 01:51:08,870
until...

780
01:51:12,250 --> 01:51:13,706
finally...

781
01:51:17,193 --> 01:51:19,226
you perish.

782
01:51:53,119 --> 01:51:54,642
What do you think
they'll do to him?

783
01:51:54,922 --> 01:51:58,650
Apparently, they're gonna break
every bone in his body with an iron bar.

784
01:52:11,482 --> 01:52:12,856
Look, there he comes!

785
01:53:14,149 --> 01:53:15,648
Unchain the prisoner.

786
01:53:26,645 --> 01:53:28,174
That's enough.

787
01:53:29,599 --> 01:53:31,520
Let him be brought
to the scaffold.

788
01:53:36,419 --> 01:53:37,347
What's that?

789
01:54:48,386 --> 01:54:50,104
Is he coming? What's his name?

790
01:56:35,659 --> 01:56:38,586
This man is innocent.

791
01:56:42,323 --> 01:56:45,026
- He didn't do it. It's impossible!
- He's innocent!

792
01:56:49,286 --> 01:56:50,513
He's innocent!

793
01:58:07,453 --> 01:58:11,635
This is no man!
This is an angel!

794
02:04:04,931 --> 02:04:07,147
You can't fool me!

795
02:04:53,946 --> 02:04:55,479
Forgive me!

796
02:05:01,869 --> 02:05:03,946
My son!

797
02:06:03,944 --> 02:06:07,769
People of Grasse
awoke to a terrible hangover.

798
02:06:09,034 --> 02:06:14,048
For many of them, the experience
was so gustly, so completely inexplicable...

799
02:06:14,080 --> 02:06:20,013
and incompatible with their morals,
that they literally erased it from their memories.

800
02:06:20,632 --> 02:06:23,505
The town council
was in session by the afternoon.

801
02:06:23,624 --> 02:06:29,527
And an order was passed to the police lieutenant
to immediately begin fresh investigations into the murders.

802
02:06:30,628 --> 02:06:33,536
The following day, Dominique Druot
was arrested.

803
02:06:33,619 --> 02:06:38,189
Since it was in his backyard that the clothes
and hair of all the victims had been found.

804
02:06:39,164 --> 02:06:42,452
After fourteen hours of torture,
Druot confessed to everything.

805
02:06:45,170 --> 02:06:47,723
With that, the case was closed.

806
02:06:51,911 --> 02:06:55,587
By then, Grenouille was already
halfway back to Paris.

807
02:06:59,404 --> 02:07:03,566
He still had enough perfume left
to enslave the whole world, if he so chose.

808
02:07:04,249 --> 02:07:07,357
He could walk to Versailles,
and have the King kiss his feet.

809
02:07:07,762 --> 02:07:12,113
He could write the Pope a perfumed letter,
and reveal himself as a new Messiah.

810
02:07:12,900 --> 02:07:15,834
He could do all this,
and more if he wanted to.

811
02:07:16,529 --> 02:07:20,976
He possessed a power stronger
than the power of money, or terror, or death.

812
02:07:21,734 --> 02:07:25,446
The invincible power
to command the love of mankind.

813
02:07:31,932 --> 02:07:34,703
There was only one thing
the perfume could not do.

814
02:07:35,084 --> 02:07:40,243
It could not turn him into a person
who could love and be loved like everyone else.

815
02:07:41,426 --> 02:07:45,178
So, to hell with it, he thought.
To hell with the world.

816
02:07:45,654 --> 02:07:48,556
With the perfume, with himself.

817
02:07:51,237 --> 02:07:56,306
On the 25th of June, 1766,
around 11 o'clock at night,

818
02:07:56,533 --> 02:07:59,618
Grenouille entered the city
through the port-de-Leones.

819
02:08:00,150 --> 02:08:06,865
And like a sleepwalker, his olfactory memories
drew him back to the place where he was born.

820
02:09:25,693 --> 02:09:28,410
An angel!

821
02:09:29,792 --> 02:09:31,697
I love you!

822
02:10:17,049 --> 02:10:22,545
Within no time, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille
had disappeared from the face of the earth.

823
02:10:23,546 --> 02:10:28,186
When they had finished,
they felt a virginal glow of happiness.

824
02:10:28,873 --> 02:10:33,951
For the first time in their lives,
they believed that they had done something...

825
02:10:34,185 --> 02:10:37,412
purely out of love.

826
02:11:06,900 --> 02:11:08,866
Hey, over here!

827
02:11:09,431 --> 02:11:10,385
Look!

828
02:11:17,407 --> 02:11:18,645
Let's take them away.

829
02:11:19,425 --> 02:11:20,537
You could wear them.

830
02:11:39,506 --> 02:11:44,134
*Sync KOz*
