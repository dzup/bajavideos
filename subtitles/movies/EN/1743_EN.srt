1
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:58,224
I had a strange dream.

2
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:02,989
I was five or six,

3
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,931
and my mother entered my room
in an elegant dress.

4
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:12,702
She introduced a young lady

5
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:15,639
as my babysitter.

6
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:26,676
I couldn't see my father,
but I could hear him

7
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:31,156
calling my mother.
They were probably having a party.

8
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:35,786
I heard music

9
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:38,524
and people dancing downstairs,

10
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:44,359
so I imagine
the party was at home.

11
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,736
But the strangest thing

12
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:51,641
is that 80 years later

13
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:54,771
I saw the young lady's face again.

14
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:00,150
Where had I kept it?

15
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:06,457
In which corner of my mind
had I hidden it?

16
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,389
Now I try to hold on to it,

17
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:15,697
for fear of losing it forever.

18
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:47,458
THE WINDOW

19
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,066
Everything's dry now.

20
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,131
Tell Alberto to air the mattress.

21
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,042
- Which sheets?
- The light blue ones.

22
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,079
What would he like to eat?

23
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,879
We could do a leg of lamb.

24
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,580
What if he doesn't eat meat?

25
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:31,885
They say Europeans don't eat meat.

26
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:35,689
- He's never been here before?
- Not since I came.

27
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:38,253
It seems he and Don Antonio
aren't speaking.

28
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:39,696
Why not?

29
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,791
Alberto said they'd had a fight.

30
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,962
San Juan.
Farina calling.

31
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:47,062
Get everything ready.

32
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,506
San Juan...
Farina calling. Over.

33
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,784
Yes, Don Farina.
How are you?

34
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:06,484
I'll be in your area,
so I could drop off the checks.

35
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,823
- How's Don Antonio? Over.
- Better. Over.

36
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:13,565
Then I'll stop by.
Over.

37
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,294
No problem. Over.

38
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:20,067
I'll be there before noon.
Over.

39
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,834
We'll be expecting you.

40
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,649
Farina's bringing the checks.

41
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:32,946
I suppose he won't stay for lunch.

42
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,987
No, I hope not.

43
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:36,715
Shall we give him some jam?

44
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,416
No, better not.

45
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,585
He's not going to be upset?

46
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,959
Give him the sugar-free kind.

47
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,102
Good morning.
How are you today?

48
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,546
Fine, fine.

49
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:06,244
Don't forget.
Your son's coming today.

50
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:10,218
How could I forget?

51
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,357
And the piano?

52
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:20,456
Is that man coming?

53
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,798
Yes, Alberto's picking him up
at the intersection.

54
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,579
It's a really good piano,

55
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,650
a German one.

56
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:42,183
Not again:

57
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,416
Don't you like how I do it?

58
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,050
You've got a knack for it.

59
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:48,889
Then don't complain.

60
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:53,160
All this junk makes me feel bad.

61
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:55,029
It makes me weak.

62
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:59,367
Tell the doctor.
I'm only following his instructions.

63
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:08,573
Right, let's sit you up
for breakfast.

64
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:12,345
Am I getting butter and jam?
Yes, butter and jam.

65
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:15,216
- Not the diet kind?
- No, the usual kind.

66
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,256
Good.

67
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,123
Do you want to write later?

68
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,258
Yes, maybe.

69
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:28,698
Okay, I'll bring the computer
after breakfast.

70
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:29,757
Okay.

71
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:40,870
Do you feel sick?

72
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:45,446
No, I had a strange dream.

73
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,748
A nightmare?

74
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,253
No.

75
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:59,463
A really beautiful dream.

76
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:09,707
- Tell Alberto to come and see me.
- Okay, I'll tell him.

77
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:13,075
- Emilse.
- Yes?

78
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:15,978
I can't receive Pablo
like a sick man.

79
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:19,609
See if the blue jacket is okay,
if it needs ironing.

80
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:21,949
I'll tell Maria del Carmen.

81
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:30,761
Good morning.

82
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,424
- How are you doing?
- Come in, please.

83
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,126
I'll leave the suitcase here

84
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:38,170
- and take the bedpan up.
- I'll take it, Alberto. Thanks.

85
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,437
How was your journey?

86
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,946
A bit long.
I left yesterday evening.

87
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:52,976
- We're a long way out, right?
- A bit.

88
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,815
Put your things here.

89
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:03,390
So this is the beast.

90
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:05,726
Yes, I'll take the cover off.

91
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:09,761
Nobody's played it
for a long time.

92
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,463
Don Antonio's son used to play.

93
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:15,837
He's a famous pianist,

94
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:18,741
and Don Antonio
wants the piano tuned for him.

95
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:21,873
That's him, see?

96
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,985
What a piano:

97
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:30,147
A Steinway:
The best there is.

98
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:33,157
Yes, he's very successful.

99
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:35,386
And he lives in Europe now.

100
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,827
Yes. One must go abroad
in order to make career.

101
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:41,558
Right, let's check it out.

102
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:52,203
Pianos are like women.
You must play them now and then.

103
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,438
If you don't...

104
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:57,514
Sorry, I was only joking.

105
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,847
- Just joking.
- It's okay.

106
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,719
- I suppose you haven't had breakfast?
- That's very kind of you.

107
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:06,383
- Would you like coffee, tea or mate?
- Coffee is fine.

108
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,051
I'll bring it right away.

109
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,000
Don Antonio.

110
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,909
Alberto,

111
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:16,216
please go down to the pantry

112
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:19,382
and find the biggest bottle there.

113
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:23,588
A big bottle of wine.
Bring it to me, please.

114
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:26,563
- I need the key, Don Antonio.
- Here.

115
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:32,035
- And bring it back to me.
- Of course.

116
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:36,033
I always bring it back,
Don Antonio.

117
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,103
Excuse me. Here you are.

118
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:45,014
Thanks. I'll move that.

119
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:49,882
- Roberto Giorgio.
- Hello. Pleased to meet you.

120
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:53,721
- What a luxury: It's all homemade?
- Yes.

121
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:56,556
- These rolls, too?
- Yes, we make them here.

122
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,828
It's the wonderful thing
about country life.

123
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,340
We city folks don't have
pleasures like this.

124
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,602
Excuse me.

125
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:14,539
You're not from around here, right?

126
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:18,478
No, I'm from
Santiago del Estero.

127
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,017
- Santiago.
- Yes.

128
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:24,149
And do you have family here?

129
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,123
No, I came alone.

130
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,792
That's good.

131
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,996
Yes. Now if you'll excuse me.

132
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:36,660
Sorry, one more thing.

133
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:38,600
Who's the woman in the picture?

134
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,039
I don't know.

135
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,075
She looks a bit like you,
doesn't she?

136
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:53,345
Look, Don Antonio.
What a lovely day:

137
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:57,116
Let's sit you here,
and I'll change the sheets.

138
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:59,157
- Sit down here.
- Wait.

139
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,261
Let me see.

140
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:22,173
Come on, Don Antonio,
we have a busy day.

141
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,510
Was there much damage
last night?

142
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:28,519
No, the storm didn't last long.

143
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,987
Just a few broken branches.

144
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:35,186
I told Emilse
I want to look nice tonight.

145
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,694
- Remember the blue jacket?
- Yes, I do.

146
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:41,426
- The one with the monogram on it.
- You want to wear the jacket in bed?

147
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:45,535
No, I'm not going to be
in bed.

148
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,665
I can't be in bed.

149
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:54,602
You can't drag the IV
all over the house.

150
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,114
Remember the shock
you gave us last time?

151
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:06,486
We'll make you look elegant
in your bathrobe.

152
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:09,857
And maybe you can receive Pablo
in that armchair.

153
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:12,021
We'll ask the doctor.

154
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,395
Don Antonio, is it this one?

155
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,942
Let's see.

156
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,456
Don Antonio,
what are you planning?

157
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:40,822
I want to

158
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:45,023
make a toast when Pablo arrives.

159
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,930
This bottle is over 40 years old.

160
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,959
My wife and I were keeping it
for a special occasión.

161
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,797
You weren't planning
to drink it, were you?

162
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:58,240
- Sorry?
- You weren't planning to drink it?

163
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:01,272
No.

164
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:16,887
Don Farina asked if you accept
checks payable in 60 days.

165
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,896
- 60 days?
- Yes.

166
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,426
60 days is an eternity.

167
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:31,637
No, tell him to pay on time.

168
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,745
Don Antonio,
what would your son like to eat?

169
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:44,983
How should I know
after all these years?

170
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:49,187
Maybe he's a vegetarian.
They say Europeans don't eat meat.

171
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,320
What?

172
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,330
Of course they eat meat:

173
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,362
- How's the vegetable garden?
- Fine.

174
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:03,564
It must have suffered
in the storm.

175
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,610
We'll tidy it up.

176
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,418
- What do we do with all this?
- We have it put in storage.

177
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,694
Help me with the bed.

178
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,989
- Wow, it's heavy.
- A bit.

179
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:37,967
How long
is Señor Pablo staying?

180
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:40,163
Don't know.
A few days, I suppose.

181
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:48,179
What on earth is that?

182
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,309
It looks like a painting.

183
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,455
- Can I have a look?
- Okay, but leave it as it was.

184
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,345
What is it?

185
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,145
I can't make it out.

186
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,551
It's weird.

187
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,748
Why has he kept it?

188
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,227
Emilse:

189
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,467
Coming:

190
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:47,805
Yes, Don Antonio?

191
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:52,503
I kept money in this book.

192
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:55,102
It's not there anymore.

193
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,910
- Well?
- I don't know.

194
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,592
Perhaps you put it
somewhere else.

195
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,628
No, I wouldn't have forgotten.

196
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,393
No.

197
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:17,924
Okay, I'll let Maria del Carmen know,
and we'll look for it.

198
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,597
- Emilse:
- Yes, sir.

199
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,436
- This is very serious.
- Yes, sir.

200
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:30,509
- What did he want?
- The usual. He lost money.

201
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:42,916
If I had half the money they get,
I'd pave it all.

202
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:47,431
With proper asphalt.
Good old-fashioned stuff.

203
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,000
- Fixing the piano?
- This way.

204
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:52,229
I'm tuning it.

205
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:55,569
A piano without a cover.
My cousin had one.

206
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,906
He played at every school function.
Played the national anthem very well.

207
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:02,310
What were we talking about?
Yes, asphalt.

208
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,645
Have you been
on Highway 225 lately?

209
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:08,277
A real pit.

210
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:10,844
The government calls it paved.

211
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:13,550
Highway 225 paved?

212
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:18,028
They wasted all the money.
Paved?

213
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:25,493
- How's Don Antonio?
- A bit better.

214
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:28,931
I heard.

215
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:33,907
- He was lucky.
- Yes.

216
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:37,346
People were worried,
because he's well liked.

217
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,316
He's a gentleman.

218
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:40,408
Yes.

219
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:42,612
We have to take care
of ourselves.

220
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:46,521
Always worrying.
Where does that get you?

221
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,615
Nowhere.

222
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:53,519
Remember I mentioned
the checks and the 60 days?

223
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:59,166
Could you ask Don Antonio
if I can make it ninety?

224
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:01,865
- They're my checks. He knows...
- I'll ask.

225
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,933
My checks are my checks.
He knows I'm like a bank.

226
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:07,979
I got that from my dad.

227
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:09,570
Okay, I'll tell him.

228
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:11,741
Thanks, that's very kind.

229
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,857
Give him my best wishes

230
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,524
and tell him
we're all very concerned.

231
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,624
- Okay.
- Thank you.

232
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,827
Don't you feel well?

233
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:34,757
My blood pressure's a bit low.

234
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,358
- Can I get you a glass of water?
- No, thank you.

235
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:41,499
Put your head down.

236
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:46,310
Try to push my hand away.
Harder:

237
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,346
Harder:

238
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:53,510
- Feeling better?
- I'm a new man.

239
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:56,679
My dad had the same thing.
It's hereditary.

240
00:25:56,755 --> 00:26:00,623
He started sweating,
went pale and bang:

241
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:04,093
Mom used to worry her head off.

242
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:08,189
I had an uncle
who could move his ears.

243
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:10,700
He inherited it from his father
who got it from his father...

244
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:15,468
Don Antonio, we'll go back to bed,
because the doctor's coming.

245
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,007
I just sat down to write.

246
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:21,239
No, you've been there for an hour.
Come on. That's it:

247
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:27,140
I want to stroll around
the vegetable garden.

248
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:30,085
I want to see how it looks
after the storm.

249
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:32,248
All right.
After you've recovered.

250
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:35,156
But I'm fine.

251
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:37,660
Okay, I'll ask Maria del Carmen.

252
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:40,756
But I'm fine.

253
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:43,494
We'll take you tomorrow.

254
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:48,195
Tomorrow.

255
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:55,813
Good day, Antonio.

256
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,145
How are we feeling today?

257
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:04,983
Fine. I fell asleep.

258
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,115
Working?

259
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:11,890
I was re-reading
what I wrote the other day

260
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:15,328
before it happened.

261
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,424
Listen.

262
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,503
Listen.

263
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:25,304
"I'm starting to forget
Irene's house.

264
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:28,778
From time to time,

265
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:31,338
without any reason,

266
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:35,580
I remember the green light
in the window,

267
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:40,182
the sound of my footsteps
in the field at night

268
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:44,194
as I returned from her house
full of love,

269
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:48,164
rubbing my hands
from the cold.

270
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:52,134
And in rare moments,

271
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:56,003
when my solitude torments me,
and sadness overwhelms me,

272
00:27:57,742 --> 00:28:01,769
a few vague memories return."

273
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,406
And everything stopped
at that moment.

274
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:07,852
I couldn't find a single key.

275
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,286
These incidents generally
happen very suddenly.

276
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:14,086
Suddenly everything was over.

277
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,252
Well, it wasn't over:

278
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:19,319
Nobody dies
before their time is up.

279
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:21,661
Now I'm too afraid
to carry on with the story.

280
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:23,701
You'll get over it.

281
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:27,733
You'll get better soon.
We'll go fishing...

282
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,938
I could have gone on
like this...

283
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:37,575
"...for some reason

284
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:41,176
I am beginning to think

285
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:43,652
that she remembers me, too,

286
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:46,850
and is waiting for me.

287
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:49,189
And one day
we will find each other.

288
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:53,523
Irene, where are you?"

289
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:06,835
My niece always asks
about you.

290
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,778
She wants to know when you're
publishing another book.

291
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:11,748
So the prodigal son
is arriving today?

292
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:16,115
Do you think I could get up?

293
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:18,211
No.

294
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:21,391
I don't want him
to see me in bed.

295
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:26,152
You have to let
your heart recover.

296
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:29,689
And take the medication.
Emilse said you've been rejecting it.

297
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,669
The medicine is very strong.
It knocks me out.

298
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:36,173
The medicine's nothing to do with it.
Do you want them to admit you?

299
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:39,301
Then cooperate.

300
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:48,952
My brother told me they saw
huge trout in the Pedregoso River.

301
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:52,512
Rest now,
and we'll go fishing in November.

302
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:01,526
I want to tell you something.

303
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:04,796
Last night I dreamed
about someone

304
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:08,067
I haven't seen in 80 years.

305
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:10,438
80 years:

306
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:15,076
She appeared in my dream

307
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,808
as if I'd seen her every day.

308
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:20,406
Isn't that weird?

309
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,955
Where had I kept that image?

310
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,626
Quite a mystery, isn't it?

311
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:34,865
I try to remember her face,

312
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:41,768
but what was her name?

313
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:45,303
Garber?

314
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:46,707
Garbo?

315
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:47,938
I don't know.

316
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,043
Garber?

317
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:54,345
Garbo?

318
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:59,580
It's like in "Morel's Invention."

319
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:03,059
The characters disappear

320
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,559
at daybreak.

321
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:10,624
I'll add some Atenolol.
It's a regulator.

322
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,694
I'll give the prescription to Alberto,
so he can pick it up.

323
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:19,004
Now that we're talking
about "Morel's Invention,"

324
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:22,808
could you look
for a green book by Borges?

325
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,940
It's on the upper bookshelf.

326
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,245
"Morel's Invention"
is by Borges?

327
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:31,777
No, but...

328
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:34,416
Borges really admired
the story.

329
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,060
- This one?
- Yes.

330
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,203
That looks like it.

331
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:50,167
"A Universal History
of Infamy."

332
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,106
- A first edition?
- Yes.

333
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:55,809
Ah, a dedication.

334
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,643
"For Antonio Romero,

335
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:59,683
a promising young man
in search of

336
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,811
the truth that awkwardly emerges
in these tales.

337
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,988
J.L. Borges."

338
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:07,786
How about that:

339
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:10,293
I think I kept my promise.

340
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,995
Take it.

341
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:21,266
- What?
- The book. Take it.

342
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:23,671
But it's a first edition.

343
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:25,971
Signed.
I can't accept it.

344
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:29,741
Don't be a pain:
It's a gift:

345
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,809
Like to stay for lunch,
Doctor?

346
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:37,514
Thank you, but no.
I have to get to Chasic´´o.

347
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:39,920
I'll make you something quick.

348
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:43,449
- No, thanks. Next time.
- Okay, I'll see you out.

349
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:46,727
Give this to Alberto.

350
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,766
How is he, Doctor?

351
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,769
We have to wait.

352
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:54,532
I'd be happier if he went in.

353
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:57,369
- When's the son arriving?
- Tonight.

354
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:59,205
Fine.

355
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:01,268
I'll come tomorrow
and we'll decide.

356
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:04,281
- Call me if you need anything.
- Okay, thank you, Doctor.

357
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:54,882
Come on. Get out.

358
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:02,550
Good afternoon.

359
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:05,391
Good afternoon.

360
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:08,899
Oh, excuse me.
How are you doing?

361
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:11,196
- How's work going?
- Progressing.

362
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:15,761
It's a good piano.
A German one.

363
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,171
Yes, it is,

364
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:19,801
but it's a little abandoned.

365
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:22,471
Nobody's played it
for a long time.

366
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:23,878
I can tell.

367
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:27,247
But there are broken strings,

368
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:30,879
a few jammed keys,
a few moth-eaten felts.

369
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:33,446
Look, I'll show you.

370
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:36,721
I put new felts here,
all new felts.

371
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:39,729
I replaced them all
with new ones.

372
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:41,389
Are they German?

373
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:45,094
No, Japanese.

374
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:48,764
Japanese, German,
they're all the same.

375
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:53,036
- See you later.
- Very well. See you later.

376
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:03,719
Could you do me a favor?

377
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:07,554
Yes, of course.

378
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:11,493
Could you tie my shoelaces?

379
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,896
Of course. Wait a second.

380
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:18,835
Are you going for a walk?

381
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,871
A little stroll.

382
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,971
Let's see...

383
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:26,271
- Thank you.
- I'll just do the other one.

384
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:35,115
Not too tight?

385
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:38,280
- No, that's perfect.
- Thank you very much.

386
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:40,324
- Okay, see you later.
- See you later.

387
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:51,134
Hold on,
I'll give you a hand.

388
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,006
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

389
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:17,946
Come on.

390
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:21,214
You can do it.

391
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,760
Come on, useless old man:

392
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:25,074
How are you doing?

393
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:27,117
I caught a hare:

394
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:35,689
I'll barbecue it tonight
if Mom lets me.

395
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:38,023
Let me know
if you want to come:

396
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:41,030
Wait:

397
00:46:45,035 --> 00:46:46,593
Ciao:

398
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:53,076
Wait:

399
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,184
Wait:

400
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,843
Excuse me, Don Antonio.

401
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:19,992
Maria del Carmen,
Don Antonio isn't here:

402
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:24,163
Oh, my God: It can't be:
Why isn't he here?

403
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,861
I swear he's not here:

404
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:28,370
- Did you look in the bathroom?
- Excuse me.

405
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:31,771
- I saw the gentleman go out.
- Go out?

406
00:48:31,842 --> 00:48:33,400
Yes, he went that way.

407
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:36,241
But why did you let him?

408
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:38,281
I'll get the IV.

409
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:52,127
Señor?
Are you okay?

410
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,391
Vicky, come here.
Vicky:

411
00:48:58,535 --> 00:49:01,663
- What happened to him?
- I don't know. He can't answer.

412
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:10,813
Maybe he fell over.

413
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:15,380
Did you fall over?

414
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:23,192
We have to call someone:

415
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:27,059
- Where are the guys?
- Don't know.

416
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,792
Around here somewhere.

417
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:31,356
Javier:

418
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:34,569
Javi:

419
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,804
What shall we do now?

420
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:47,242
- Vicky.
- What?

421
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:49,285
- What's he got there?
- What?

422
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,446
There.

423
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,684
It's an IV.

424
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:56,726
Then he's sick.

425
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:03,761
Why don't you tell us
where you live?

426
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,802
We'll take you home.

427
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:14,074
What if we sit him up?

428
00:50:14,144 --> 00:50:17,136
No. What if he hurt his neck?

429
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:24,554
Maybe there's a house
behind those trees.

430
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:28,715
Okay, I'll go look.

431
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:32,489
You stay here. If the guys come,
tell them not to move him.

432
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:37,529
- Please, hurry:
- Yes.

433
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:49,939
They've gone for help.

434
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:14,102
Keep calm.
I'm staying here.

435
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:37,060
Over here:

436
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:41,030
Get in closer:

437
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:43,794
I can't.
I have to drive around.

438
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:49,133
- There he is:
- Where?

439
00:51:49,206 --> 00:51:51,538
- How is he?
- He's calmer now.

440
00:51:56,546 --> 00:51:58,707
Don Antonio,
have you lost your mind?

441
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:05,021
- We'll have to carry him.
- We have to be careful.

442
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:06,885
He could have hurt his neck.

443
00:52:07,924 --> 00:52:10,358
What neck?
He's just pigheaded:

444
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:11,894
The guys are here.

445
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,589
What happened?

446
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:16,598
We found this man lying here.
He's sick.

447
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:19,900
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

448
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,438
- He lives back there.
- Let's lift him up.

449
00:52:22,506 --> 00:52:24,440
- Alberto:
- Coming:

450
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:26,942
Careful, please, guys.

451
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:30,571
Alberto, take his shoulders.
Careful with his back.

452
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:33,673
Here we go. Careful.

453
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:36,548
- Careful with the IV.
- His neck:

454
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:38,713
- Careful.
- Okay there?

455
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:41,724
- The IV.
- Get his things.

456
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:45,590
Careful. Slowly.

457
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:49,496
- His arm:
- The Panama hat:

458
00:52:49,566 --> 00:52:51,727
We have it, Don Antonio.

459
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:54,100
Take it easy, guys.

460
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:00,342
We're going down here.

461
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,469
It's okay.
We're nearly there.

462
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,681
His leg... there.

463
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:11,914
Watch his head.

464
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:14,923
- The head... Here we go.
- Let's sit in the back.

465
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:17,153
The IV.

466
00:53:17,227 --> 00:53:18,888
Let's go:

467
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:27,069
Come on. Let's go:

468
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:55,327
To the right:

469
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:57,161
To the right.

470
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,327
Evening.

471
00:54:00,437 --> 00:54:02,234
Careful.

472
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:28,728
Excuse me.
What happened?

473
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:32,666
We found him unconscious
in the field.

474
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:35,398
We didn't know what was wrong,
so we brought him here.

475
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:42,671
He went out a while ago.
He was fine then.

476
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:47,516
How strange.

477
00:55:01,564 --> 00:55:04,226
- Guys, I'll drive you back in a minute.
- Okay.

478
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:14,370
San Juan calling. Over.

479
00:55:18,915 --> 00:55:21,383
Yes, San Juan.
I can hear you.

480
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:25,114
Good evening.
Is the doctor in? Over.

481
00:55:25,188 --> 00:55:28,055
No, Dad isn't here.
He went out. Over.

482
00:55:28,124 --> 00:55:30,615
Do you know where he is?
Over.

483
00:55:30,694 --> 00:55:34,221
He went to Bahía Blanca with Mom
to do some shopping.

484
00:55:34,297 --> 00:55:36,527
But I don't know
how to reach him.

485
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:40,399
I think they wanted
to eat there. Over.

486
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:44,839
Ask him to pay a visit to San Juan
if possible. We have a problem. Over.

487
00:55:44,908 --> 00:55:47,570
I'll let him know
when he comes in.

488
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:49,612
Okay, thanks.
Over and out.

489
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:54,716
Come on, guys.
Let's go.

490
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:57,720
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

491
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,496
Excuse me.

492
00:56:14,571 --> 00:56:16,334
- Yes.
- I'm finished.

493
00:56:16,406 --> 00:56:19,239
I'll tell Maria del Carmen
to come and see you.

494
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:24,076
Could someone drive me
to the intersection to catch the bus?

495
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:26,581
Alberto will take you.

496
00:56:26,649 --> 00:56:29,345
Want to try the piano?

497
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,784
I don't know anything
about it.

498
00:56:33,857 --> 00:56:38,055
Come here.
I'll show you something.

499
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:45,358
See those strings?

500
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,371
They're in bad shape.

501
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:51,771
I can get some new ones
to replace them.

502
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:54,969
- Okay, I'll ask.
- Just let me know.

503
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:57,478
I'll tell Maria del Carmen.

504
00:58:30,573 --> 00:58:34,839
- Have we reached the farm yet?
- No. We must take Highway 33

505
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:37,277
and drive 12 miles.

506
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:49,857
How big is San Juan?

507
00:58:49,926 --> 00:58:52,793
About 750 acres now.

508
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:56,025
There was more land before,
but we had some problems

509
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:59,296
and had to sell part of it.

510
00:59:14,617 --> 00:59:18,018
- There's no signal.
- What should I do, Claudia?

511
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:21,488
- You promised me.
- I thought there'd be one.

512
00:59:24,127 --> 00:59:28,325
They'll call to close the deal
and think I'm on vacation,

513
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,195
or I don't care,

514
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:34,294
or I'm irresponsible.

515
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:38,403
There's no phone, is there?

516
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:42,376
No, there isn't, but we get by
with a radio unit.

517
00:59:46,115 --> 00:59:48,606
We'll take care of it,
Claudia.

518
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:50,778
Yeah, right.

519
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,822
- Hello.
- Good evening, Señora.

520
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:05,258
Good evening, Señor.

521
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:09,230
How are you? Please, come in.
We've been expecting you.

522
01:01:09,298 --> 01:01:13,200
Alberto, take the luggage
to his room.

523
01:01:14,737 --> 01:01:17,604
Take it to Señor Pablo's room,
please.

524
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:29,379
We'll put up another bed.
We didn't know the lady was coming.

525
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:32,148
It's fine.
We'll work it out.

526
01:01:34,424 --> 01:01:37,416
- How's my old man?
- In general, fine.

527
01:01:37,493 --> 01:01:40,792
- But he escaped this afternoon.
- Escaped?

528
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:43,354
He was found in the field.

529
01:01:43,433 --> 01:01:46,425
So he's a bit tired now.

530
01:01:48,237 --> 01:01:50,831
- Is the doctor coming?
- Yes.

531
01:01:52,675 --> 01:01:54,267
He wanted to talk to you.

532
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:57,073
He thinks it'd be better
to have him admitted.

533
01:02:00,016 --> 01:02:02,280
- Do you want to see him?
- Of course.

534
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:05,843
- Is he awake?
- Yes, he'll be expecting you.

535
01:02:05,922 --> 01:02:08,652
- Are you coming?
- Yes.

536
01:02:09,692 --> 01:02:11,853
Remember the house?

537
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:14,021
Not really.

538
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:19,728
Don Antonio,
look who's here.

539
01:02:31,214 --> 01:02:32,772
How are you, old man?

540
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:35,784
All right.

541
01:02:52,568 --> 01:02:54,160
What a shock:

542
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,307
How was the trip?
Good?

543
01:03:00,376 --> 01:03:02,344
Okay.

544
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:08,447
Dad, this is Claudia.

545
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:14,446
How are you doing, Antonio?

546
01:03:15,525 --> 01:03:17,618
Hello.

547
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:30,799
Rest now.
Take it easy.

548
01:03:32,742 --> 01:03:36,439
The flight... was it long?

549
01:03:36,512 --> 01:03:38,946
A bit,
but I'm used to it.

550
01:03:53,629 --> 01:03:56,189
Maricarmen,

551
01:03:56,265 --> 01:03:58,165
the bottle:

552
01:03:58,234 --> 01:04:01,032
But, Don Antonio,
how can you even think of it?

553
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:04,664
He wants to make a toast
with the wine he's been saving.

554
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:08,608
Dad, shouldn't we wait
until you're feeling better?

555
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:12,375
The bottle and three glasses:
Now:

556
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:15,542
Okay.

557
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:28,963
I must change the IV
and give him his pills.

558
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:30,999
Of course, please come in.

559
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:53,288
I've got a signal.
Hello?

560
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:56,658
Yes, I can hear you.

561
01:04:58,594 --> 01:05:00,562
At the Rosenthal Studio?

562
01:05:01,597 --> 01:05:02,894
Yes.

563
01:05:02,965 --> 01:05:04,626
Yes. When?

564
01:05:05,668 --> 01:05:07,533
When?

565
01:05:07,603 --> 01:05:09,628
Hello? Hello?

566
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:12,999
What happened?

567
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:14,838
Claudia, what happened?

568
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:17,243
They picked me.
I have to go to Rosenthal's.

569
01:05:17,313 --> 01:05:20,214
- But I don't know when.
- They'll call you back soon.

570
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:23,514
- What if they can't reach me?
- They'll call you.

571
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:26,885
- Please, come over.
- When are we leaving, Pablo?

572
01:05:26,956 --> 01:05:29,516
What do you mean?
We just got here.

573
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:31,219
- Please, come over.
- Okay.

574
01:05:31,294 --> 01:05:32,921
- Come on:
- I'm coming:

575
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:40,465
- You'll open it, Señor Pablo?
- Yes.

576
01:05:45,374 --> 01:05:49,640
Sorry, Antonio, but I've been waiting
for that call since this morning.

577
01:05:50,913 --> 01:05:54,542
- This is Mom's writing, isn't it?
- Yes.

578
01:05:57,987 --> 01:06:00,455
We'll see how it is
after all this time.

579
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:04,618
A good champagne.

580
01:06:04,694 --> 01:06:06,628
Is it cold?

581
01:06:06,696 --> 01:06:08,630
Yes, it's fine.

582
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:19,005
It's flat.

583
01:06:19,075 --> 01:06:22,203
The cork is fine.
Let's see about the rest.

584
01:06:32,355 --> 01:06:36,314
We'll sit you up,
Don Antonio.

585
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:42,130
- Claudia.
- What?

586
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,568
Dad.

587
01:06:48,471 --> 01:06:51,269
You'll toast but not drink.

588
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:54,309
Right.
Here's mine.

589
01:06:56,545 --> 01:06:59,514
Cheers:
Get well soon.

590
01:07:06,989 --> 01:07:09,321
Okay, old man.

591
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:42,017
Dinner's ready in 30 minutes.
Is that all right?

592
01:07:42,091 --> 01:07:45,026
That's fine.
I'd like to shower beforehand.

593
01:07:45,094 --> 01:07:48,120
Everything's in your bathroom,
Señor Pablo.

594
01:07:48,197 --> 01:07:50,324
I'll bring the towels right away.

595
01:07:51,967 --> 01:07:53,935
I'll go and shower.

596
01:07:54,003 --> 01:07:56,631
Dad, I'll come up
and see you later.

597
01:08:03,012 --> 01:08:05,947
- Are you coming?
- I'll stay a bit. Just in case.

598
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:08,984
It seems to be the only place
I can get a signal.

599
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:15,022
- I'll bring you the towels.
- That's fine.

600
01:09:51,654 --> 01:09:55,351
- I'll put them in your bedroom.
- Thank you.

601
01:09:55,424 --> 01:09:57,688
I don't know
if the lady would like a bath.

602
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:00,092
Don't worry.
She'll sort it out herself.

603
01:10:00,162 --> 01:10:03,097
Alberto said you asked
about the property sale.

604
01:10:03,165 --> 01:10:04,462
Yes.

605
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:40,128
Sorry.

606
01:11:41,263 --> 01:11:43,493
Do you need anything?

607
01:11:48,003 --> 01:11:50,096
I beg your pardon?

608
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:53,538
Are they dancing downstairs?

609
01:11:54,576 --> 01:11:56,544
What?

610
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,108
Are they dancing downstairs?

611
01:17:38,053 --> 01:17:45,585
