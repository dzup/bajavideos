1
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:50,944
The animals appearing in this film
lived and died as they naturally would.

2
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:19,311
And you?

3
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:28,214
I don't know.

4
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,901
- Leave that alone. Take that off.
- What's wrong? Come here!

5
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:53,112
- Come here!
- And if the boss comes?

6
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:55,546
- Come here!
- And if the boss comes?

7
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,831
What's that noise?

8
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:27,011
Put it down. It might go off.

9
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,172
It hasn't been fired in 100 years.

10
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:32,943
The dogs.

11
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:32,871
A weasel?

12
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:39,609
Impossible.

13
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,184
How is it impossible, young man?

14
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,748
I killed them all.

15
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,317
I drowned the litter.

16
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:58,028
So their ghost knows how to swim.

17
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:02,692
- Mercedes, bring Poldo some gin.
- Come on! - That much?

18
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,098
Hello, Pablito!

19
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:25,318
Pretty girl.

20
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,392
You'll have a daughter someday.

21
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,593
Enough.

22
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:55,182
Poldito, your order.
Should it go on your bill?

23
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:58,519
- Yeah. Is it all here?
- Yeah, I got everything.

24
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,294
Okay, Anselmo. I'm off.

25
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,127
Bye. See you tomorrow, Poldo.

26
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,064
Bye. See you tomorrow.

27
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,729
- Bye, everybody.
- See you tomorrow, Poldo.

28
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:59,374
"LA RABIA"

29
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,489
Know something, Nati?

30
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,525
Your grandfather's brother
was really bad.

31
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,467
Your mom's uncle.

32
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:23,838
I didn't know him.

33
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,803
Neither did your mother.

34
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,143
He was much older
than your grandfather.

35
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,546
When he died, your grandfather was...

36
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,581
4 years old.

37
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:45,561
They called him the Englishman.

38
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,699
He was real white, like you.

39
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,536
Worked at the

40
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,132
railroad station too,

41
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,769
which was owned by the British.

42
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,446
He was in charge of the train station.

43
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,487
But...

44
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:17,152
he had a problem.

45
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:19,530
You know why?

46
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,567
His wife

47
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,627
liked to take her clothes off.

48
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:29,700
Just like you.

49
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,642
You don't believe me?

50
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:44,650
She walked through the fields

51
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:46,657
and suddenly

52
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,629
took her clothes off!

53
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,794
And you can't do that, Nati.

54
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,493
That's wrong.

55
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,830
How can young girls run around
taking their clothes off?

56
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:05,439
The old man gambled.

57
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:07,868
To not see her.

58
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:12,775
That's ugly to see.

59
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,751
And for a fatherto see that,

60
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:20,621
his daughter taking her clothes off.

61
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:34,731
One day he made a lot of money

62
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:40,807
and then went home, they say.

63
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,475
He walked inside

64
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,780
and found his wife naked.

65
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,120
Well...

66
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:52,180
He ran off to the bar,

67
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,486
to get drunk,

68
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,890
'cause he was so sad.

69
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,296
Then he went

70
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,262
and gambled all it away.

71
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,107
All ofit, you understand?

72
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,308
Even Rayo,

73
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:14,141
the dog he loved the most.

74
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:24,919
That's not the worst, Nati.

75
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,355
Worse yet,

76
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:36,164
he gambled the railroad people's wages.

77
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:42,129
They went after him.

78
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:45,740
When they eventually found him,

79
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:50,204
they cut his throat,

80
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,614
cut off his head, like a pig.

81
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,416
They say he kicked real hard...

82
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,988
Know where your mother's uncle is now?

83
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,190
Running in the fields

84
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:06,959
hiding in the train station,
in La Rabia.

85
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,034
Because no one can see him.

86
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,933
He jumps out,

87
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:14,336
his head in his hand.

88
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,441
Wearing a dinner jacket...

89
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:22,113
People dressed up like that.

90
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,240
It looked like
they were going to a funeral.

91
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,674
All in black.

92
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:30,812
He chases after little girls

93
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:33,414
who take their clothes off.

94
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,452
He covers them with his cape,

95
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:40,728
to teach them a lesson.

96
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,865
But if they do it again,

97
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,198
he comes and eats them.

98
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:56,441
They say he buries the head
in a well there, in La Rabia.

99
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,609
Time for bed.

100
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,411
Kiss your father goodnight.

101
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:10,362
Why tell her lies?

102
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,937
Someone has to teach herthings, no?

103
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:26,670
Let's go, Lucifer!

104
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:24,423
Are you angry?

105
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,731
See what happened to your sisters?

106
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,461
You're lucky.

107
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:33,696
They're in the ditch.

108
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,469
You're safe. No one will find you.

109
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:40,909
Not even my father.

110
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:49,051
I'll tie a string around your neck.
You'll be my dog.

111
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:53,687
You can watch the house.

112
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:58,358
Eat, eat,
or you'll be too skinny.

113
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,796
They'll see your ribs.

114
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:06,504
I'll take you to the slaughter.
Let's see if you eat.

115
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:22,787
There! Got you!

116
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,812
And those?

117
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:56,918
It was your fucking dogs.

118
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:03,888
It was a weasel.
We can't catch it.

119
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,131
Think I'm one of your bitches, eh?

120
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:16,765
Better mind your dogs, Pichón!

121
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:17,774
Or else?

122
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:22,138
I'll make mince meat out of them.

123
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,079
Going to shoot the boy's dogs?

124
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:27,581
You going to pay for my sheep?

125
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:30,980
Get inside, you dumb kid!

126
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,022
Faggot.

127
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:46,034
Clean it up!
Always causing trouble.

128
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,500
Nati, careful!

129
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:10,619
Sit still here.

130
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:35,171
Ladeado, I'm off for La Rabia.

131
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,772
- Take her home later.
- Okay.

132
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,652
Stop.

133
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,247
Stop. You're a brute!

134
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:08,803
Easy now.

135
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:10,205
Stop!

136
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,211
Go on!

137
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:48,123
What's that there?

138
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,365
Nothing.

139
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:20,954
Come eat!

140
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:31,836
You won't eat?
You'll be skinny as Luisa.

141
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,538
Get down, before you fall off.

142
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:13,301
Want to fire it?

143
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:23,620
Wait. I'll show you.

144
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:33,590
First we need to call out.

145
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:50,103
Okay, shoot!

146
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,167
Hold hertight!

147
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,288
Hold tight!

148
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:04,366
Drag her over here.

149
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:08,866
Hold her!

150
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:24,154
Ladeado, grab the knife.

151
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:52,742
Not bad, eh?

152
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,396
Where's Ladeado?

153
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:10,992
Alejandra!

154
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,112
Pull it higher.

155
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:38,988
That's enough.

156
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,769
What?

157
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:16,759
Take it easy now.

158
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:45,812
Nati...

159
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:49,458
¡Nati!

160
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:52,755
Enough. Don't make that noise.

161
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,161
Come with me.

162
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:58,524
- Alejandra!
- She's playing.

163
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:10,943
What happened with Pichón?

164
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,710
Look at me.

165
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,547
Don't worry.

166
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,885
Don't make those noises again.
They're horrible.

167
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:24,987
You don't like this dress?
Take it off. I'll get something else.

168
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:33,036
Here.

169
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:36,736
You'll be eating something nice now.

170
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,032
Nati.

171
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:53,350
Hey, did you see how the mute acted?

172
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:55,824
You've got to play with her more.

173
00:39:57,762 --> 00:39:59,320
What'd he say?

174
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,609
What did you say?

175
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:17,340
I told the kid to behave himself,
that's all.

176
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:23,080
- Get off your ass and out ofmy house.
- What's wrong, Poldo?

177
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:24,280
Now!

178
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:28,121
- What did I do?
- Get out ofhere. Now.

179
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:35,560
Don't come back. Ever.

180
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:38,302
You wipe your mouth before you mention
my daughter.

181
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:39,564
Go fuck yourself.

182
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:01,616
God damn it. Can't we eat in peace?

183
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:07,492
You got to act the boss around here?
Can't you see Ladeado is here?

184
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:09,328
Shut your mouth.

185
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:13,563
What? You like showing off
in front of your friends.

186
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:14,729
Eh?

187
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:22,203
You go inside and stay there.

188
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:23,678
Get out ofhere.

189
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,884
- It's well cooked, eh, Modesto?
- Yes, really delicious.

190
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:46,267
Pass me the wine.

191
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,155
God damn him to hell.

192
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:17,962
I hope one of those monsters you draw
gets him.

193
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:24,252
Don't you worry about grownup things.

194
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:36,167
We grownups fight,
but you're just a child.

195
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:41,043
You just behave yourself.

196
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:45,540
Everyone loves kids that behave.

197
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:54,791
Up you go. I'll dry you off.

198
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:04,129
There you go.

199
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:06,229
That's it.

200
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:10,039
Nice and dry.

201
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:28,050
I won't have you going
to Pichón's house.

202
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:28,977
Ladeado's not the problem.

203
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:40,528
What's your problem with Pichón now?
You know he's a brute.

204
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:42,224
We've talked about it.

205
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,698
Wasn't that enough?

206
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:46,897
Go to bed.

207
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,837
Talked about it?
No one can with you.

208
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:52,432
You don't care what they say
about your daughter?

209
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:56,411
Poldo, what do you expect?
She's a mute. She screams like a pig.

210
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,674
That's not normal.

211
00:46:57,781 --> 00:47:00,579
Asshole fucks the sheep in the fields.

212
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:01,879
That's not normal.

213
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:03,920
She'll talk soon.

214
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:09,789
Look, Leopoldo.

215
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:46,122
Nati's not coming anymore?

216
00:47:53,103 --> 00:47:54,866
What's wrong? The jerk won't let her?

217
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:59,204
- After what you said recently...
- I say what I want. She's a mute.

218
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,842
Fucking useless as a father.

219
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,042
What you say?

220
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:09,975
Say it again!

221
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:14,882
Know what?
You can't go there either.

222
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:16,118
You hear me?

223
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:18,457
- You hear me, you dirty punk?
- Yes.

224
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:22,658
I'll catch you over there,
I'll beat you to a pulp.

225
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:28,298
- Here.
- Don't want it.

226
00:48:30,607 --> 00:48:33,041
God damn you to hell. Damn it.

227
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:00,726
Very good, Nati.

228
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:02,537
There you go.

229
00:49:09,846 --> 00:49:13,441
Nati, come here. Let's treat Pintita.

230
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:26,659
Easy now.

231
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:37,236
There.

232
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:40,334
Very good, Nati.

233
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:44,145
Now, slowly.

234
00:49:44,214 --> 00:49:46,205
You need a little more there.

235
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:48,114
Here.

236
00:49:48,952 --> 00:49:51,079
Good.

237
00:50:10,474 --> 00:50:12,499
Querés ir a Io de Ladeado, ¿no?

238
00:50:14,978 --> 00:50:16,309
You want to go see Ladeado, don't you?

239
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:22,116
Only today. You hear?

240
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:18,766
Ladeado!

241
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:21,811
What did I say about the hay?
Come here, damn it!

242
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:31,486
The hay, damn it!

243
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:33,182
What'd I tell you about the mute!

244
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:35,983
Get over here!
Where are you going?

245
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:37,494
Get over here!

246
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:39,223
Get over here you bastard!

247
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:43,165
What did I tell you about the mute!
Are you going to listen to me?

248
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:45,667
Get up! You listen to me!

249
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,401
Get home!

250
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:51,566
Go home! I said get going!

251
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,511
Get out!

252
00:51:58,181 --> 00:52:00,046
Get out!

253
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:03,609
Get out! Get out!

254
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:07,853
Stop!

255
00:52:07,924 --> 00:52:10,154
Stay here until tomorrow!

256
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,957
Get out ofhere.

257
00:52:15,031 --> 00:52:17,234
- Damn it!
- Go away!

258
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:19,395
Damn it! Go over there!

259
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:20,937
Are you going to start listening to me?

260
00:52:20,937 --> 00:52:22,871
Are you going to start listening to me?
Take this!

261
00:52:22,939 --> 00:52:27,210
- Get out!
- Take this!

262
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:29,872
Get out!

263
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,979
Get out, go away!

264
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:39,013
Get out! No!

265
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:42,525
I don't want to see you again with
the mute, or I'll knock your head off!

266
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:45,128
I'll knock your head off, you hear?

267
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:46,857
Go away!

268
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:49,364
You learn to listen
to your father, damn it!

269
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:34,935
I won't have either of you going over
to that son of a bitch.

270
00:54:35,005 --> 00:54:37,303
I won't have either of you in his house.

271
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:41,810
That's it!

272
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:51,045
If you want to see Ladeado,
he'll have to come here.

273
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,125
What's wrong now?

274
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:05,992
You kidding me?

275
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,828
Didn't you see the girl's leg?

276
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:12,204
How do you know it was at Pichón's?

277
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:16,442
How?

278
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:19,676
- Alejandra, you know very well.
- I don't know anything.

279
00:55:21,584 --> 00:55:25,953
- Who the fuck are you defending now?
- She's my daughter. She likes to go.

280
00:55:26,022 --> 00:55:28,183
The girl won't go because I say so.
That's it!

281
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:34,992
It's over,
that's it sweetie...

282
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:38,334
It's okay. It's over, Nati.

283
00:55:40,103 --> 00:55:41,764
Give herto me. You happy now?

284
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,572
God damn it.

285
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,203
Get your boy.

286
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:11,336
What's up, Poldo?

287
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:13,739
I'm not talking to you. Get your boy.

288
01:00:15,044 --> 01:00:16,739
You're not the foreman around here.

289
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:20,907
Don't get smart with me
and get him over here. Damn it.

290
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:35,228
The dogs got into my chicken coop,
killed my hens.

291
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:41,628
You know what has to be done,
don't you?

292
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:46,570
It's not the first time either, Ladeado.

293
01:00:48,244 --> 01:00:50,974
You're going to shoot the boy's dogs?

294
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:53,106
Start raising your kid right

295
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:56,049
instead of making him work all day.

296
01:00:57,687 --> 01:00:59,780
Go inside, son.

297
01:01:02,592 --> 01:01:04,457
Go inside, I tell you!

298
01:01:15,138 --> 01:01:16,730
It was the lame dog.

299
01:01:16,806 --> 01:01:19,434
Always been a mean dog.

300
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:25,204
- Think it was the lame one?
- An old shitty dog.

301
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:26,839
Ladeado!

302
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:36,888
Here, take him.

303
01:01:36,959 --> 01:01:38,483
Go on, carry him.

304
01:07:23,506 --> 01:07:24,768
Get dressed.

305
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:29,106
Get dressed. It's cold.

306
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:34,645
If you won't, cover up
with this at least.

307
01:07:54,603 --> 01:07:56,798
I'm going after your mother now.

308
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:02,140
Stay with Luisa.
She'll take good care of you.

309
01:09:45,648 --> 01:09:47,479
Alejandra, come here.

310
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:52,053
Drop everything and come here!

311
01:10:04,733 --> 01:10:06,860
Come here, Alejandra!

312
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:21,046
Come out, son of a bitch!

313
01:10:27,623 --> 01:10:30,148
Fucking coward!

314
01:13:41,717 --> 01:13:43,981
We'll be fine, you hear?

315
01:13:51,393 --> 01:13:54,294
See why I tell you
not to go out on the road?

316
01:13:54,363 --> 01:13:57,491
They go hunting and
just shoot around.

317
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:06,499
It won't happen to us girls.

318
01:14:06,575 --> 01:14:09,203
We just stay here, you hear me?

319
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:12,975
We'll clean things up nice,
like the bosses want.

320
01:14:25,394 --> 01:14:27,726
What did I just tell you, Nati?

321
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:29,764
Don't play with that.

322
01:15:20,082 --> 01:15:22,050
What are you drawing?

323
01:15:23,051 --> 01:15:24,279
Let's see.

324
01:15:28,123 --> 01:15:31,217
Don't draw those dirty things
you've been doing.

325
01:15:31,293 --> 01:15:32,453
Little girls don't do that.

326
01:15:35,664 --> 01:15:38,599
Draw pretty things.
Little animals, flowers.

327
01:15:44,339 --> 01:15:46,204
Look at me.

328
01:15:47,109 --> 01:15:51,068
At school, the teacher will scold you
if you draw dirty things.

329
01:15:51,146 --> 01:15:52,579
Come on.

330
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,346
Draw me a sun.

331
01:16:00,355 --> 01:16:01,720
A sun.

332
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:20,205
Go on, do whatever you want.

333
01:17:21,803 --> 01:17:23,134
Ladeado?

334
01:17:25,073 --> 01:17:26,836
No, wait.

335
01:17:28,543 --> 01:17:30,636
