THE SECRET OF THEIR EYES

2
00:02:44,001 --> 00:02:47,101
June 21st, 1974...

3
00:02:47,202 --> 00:02:52,302
was the last day that Morales 
had breakfast with Liliana Colotto.

4
00:02:52,303 --> 00:02:54,303
And for the rest of his life

5
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:57,304
he would remember every detail of that morning.

6
00:02:57,305 --> 00:03:00,305
They planned their first holiday, with some tea and lemon

7
00:03:00,306 --> 00:03:03,306
because of the cold, that he drunk with some sugar.

8
00:03:07,307 --> 00:03:11,907
he will always remember that real jam, that he would never taste again.

9
00:03:12,008 --> 00:03:14,908
the tiny flowers on her dress

10
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:17,309
but mainly.. her smile.

11
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,310
that smile just awaken

12
00:03:19,311 --> 00:03:23,311
mixed with that ray of sun in her cheek

13
00:03:23,312 --> 00:03:24,512
and that...

14
00:04:42,213 --> 00:04:45,513
*im afraid*

15
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,614
- the gates of heaven must be open, because an angel...

16
00:05:07,615 --> 00:05:08,615
-Esposito..

17
00:05:08,616 --> 00:05:10,616
-Bye, girl

18
00:05:11,617 --> 00:05:12,617
-How you say you are?

19
00:05:12,618 --> 00:05:14,718
-How are you, Doctor?

20
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:15,819
-How are things, Chief? Is the Doctor in?

21
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,820
-Go on, she's in there.

22
00:05:17,821 --> 00:05:21,821
-Thanks holy father, you look well sitting down there

23
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,822
-Hee hee, what a mother fucker...

24
00:05:25,823 --> 00:05:28,823
-Less legs than a passport picture

25
00:05:30,824 --> 00:05:33,824
-The gates of heaven must be op...

26
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,025
-Your highness...

27
00:05:43,026 --> 00:05:45,026
-What a surprise!

28
00:05:46,027 --> 00:05:48,027
-How are you?

29
00:05:50,028 --> 00:05:53,028
-Nothing. I just came by to talk a bit. Are you busy?

30
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:57,929
-No, i was just looking over a speech, but i know it by heart. Coffee?

31
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:02,930
-I was asking, because maybe in your priestly life, you decided to take care of yourself.

32
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:04,931
-Mariano
-Yes, Doctor?

33
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:08,032
-Go to the coffee shop and bring us two coffees

34
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:11,033
-but i must finish off the files

35
00:06:11,034 --> 00:06:15,034
-which files? Let me introduce you to Mr Benjamin Esposito,
recently retired from the palace

36
00:06:15,035 --> 00:06:18,035
...and an old friend.

37
00:06:18,036 --> 00:06:20,136
Mariano, the new boy of spring/summer

38
00:06:20,137 --> 00:06:22,237
not bad

39
00:06:22,238 --> 00:06:25,238
take this, bring some petite fur
if you want, also a Tita

40
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:28,239
-More milk than coffee for me, please

41
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,240
-That's right, you have this little problem...

42
00:06:31,241 --> 00:06:33,441
..you're old

43
00:06:33,442 --> 00:06:37,442
more milk than coffee for this gentleman
who has this elderly problem

44
00:06:37,443 --> 00:06:40,543
wait..you wanted me to say something important?

45
00:06:40,544 --> 00:06:43,544
-No, well...think not

46
00:06:43,545 --> 00:06:47,645
-Leave it open, kid. Come, sit down

47
00:06:47,646 --> 00:06:49,646
so what do you know about writing books?

48
00:06:49,647 --> 00:06:53,647
-What? i spent all my life writing.
I can show you all the files

49
00:06:53,648 --> 00:06:55,648
-Ah, the files

50
00:06:55,649 --> 00:07:01,649
and how many pages will you have in your new file?
does it have a title?

51
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,650
-a bit of help would be great

52
00:07:04,651 --> 00:07:08,751
what do you want me to do?
to behave like someone retired?

53
00:07:08,752 --> 00:07:11,752
asking if you need help, a coffee?

54
00:07:11,753 --> 00:07:15,753
i want to write
what's wrong on that?

55
00:07:15,754 --> 00:07:20,754
and i want to write about the Morales case

56
00:07:30,755 --> 00:07:33,755
I don't know why

57
00:07:33,756 --> 00:07:38,756
i was thinking about it
we never talked about it... why didn't we?

58
00:07:42,057 --> 00:07:44,757
-With your handwriting
this is going to be a great mess

59
00:07:47,058 --> 00:07:49,758
-ah, wait...look

60
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,759
-anyway, we will not have problems
at the pace I'm at...

61
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,860
...i couldnt finish the 5th line

62
00:07:54,861 --> 00:07:57,861
I'll end up spending all my money on paper

63
00:08:00,962 --> 00:08:03,862
-Come, come here, give me a hand

64
00:08:05,863 --> 00:08:08,863
-cant believe it

65
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:10,864
-its really heavy

66
00:08:14,865 --> 00:08:16,765
-cant believe it, the old Olivetti

67
00:08:17,766 --> 00:08:20,766
-it was stocked with the case of
heary dwarf

68
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,767
-the "a" was fixed?

69
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:26,768
-hah, how funny, with the "a" anybody can write

70
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:29,769
take it, you two dinasours
will come to an understanding

71
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:35,770
-i think that now, i won't have any excuses.
i will have to write

72
00:08:35,771 --> 00:08:38,771
but where can i start?

73
00:08:38,772 --> 00:08:43,772
-Start where you remember the best
it was 20 years ago, what is it?

74
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:47,773

75
00:08:47,774 --> 00:08:51,774

-in fact i went to Cornell, not Harvard

83
00:09:14,882 --> 00:09:18,882
-A pleasure, Pablo Sandoval
official, but first, at your service

84
00:09:21,883 --> 00:09:24,883
-Che, whats up?

But I'm not sure that

87
00:09:35,886 --> 00:09:38,886
they're connected with the story

88
00:09:38,887 --> 00:09:41,887
-then start with the beginning
and don't fuck with it

89
00:09:52,988 --> 00:09:55,188
-blood bank, hello?
-Mr Esposito

96
00:10:16,295 --> 00:10:20,495
-ah, no, its a trick we angels use
to look 3 kilos slimmer

00:10:30,498 --> 00:10:32,498
-you are such a tender kid

100
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:36,199
-why?

101
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,200
-why? A chick comes and you already

102
00:10:42,201 --> 00:10:46,201
-thing is... I may look like a frog
but I'm really a charming prince

103

-Mr Esposito
-What?

104
00:10:48,303 --> 00:10:51,303
-they say that Dr Romano said
this case is for us

105
00:10:51,404 --> 00:10:54,104
-Dr Romano? Tell him that
General Esposito is going to kick his ass

106
00:10:54,105 --> 00:10:56,105
-ok
-where are you going, asshole?

107
00:10:56,106 --> 00:11:00,106
3 hours thinking about what to say to her
she comes, and i'm a blank

108
00:11:01,107 --> 00:11:04,107
-forme is easier, Benja
i'm not in love

109
00:11:04,108 --> 00:11:07,108
-me either, jerk

110
00:11:09,109 --> 00:11:12,109
-what i say is, you took the files
and put them right there

111
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,110
not too complicated

112
00:11:14,111 --> 00:11:18,111
-Che, Romano, what did you
say to 25th? its yours

113
00:11:18,112 --> 00:11:21,212
-we agreed to make on you
one us, whats the deal?

114
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:24,413
-a robbery, not a murderer, cheater
one and one if its the same

115
00:11:24,414 --> 00:11:27,414
-what can i do? ask him to
Dr Fortuna Lacalle

116
00:11:27,415 --> 00:11:29,415
-im asking for a solution
not 2 problems

117
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,416
-excuse me, my dear
why a problem?

118
00:11:35,417 --> 00:11:38,417
-no, Dr. i meant, it would be childish
to bother you with this

119
00:11:38,418 --> 00:11:41,418
its something we can solve
by ourselves

120
00:11:41,419 --> 00:11:44,419
-by the agreement, the case is yours
and hurry up with it..

121
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:48,420
..or instead of a murder scene
you'll find a funeral

122
00:11:51,421 --> 00:11:53,421
-how are you, Baez?
-here i am and you

123
00:11:53,622 --> 00:11:57,422
-tired of being so happy
-i can see the joy in your face

124
00:11:57,423 --> 00:11:59,423
-like a dog with two tails
if there's one thing i love...

125
00:11:59,424 --> 00:12:02,424
it's that the asshole Doctor
sends me to see a dead woman

126
00:12:02,425 --> 00:12:05,525
-watch out, there are thousands of assholes
like the easy asshole, never bothers

127
00:12:05,526 --> 00:12:10,526

128
00:12:10,527 --> 00:12:13,527
-how are you inspector?
-hah, talking about you

129
00:12:13,528 --> 00:12:16,528
-and we have the asshole

or a clever combination of the two

133
00:12:27,532 --> 00:12:33,532

-somebody else had keys for your house?

142

Have you seen any strangers around recently?

143
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:04,642
A neighbour told us that you came home

144
00:15:14,643 --> 00:15:17,643
sorry, i didnt understand

145
00:15:19,644 --> 00:15:29,644
-we had a habit, to watch The Three Stooges together
at midday. She had so much fun...with them

146
00:15:35,645 --> 00:15:41,645
-well, you will have to come with us
to the morgue. We'll try to make things fast

147
00:16:04,646 --> 00:16:08,646

Dr Fortuna Lacalle, declare myself...

151
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:25,650
..completely insane and incapable of acting.

152
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,651
-No, no, no. That's not the way.

153
00:16:28,652 --> 00:16:31,652
let's see

154
00:16:31,653 --> 00:16:39,653
no, no, its like this: because of articles number
141, 142  and 143 of the civil code

155
00:16:39,654 --> 00:16:45,654
i state, big letters, that Raimundo Fortuna
Lacalle, is a crazy man

156
00:16:45,655 --> 00:16:51,655
demented, in juridical meaning
as a delusional-minded case

157
00:16:52,656 --> 00:16:56,656
therefore, unable to face acts
of civil life

158
00:16:58,657 --> 00:17:01,657
-how are you Doctor?
Do we have papers for today?

159
00:17:02,658 --> 00:17:05,658
-ah, yes, doctor, the case of
Nicolosi its what we have

160
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:08,659
-Not much, Dr
just some citations to witnesses

161
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,660
-yes, sorry, one last file
-ok, thank you

162
00:17:18,661 --> 00:17:21,661
-how are you doctor?
-how are you? -Benjamin

163
00:17:25,062 --> 00:17:28,662
-che, Benjamin. so you can see
the good will of the 18th

164
00:17:28,663 --> 00:17:31,663
remember the other day you were
a bit mad with us?

165
00:17:32,664 --> 00:17:37,764
here you are, case is solved. It was 2 workers
who were in dept 3, and killed her

166
00:17:38,765 --> 00:17:43,765
they are already in jail in the 25th
when the judge wants it, you can bring them

167
00:17:43,766 --> 00:17:46,766
-wait, wait, wait. which workers?

168
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:53,767
-i tell you: Jacinto Caceres, from Bolivia, 35
Juan Robles, 34

169
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:56,768
at least, this one is from Argentina

170
00:17:56,769 --> 00:18:00,769
-you really amaze me, from now on
i will give you all the difficult cases

171
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:06,770
-please, doctor. i always say
better to help than fight
172
00:18:10,771 --> 00:18:12,771
-Exposito, how are you?

173
00:18:12,772 --> 00:18:15,772
-Romano told you i was coming?
-yes, i was sending a report to the judge

174
00:18:15,773 --> 00:18:18,773
I'll send you the prisioners tomorrow
its them, they already confessed

175
00:18:18,774 --> 00:18:20,774
-open it, come on
-i ll send them to the judge

176
00:18:20,775 --> 00:18:23,775
-come on, let me in
-it must be authorized by Cicora

177
00:18:23,776 --> 00:18:26,776
-Listen jerk, Cicora is about to receive
a citation in the ass

178
00:18:26,777 --> 00:18:30,777
you want one too? for me its the same,
2 for the price of 1

179
00:18:30,778 --> 00:18:32,778
what do we do?

180
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:46,779
you are Caceres?

181
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,780
-no, im Robles
he is Caceres

182
00:19:04,781 --> 00:19:08,781

183
00:19:16,382 --> 00:19:19,882
-you are a one huge motherfucker
-whats your problem, sicko?

184
00:19:21,883 --> 00:19:24,883
-you found two fools, two fools

185
00:19:24,884 --> 00:19:28,884
-what the fuck do i care?
-they beat them according to your orders

186
00:19:28,885 --> 00:19:32,885
-you know where I'm going now? To chambers
im going to make a complaint against you

187
00:19:37,186 --> 00:19:40,886
-you know where I'll put your complaint?
-no, i will put it in your ass!

188
00:19:40,887 --> 00:19:43,887
-go, go and make it. All this trouble because of
two little blacks

189
00:19:43,888 --> 00:19:45,888
-I'll black your eyes, you fucker!

190
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:52,889
you will never come to this judge's house again
-stop it, stop it

191
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,890
-you dont know who are you fucking with

194
00:20:08,893 --> 00:20:10,893
I'll be right back

195
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,094

-he's gone

196
00:20:14,095 --> 00:20:17,095
where?
-i think he left by Talcahuano street

197
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:35,096
-attention a moment, please. The minister has just arrived.

198
00:20:35,097 --> 00:20:38,297
Benjamin Esposito, greetings

199
00:20:38,298 --> 00:20:42,298
-my god, how much is it?
-you dont have to pay anything

200
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:47,299

00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:28,410
-bye, the coat.
-here it is, here it is...lets go

212
00:21:35,411 --> 00:21:40,411
you are his wife, this is his house
-i cant take this any longer... no

213
00:21:40,412 --> 00:21:45,412
-you should thank me for bringing him back at this hour
-i dont know why he comes like that

214
00:21:45,413 --> 00:21:48,413
this is your fault
-mine?

215
00:22:27,414 --> 00:22:30,414
-who is it?
-Benjamin Esposito

216
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:33,415
-Who?
-from the judge's house, remember?

217
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:41,416
-she was pretty, wasn't she?
-very

218
00:22:42,417 --> 00:22:47,417
-i feel really sorry for those men
yeah, they must be free by now

219
00:22:47,418 --> 00:22:51,418
they had to be checked by forensic doctors
because of what i told you

220
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:55,419
-no, no, carry on looking
so you can get to know her better

221
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:01,420
here you have more
i spend all my time looking at her photos
222
00:23:04,421 --> 00:23:08,421
i know, im not facing the truth, but well
it helps me to carry on living

223
00:23:08,422 --> 00:23:11,422
until we catch this guy

224
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:15,423
that's when she became a teacher
then she came from Chivilcoy

225
00:23:15,424 --> 00:23:18,424
to live here, in the house
of her aunt, working in a school

226
00:23:18,425 --> 00:23:21,425
i met her in there, she came
to pay her taxes at the National Bank

227
00:23:21,426 --> 00:23:27,426
i still can't believe how i dared
to talk with such a beautiful woman

228
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:38,427
tell me something, when this guy is caught
how much time will he get in jail?

229
00:23:42,228 --> 00:23:46,428
-murder-rape gets life imprisonment

230
00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:52,129
what else can we do? we can't kill him in argentina
-i don't agree with the death sentence

231
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:58,130
-no, me either...i meant
maybe it would be retribution for you

232
00:23:58,131 --> 00:24:03,131
-retribution? what? is he going to
be raped and murdered like her?

233
00:24:03,132 --> 00:24:06,232
no, they would give him an injection
and he would just fall asleep

234
00:24:06,233 --> 00:24:11,233
its not fair. can you imagine how much
i'd desire an injection like that?

235
00:24:17,234 --> 00:24:21,234
those are from when she was 17
or 18 years old

236
00:24:21,235 --> 00:24:25,235
a day in the country side,
in Chivilcoy, do you know Chivilcoy?

237
00:24:25,236 --> 00:24:29,236
-no
-i do, i went with her, to meet her parents

238
00:24:35,237 --> 00:24:40,237
no, i want him to live for many years to come

239
00:24:40,238 --> 00:24:44,238
so he can live many years full of nothing

240
00:25:00,239 --> 00:25:03,239
what's up?

241
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,240
mm...nothing

242
00:25:19,241 --> 00:25:22,241
she didnt have brothers, right?
-no, why?

243
00:25:31,042 --> 00:25:35,242
-do you know who this guy is?
he's in several pictures, looking at her

244
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:39,243
i showed her this system
because later in life, we forget names

245
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:52,244
here it is... Gomez
Isidoro Gomez

246
00:26:13,245 --> 00:26:17,245
-so?  -i always thought this
pictures thing was crazy

247
00:26:17,246 --> 00:26:20,246
-well, yes...but, i think
it's because of the way he's looking

248
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:25,247
i think its that. you see this guy
watching this woman, with adoration

249
00:26:27,248 --> 00:26:31,248
the eyes, talk...

250
00:26:40,249 --> 00:26:43,249
talk bullshit, they'd better shut up

251
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:48,450
sometimes it's better not to look

252
00:26:50,451 --> 00:26:54,451
-we never talked about again
when did you come back from Jujuy?

253
00:26:54,452 --> 00:26:58,452
-in '85
-why now?

254
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:03,453
-better than flower-arranging
-why?

255
00:27:07,054 --> 00:27:10,454
-because i've been getting
disctracted for 20 years

256
00:27:11,455 --> 00:27:17,455
cases, friends, parties
a marriage, a few affairs

257
00:27:18,456 --> 00:27:20,456
i got distracted

258
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:23,457
now im retired, i dont have anything
to distract me

259
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:26,458
the other day i was having my dinner

260
00:27:26,459 --> 00:27:29,459
and i saw myself, eating
alone

261
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,460
and i didnt like myself

262
00:27:32,461 --> 00:27:36,461
i know it doesnt happen to you
im not asking you to understand me

263
00:27:37,462 --> 00:27:40,462
believe me, and trying..

264
00:27:41,463 --> 00:27:48,463
..to find the whys, the moments
everything, everything lead me to Morales

265
00:27:49,464 --> 00:27:53,464
its like if my life,
would...

266
00:27:56,465 --> 00:27:59,465
answer, answer
-its okay. It's Alfonso, I'll call him back

267
00:28:00,466 --> 00:28:02,466
-its okay, answer

268
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:24,467
-hello
-hello, is this Isidoro Gomes's house?

269
00:28:24,468 --> 00:28:27,468
-yes
-is he at home?

270
00:28:27,469 --> 00:28:31,469
-no, no, he doesnt live here anymore
-no?

271
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:36,470
-no, he moved. to Buenos Aires

272
00:28:38,471 --> 00:28:41,071
-ah, to Buenos Aires.
-who is this?

273
00:28:43,072 --> 00:28:45,000

I'm calling on behalf of counsellor Mendez
it's for a job

274
00:28:48,073 --> 00:28:51,073
Has it been a long time since he moved
to Buenos Aires?

275
00:28:51,074 --> 00:28:54,274
-maybe a month..
month and a half

276
00:28:56,275 --> 00:28:59,275
do you know where i can find him?
do you have an address?

277
00:28:59,276 --> 00:29:02,276
this job is important

278
00:29:02,277 --> 00:29:06,277
-i know he's working in a building,
in construction

279
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:13,278
he told me.. something like..

280
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:20,279
Montevideo street, in Lanus
I'm not really sure

281
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,280
but, what kind of job is it?

282
00:29:25,881 --> 00:29:33,281
its a job he will like because
its for counsellor Mendez and...

283
00:29:34,682 --> 00:29:40,282
tell me somthing, was he friends with
Liliana Colotto?

284
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:48,283
ahh..Liliana Colotto she was
his girlfriend, in the neigbourhood

285
00:29:48,484 --> 00:29:53,284
why?
-because Liliana works for Counsellor Mendez

286
00:29:55,285 --> 00:29:58,285
it was her who recommended him for the job

287
00:30:01,286 --> 00:30:07,286
ah, it was her. he will be happy
-really? you think he will remember her?

288
00:30:08,587 --> 00:30:13,287
-oh, yes. he liked her a lot

289
00:30:14,288 --> 00:30:20,288
but then later she left, for Buenos Aires
I don't think they've seen each other since.

290
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:25,289
hello... hello

291
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:38,290
-if we find him, it's going to be a miracle,
big asshole.

292
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:41,291
-poor guy, i would like to see you
in a similar situation

293
00:30:41,292 --> 00:30:45,292
-no, you big asshole. you should tell me
and keep it quiet

294
00:30:45,393 --> 00:30:48,393

Isidoro Gomez

295

296
00:30:51,395 --> 00:30:53,895
-Mike Hammer, asshole

297
00:30:53,896 --> 00:30:55,896
-no he didn't come
we have nothing to do with him

298
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:59,897
-please, just give me his address
-right away

299
00:31:08,898 --> 00:31:15,998
-we know that Gomez had a phone call last night
he had paid the whole week

300
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:20,999
but he left anyway

301
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
i can search more, if you want

302
00:31:28,001 --> 00:31:31,001
-i saw the same pictures

303
00:31:31,002 --> 00:31:35,002
i should have found that out

304
00:31:35,003 --> 00:31:39,003
-there's no way, Esposito.
that case has nothing, just smoke

305
00:31:40,004 --> 00:31:44,004
if you think im going to embarrass
myself with my collegue from Chivilcoy

306
00:31:44,005 --> 00:31:48,005
to enter in the house of an old woman
to search for some letters he might have written...

307
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:54,006
and..papa..please, Esposito
you are crazy

308
00:31:54,007 --> 00:31:58,007
-you know what, Doctor
without this, we have nothing

309
00:31:58,008 --> 00:32:02,008
-look, you gave enough trouble with
your charge on poor Romano

310
00:32:02,009 --> 00:32:06,009
he's now who knows where
or maybe he is in Chivilcoy

311
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:10,010
why dont you check, he could help you

312
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:37,011
the truth is, i dont know what to do

313
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:43,012
Morales gets worse and worse everyday the
murderer knows we are after him

314
00:32:44,013 --> 00:32:48,013
i have a judge is a stupid
irene..i want to kill her

315
00:32:50,014 --> 00:32:55,014
and the only guy i trust
is a dumb drunk, an asshole

316
00:33:00,015 --> 00:33:03,515
i have something on my favour.
small, but something

317
00:33:03,516 --> 00:33:07,516
today is 28th, it means that
dumb drunk still hasn't got his salary

318
00:33:07,517 --> 00:33:11,517
the previous one..he drunk it

319
00:33:11,518 --> 00:33:15,518
so, when the barman asks him for money, the
guy will face a dilemma

320
00:33:15,719 --> 00:33:20,519
If he says he doesn't have any money
he goes to jail, he fights, a lot of problems

321
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,520
his wife definitely throw him out
or...

322
00:33:23,521 --> 00:33:28,521
..he turns around, to his asshole boss
that is me, and asks him to pay

323
00:33:28,522 --> 00:33:33,022
that's it. The boss is an asshole
but not that much of an asshole

324
00:33:33,023 --> 00:33:37,023
he will pay. Again

325
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:40,024
but he will ask a favour in return

326
00:33:40,025 --> 00:33:46,025
and the dumb drunk will not say no
isnt it?

327
00:33:57,026 --> 00:34:00,026
i have to pee
-hold it

328
00:34:00,027 --> 00:34:03,027
The old woman will be out in any moment

329
00:34:03,028 --> 00:34:07,428
- Too many inspectors movies. Napoleon Solo
Perry Mason... that's your problem

330
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:16,429
che, really, i have to pee

331
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:44,430
ah, motherfucker! I could shit on you!
-you fucking scared me, asshole

332
00:36:44,431 --> 00:36:48,431
-me, to you? what are you doing here?
-i came to help

333
00:36:48,732 --> 00:36:51,432
-you should've stayed outside,
in case the old woman comes back

334
00:36:51,433 --> 00:36:55,433
-she's not coming
-how do you know?

335
00:36:55,434 --> 00:36:58,434
-she is in the shop. She'll be there
a while, calm down

336
00:37:00,435 --> 00:37:03,435
did you find something?
-letters

337
00:37:03,436 --> 00:37:08,436
but they dont have his address.
There aren't any envelopes

338
00:37:12,437 --> 00:37:15,437
this is recent
-so?

339
00:37:15,438 --> 00:37:21,438
-how, so? its new
-the trash, maybe an envelope might still be there

340
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:32,439
che, there's nothing here

341
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,440
nothing, nothing?
-nothing

342
00:37:40,541 --> 00:37:44,441
-did you look carefully?
-want to see?

343
00:38:18,442 --> 00:38:20,542
want me to drive?

344
00:38:21,143 --> 00:38:24,643
I'm sure that little dog was rapid
and you're going to die

345
00:38:24,644 --> 00:38:27,644
- i dont understand why you didn't 
stay outside. The old woman can't know

346
00:38:27,945 --> 00:38:33,645
-Benjamin, the moment we came
she'd know, sooner or later

347
00:38:33,646 --> 00:38:36,646
-thats why we decided to not
bring the letters with us

348
00:38:39,147 --> 00:38:42,647
you couldn't be so stupid as to have taken
the letters, could you?

349
00:38:46,048 --> 00:38:48,648
and what if I did?

350
00:38:48,649 --> 00:38:51,649
-ay, motherfucker! what?
what?

351
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:56,650
if the old woman knows, she'll tell Gomez
and we'll never find him.

352
00:38:56,651 --> 00:38:59,951
-i dont see it like that
-what don't you see? you don't see a fucking thing

353
00:38:59,952 --> 00:39:04,952
-you'll see. When i start to study this, you'll see
i'll find out everything.. when I'm alone

354
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:19,053
tactical revolutionary command..?
...wrong number..

355
00:39:26,054 --> 00:39:29,054
so? nothing?
-dont know, maybe it's me

356
00:39:29,055 --> 00:39:32,055
It's as if this fucker knew that we'd read them.

357
00:39:32,056 --> 00:39:36,056
just names, nonsense things
nothing concrete

358
00:39:40,057 --> 00:39:44,057
look, calm down, mum
I'm more like Manfredini than Babastro in this way

359
00:39:44,058 --> 00:39:47,558
People from Chivilcoy?

360
00:39:48,959 --> 00:39:52,559
-give them to me..

361
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:57,560
Sperm Bank, hello?
...no we only provide...

362
00:40:00,561 --> 00:40:05,561
Esposito, Sandoval... Dr Fortuna
wants to see you, please

363
00:40:08,962 --> 00:40:11,562
when i talk to you, you can hear
me, right?

364
00:40:11,763 --> 00:40:14,563
-yes, doctor

365
00:40:14,564 --> 00:40:18,564
-then i must assume that if i say
something and you do the opposite

366
00:40:18,565 --> 00:40:23,565
its not because you don't hear but
you shit on the order i gave you

367
00:40:23,566 --> 00:40:26,566
Is that right, Esposito?
-no, its not like that, Dr-

368
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:32,567
and if my colleague from Chivilcoy calls me
very angry, because two of my men

369
00:40:32,568 --> 00:40:40,568
broke into the house of a poor old woman
that would mean he's full of shit

370
00:40:44,869 --> 00:40:47,969
-i dont know where your colleague
could have come up with that idea

371
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:51,670
-its the same as I said to him, Esposito
but look, look

372
00:40:51,671 --> 00:40:58,671
my colleague tells me, the other day
in the city of Chivilcoy

373
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:08,672
in the streets Sabeiro and Esquiafino
city of Chivilcoy, there was a black car parked

374
00:41:08,673 --> 00:41:12,973
Peugeot, Capital licence plate

375
00:41:12,974 --> 00:41:22,674
and he checked the identification of the car

376
00:41:23,675 --> 00:41:27,675
you will never guess who
the owner was..tell me, who

377
00:41:31,176 --> 00:41:34,676
some Es..

378
00:41:51,677 --> 00:41:56,677
the federal police gave him your work
information

379
00:41:57,978 --> 00:42:04,678
judge calls me to clarify this point
but the truth is i can't

380
00:42:04,679 --> 00:42:09,679
so it looks like im not a judge,
but a big asshole

381
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,680
i say: do "a" and in here you do "z"

382
00:42:13,681 --> 00:42:17,681
like this fucking machine...

383
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:26,682
Dr, but.. i think that there's 
something strange about this

384
00:42:26,783 --> 00:42:31,683
-that's right, wait wait, dont go
here comes the best part

385
00:42:31,684 --> 00:42:37,684
Later you can treat me like an
asshole, but now, listen to me

386
00:42:37,685 --> 00:42:40,685
because what called the
attention in town

387
00:42:40,686 --> 00:42:43,986
it wasnt two guys looking
like they're from capital city, no

388
00:42:43,987 --> 00:42:49,987
or that one of them tied
his shoes, no

389
00:42:49,988 --> 00:42:56,788
what was curious was that, one of
them got inside a store

390
00:42:56,789 --> 00:43:01,789
greeted people very kindly
bought a whisky bottle

391
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:04,790
and went drinking it
on the sidewalk

392
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:07,791
need the description of the guy?

393
00:43:07,7
We've got to deny it, Benjamin. it wasn't me
i wasn't there, i don't know

394
00:43:12,793 --> 00:43:16,793
-don't talk to me, never again
-but we must deny it

395
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:21,794
-Doctor
-get out of my sight, please

396
00:43:21,795 --> 00:43:24,795
-are you going to be against us, too?

397
00:43:25,797 --> 00:43:28,897
Irene, im talking with you... Irene

398
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:32,898
-I dont know what is worse. the stupid thing
you did, or the fact it was behind my back

399
00:43:32,899 --> 00:43:36,199
-i thought that you...
-you think im useless here

400
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,200
-i never said that
-you dont have to, it's plain to see

401
00:43:39,201 --> 00:43:43,201
but you must know that I'm the boss and you're the employee

402
00:43:47,202 --> 00:43:52,202
12 letters, 31 thin papers
talks about 5 jobs,

403
00:43:52,203 --> 00:43:58,203
one in construction, other selling vegetables
3 places outside Buenos Aires

404
00:43:58,204 --> 00:44:01,204
Monte Grande, San justo
Avellaneda

405
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:07,205
6 names, Anido, Mesias
Oleniak, Manfredini, Babastro and Sanchez

406
00:44:07,806 --> 00:44:11,206
just one woman, some Rosa
i think it's an aunt

407
00:44:13,207 --> 00:44:16,407
nothing else, can't count more
the rest is useless

408
00:44:19,408 --> 00:44:21,408
-please

409
00:44:31,409 --> 00:44:35,409
leave it open, its nothing private
i was talking with Fortuna

410
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:39,410
i explained to him that you are stupid
i flashed him my most irresistible smile

411
00:44:39,411 --> 00:44:43,411
and i convinced him
to forget everything

412
00:44:44,812 --> 00:44:49,412
i really appreciate it, doctor
-i beg that from now on..

413
00:44:49,413 --> 00:44:52,413
you don't do this kind of thing anymore

414
00:44:52,414 --> 00:44:55,214
you can go.
-i have a doubt, if you'd allow me

415
00:44:55,215 --> 00:44:59,215
what is that irresistible smile?
I don't think I know it

416
00:44:59,716 --> 00:45:04,216
Why would you? I only use it on
my boyfriend. Just as it is should be

417
00:45:05,217 --> 00:45:09,217
-of course. okay, i don't want to
bother you

418
00:45:10,218 --> 00:45:13,218
-bring me the case of Colotto
and I'll close it

419
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:21,219
the subject is closed

420
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:33,220
Engagements. today kids make fun
of engagements

421
00:45:33,221 --> 00:45:35,221
who gets engaged anymore?

422
00:45:36,622 --> 00:45:39,222
this kid, what was his name?
-Godoy

423
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:43,223
Larreta brought him.
-it's true

424
00:45:43,224 --> 00:45:46,224
-but I'm so silly, i didn't
date them

425
00:45:47,225 --> 00:45:50,225
when could it be? some months
after Chivilcoy?

426
00:45:50,226 --> 00:45:52,226
-a week later. i remember
perfectly

427
00:45:54,227 --> 00:45:57,227
a week after our fight, you came with
that Alfonso from god knows where.

428
00:45:57,228 --> 00:46:00,228
ready to announce your engagement

429
00:46:02,229 --> 00:46:05,229
look here Sandoval, trying to
not look drunk

430
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:10,230
-Sandoval...poor

431
00:46:10,631 --> 00:46:14,231
-amazing, I see myself but I hardly recognise me, like it's someone else altogether

432
00:46:15,532 --> 00:46:19,232
-who were you? how were you?

433
00:46:20,233 --> 00:46:23,233
-I dont know, hard, conservative
-serious

434
00:46:24,234 --> 00:46:27,234
-structured
-inflexible

435
00:46:27,735 --> 00:46:31,235
-young..young, Benjamin
I was young

436
00:46:31,736 --> 00:46:35,236
you were also young. Look, all
your hair was black

437
00:46:36,237 --> 00:46:39,237
and here, looking from the sidelines
with a butt face

438
00:46:46,238 --> 00:46:49,238
i was somebody else

439
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:07,239
I'm sure the book'll be fine, but I don't want to get involved.

440
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:13,240
you might be at the end of your life
and want to look back

441
00:47:14,741 --> 00:47:17,641
but I can't

442
00:47:17,642 --> 00:47:22,542
i have to go to work everyday
to deal with this

443
00:47:22,543 --> 00:47:25,843
It might not be the perfect justice,
but its a justice of sorts

444
00:47:26,044 --> 00:47:31,844
at the end of day I must go back home
to live with my husband

445
00:47:31,845 --> 00:47:34,845
with my kids, that I love

446
00:47:37,846 --> 00:47:40,846
my life was always about looking forward

447
00:47:43,647 --> 00:47:46,847
backwards is not my jurisdiction

448
00:47:46,848 --> 00:47:49,348
I declare my self unable

449
00:47:56,349 --> 00:48:00,349
what a case, it just doesn't want to die

450
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:39,350
Morales

451
00:48:39,351 --> 00:48:41,351
-how are you?
-how you doing?

452
00:48:41,352 --> 00:48:44,352
-I'm Esposito
-sure, how are you?

453
00:48:44,353 --> 00:48:46,753
I'm okay, and you?
-well, here I am

454
00:48:47,754 --> 00:48:49,754
want to sit down?

455
00:48:55,355 --> 00:48:58,755
how are things?
-this month i come here Tuesdays and Thursdays

456
00:48:59,756 --> 00:49:03,756
-sorry?
-to the station, Tuesdays and Thursdays

457
00:49:03,757 --> 00:49:06,757
Mondays and Fridays I go to
Once and Sundays Constitucion

458
00:49:06,758 --> 00:49:09,758
anyway, i change it around every month

459
00:49:09,759 --> 00:49:12,759
he will come here some day

460
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:16,760
I'm sure that if he lives in the region around 
the Capital, he'll be caught

461
00:49:18,761 --> 00:49:24,761
I guess that even after a year
you haven't stopped working on him

462
00:49:24,762 --> 00:49:27,762
no, no, of course not

463
00:49:31,163 --> 00:49:34,763
you must think I'm stupid
-no

464
00:49:35,064 --> 00:49:38,764
-dont pay attention, really, dont
-no, please, it's not like that

465
00:49:42,765 --> 00:49:45,765
- the worst is that over time I'm starting to forget her

466
00:49:45,766 --> 00:49:49,766
i have to try hard to remember
the whole day, night and day

467
00:49:53,767 --> 00:49:56,767
the day he killed her, she made
tea with lemon for me

468
00:49:56,768 --> 00:50:01,868
she heard me coughing the whole night
she said it would be good for me

469
00:50:01,869 --> 00:50:05,869
All these silly memories come back to me now

470
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:10,870
then the doubts start

471
00:50:10,871 --> 00:50:14,871
i dont know if it was tea with lemon
or tea with honey

472
00:50:14,872 --> 00:50:18,872
and I'm not sure if i have a real memory
or the memory of a memory

473
00:50:33,073 --> 00:50:36,873
excuse me, i need to talk with you

474
00:50:37,074 --> 00:50:39,874
go ahead
-thanks

475
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:48,875
something happened yesterday
i was thinking all night long, couldn't sleep

476
00:50:49,176 --> 00:50:53,876
i was thinking about you
you know, when...

477
00:50:53,877 --> 00:50:58,877
when you see things from a
new perspective

478
00:50:58,878 --> 00:51:05,378
when you see somebody, and that
makes you see your own life in a different way

479
00:51:08,879 --> 00:51:10,779
-go on
-yes

480
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:16,780
and i said to myself
i have to talk with Irene

481
00:51:16,781 --> 00:51:20,781
she could send me to hell
sorry...she could get mad, but

482
00:51:22,782 --> 00:51:24,782
i must try

483
00:51:24,783 --> 00:51:27,783
-if you can wait, i'll close the door

484
00:51:32,784 --> 00:51:35,784
-sorry
-Sandoval, I'm busy now, when I'm free...

485
00:51:35,785 --> 00:51:40,785
-but he called me
-yes, I called him, to talk amongst the three of us

486
00:51:52,186 --> 00:51:56,786
yesterday i met with Morales at the
Station. You know what he was doing?

487
00:51:56,787 --> 00:52:00,787
-My crystal ball is broken

488
00:52:01,788 --> 00:52:05,788
-this guy goes everyday to stations in the hope of finding
the murderer, Dr

489
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:08,789
every single day, he leaves the bank
and goes to watch

490
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:12,790
-you dont know the capacity of this man's love

491
00:52:12,991 --> 00:52:15,791
it moves me

492
00:52:16,992 --> 00:52:21,792
It's as if this woman's death
froze him, in time, forever

493
00:52:24,793 --> 00:52:30,793
you must see those eyes
they are in a state of pure love

494
00:52:31,194 --> 00:52:34,794
can you imagine what love like that must be like?

495
00:52:34,795 --> 00:52:38,795
without being diluted by
everyday life

496
00:52:40,996 --> 00:52:44,796
-speak for yourself
it hasn't happened to me

497
00:52:46,797 --> 00:52:51,797
-we think this guy deserves a chance, Dr

498
00:52:54,098 --> 00:52:56,798
-and what's my role in all this?

499
00:52:56,799 --> 00:52:59,799
- the case is closed. We should reopen it

500
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,800
-you are proposing to me to destroy
an official document, with my signature 

501
00:53:03,801 --> 00:53:11,801
and the judge's on it. To make false declarations in order
to make it look as if it is still open?

502
00:53:11,802 --> 00:53:15,802
-That's a brilliant idea. i hadn't thought of that.
-Don't be an asshole

503
00:53:43,503 --> 00:53:45,603
everything okay, Doctor?

504
00:53:45,604 --> 00:53:49,604
-tell me, haven't you seen
some letters over there?

505
00:53:53,005 --> 00:53:55,605
Sandoval?
- I think he left for Talcahuano street

506
00:54:04,206 --> 00:54:07,106
So, now you don't only escape to drink,
you also steal evidence.

507
00:54:07,107 --> 00:54:10,107
-Everything's clear now, Benjamin
-if Irene wants to read the files..

508
00:54:10,108 --> 00:54:14,108
-hands off, damn it
are you crazy? Sit down

509
00:54:21,109 --> 00:54:24,109
do you know why we'll catch him, Benjamin?

510
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:28,110
because we are two assholes
look

511
00:54:30,311 --> 00:54:35,111
12 letters, 31 papers. 5 jobs
No, I've already read this to you

512
00:54:35,112 --> 00:54:39,112
-let's go
-no, I haven't finished this train of thought

513
00:54:39,113 --> 00:54:44,113
i asked myself, how is it possible
we can't find this guy?

514
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:48,114
he always disappears. Where is he?

515
00:54:49,115 --> 00:54:55,115
then I start thinking about guys
all guys, not just this one

516
00:54:55,116 --> 00:54:58,116
not specifically this one but...
-all guys, yes

517
00:54:58,117 --> 00:55:01,117
-right..the general guy

518
00:55:03,118 --> 00:55:09,118
A guy can do anything to change,
but there's one thing he can't change

519
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:12,119
not him, you, me, anyone

520
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:17,120
look at me.
Am I a young guy?

521
00:55:17,121 --> 00:55:20,121
I have a good job,
a woman who loves me

522
00:55:20,122 --> 00:55:24,122
and as you say, I keep on
screwing up my life in places like this

523
00:55:24,123 --> 00:55:28,123
several times you've asked me: why are you
here, Pablo? what are you doing?

524
00:55:28,124 --> 00:55:32,124
do you know why I'm here, Benjamin?

525
00:55:33,625 --> 00:55:36,625
because it's my passion

526
00:55:36,626 --> 00:55:43,626
I like coming here, geting drunk
fight if someone fucks with me. I like it

527
00:55:43,927 --> 00:55:48,527
with you it's the same, Benjamin

528
00:55:50,528 --> 00:55:54,528
you can't get this Irene out
of your head

529
00:55:54,529 --> 00:56:00,729
she really wants to get married. She's
probably got more than 37 catalogues

530
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:03,730
for weddings dresses in her desk

531
00:56:03,731 --> 00:56:07,731
she has an engagement
with a huge party, but you...

532
00:56:07,732 --> 00:56:11,032
you are still waiting for the miracle, Benjamin

533
00:56:11,033 --> 00:56:13,033
why?

534
00:56:13,034 --> 00:56:15,034
come

535
00:56:15,035 --> 00:56:18,035
how are you, Notary?
-how're you doing?

536
00:56:18,036 --> 00:56:23,536
this is my friend Esposito, Notary Andretta.
A real notary, my advisor

537
00:56:23,537 --> 00:56:28,537
let's check the first letter
of our friend Gomez, never mind the card

538
00:56:29,638 --> 00:56:35,038
"I swear, that with the rain I finished
worse than Oleniak".. please

539
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:40,039
Juan Carlos Oleniak, he began
as a racing driver in 1960

540
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:43,040
in '61 he went to Argentinos Jrs, in '63
he came back to Racing

541
00:56:43,041 --> 00:56:48,641
in a classic with San Lorenzo, they
sent him right into a pit, he was all wet

542
00:56:51,642 --> 00:56:54,642
something serious, we call him Plato,
because he lives for the Academy

543
00:56:54,943 --> 00:57:00,643
"im going to bring you here, Mum. We'll be
like Anido, but Anido with Mesias" .. Notary?

544
00:57:00,644 --> 00:57:05,644
Anido and Mesias. Racing
champions from 1961

545
00:57:05,645 --> 00:57:11,645
Blanco, Piani and Corbata,
Pisutti...Mansilla, Sosa and Belen

546
00:57:11,746 --> 00:57:16,646
"stay calm, Mum, about this, I'm like
Manfredini, not like Babastro"

547
00:57:17,647 --> 00:57:22,647
Pedro Valdemar Manfredini
he was bought by Mendoza for 2 pesos

548
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:26,648
he was an exceptional player
for his times

549
00:57:26,649 --> 00:57:31,649
Babastro, striker. he played a few
matches between '62 and '63

550
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:34,050
he never scored

551
00:57:34,051 --> 00:57:37,051
It says: "I dont want to end like Sanchez"
what does it mean?

552
00:57:37,052 --> 00:57:41,052
no, he must be talking about the goalkeeper
Atahulfo Sanchez

553
00:57:41,053 --> 00:57:44,053
eternal Number Two of Great Negri

554
00:57:44,054 --> 00:57:48,054
he played a few games between
'57 and '61

555
00:57:48,055 --> 00:57:53,755
Notary, what is the Racing Club for you?
-it's a passion, my friend

556
00:57:54,056 --> 00:57:58,756
even when they haven't won in 9 years?
-no, a passion is a passion

557
00:57:58,757 --> 00:58:04,757
-Can't you see, Benjamin? this guy can change
everything: face, house, family...

558
00:58:04,758 --> 00:58:07,758
..girlfriend, religion, God...

559
00:58:08,759 --> 00:58:13,759
but there s something he can't change
he can't change his passion

560
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:24,760
**It's a beautiful night for playing football...
Huracan host to Racing Club of Avellaneda...**

561
00:58:26,761 --> 00:58:34,361
**Racing is not doing well at the tournament...
wants revenge against the "Balloons" of Patricios Park....

562
00:59:03,362 --> 00:59:09,362
**its the Academy, the Academy, the Academy...**

563
00:59:32,363 --> 00:59:36,363
this is madness, crazy...
-because you don't understand about football...

564
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:41,364
you just must be patient, just that...
-no way...I mean there are too many people, it's impossible

565
00:59:41,365 --> 00:59:45,365
-he is there, he is there
-where?

566
00:59:46,366 --> 00:59:48,366
tell me where

567
01:00:13,367 --> 01:00:16,367
let's go
-what's your problem?

568
01:00:18,468 --> 01:00:21,368
We've been here a month, 4 matches

569
01:00:55,469 --> 01:00:58,369
motherfuck.... Gomez!

570
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:01,870
come here! you fag!

571
01:01:11,871 --> 01:01:13,871
hurry up, Benjamin

572
01:01:13,872 --> 01:01:15,872
i had him, he ran away!

573
01:01:15,873 --> 01:01:20,873
where is Baez? Baez! he came running.
didn't you see him?

574
01:01:20,874 --> 01:01:23,874
-What's he look like?
-What's he look like? Didn't you see the pictures?

575
01:01:23,875 --> 01:01:26,875
-yes, but what's he like? tall, short?
-middle tall, thin...what are you doing?

576
01:01:28,876 --> 01:01:32,876
I don't know these things, Benjamin
this asshole asks what's he like

577
01:01:32,877 --> 01:01:35,877
he should be up there, not us
-he doesn't know him. We do

578
01:01:37,278 --> 01:01:40,878
-"damn animal!"

579
01:01:52,879 --> 01:01:54,879
motherfucker, son of the bitch, damn faggot!!

580
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:04,880
get out!
-fuck off, son of a bitch mother!

581
01:02:07,081 --> 01:02:09,881
-get out, asshole. the police is here
-what police, fuck off

582
01:03:21,082 --> 01:03:23,982
-I'm sorry. how is it?
-I'm waiting for Sandoval

583
01:03:23,983 --> 01:03:27,983
-what for?
-I play the good guy..its a routine...

584
01:03:29,984 --> 01:03:33,984
-older than suckers. Can you question
him without the judge?

585
01:03:33,985 --> 01:03:36,985
-of course. We must finish it all up before
Fortune arrives. He would just screw everything up.

586
01:03:36,986 --> 01:03:39,986
are you trying to question a man
without a lawyer or judge?

587
01:03:39,987 --> 01:03:43,187
Ordoez, have you seen Sandoval?
-He left a moment ago

588
01:03:43,188 --> 01:03:45,188
-God damn it
-listen, it would be not valid anyway

589
01:03:45,189 --> 01:03:48,189
what charges would you apply?
-What? you think it's enough?

590
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:51,190
-to stare at him in a picture?

591
01:03:51,191 --> 01:03:54,491
-that's why i want to work on him.
To break him. -and if he's not the one?

592
01:03:54,492 --> 01:03:57,492
Don't look at me like that.
If he's not the one?

593
01:03:57,493 --> 01:04:01,493
-How could he not be?
Don't try and sell me on it, Doctor. Go find Sandoval

594
01:04:01,494 --> 01:04:05,494
-Should I go in a taxi?
-yes, no.. he's must be in Robertino

595
01:04:06,495 --> 01:04:09,495
-no, dont go please. no
-wait, wait

596
01:04:09,496 --> 01:04:13,496
-but what are you doing?
-im sorry... it's him

597
01:04:13,697 --> 01:04:16,997
-how do you know?
-don't know

598
01:04:16,998 --> 01:04:19,998
-see?
-no, I dont know how, but I know

599
01:04:19,999 --> 01:04:21,999
-How?

600
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000

605
01:04:53,905 --> 01:04:58,105
-I dont use the train
I come by bus 96

606
01:05:02,806 --> 01:05:06,106
What's wrong?

607
01:05:08,107 --> 01:05:12,107
-Mo..co..re...

608
01:05:13,608 --> 01:05:15,908
this machine doesn't work

609
01:05:16,109 --> 01:05:19,009
the "a" is missing

610
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:25,310
-wait, wait... tell me
what's going on, please

611
01:05:26,711 --> 01:05:29,711
please, i beg you

612
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:36,712
you are accused in the case of
Liliana Colotto Morales

613
01:05:36,713 --> 01:05:37:00
on the date of june 21st, 1974

614
01:05:41,714 --> 01:05:45,714
concretely, you are accused
of the act. I will make the interrogation

615
01:05:46,015 --> 01:05:49,715
you will have a lawyer

616
01:05:51,016 --> 01:05:56,716
-Liliana Colotto, she's an acquaintance
from Chivilcoy

617
01:05:57,217 --> 01:05:59,717
what happened?

618
01:06:02,018 --> 01:06:06,218
-tell me, Gomez. why you think
you've been here for three days?

619
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:09,219
-no idea, i went to see the Racing
-yeah, I know

620
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:10,220
when we wanted to catch you
you ran away

621
01:06:10,221 --> 01:06:14,221
-what would you do? with 2 guys
with mad faces...

622
01:06:14,222 --> 01:06:17,222
what happened with Liliana?
-look, Gomez, dont play games

623
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:20,223
you know as I do, that
you raped and murdered that girl

624
01:06:20,224 --> 01:06:25,224
-what? are you serious? how could
i do such a thing..to her?

625
01:06:25,225 --> 01:06:28,225
its been more than a year since I've last been
to Chivilcoy, I can prove it.

626
01:06:28,226 --> 01:06:32,226
-i went to find you a week after the crime, but
you fled, from home and work

627
01:06:32,327 --> 01:06:36,227
-from where?, I didn't leave anywhere.
-Gomez, dont pretend to be stupid!

628
01:06:36,228 --> 01:06:43,228
from Piedras street.
-that's a year ago. I left 'cause it was too expensive

629
01:06:43,229 --> 01:06:47,229
-and work?
-i found a better job

630
01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:52,230
what's your relationship with Liliana?
she's a girl i've known since childhood

631
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:14,231
-they cant find Sandoval

632
01:07:20,232 --> 01:07:24,232
..why dont you wait for the Dr?

633
01:07:28,233 --> 01:07:31,233
-ok, it could be, it could be

634
01:07:49,234 --> 01:07:58,234
look, Gomez. The case judge is
about to arrive, we'll wait

635
01:08:00,235 --> 01:08:06,235
Im sorry to get into this officially..Doctor
I know this is your case...

636
01:08:06,736 --> 01:08:12,236
but this boy couldn't have been the one

637
01:08:15,237 --> 01:08:18,737
-we can talk outside, ok?
-wait, wait. its just a minute

638
01:08:18,738 --> 01:08:23,738
Have you looked at him closely?
he couldn't've been

639
01:08:26,439 --> 01:08:29,739
let me see the autopsy

640
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:36,240
this girl Colotto.. here it is
1,70m 58kg

641
01:08:36,441 --> 01:08:41,241
look how she ended up

642
01:08:41,442 --> 01:08:44,242
im sorry, Gomez
but its not likely, officially

643
01:08:44,243 --> 01:08:46,743
the amazon and the dwarf

644
01:08:50,744 --> 01:08:57,744
besides, she was beautiful
i'm asking you to look at this face

645
01:08:59,345 --> 01:09:03,745
a beauty like this is not in everybody's league

646
01:09:03,846 --> 01:09:07,746
must be a very special man to have a
woman like that

647
01:09:08,647 --> 01:09:12,747
-do you think so, doctor?
i mean..

648
01:09:13,148 --> 01:09:16,448
the door wasn't broken

649
01:09:16,449 --> 01:09:20,449
it means she knew
the attacker

650
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:26,450
-yes, but don't tell me that such a woman
would remember this kid

651
01:09:27,051 --> 01:09:31,951
unless she was a prostitute
with some, and he was paying

652
01:09:31,952 --> 01:09:33,952
-who is this person?

653
01:09:33,953 --> 01:09:36,053
-shut your ass

654
01:09:39,054 --> 01:09:42,054
no, the girl was decent

655
01:09:42,455 --> 01:09:45,655
-hmm, on this i agree with the kid

656
01:09:45,656 --> 01:09:48,656
for me, the guy from the bank was
really cheated

657
01:09:49,057 --> 01:09:53,657
He must have had one of those convertible cars,
so horns could be out

658
01:09:53,658 --> 01:09:56,658
what are you laughing about, stupid?

659
01:09:56,659 --> 01:10:00,659
the guy who already gave his witness statement
that one...

660
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:04,660
that it was a tall big-backed guy

661
01:10:04,661 --> 01:10:09,661
a man able to make a woman hot

662
01:10:09,862 --> 01:10:14,662
look at this thing
surely when she saw you she thought

663
01:10:15,663 --> 01:10:21,663
this asshole again, with his stupid looks,
saying "i love you", "i adore you"

664
01:10:25,664 --> 01:10:27,664
yes or no?

665
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:39,665
take him out, please...
leave...

666
01:10:40,666 --> 01:10:43,666
-i caught you, you son of the bitch

667
01:11:07,367 --> 01:11:10,667
you are all crazy

668
01:11:15,968 --> 01:11:21,668
listen Benjamin...the destruction of the
right skull bone

669
01:11:21,669 --> 01:11:26,669
shows an attacker with great upper body strength

670
01:11:27,170 --> 01:11:32,670
look at this..
two strips of spaghetti.

671
01:11:34,771 --> 01:11:38,871
and so, the depth of injuries
in the vagina

672
01:11:39,072 --> 01:11:42,972
allow us to know, this man was
extremely well-hung

673
01:11:42,973 --> 01:11:47,973
of course, nothing like this insect, who
must have tiny roasted peanuts for balls.

674
01:12:03,174 --> 01:12:07,074
here you are, pussy bitch
do you like it?

675
01:12:20,075 --> 01:12:26,875
my love...don't try to catch this one here.
you are too small. Not enough man for me

676
01:12:27,476 --> 01:12:30,076
not enough...bitch!

677
01:12:30,077 --> 01:12:34,077
you know how i fucked her? uh?
you know how?

678
01:12:38,078 --> 01:12:41,078
don't touch her!
-let him go

679
01:12:44,079 --> 01:12:47,079
you touch her, and I'll kill you
I'll kill you

680
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,280
you are Esposito?

681
01:13:44,981 --> 01:13:49,281
you are Esposito or you are not Esposito?

682
01:14:00,282 --> 01:14:03,282
-hello?
-hello, it's me..did I wake you up?

683
01:14:03,283 --> 01:14:08,283
-no, I was working, writing a bit.
Strange, you being awake at this hour

684
01:14:08,284 --> 01:14:11,284
-i was thinking
-no way, really?

685
01:14:11,485 --> 01:14:17,285
-yes, silly, yes. its about the book
when you finish it, i want to read it

686
01:14:19,286 --> 01:14:22,286
ah, of course, yes.
i would love you to

687
01:14:22,287 --> 01:14:28,287
really you want to talk or something?
-no, I'll drink my tea and got back to sleep 

688
01:14:35,288 --> 01:14:39,288
**this morning, the president of the nation
Maria Estela Martinez Peron...***

689
01:14:39,289 --> 01:14:43,289
-Irene, it was the dressmaker
look, with the cape as we wanted

690
01:15:20,290 --> 01:15:25,290
-hello?... Morales...
how are you?

691
01:15:27,291 --> 01:15:30,291
..yes, i was watching, mute...

692
01:15:30,392 --> 01:15:33,292
..what?...

693
01:15:59,293 --> 01:16:03,293
good morning, I'm Doctor Menendez Hasting
from Judge number 42

694
01:16:03,294 --> 01:16:06,294
we came to see Mr Romano, please
-at this time he's in a meeting 

695
01:16:06,295 --> 01:16:08,795
sir! sir!

696
01:16:15,796 --> 01:16:18,796
what are you doing in here?
are you crazy?

697
01:16:18,897 --> 01:16:22,797
-no, you are crazy
-Doctor

698
01:16:22,798 --> 01:16:25,898
-we must talk to you
-boys, can you leave us, please?

699
01:16:29,999 --> 01:16:33,899
if you would've told me in advance
i would have got some good coffee prepared

700
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:37,900
Isidoro Gomez, rape followed by murder,
imprisoned by the judge

701
01:16:37,901 --> 01:16:41,901
The service informs us now that he was
set free by order of executive power

702
01:16:41,902 --> 01:16:44,902
we searched and here we are.
something to say?

703
01:16:44,903 --> 01:16:47,903
-yes, of course. you must
get out a bit more

704
01:16:47,904 --> 01:16:50,004
justice is an island in the world
but this one...

705
01:16:50,005 --> 01:16:53,005
this is the world. and meanwhile
you kill birds..

706
01:16:53,106 --> 01:16:57,406
we are here, fighting in the
middle of the jungle. Got it?

707
01:16:57,507 --> 01:17:03,407
Gomez, Gomez.. yes. He
started with us while he was in jail

708
01:17:03,408 --> 01:17:06,508
he brought information by
spying on young communists

709
01:17:06,609 --> 01:17:10,709
he did a great job, we start
to like him, why? What's the problem?

710
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:13,710
-do you understand what
you're saying?

711
01:17:13,711 --> 01:17:17,711
he is a murderer, convicted and self-confessed
-maybe, but he is also 

712
01:17:17,712 --> 01:17:22,712
an intelligent, courageous person intelligent,
capable of getting inside a house and doing what needs to be done

713
01:17:22,813 --> 01:17:27,713
With all the communists everywhere, i really don't care about his personal life

714
01:17:27,814 --> 01:17:31,714
if we only work with good people...

715
01:17:31,915 --> 01:17:36,715
He's a prisoner, processed by order
of Dr Fortuna...

716
01:17:36,716 --> 01:17:42,716
-you think i dont know you released him just
to screw with me? you think I'm an asshole?

717
01:17:42,717 --> 01:17:46,817
those are 2 questions
wich one do you want me to answer first?

718
01:17:47,018 --> 01:17:49,818
is this true?
-Doctor...

719
01:17:50,419 --> 01:17:55,819
lets see, please. Dont get involved in this.
what do you want to do?

720
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:58,420
Make some demand? Don't get offended
but you're not capable of doing anything 

721
01:17:58,521 --> 01:18:02,421
What you can do, is go back to your office
stay quiet and learn

722
01:18:02,522 --> 01:18:06,422
the new Argentina is not taught at Harvard

723
01:18:06,523 --> 01:18:12,423
and you, why you did you come with the Doctor?
You think she can protect you?

724
01:18:12,524 --> 01:18:16,424
Why dont you leave her alone.
She has nothing to do with you

725
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:20,425
she's a lawyer, you're a trade expert,
she's young, you're old

726
01:18:20,626 --> 01:18:23,426
she's rich, you are poor

727
01:18:23,527 --> 01:18:27,727
she's Menendez Hasting, you're Esposito
meaning nothing

728
01:18:27,828 --> 01:18:30,828
she's untouchable
you are not

729
01:18:30,929 --> 01:18:34,029
let her go back to her world
don't be a bad man

730
01:18:34,130 --> 01:18:39,030
now, if you have a problem with me
come alone, and we'll fix it

731
01:18:44,032 --> 01:18:46,232
-let's go Irene

732
01:18:51,733 --> 01:18:54,633
there's one thing you do both have in common

733
01:18:54,734 --> 01:18:58,634
Neither of you can do a thing

734
01:20:18,335 --> 01:20:22,735
you told me life in prison
-well, yes

735
01:20:22,836 --> 01:20:24,936
he should have got life in prison

736
01:20:25,037 --> 01:20:28,137
so what happened?

737
01:20:28,238 --> 01:20:32,138
-what can i say? these people
stuff justice up their asses

738
01:20:32,439 --> 01:20:36,139
Where he is right now, we can't even get close to him

739
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:46,140
-and if we could...what then?
what would be achieved by shooting him four times?

740
01:20:46,241 --> 01:20:51,241
I'd go to jail for the rest of my life, and Gomez would be free of
everything before he even hits the floor

741
01:20:51,342 --> 01:20:55,742
And I'd rot in prison, envying him.

742
01:20:55,843 --> 01:21:03,743
no, for me, life imprisonment would be fine.

743
01:21:03,944 --> 01:21:10,744
-truth is, i would like to help you
but i don't know how

744
01:21:14,745 --> 01:21:18,745
-who knows..at some other time

745
01:21:23,746 --> 01:21:26,746
please, allow me to treat you
-no, no

746
01:21:26,847 --> 01:21:29,747
-it's just a coffee

747
01:21:32,948 --> 01:21:36,748
i really want to thank you, Benjamin
for everything you've done

748
01:21:36,849 --> 01:21:40,749
without you, I really wouldn't've got this far...

749
01:21:40,850 --> 01:21:42,850
i owe you one

750
01:22:11,051 --> 01:22:13,751
-Dr Esposito. they are looking for you, for the...

751
01:22:13,852 --> 01:22:16,752
-I'm not a doctor, how many times do I have to say it?

752
01:22:16,853 --> 01:22:20,453
If you call me Doctor in front of the judge
I'll look like an idiot

753
01:22:20,654 --> 01:22:22,754
what happened with the file
You finished it?

754
01:22:22,755 --> 01:22:25,755
-i'm doing it now.
-no, you are not. you are here. you should be there...

755
01:22:37,756 --> 01:22:40,756
How long will it be before you talk to me?

756
01:22:40,857 --> 01:22:43,757
-i talk to you everyday

757
01:22:45,058 --> 01:22:49,058
I'm not untouchable, nor from 
another world

758
01:22:49,159 --> 01:22:53,859
-I wish you weren't, but that's the way it is.
Irene, let's forget it

759
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:55,860
-forget what?

760
01:22:55,961 --> 01:22:59,861
-you'll marry the engineer 
Zapiola Urtubey Martinez....

761
01:23:03,462 --> 01:23:05,562
-you're not jealous, are you?

762
01:23:06,763 --> 01:23:09,563
-no, God
be happy and live long

763
01:23:09,664 --> 01:23:12,564
-What's your beef?
come on, spit it out.

764
01:23:14,565 --> 01:23:17,665
-Irene... please

765
01:23:17,966 --> 01:23:20,666
-what are you watching?
leave

766
01:23:23,667 --> 01:23:25,367
-where shall we meet?

767
01:23:25,468 --> 01:23:27,368
-what for?

768
01:23:27,969 --> 01:23:32,369
-So you can air all your objections to my life,
marriage, and everything else in bed

769
01:23:36,370 --> 01:23:39,370
we can share a coffee when we leave

770
01:23:39,471 --> 01:23:42,371
-time?

771
01:23:42,472 --> 01:23:44,372
8:30, place?

772
01:23:44,473 --> 01:23:48,373
-the immortals
-the Richmond

773
01:23:48,374 --> 01:23:50,874
-I'm sorry, I can't think of anywhere more sophisticated

774
01:23:53,975 --> 01:23:55,875
-no, Benjamin, somewhere farther away.

775
01:23:59,876 --> 01:24:01,776
what are you doing there watching us?


776
01:24:02,277 --> 01:24:03,777
-sorry, you got a phone call
from the Mala Yunta bar

777
01:24:03,778 --> 01:24:08,778
Pablo Sandoval...
you big motherfucker!

778
01:24:08,779 --> 01:24:10,779
-wash your ass...fag!

779
01:24:10,780 --> 01:24:14,780
-no, no..Benjamin..i told them
i didn't want them to call you

780
01:24:15,081 --> 01:24:20,781
-i told them..don't bother my friend
this is between us

781
01:24:21,082 --> 01:24:23,782
-what kind of a man are you??
fucking drunk

782
01:24:26,583 --> 01:24:30,683
-it's a nazi, fascist..nazi

783
01:24:31,684 --> 01:24:33,784
-official, I'm from judge house 42
i'll take care of him

784
01:24:34,785 --> 01:24:37,785
-come, come
-he should be in jail

785
01:24:37,986 --> 01:24:40,786
fuckers, you'll know what justice really means

786
01:24:40,887 --> 01:24:43,787
-coat, my coat
-you have it on you

787
01:24:56,788 --> 01:24:59,788
-what time is your wife back at home?

788
01:24:59,989 --> 01:25:02,989
-at 8
-strange, she's not picking up

789
01:25:03,790 --> 01:25:07,990
-my mouth is...dry..
do you have something...for...

790
01:25:09,991 --> 01:25:12,491
-she's not answering, che
leave that

791
01:25:13,092 --> 01:25:16,192
-she won't answer
-why?

792
01:25:16,193 --> 01:25:19,193
-because the phone's not working
-why not? leave that

793
01:25:19,294 --> 01:25:23,394
-i told you a thousand times, Benjamin
i wanted to make a complaint

794
01:25:23,595 --> 01:25:27,395
and you sent me to hell

795
01:25:27,496 --> 01:25:31,396
-that was 6 months ago
-the phone's not been working for a year

796
01:25:31,497 --> 01:25:35,497
fuckers never fixed it
-what a mess, you can't stay here today

797
01:25:35,598 --> 01:25:38,498
leave that. don't touch it

798
01:25:38,599 --> 01:25:43,899
-if you ever call me, you would know that
-stop touching, what are you looking for?

799
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:47,900
-i wanted to make a complaint

800
01:25:48,901 --> 01:25:51,901
look at me..
you have a chick?

801
01:25:51,902 --> 01:25:54,902
-no, no..what chick
-you have a chick

802
01:25:55,003 --> 01:25:58,903
and I'm leaving.. I dont want you to say:
Sandoval screwed me

803
01:25:58,904 --> 01:26:01,904
god damn it, how many sofas do you have here?

804
01:26:02,005 --> 01:26:04,905
-come, stay calm, come
-i fucking hit myself

805
01:26:05,006 --> 01:26:07,406
-that's why, relax here
until you're sober

806
01:26:10,307 --> 01:26:12,207
-what time is it?
-There's a clock in the bedroom

807
01:26:12,308 --> 01:26:15,208
-what bedroom? you are
in my house

808
01:26:15,609 --> 01:26:19,209
-yes, we are cool
we are cool

809
01:26:20,910 --> 01:26:25,210
-im going to your house to convince
your wife not to kill you. Be right back

810
01:26:25,311 --> 01:26:27,211
-call her by phone

811
01:26:27,212 --> 01:26:29,812
-didn't you tell me its not working?

812
01:26:31,913 --> 01:26:35,613
-mine doesnt work
but you can use yours

813
01:26:39,614 --> 01:26:44,614
you stay here, calm
dont touch anything

814
01:26:44,715 --> 01:26:46,215
wait for me, I'll be right back

815
01:26:46,616 --> 01:26:49,416
-turn off the lights
-yes

816
01:26:50,417 --> 01:26:53,417
-we are going to catch
this motherfucker

817
01:26:59,418 --> 01:27:02,418
we were working the whole day
-leave it, that's enough

818
01:27:02,519 --> 01:27:06,419
-give me the chance of explain
-ok, but its the last one you get

819
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:13,420
-truth is you could have also remembered
-show a little pateience, he needs help

820
01:27:13,521 --> 01:27:16,821
-Does he?
-i know, what i meant is 

821
01:27:16,822 --> 01:27:18,922
if we help him, we help
 all of us

822
01:27:18,923 --> 01:27:21,923
-you dont want him to bother you
-dont tell me that

823
01:27:24,924 --> 01:27:26,624
what's this?


824
01:27:26,625 --> 01:27:28,625
what happened?
-wait, wait

825
01:27:35,626 --> 01:27:37,826
-what happened?
-don't know

826
01:27:37,927 --> 01:27:39,827
-dont scare me
-wait a bit

827
01:27:47,828 --> 01:27:49,828
what, what happened?

828
01:28:13,829 --> 01:28:17,829
this is crazy, crazy
-crazy would be that i can find that one

829
01:28:17,930 --> 01:28:21,830
-you? you are going after him?
-i told my father, he knows

830
01:28:21,931 --> 01:28:23,931
this guy works for Romano
and Romano will not mess with me

831
01:28:23,932 --> 01:28:27,932
-but Jujuy?
-my cousins are powerful there

832
01:28:28,033 --> 01:28:30,933
they won't not dare touch you
there, don't worry

833
01:28:31,034 --> 01:28:33,134
-but what am I going to do
in Jujuy?

834
01:28:33,135 --> 01:28:35,635
-the same you're doing here, signatures
stamps, you have everything ready there

835
01:28:35,636 --> 01:28:38,636
-no, no Irene
i can't, i can't

836
01:28:38,737 --> 01:28:41,637
i have my life here
i have my dad, i have...

837
01:28:46,638 --> 01:28:48,638
i have everything

838
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:53,639
-what are we going to do?
here...

839
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:57,640
we..

840
01:28:59,641 --> 01:29:01,641
i mean, you and me

841
01:29:10,642 --> 01:29:13,642
we can't do anything

842
01:31:26,043 --> 01:31:28,643
it's a first draft

843
01:31:31,644 --> 01:31:33,644
I'll make more

844
01:31:36,945 --> 01:31:39,645
your house it's just as I imagined

845
01:31:39,646 --> 01:31:41,746
-really? Like how?
-how do you think?

846
01:31:41,847 --> 01:31:44,847
just like
just like I imagined

847
01:31:44,948 --> 01:31:48,848
-right. but I
I thought your house would be different

848
01:31:48,949 --> 01:31:51,949
-you know my house?
-no, different to this one, I mean

849
01:31:56,950 --> 01:31:59,950
-what are you afraid of
Benjamin?

850
01:32:00,951 --> 01:32:03,951
There's a piece of paper here that says
"i'm afraid". What are you afraid of?

851
01:32:08,952 --> 01:32:12,952
no, no, that was just an exercise I did
to open my imagination. Don't pay any attention to it

852
01:32:13,153 --> 01:32:15,953
ok, so...tell me

853
01:32:18,554 --> 01:32:20,954
-well, it's a book, right?

854
01:32:21,655 --> 01:32:24,955
a book doesn't need to
be true

855
01:32:24,956 --> 01:32:26,356
not even realistic
-yes

856
01:32:26,357 --> 01:32:29,357
no, no..what's not realistic?

857
01:32:31,358 --> 01:32:35,358
-Benjamin, that part when...the
guy goes to Jujuy

858
01:32:35,459 --> 01:32:39,359
The guy's crying is despair

859
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:42,360
and she's running along the platform
as if she's losing the love of her life

860
01:32:42,461 --> 01:32:46,361
touching their hands through the glass
as if they were a single person

861
01:32:46,462 --> 01:32:51,862
she's crying, as if she knew she
would be fated to suffer a fake love

862
01:32:51,863 --> 01:32:56,863
almost falling on the track, because
she never dared to show her love

863
01:32:56,964 --> 01:32:59,464
-yes..it was like that, no?

864
01:33:03,365 --> 01:33:06,465
if it was..

865
01:33:08,766 --> 01:33:11,466
why didn't you take me with you?

866
01:33:23,067 --> 01:33:25,067
silly

867
01:33:42,068 --> 01:33:44,468
And how does the story continue?

868
01:33:45,069 --> 01:33:48,469
-i dont know, if you want
i can write that the guy...

869
01:33:49,070 --> 01:33:52,470
was counting guanacos in the desert
for years

870
01:33:52,571 --> 01:33:55,471
when i came back, i found you
were a prosecutor

871
01:33:55,472 --> 01:33:58,472
married, with two kids.
Want me to write that?

872
01:33:58,673 --> 01:34:02,473
-yes, or that he came back married
to a pretty Jujuy girl

873
01:34:02,574 --> 01:34:06,474
aristocratic
-she was a wonderful girl

874
01:34:06,475 --> 01:34:09,475
it wasn't her fault if
i wasnt able to love her

875
01:34:12,976 --> 01:34:17,476
-what a disgusting ending, this book
-fucking ending

876
01:34:19,077 --> 01:34:23,477
i don't want to leave everything again
How can I?

877
01:34:23,478 --> 01:34:26,078
how is it possible I don't do anything?

878
01:34:26,079 --> 01:34:29,079
I've been asking myself that for twenty-five years,
and for twenty-five years I've thought-

879
01:34:29,180 --> 01:34:33,380
leave it, it was another life
stop it, don't ask, don't think about it

880
01:34:33,881 --> 01:34:36,681
it wasn't other life
it was this one

881
01:34:37,082 --> 01:34:39,382
it is this one

882
01:34:39,683 --> 01:34:43,383
now i want to understand
how we do it, living an empty life?

883
01:34:43,784 --> 01:34:46,584
how do we live a life
filled with nothing

884
01:34:46,785 --> 01:34:48,685
how do we it?

885
01:34:54,686 --> 01:34:57,686
-no, it's impossible
a waste of time

886
01:34:57,687 --> 01:35:00,687
-you just do it
-change of address? I've had the same adress since

887
01:35:00,688 --> 01:35:02,688
I danced Pata pata
...sorry

888
01:35:03,889 --> 01:35:07,689
Gomez Isidoro, Espora 691
Chivilcoy

889
01:35:07,690 --> 01:35:10,690
-just what i said. his mother's place

890
01:35:13,691 --> 01:35:16,691
-look, Sir. Registering a change of address 
is a requirement, whether you like it or not

891
01:35:16,892 --> 01:35:19,692
got it?
-yes, now i do

Morales Ricardo.. we have 4

893
01:35:22,694 --> 01:35:24,794
-lets search by ID number
what's yours?

894
01:35:24,795 --> 01:35:27,895
-3 million, you?
-200 million, none of your business

895
01:35:28,096 --> 01:35:34,896
we have one 5 and other of 6
here, Morales Ricardo Agustin

896
01:35:34,997 --> 01:35:37,897
he changed his address
in 1975

897
01:35:37,998 --> 01:35:40,198
write it down..
pata pata

898
01:36:57,199 --> 01:36:59,499
who are you looking for?

899
01:36:59,900 --> 01:37:02,300
Morales

900
01:37:02,401 --> 01:37:05,401
how are you?
remember me?

901
01:37:05,402 --> 01:37:09,402
Esposito, from the judge's house
like 25 years ago

902
01:37:14,403 --> 01:37:17,403
what a surprise
-yes, right?

903
01:37:26,004 --> 01:37:28,404
how are you?
-how do you do?

904
01:37:30,905 --> 01:37:33,405
it's been so long

905
01:37:34,006 --> 01:37:38,406
what a big surprise
-yes

906
01:37:42,407 --> 01:37:45,407
come, get it

907
01:37:46,608 --> 01:37:52,408
Can I get you a coffee?
-coffee, of course. you don't drink mate here?

908
01:37:52,509 --> 01:37:56,409
-Here? I'm at the bank all day. 

909
01:37:56,510 --> 01:38:00,410
-ah..you're still at the bank
I'll take one coffee

910
01:38:04,411 --> 01:38:09,411
you came right away
-well, yes

911
01:38:09,412 --> 01:38:12,412
i wanted to start over
to leave everything in the past

912
01:38:12,613 --> 01:38:15,413
that's a good thing about the
national bank...

913
01:38:15,514 --> 01:38:20,414
it has branches everywhere.
there's always one that nobody wants

914
01:38:20,415 --> 01:38:23,415
so here i am
I was even promoted, you know

915
01:38:32,116 --> 01:38:34,416
do you remember Liliana?

916
01:38:34,917 --> 01:38:37,617
-yes, of course

917
01:38:42,618 --> 01:38:45,618
and you, how are things with you?

918
01:38:45,919 --> 01:38:48,619
-me, here i am

919
01:38:49,620 --> 01:38:52,620
-i mean, alone?
are you married?

920
01:38:53,621 --> 01:38:57,521
-no..not in fact
i think that for me

921
01:38:57,622 --> 01:39:01,522
at this point life is over

922
01:39:02,923 --> 01:39:07,523
no..i tried, but you know...
it's complicated


923
01:39:08,124 --> 01:39:10,724
i got married
-no way

924
01:39:11,125 --> 01:39:15,025
yes, for a while
but it didn't work

925
01:39:15,326 --> 01:39:18,026
don't know, maybe it was me

926
01:39:18,327 --> 01:39:23,027
it's complicated
-it's complicated

927
01:39:29,428 --> 01:39:33,428
-look at all this work
I can't believe it

928
01:39:33,729 --> 01:39:35,729
i want to be a great writer

929
01:39:36,330 --> 01:39:39,730
yes, but you must work more on it.
It looks like a long memorandum

930
01:39:39,731 --> 01:39:42,831
it's crazy
-it's because I always remembered it

931
01:39:43,932 --> 01:39:48,832
bad done. You really should forget it

932
01:39:51,833 --> 01:39:54,833
you came here because of Gomez, right?

933
01:39:54,934 --> 01:39:57,534
-why because of Gomez?

934
01:39:57,535 --> 01:40:00,535
If the guy was free, he could come after you

935
01:40:01,536 --> 01:40:05,136
no, im not afraid of Gomez

936
01:40:05,337 --> 01:40:09,737
-he might even be dead
-yes, he might be

937
01:40:18,038 --> 01:40:21,738
they came for me, too
-yes, i know

938
01:40:22,839 --> 01:40:27,839
-how do you know?
-i have just read it, they found your friend

939
01:40:28,140 --> 01:40:31,840
Sandoval, poor sap.
You remember him, don't you?

940
01:40:32,041 --> 01:40:35,841
-no, no
-my workmate, from the judge's house


941
01:40:36,542 --> 01:40:40,842
they came for me, didn't find me.
he got it.


942
01:40:40,943 --> 01:40:44,343
-Motherfuckers!

943
01:40:45,944 --> 01:40:49,344
Gomez was never found, right?
-guess

944
01:40:52,045 --> 01:40:54,345
-these guys always get away

945
01:40:59,346 --> 01:41:03,346
you know, i want to ask you something
cause, i don't know how

946
01:41:04,947 --> 01:41:08,347
how did you learn to live without her?

947
01:41:08,948 --> 01:41:11,348
-it's been 25 years, Esposito

948
01:41:11,449 --> 01:41:15,349
-i was sure you wouldnt be able to.
-it's been 25 years, Esposito

949
01:41:15,650 --> 01:41:19,350
-with this guy free, how did you do it?
-its been 25 years

950
01:41:20,451 --> 01:41:23,351
forget it

951
01:41:33,352 --> 01:41:36,352
if it wasn't for me, you wouldn't
be here

952
01:41:37,653 --> 01:41:41,353
remember that?
you owe me one

953
01:41:42,054 --> 01:41:45,054
-i don't know what you want,
don't know what you're talking about

954
01:41:45,155 --> 01:41:47,855
-you say that you did nothing
with this guy free?

955
01:41:47,956 --> 01:41:49,656
-right, i couldnt do anything
-no?

956
01:41:50,057 --> 01:41:53,657
you spend a year searching for him
and then you do nothing?

957
01:41:53,758 --> 01:41:57,658
-right, i was after him for a year, 
then they got him and set him free

958
01:41:57,759 --> 01:41:59,559
what can i do?
-that's it? it's over?

959
01:41:59,660 --> 01:42:02,160
you spend the rest of your life with stamps?
-look who's talking

960
01:42:02,261 --> 01:42:04,261
-you are better than me
-what do you care?

961
01:42:05,462 --> 01:42:10,262
it's my life, not yours
-no, Morales..it's my life...too


962
01:42:11,063 --> 01:42:13,563
your love for this woman
i never saw the like

963
01:42:13,964 --> 01:42:17,864
from anyone
anyone 

964
01:42:19,865 --> 01:42:21,865
never

965
01:42:24,466 --> 01:42:26,866
-get out of my house

966
01:42:28,867 --> 01:42:30,867
now, please

967
01:42:31,968 --> 01:42:34,868
it's my life
not yours

968
01:42:41,969 --> 01:42:43,969
excuse me
i...

969
01:42:47,970 --> 01:42:50,970
it's an old man thing

970
01:42:51,971 --> 01:42:53,971
maybe it is

971
01:42:58,972 --> 01:43:00,972
it's just that i think about it all the time

972
01:43:01,073 --> 01:43:03,573
-Go home, if you want to think about it all the time

973
01:43:19,974 --> 01:43:22,574
Sandoval wasn't killed by Gomez

974
01:43:23,675 --> 01:43:25,175
so?

975
01:43:26,076 --> 01:43:30,176
-Gomez knew us both. If it was him
he would've waited for me

976
01:43:34,077 --> 01:43:38,077
there's something...in my house 
there were a couple of pictures of me

977
01:43:38,878 --> 01:43:42,478
when they killed Pablo, Sandoval's


978
01:43:42,479 --> 01:43:45,779
pictures were upside down

979
01:43:45,980 --> 01:43:48,880
all the rest were in order
they hadn't touched anything

980
01:43:50,881 --> 01:43:53,881
i thought..
i think

981
01:44:10,982 --> 01:44:13,882
Is this Esposito?

982
01:44:16,983 --> 01:44:20,883
Can't you hear, asshole?
Are you Esposito?

983
01:44:24,984 --> 01:44:28,884
-what happened?
-what are you doing?

984
01:44:29,085 --> 01:44:31,385
answer me

985
01:44:31,986 --> 01:44:34,486
what are you doing?
where are you going?

986
01:44:35,587 --> 01:44:38,487
where are you going?
-here

987
01:44:38,588 --> 01:44:41,088
-what are you going to do?

988
01:44:41,189 --> 01:44:44,089
-im going to put on some music

989
01:44:44,390 --> 01:44:48,090
-put on some music?
listen

990
01:44:48,191 --> 01:44:51,491
are you Esposito
or you are not Esposito?

991
01:44:59,192 --> 01:45:01,292
it's me

992
01:45:35,293 --> 01:45:40,293
i feel so embarrassed that i can't
even go to cemetery with some flowers

993
01:45:44,894 --> 01:45:47,294
or maybe it wasn't like that

994
01:45:49,195 --> 01:45:53,295
maybe he went to sleep, and they killed him
just like that, not knowing

995
01:45:54,996 --> 01:45:59,296
And the pictures fell on their own
by chance, some movement

996
01:46:00,997 --> 01:46:02,297
don't know

997
01:46:02,998 --> 01:46:05,798
i think, and think, don't know
what to think

998
01:46:05,899 --> 01:46:08,799
-choose well

999
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:11,800
all what we have left
is memories

1000
01:46:11,901 --> 01:46:14,701
at least, let's have some nice ones

1001
01:46:16,702 --> 01:46:19,202
-but there's something i will
never forget

1002
01:46:20,203 --> 01:46:22,603
last thing he told me the
night they killed him

1003
01:46:24,604 --> 01:46:28,604
dont worry, Benjamin. we'll
catch this motherfucker


1004
01:46:30,105 --> 01:46:33,605
and i will. 

1005
01:46:33,706 --> 01:46:36,606
if he's alive, i will

1006
01:46:44,007 --> 01:46:46,007
wait

1007
01:46:47,808 --> 01:46:50,008
come in, sit down

1008
01:47:00,909 --> 01:47:04,009
dont search anymore

1009
01:47:04,910 --> 01:47:09,010
i couldnt go to the ministry. i knew
this guy was untouchable there

1010
01:47:11,511 --> 01:47:16,011
but i also knew that, sooner or later
he would come... for you

1011
01:48:38,012 --> 01:48:41,512
i got rid of the body and its clear that
nobody missed him too much

1012
01:48:55,513 --> 01:48:57,513
Was it worth it?

1013
01:48:59,014 --> 01:49:02,514
-I don't think about it anymore
dont think about it anymore

1014
01:49:03,515 --> 01:49:06,515
who cares?
my wife is dead

1015
01:49:06,716 --> 01:49:10,516
your friend is dead, Gomez is dead
all of them are dead

1016
01:49:10,717 --> 01:49:13,617
dont think about it anymore
you will start with..

1017
01:49:13,718 --> 01:49:17,818
if i was..if i wasn't.. you will
have a thousand pasts, and no future

1018
01:49:19,919 --> 01:49:22,419
dont think about it anymore
believe me

1019
01:49:24,020 --> 01:49:27,420
you will only have memories

1020
01:49:30,921 --> 01:49:33,421
i owed you one, right?


1021
01:49:34,922 --> 01:49:36,922
now we are even

1022
01:49:57,923 --> 01:50:00,923
**dont think about it anymore**

1023
01:50:04,124 --> 01:50:05,924
i thought about it so many times

1024
01:50:06,925 --> 01:50:09,925
**what can I achieve by putting four shots into him?**

1025
01:50:13,026 --> 01:50:16,126
**it's my life, not yours**

1026
01:50:16,927 --> 01:50:19,127
**go to your house if you want to think about it**

1027
01:50:19,228 --> 01:50:22,128
**we are going to catch him**

1028
01:50:23,129 --> 01:50:25,129
**it's been 25 years asking myself about it**

1029
01:50:30,930 --> 01:50:33,130
**it wasnt another life, it was this one**

1030
01:50:33,231 --> 01:50:35,831
**a guy can do everything to change**

1031
01:50:36,032 --> 01:50:38,832
**what can i achieve by putting four shots into him?**

1032
01:50:39,033 --> 01:50:41,933
**but there's one thing he can't change
not him, you, me, anybody, Benjamin**

1033
01:51:26,134 --> 01:51:28,934
**how is it possible to live an empty life?**

1034
01:51:34,935 --> 01:51:37,935
**how can carry on living a life
filled with nothing?**

1035
01:51:43,736 --> 01:51:46,136
