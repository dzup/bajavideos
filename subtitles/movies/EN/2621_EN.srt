0
00:00:53,726 --> 00:00:57,093
I've said for years that
our special equipment is obsolete.

1
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:01,892
And now, computer analysis reveals
a new approach: Miniaturization.

2
00:01:02,101 --> 00:01:04,365
For instance, radioactive lint.

3
00:01:05,838 --> 00:01:07,863
When placed in
an opponent's pockets...

4
00:01:08,174 --> 00:01:11,200
...the personnel and location fix
seems obvious.

5
00:01:11,377 --> 00:01:14,369
What we want
is a location fix on 007.

6
00:01:14,581 --> 00:01:17,846
Number 10 is making ugly noises
about Operation Bedlam.

7
00:01:18,051 --> 00:01:20,519
Miss Moneypenny, did you check
with Communications?

8
00:01:20,687 --> 00:01:24,350
Replies to our Cairo, Amsterdam
and Madrid inquiries: All negative.

9
00:01:24,691 --> 00:01:27,558
The PM wants to be informed
personally when we find 007.

10
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:38,381
Good morning. My name's Bond.
James Bond. Miss?

11
00:04:38,584 --> 00:04:40,279
Don't move, Mr. Bond.

12
00:04:44,824 --> 00:04:46,121
Now get up!

13
00:04:47,059 --> 00:04:48,720
Put your hands behind your head.

14
00:04:48,895 --> 00:04:50,294
Move!

15
00:04:59,605 --> 00:05:00,765
Get in.

16
00:05:05,578 --> 00:05:06,738
Lie down.

17
00:06:53,152 --> 00:06:55,382
This never happened
to the other fellow.

18
00:09:40,453 --> 00:09:42,011
- Baggage, sir?
- In the boot.

19
00:09:42,221 --> 00:09:44,519
- Take care of those clubs.
- Right, sir.

20
00:09:48,694 --> 00:09:51,891
- Commander Bond. How are you?
- Good to see you, Manuel.

21
00:09:53,532 --> 00:09:56,023
Everything seems up to
the Palacio's usual standards.

22
00:09:56,235 --> 00:09:58,032
Yes, it's a good season.

23
00:09:58,237 --> 00:10:00,535
That red car,
does it belong to a lady?

24
00:10:00,739 --> 00:10:03,139
Yes. Contessa Teresa di Vincenzo.

25
00:10:06,245 --> 00:10:07,712
Our best.

26
00:10:07,913 --> 00:10:10,438
Fortunately, we have had
a cancellation.

27
00:10:11,884 --> 00:10:13,613
Allow me.

28
00:10:22,895 --> 00:10:25,227
This will do.
This will do me nicely.

29
00:10:25,431 --> 00:10:27,899
I'm sure we can look after
your special needs.

30
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,466
I'm sure you can. Thank you.

31
00:11:22,321 --> 00:11:23,515
Thank you.

32
00:11:56,121 --> 00:11:57,452
Twenty thousand francs.

33
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,986
Too rich for my blood.

34
00:12:37,663 --> 00:12:38,823
Madame?

35
00:12:39,331 --> 00:12:40,889
I don't have the money.

36
00:12:44,236 --> 00:12:47,034
I regret too, but I don't have
any money.

37
00:12:47,239 --> 00:12:48,604
The dame can't pay up.

38
00:12:52,077 --> 00:12:54,204
Forgive me.
My mind was elsewhere.

39
00:12:54,413 --> 00:12:57,849
Madame has forgotten we agreed
to be partners this evening.

40
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,074
Please continue.

41
00:13:02,254 --> 00:13:06,213
That's lucky, being bailed out
like that at the last minute.

42
00:13:11,397 --> 00:13:12,762
Waiter.

43
00:13:15,067 --> 00:13:17,262
- Dom Perignon, '57.
- Yes, sir.

44
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,541
Why do you persist
in rescuing me, Mr. Bond?

45
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:27,504
It's becoming a habit,
Contessa Teresa.

46
00:13:27,813 --> 00:13:29,747
Teresa was a saint.
I'm known as Tracy.

47
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:34,052
Tracy, next time play it safe
and stand on five.

48
00:13:34,219 --> 00:13:36,551
People who want to stay alive
play it safe.

49
00:13:37,656 --> 00:13:40,625
Please stay alive,
at least for tonight.

50
00:13:46,532 --> 00:13:47,897
Come later.

51
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:52,068
I hope it'll be worth it, partner.

52
00:13:54,907 --> 00:13:58,070
Send it to suite 423
with caviar for two.

53
00:14:22,201 --> 00:14:23,429
Tracy?

54
00:14:26,672 --> 00:14:27,832
Tracy?

55
00:15:22,494 --> 00:15:23,984
Gatecrasher.

56
00:15:24,997 --> 00:15:26,521
I'll leave you to tidy up.

57
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:42,841
Royal beluga,
north of the Caspian.

58
00:16:29,127 --> 00:16:32,563
- You're full of surprises, contessa.
- So are you, Mr. Bond.

59
00:16:34,066 --> 00:16:36,330
Do you always have a gun
for a rendezvous?

60
00:16:36,568 --> 00:16:39,435
Occasionally. I seem
to be accident-prone.

61
00:16:39,838 --> 00:16:41,931
I'll take that, if you don't mind.

62
00:16:42,741 --> 00:16:44,072
You're very confident.

63
00:16:45,143 --> 00:16:46,735
Suppose I kill you for a thrill?

64
00:16:46,979 --> 00:16:49,948
I can think of something
more sociable to do.

65
00:16:51,517 --> 00:16:54,680
Stop playing games.
Who was that man in your room?

66
00:16:54,887 --> 00:16:57,617
- You're hurting me.
- I thought that was the idea tonight.

67
00:16:57,789 --> 00:16:58,813
Now, who was he?

68
00:16:58,991 --> 00:17:00,822
I don't know
what you're talking about.

69
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,387
I can be a lot more persuasive.

70
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:05,529
I'm sure you can.

71
00:17:08,534 --> 00:17:11,628
Whatever else I may be,
I'm not a liar.

72
00:17:14,773 --> 00:17:16,263
Get dressed.

73
00:17:40,165 --> 00:17:42,156
You're the most extraordinary girl.

74
00:17:42,568 --> 00:17:45,366
I'm not interested in
your opinion of me, Mr. Bond.

75
00:17:45,571 --> 00:17:48,870
- I'm here for a business transaction.
- Really?

76
00:17:54,346 --> 00:17:56,906
Isn't Le Bleu a bit heady for that?

77
00:17:57,249 --> 00:18:00,741
You know your perfumes.
What else do you know?

78
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:02,850
A little about women.

79
00:18:03,255 --> 00:18:05,223
Think about me...

80
00:18:05,424 --> 00:18:08,018
...as a woman you've just bought.

81
00:18:08,193 --> 00:18:10,024
Who needs to buy?

82
00:18:13,899 --> 00:18:16,459
Look, you don't owe me a thing.

83
00:18:19,371 --> 00:18:21,202
I think you're in trouble.

84
00:18:21,373 --> 00:18:23,364
Would you like to talk about it?

85
00:18:23,542 --> 00:18:25,373
No, Mr. Bond.

86
00:18:25,544 --> 00:18:29,571
The only thing you need know
about me is that I pay my debts.

87
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:33,347
Twenty thousand francs
is a lot of money.

88
00:19:10,922 --> 00:19:15,120
- <i>Good morning, Commander Bond.</i>
- Good morning. <i>Cafe complet</i> for two.

89
00:19:15,427 --> 00:19:18,157
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>
- Connect me with suite 423, please.

90
00:19:18,397 --> 00:19:20,991
<i>The Contessa di Vincenzo</i>
<i>has left the hotel, sir.</i>

91
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:23,463
- Checked out?
- <i>A few minutes ago.</i>

92
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:25,261
Thank you.

93
00:19:37,315 --> 00:19:38,976
Paid in full, as well.

94
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,452
- Mr. Bond?
- Yes.

95
00:19:50,662 --> 00:19:52,857
- You've lost something.
- Really?

96
00:19:57,035 --> 00:19:59,367
We'll give it to you outside.

97
00:20:00,372 --> 00:20:03,136
Why not? Perhaps we can make up
a foursome.

98
00:20:05,143 --> 00:20:06,940
You've thought of everything.

99
00:20:08,213 --> 00:20:11,546
What a lovely surprise,
our meeting again so soon.

100
00:20:18,657 --> 00:20:20,386
Where's the party this time?

101
00:20:20,592 --> 00:20:24,153
- You have an appointment.
- Business or pleasure?

102
00:20:26,598 --> 00:20:28,156
Mystery tour, eh?

103
00:20:30,102 --> 00:20:32,593
I think we'd enjoy it
more without that.

104
00:21:45,944 --> 00:21:47,172
Do not kill me, Mr. Bond.

105
00:21:47,412 --> 00:21:49,403
At least not until we've had a drink.

106
00:21:49,614 --> 00:21:52,606
Then if you wish, I'll give
you another chance.

107
00:21:52,818 --> 00:21:54,752
I'm Draco, of Draco Construction.

108
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:10,591
- But today is the 13th, commander.
- I'm superstitious.

109
00:22:10,802 --> 00:22:13,066
- A martini for our guest.
- A pleasure.

110
00:22:13,271 --> 00:22:15,296
Shaken, not stirred.

111
00:22:15,507 --> 00:22:17,304
- Of course.
- Campari for me.

112
00:22:19,511 --> 00:22:23,311
My apologies for the way you were
brought here today. Please sit down.

113
00:22:23,515 --> 00:22:26,575
I was not sure you would
accept a formal invitation.

114
00:22:26,785 --> 00:22:29,777
There's always something formal
about the point of a pistol.

115
00:22:31,623 --> 00:22:32,954
Thank you, <i>cheri.</i>

116
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:35,722
Olympe, we will finish
our struggle later.

117
00:22:35,894 --> 00:22:37,521
As you wish.

118
00:22:38,129 --> 00:22:41,462
And she also plays
a very good game of chess.

119
00:22:42,634 --> 00:22:43,965
Cheers.

120
00:22:44,636 --> 00:22:47,127
You usually drink Corsican brandy.

121
00:22:47,639 --> 00:22:49,231
What else do you know about me?

122
00:22:49,474 --> 00:22:51,704
Marc Ange Draco:
Head of the Union Corse.

123
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:54,140
A big crime syndicate in Europe.

124
00:22:54,312 --> 00:22:55,745
- The biggest.
- Not quite.

125
00:22:55,981 --> 00:22:59,144
An organization known as SPECTRE
operates worldwide.

126
00:22:59,351 --> 00:23:02,115
But your legitimate business fronts
are more extensive.

127
00:23:03,154 --> 00:23:05,418
Construction, electrical supplies...

128
00:23:05,657 --> 00:23:08,148
...numerous agricultural holdings.

129
00:23:08,526 --> 00:23:10,619
Your dossier on me...

130
00:23:11,363 --> 00:23:13,695
...is not entirely complete.

131
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,834
I am also Teresa's father.

132
00:23:18,536 --> 00:23:20,697
- Tracy.
- Yes, Tracy.

133
00:23:20,906 --> 00:23:24,000
Tracy. My only child.

134
00:23:25,644 --> 00:23:27,373
Her mother was an English girl.

135
00:23:27,579 --> 00:23:31,709
A romantic who had come to Corsica
to look for bandits.

136
00:23:32,217 --> 00:23:36,244
Rather like those women who ventured
into the desert looking for sheiks.

137
00:23:37,055 --> 00:23:39,023
She found me in the mountains...

138
00:23:39,591 --> 00:23:41,855
...hiding from the police
at the time.

139
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,789
I came to love this girl.

140
00:23:44,029 --> 00:23:46,930
We married. The result: Teresa.

141
00:23:48,433 --> 00:23:52,233
Twelve years later, my wife died.
I sent Teresa to Switzerland...

142
00:23:52,437 --> 00:23:55,463
- No, thanks, I prefer my own.
...to finish her education.

143
00:23:55,707 --> 00:23:57,800
Unfortunately, I didn't give her
a proper home.

144
00:23:58,043 --> 00:23:59,806
She was without supervision.

145
00:24:00,045 --> 00:24:03,572
So she joined a fast
international set.

146
00:24:04,282 --> 00:24:05,579
One scandal after another.

147
00:24:05,784 --> 00:24:09,720
When I disapproved,
cut off her allowance...

148
00:24:10,722 --> 00:24:13,213
...she committed some greater folly...

149
00:24:14,092 --> 00:24:15,753
...to spite me.

150
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,593
And yet, behind her bravado...

151
00:24:20,999 --> 00:24:23,695
...something was eating away
at her soul.

152
00:24:23,969 --> 00:24:25,903
This can happen
to men and women.

153
00:24:26,071 --> 00:24:29,768
They burn the heart out of themselves
by living too greedily...

154
00:24:30,608 --> 00:24:32,235
...and suddenly...

155
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,310
...all is finished.
- Why tell me this?

156
00:24:37,515 --> 00:24:38,812
She married...

157
00:24:39,017 --> 00:24:41,315
...an Italian count
who killed himself...

158
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:44,215
...in a Maserati with one
of his mistresses.

159
00:24:44,589 --> 00:24:47,456
I gave her too much,
and it brought her nothing.

160
00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:51,595
Now, why I tell you all this.

161
00:24:53,031 --> 00:24:56,762
I've been informed of everything
you've done for my daughter.

162
00:24:56,935 --> 00:25:00,769
- Everything?
- Don't worry. Don't worry about that.

163
00:25:00,939 --> 00:25:03,271
What you did,
the way you behaved...

164
00:25:03,441 --> 00:25:06,672
...might be the beginning
of some kind of therapy.

165
00:25:06,878 --> 00:25:08,778
She needs help.

166
00:25:10,749 --> 00:25:12,239
Your help.

167
00:25:12,817 --> 00:25:16,184
I find her fascinating, but she needs
a psychiatrist, not me.

168
00:25:16,388 --> 00:25:19,357
What she needs is a man
to dominate her...

169
00:25:19,958 --> 00:25:22,859
...to make love to her enough
to make her love him.

170
00:25:24,129 --> 00:25:25,653
A man like you.

171
00:25:26,931 --> 00:25:28,865
You overestimate me, Draco.

172
00:25:29,067 --> 00:25:31,831
She's very attractive,
but what you ask is not for me.

173
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:40,041
Listen to me.
On the day you marry her...

174
00:25:40,278 --> 00:25:43,406
...I'll give you a personal dowry
of one million pounds...

175
00:25:44,482 --> 00:25:45,710
...in gold.

176
00:25:46,184 --> 00:25:48,414
That's quite an inducement.

177
00:25:50,188 --> 00:25:52,816
But I don't need a million pounds.

178
00:25:53,591 --> 00:25:55,218
And I have a taste for freedom.

179
00:25:55,427 --> 00:26:00,228
Please, just see her some more.
Who knows what will come of it?

180
00:26:00,432 --> 00:26:02,832
I'm sorry, Draco,
but in my profession, I can't...

181
00:26:03,668 --> 00:26:07,001
- What?
- You have connections not open to me.

182
00:26:07,372 --> 00:26:09,863
Where is Ernst Stavro Blofeld?

183
00:26:10,842 --> 00:26:12,332
Blofeld?

184
00:26:13,678 --> 00:26:17,045
Some of my men defected to him.
I don't know where he is.

185
00:26:17,248 --> 00:26:20,342
- Can you find out?
- Lf I could...

186
00:26:20,685 --> 00:26:23,677
...I wouldn't tell
Her Majesty's Secret Service...

187
00:26:24,022 --> 00:26:27,514
...but I might tell
my future son-in-law.

188
00:26:27,892 --> 00:26:29,223
Go on.

189
00:26:31,362 --> 00:26:33,091
Next week is my birthday.

190
00:26:34,199 --> 00:26:37,726
For that, Teresa always comes
back to me.

191
00:26:41,706 --> 00:26:42,866
You understand?

192
00:26:43,074 --> 00:26:46,532
- Let's say I'll sleep on the idea.
- You do that.

193
00:26:48,713 --> 00:26:50,704
James, where have you been?

194
00:26:50,915 --> 00:26:54,976
- Much too far from you, darling.
- Same old James.

195
00:26:56,221 --> 00:26:57,381
Only more so.

196
00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:02,055
Heartless brute, letting me pine away
without even a postcard.

197
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,057
Pine no more.

198
00:27:04,796 --> 00:27:08,163
Cocktails at my place,
8-ish, just the two of us.

199
00:27:08,666 --> 00:27:10,861
Oh, I'd adore that...

200
00:27:11,069 --> 00:27:13,663
...if only I could trust myself.

201
00:27:13,905 --> 00:27:17,363
Same old Moneypenny:
Britain's last line of defense.

202
00:27:17,575 --> 00:27:21,011
You'd better go in.
He's running a very tight ship today.

203
00:27:39,531 --> 00:27:42,398
I'm relieving you
from Operation Bedlam, 007.

204
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,034
But, sir, Blofeld's
something of a must with me.

205
00:27:45,303 --> 00:27:47,203
You've had two years
to run him down.

206
00:27:47,438 --> 00:27:49,201
You've lost confidence in me?

207
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,704
I'm well aware of your talents, 007...

208
00:27:51,943 --> 00:27:55,140
...but license to kill is useless
unless one has a target.

209
00:27:55,346 --> 00:27:58,008
I'll find you a more suitable
assignment. That's all.

210
00:27:58,216 --> 00:27:59,911
- Sir...
- That's all.

211
00:28:09,827 --> 00:28:11,454
That was a quick conference.

212
00:28:11,696 --> 00:28:14,460
How do you expect a girl to keep
herself alluring...?

213
00:28:14,666 --> 00:28:16,497
Take a memo, please.

214
00:28:18,636 --> 00:28:21,662
- Ready, James.
- Sir, I have the honor to request...

215
00:28:21,873 --> 00:28:26,207
...you will accept my resignation,
effective forthwith.

216
00:28:27,712 --> 00:28:30,875
- Resignation from what?
- Her Majesty's Secret Service.

217
00:28:31,082 --> 00:28:34,051
And kindly present it
to that monument in there.

218
00:29:20,632 --> 00:29:22,122
Sorry, ma'am.

219
00:29:27,572 --> 00:29:28,937
007...
James Bond here.

220
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,869
He wants you, James.

221
00:29:42,453 --> 00:29:43,613
Request granted.

222
00:29:56,901 --> 00:29:59,563
Request granted.
Not even with regret.

223
00:29:59,737 --> 00:30:02,228
What did you expect,
a knighthood?

224
00:30:03,107 --> 00:30:04,597
Why don't you read it?

225
00:30:07,145 --> 00:30:08,737
"Two weeks leave."

226
00:30:08,913 --> 00:30:12,747
You didn't really want
to resign, did you?

227
00:30:12,917 --> 00:30:16,080
Moneypenny, what would I do
without you?

228
00:30:16,254 --> 00:30:19,087
My problem is that you
never do anything with me.

229
00:30:19,257 --> 00:30:21,248
It's a date. The moment I get back.

230
00:30:21,426 --> 00:30:24,418
- Where are you off to?
- Just someplace to laze about.

231
00:30:25,463 --> 00:30:26,953
Beachcombing.

232
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:35,667
<i>What would I do without you,</i>
<i>Miss Moneypenny? Thank you.</i>

233
00:30:55,693 --> 00:30:57,126
<i>Bonjour,</i> Miguel.

234
00:31:20,485 --> 00:31:22,043
- Teresa, hello.
- Good morning.

235
00:31:22,253 --> 00:31:24,244
- It's so nice that we see you.
- How are you?

236
00:31:29,327 --> 00:31:32,626
- Yes, very well.
- There's Tracy.

237
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:35,697
Where is she? Ah, there she is!

238
00:31:36,234 --> 00:31:38,896
- Teresa!
- Happy birthday, Papa.

239
00:31:39,137 --> 00:31:42,231
You make it so by being here.
You look marvelous.

240
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,408
There's someone
I want you to meet. Come.

241
00:31:44,642 --> 00:31:47,839
- Olympe, how are you?
- It's good to have you back.

242
00:31:49,647 --> 00:31:51,410
- You look wonderful.
- Thanks.

243
00:31:53,885 --> 00:31:57,446
Mr. Bond, may I introduce
my daughter, Teresa?

244
00:31:57,688 --> 00:32:00,282
- Contessa.
- Mr. Bond and I have already met.

245
00:32:00,525 --> 00:32:02,959
Each time is a renewed pleasure.

246
00:32:03,928 --> 00:32:06,863
Madame always makes one feel
so welcome.

247
00:32:10,368 --> 00:32:12,199
She likes you. I can see it.

248
00:32:12,403 --> 00:32:14,803
You must give me the name
of your oculist.

249
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:24,979
Olympe, I didn't know
Mr. Bond knew Papa.

250
00:32:25,216 --> 00:32:27,776
There is much about Mr. Bond
one does not know.

251
00:32:27,985 --> 00:32:31,386
It would be interesting to attend
night school, perhaps.

252
00:32:37,628 --> 00:32:40,222
Papa is up to something.
I'm sure of it.

253
00:32:40,998 --> 00:32:43,091
Your father loves you
very much, Tracy.

254
00:32:43,468 --> 00:32:47,598
Whatever he may arrange,
I know it's for your happiness.

255
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:51,431
What has Papa arranged?

256
00:33:05,256 --> 00:33:08,589
- Ah, Mr. Bond!
- Thank you.

257
00:33:08,926 --> 00:33:11,224
- Thank you.
- Many happy returns.

258
00:33:11,429 --> 00:33:14,159
The best years are still to come,
let's hope.

259
00:33:14,332 --> 00:33:15,629
Allow me.

260
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:17,164
What are you doing here?

261
00:33:17,435 --> 00:33:20,029
Yes, wasn't it kind of your father
to invite me?

262
00:33:20,271 --> 00:33:22,034
We're discussing a business deal.

263
00:33:22,273 --> 00:33:24,104
Really?

264
00:33:24,542 --> 00:33:28,774
No woman would waste this excellent
champagne discussing business.

265
00:33:29,247 --> 00:33:32,307
Unless she happened to be part
of the arrangement.

266
00:33:32,917 --> 00:33:34,043
What did you say?

267
00:33:34,285 --> 00:33:36,810
Don't blame Olympe.
I'm not your daughter for nothing.

268
00:33:36,988 --> 00:33:39,115
I detect a certain
family resemblance.

269
00:33:39,357 --> 00:33:42,485
I suggest you revise the terms
of your contract, Mr. Bond.

270
00:33:42,693 --> 00:33:46,390
- Your liability is too expensive.
- There you're mistaken.

271
00:33:46,564 --> 00:33:47,622
- Papa.
- Yes?

272
00:33:47,832 --> 00:33:50,960
- Mr. Bond wants some information.
- What are you talking about?

273
00:33:51,135 --> 00:33:54,263
You taught me that a good host
supplies his guests' needs.

274
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,039
And without obligation.

275
00:33:59,277 --> 00:34:02,212
- And then?
- "Obligation" is not the right word.

276
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,972
Tell him, Papa.
Tell him what he wants to know.

277
00:34:06,384 --> 00:34:09,217
- Now!
- Please, Teresa.

278
00:34:09,554 --> 00:34:11,681
There's only a possibility.
Nothing definite.

279
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:14,551
Tell him, Papa,
or you'll never see me again.

280
00:34:21,165 --> 00:34:22,427
All right.

281
00:34:24,101 --> 00:34:25,329
All right.

282
00:34:25,836 --> 00:34:29,033
There may be a connection
between that man Blofeld...

283
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,801
...and a lawyer with offices
in Bern, Switzerland.

284
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,574
- Named Gumbold.
- Gumbold.

285
00:34:36,814 --> 00:34:39,180
- Bern, Switzerland.
- Yes, Gumbold.

286
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,812
So...

287
00:34:41,185 --> 00:34:44,211
- Mr. Bond need have no interest in me.
- Another mistake.

288
00:34:45,856 --> 00:34:47,687
She always was a headstrong child.

289
00:34:48,459 --> 00:34:50,017
I'm sorry...

290
00:34:50,728 --> 00:34:52,252
Where has he gone?

291
00:34:59,737 --> 00:35:00,965
Tracy!

292
00:35:07,912 --> 00:35:09,106
Tracy.

293
00:35:09,413 --> 00:35:12,382
I was always taught that mistakes
should be remedied.

294
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,241
Especially between friends.

295
00:35:20,358 --> 00:35:21,723
Or lovers.

296
00:37:24,915 --> 00:37:26,780
I'll catch up with you later.

297
00:37:27,017 --> 00:37:30,009
- The story of our life, James?
- Just keep my martini cool.

298
00:38:08,425 --> 00:38:10,086
I will be back in an hour.

299
00:40:26,096 --> 00:40:30,192
Such things should be left
to a girl's father, who knows best.

300
00:40:30,534 --> 00:40:33,298
But what could be better
than being in love?

301
00:40:34,672 --> 00:40:37,300
Mr. Bond is in love with you?

302
00:40:39,677 --> 00:40:41,076
That may come too...

303
00:40:41,278 --> 00:40:42,609
...someday.

304
00:40:43,447 --> 00:40:46,245
Life's too short for "someday,"
Teresa.

305
00:40:46,717 --> 00:40:49,709
Tomorrow I will speak to him alone,
man-to-man.

306
00:40:49,887 --> 00:40:52,481
- No, Papa. No talk.
- Why not?

307
00:40:52,723 --> 00:40:55,692
Whatever happens,
there'll be no regrets.

308
00:40:57,561 --> 00:40:58,926
Please.

309
00:44:18,428 --> 00:44:21,761
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon. Is the admiral in?

310
00:44:28,472 --> 00:44:30,463
Excuse me, sir.
Commander Bond to see you.

311
00:44:31,808 --> 00:44:32,832
Show him in.

312
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:35,972
- Aye, aye, sir. If you please.
- Thank you.

313
00:44:42,986 --> 00:44:46,353
Unusually small for
a <i>Nymphalis polychloros.</i>

314
00:44:48,759 --> 00:44:53,287
I wasn't aware that your expertise
included lepidoptery.

315
00:44:53,497 --> 00:44:56,466
- Why are you here? You're on leave.
- Genealogy.

316
00:44:56,667 --> 00:44:58,157
Fascinating subject.

317
00:44:58,502 --> 00:45:02,063
Found a letter from Gebruder
Gumbold, solicitors in Switzerland...

318
00:45:02,306 --> 00:45:05,298
...to a certain
Count Balthazar de Bleuchamp.

319
00:45:05,475 --> 00:45:09,172
- De Bleuchamp?
- French form of Blofeld.

320
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:13,672
You've been relieved from
Operation Bedlam, remember?

321
00:45:14,151 --> 00:45:15,846
I assumed you'd reassign me, sir.

322
00:45:16,486 --> 00:45:18,477
This is a Photostat copy
of a letter...

323
00:45:18,689 --> 00:45:20,816
<i>... addressed to College of Arms</i>
<i>in London...</i>

324
00:45:20,991 --> 00:45:25,690
<i>... with a request to establish</i>
<i>de Bleuchamp's claim to the title.</i>

325
00:45:25,896 --> 00:45:29,024
<i>Sir Hilary Bray, the sable</i>
<i>basilisk of the college...</i>

326
00:45:29,233 --> 00:45:32,862
<i>... has replied to Gumbold,</i>
<i>suggesting they meet in person.</i>

327
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:36,528
<i>I've taken the liberty of working</i>
<i>with the college on this...</i>

328
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:39,368
<i>... using an examination</i>
<i>of my own family as cover.</i>

329
00:45:39,576 --> 00:45:42,545
<i>I've also been studying</i>
<i>the technical side of heraldry.</i>

330
00:45:42,746 --> 00:45:46,546
- Sir Hilary Bray. Commander Bond.
- Ah, yes, sir.

331
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:51,119
<i>If he consents to a meeting, I could</i>
<i>act as a college representative.</i>

332
00:45:51,855 --> 00:45:53,186
Come.

333
00:45:54,391 --> 00:45:56,291
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

334
00:45:56,526 --> 00:45:58,289
Look at this. Let me take your coat.

335
00:45:58,528 --> 00:46:02,396
Arms of Sir Thomas Bond,
Baronet of Peckham, died 1734.

336
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:05,397
Argent on a chevron sable.
Three bezants.

337
00:46:05,602 --> 00:46:08,571
Good motto, eh?
"The World is Not Enough."

338
00:46:08,772 --> 00:46:11,866
- Phidian's doing a splendid job.
- Thank you, sir.

339
00:46:12,042 --> 00:46:14,374
We've traced your line
to a Sir Otho le Bon...

340
00:46:14,544 --> 00:46:17,536
...who held the manor of
Wickhamsbreux by a knight's fee...

341
00:46:17,714 --> 00:46:20,376
...from the Earl of Thanet, 1387.

342
00:46:21,018 --> 00:46:22,246
We're in luck.

343
00:46:22,452 --> 00:46:24,386
Gumbold's telephoned from Bern...

344
00:46:24,554 --> 00:46:26,715
...to say that his client will see me.

345
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:28,721
- You mean me.
- Yes, you.

346
00:46:29,293 --> 00:46:30,885
But, Commander Bond...

347
00:46:31,061 --> 00:46:33,393
...I'm only able to countenance
this deception...

348
00:46:33,563 --> 00:46:36,225
...on your assurance this matter
is of national importance.

349
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,233
I haven't exaggerated.
We appreciate your help.

350
00:46:39,403 --> 00:46:43,567
All right. During the deception period,
I've arranged to go to Brittany.

351
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:45,970
I want to do some brass rubbings.

352
00:46:46,176 --> 00:46:47,666
Where do I go for this meeting?

353
00:46:47,911 --> 00:46:49,902
They want a description of myself.

354
00:46:50,113 --> 00:46:53,640
- Tactfully adjusted to favor me.
- Yes.

355
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:56,580
They will send the time and place
where I am to be...

356
00:46:56,753 --> 00:46:58,584
...collected, as they put it.

357
00:46:58,755 --> 00:47:02,247
It's not our sort of thing,
but under the circumstances...

358
00:47:02,426 --> 00:47:05,088
- Sounds like they're suspicious.
- No, not suspicious.

359
00:47:05,262 --> 00:47:07,162
Just discreet.

360
00:47:07,364 --> 00:47:10,424
There was no objection
to my fee of 1000 guineas.

361
00:47:10,867 --> 00:47:14,997
- Could their claim be genuine?
- It's hard to say at this point.

362
00:47:15,205 --> 00:47:17,833
We never like to speak until
we're absolutely certain...

363
00:47:18,075 --> 00:47:20,373
...that there's no error
on our side...

364
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:22,009
...or forgery on theirs.

365
00:47:22,212 --> 00:47:24,009
I hope I meet your high standards.

366
00:47:24,214 --> 00:47:26,182
One helpful physical point might be...

367
00:47:26,383 --> 00:47:29,352
...that the real de Bleuchamps
are without earlobes.

368
00:47:29,586 --> 00:47:32,987
It's not the sort of thing
that we rely on, but it could help.

369
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:36,785
- No earlobes.
- You might invite him to Augsburg.

370
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,019
They've been there for generations.

371
00:47:39,229 --> 00:47:42,392
Yes, I'd like to get him away
from Switzerland.

372
00:48:28,745 --> 00:48:31,270
- Sir Hilary Bray, baronet?
- The same, dear lady.

373
00:48:31,515 --> 00:48:35,212
I am Fraulein Irma Bunt,
personal secretary to the count.

374
00:48:35,419 --> 00:48:38,149
- Have you had a good journey?
- No, quite intolerable.

375
00:48:38,321 --> 00:48:39,481
I'm not a good traveler.

376
00:48:39,689 --> 00:48:42,920
I'm sorry. Grunther will take
your luggage.

377
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,957
- No, I can manage.
- I take it.

378
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:49,456
- You know Switzerland, Sir Hilary?
- I'm afraid not, Fraulein?

379
00:48:49,666 --> 00:48:50,690
- Bunt.
- Bunt.

380
00:48:50,867 --> 00:48:52,528
Interesting name for a genealogist.

381
00:48:52,736 --> 00:48:54,863
- Are you from a naval family?
- Naval?

382
00:48:55,071 --> 00:48:59,201
It's a nautical term, meaning
the baggy or swollen parts of a sail.

383
00:48:59,409 --> 00:49:01,877
- Nothing personal, of course.
- Interesting.

384
00:49:02,078 --> 00:49:04,546
- You speak German?
- I'm afraid not.

385
00:49:04,748 --> 00:49:06,807
- French?
- A little. Where are we off to?

386
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:09,314
You will not be disappointed.
Please?

387
00:49:12,889 --> 00:49:15,323
Like the bugs in a rug, yes?

388
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:18,494
- You are comfortable?
- Yes, indeed, fraulein.

389
00:49:18,728 --> 00:49:21,390
- Your kindness is quite overwhelming.
- Good.

390
00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:04,734
So we are halfway.

391
00:50:04,941 --> 00:50:07,034
Now we will have a little flight.

392
00:50:07,277 --> 00:50:08,835
I've never been in one of these.

393
00:50:09,045 --> 00:50:10,535
You must your pipe knock off.

394
00:50:11,114 --> 00:50:12,672
"Knock out," you mean.

395
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:14,610
I hope.

396
00:50:15,452 --> 00:50:17,545
Mind your head, Sir Hilary.

397
00:50:17,787 --> 00:50:19,550
Please fasten your safety belt.

398
00:50:27,264 --> 00:50:28,629
Now, up into the Alps.

399
00:51:12,375 --> 00:51:15,037
That is avalanche damage.

400
00:51:36,366 --> 00:51:38,891
You enjoy the skiing
or the bobsled perhaps?

401
00:51:39,102 --> 00:51:41,593
I'm not a sporting man, fraulein.

402
00:51:42,372 --> 00:51:43,839
Even when I'm at my best.

403
00:51:45,342 --> 00:51:47,537
Do you feel the airsickness?

404
00:52:06,062 --> 00:52:11,090
Up to there is for the public,
and from here upwards it is private.

405
00:52:11,301 --> 00:52:16,432
No one may come through without
permission from the count.

406
00:52:16,906 --> 00:52:21,605
There is the Bleuchamp Institute
for Allergy Research.

407
00:52:23,246 --> 00:52:25,908
- What kind of allergies?
- All of them.

408
00:52:26,082 --> 00:52:29,574
Like the hay fever, or the sickness
caused by the oysters...

409
00:52:29,753 --> 00:52:31,584
...or inability to eat meat.

410
00:52:31,788 --> 00:52:34,757
The count is a great specialist
in this field.

411
00:52:43,767 --> 00:52:45,792
I'll be glad to get my feet
on the ground.

412
00:52:46,002 --> 00:52:47,936
Not ground. Ice.

413
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:26,700
I should warn you,
guns make me very nervous.

414
00:53:26,943 --> 00:53:29,878
They are to keep the spies
from the chemical companies.

415
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:33,516
Many times already they have tried
to steal our discoveries.

416
00:53:33,717 --> 00:53:36,049
We live in a world
of avarice and deceit.

417
00:53:36,252 --> 00:53:39,050
- Here at least is no avarice.
- Really?

418
00:53:39,255 --> 00:53:43,055
The Bleuchamp Institute
is not for profit, Sir Hilary.

419
00:53:43,993 --> 00:53:46,723
The count does his work
for the sake of mankind.

420
00:53:46,963 --> 00:53:48,897
I'm very happy to hear it.

421
00:53:49,099 --> 00:53:51,897
He wants to leave his mark
on the entire world.

422
00:53:52,102 --> 00:53:54,900
- Characteristic ambition.
- Characteristic?

423
00:53:55,105 --> 00:53:57,005
Of a true humanitarian.

424
00:53:57,207 --> 00:54:00,404
Formerly it was a sports club,
open to the public.

425
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:05,377
Now it belongs to the count,
who has given it to scientific research.

426
00:54:05,548 --> 00:54:07,846
Joseph, Sir Hilary Bray will take
number four.

427
00:54:08,284 --> 00:54:12,550
I'll show you there after Grunther
takes you for medical examination.

428
00:54:12,756 --> 00:54:15,884
- I'm quite all right now.
- You are our honored guest.

429
00:54:16,059 --> 00:54:17,083
Thank you.

430
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:19,990
After your experience
in the helicopter...

431
00:54:20,196 --> 00:54:22,528
...we must make sure
you are well again.

432
00:54:22,732 --> 00:54:25,860
Grunther, take Sir Hilary
to Dr. Von Sant.

433
00:54:38,381 --> 00:54:39,541
Yes?

434
00:54:39,749 --> 00:54:41,546
Give him the usual comforts.

435
00:54:44,053 --> 00:54:45,714
You have 10 minutes...

436
00:54:46,289 --> 00:54:48,519
...and then take them to number four.

437
00:54:54,631 --> 00:54:58,158
If you wish anything for your comfort,
you must ring this...

438
00:54:58,401 --> 00:55:00,426
...and the attendant will come.

439
00:55:00,637 --> 00:55:02,434
Very considerate. Thank you.

440
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:07,440
You must also ring for him to open
the door when you wish to leave.

441
00:55:07,644 --> 00:55:11,273
- Complicated arrangement.
- To stop patients leaving their rooms...

442
00:55:11,481 --> 00:55:13,745
...when they should be resting.

443
00:55:14,417 --> 00:55:17,944
The count believes very strongly
in undisturbed rest.

444
00:55:18,121 --> 00:55:21,284
Prudent fellow. When can I see him?
We have much to discuss.

445
00:55:21,457 --> 00:55:23,823
He will send for you
when he's ready.

446
00:55:23,993 --> 00:55:29,192
Meanwhile, I'd like you to join me
in the Alpine room before dinner.

447
00:55:29,432 --> 00:55:33,095
- Alpine room?
- Yes. Grunther will come for you.

448
00:55:33,303 --> 00:55:35,635
- Shall we say 7:00?
- Thank you.

449
00:57:20,276 --> 00:57:22,403
Fraulein Bunt will receive you.

450
00:57:56,312 --> 00:58:00,442
Sir Hilary, please,
come to meet our patients.

451
00:58:00,616 --> 00:58:03,517
- This is Sir Hilary Bray, baronet.
- How do you do?

452
00:58:03,753 --> 00:58:07,849
He's a famous genealogist.
You will have a drink, yes?

453
00:58:08,091 --> 00:58:10,616
- Please, come and sit down.
- How do you do?

454
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:13,194
Thank you.

455
00:58:13,396 --> 00:58:15,921
- What is a baronet?
- An inferior sort of baron.

456
00:58:16,099 --> 00:58:18,260
- Oh, how disappointing.
- Well...

457
00:58:18,434 --> 00:58:21,892
Oh, I don't mean you're inferior.
I mean the title is.

458
00:58:22,105 --> 00:58:24,198
What's a gyn... genealogist?
What is that?

459
00:58:24,407 --> 00:58:26,102
An old people's doctor.

460
00:58:26,275 --> 00:58:28,766
So he's here to cure Fraulein Bunt?

461
00:58:28,945 --> 00:58:31,436
Be careful. She's got ears
like an elephant.

462
00:58:31,614 --> 00:58:35,778
- What will you drink, sir?
- Malt whiskey and branch water.

463
00:58:35,952 --> 00:58:38,512
I'm sorry I was so rude
about what a baronet is.

464
00:58:38,755 --> 00:58:42,020
You gave a very accurate
description.

465
00:58:42,258 --> 00:58:44,954
- Sir.
- Thank you.

466
00:58:45,161 --> 00:58:47,254
It's a treat, having
a man here for once.

467
00:58:47,463 --> 00:58:49,522
You mean there aren't any others?

468
00:58:49,766 --> 00:58:52,030
Only the staff, and you can't
really count them.

469
00:58:52,268 --> 00:58:54,293
Don't discuss the affairs
of the clinic.

470
00:58:54,504 --> 00:58:57,371
Yes, but what is a genealogist?
Will nobody tell me?

471
00:58:57,607 --> 00:59:00,269
- I would be pleased to tell you.
- Well?

472
00:59:00,476 --> 00:59:03,240
Genealogy is all about ancestors
and families.

473
00:59:03,446 --> 00:59:08,349
It could easily be that any one of you
here is related to a royal house...

474
00:59:08,885 --> 00:59:11,649
...if only we could go back
far enough to find out.

475
00:59:11,821 --> 00:59:13,652
Now, if you will tell me your names...

476
00:59:13,823 --> 00:59:17,020
We do not use surnames here.
It is a rule of the clinic.

477
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:19,558
I'm so sorry. I didn't know that.

478
00:59:19,796 --> 00:59:22,390
Come, it's time for dinner.

479
00:59:22,632 --> 00:59:26,398
Our schedule is rather strict.
So is our diet.

480
00:59:26,636 --> 00:59:29,901
Please, if you will sit
there between Helen and Ruby.

481
00:59:30,139 --> 00:59:33,336
I've never had much to do
with young ladies.

482
00:59:33,509 --> 00:59:35,909
I have ordered you
a steak Piz Gloria.

483
00:59:36,145 --> 00:59:39,842
- I hope you enjoy it.
- Thank you. I'm sure I will.

484
00:59:46,389 --> 00:59:50,519
- Are you here for Christmas?
- Well, I might be if...

485
00:59:50,693 --> 00:59:54,686
- We can have a party before we go!
- That's not quite in my line.

486
00:59:55,898 --> 00:59:58,366
Delicious! I used to hate chicken.

487
00:59:58,568 --> 01:00:02,368
It used to make me break out all over.
You'd be surprised where.

488
01:00:02,572 --> 01:00:04,540
Potatoes did it to me.
Now I adore them.

489
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:07,538
No medical histories, please.

490
01:00:09,879 --> 01:00:14,680
Girls, I'm sure Sir Hilary would like
to tell us about the College of Arms.

491
01:00:14,884 --> 01:00:17,216
Go on, Sir Hilary.
Please tell us.

492
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,889
- Lf you'd really enjoy that.
- Please. Yes!

493
01:00:21,057 --> 01:00:22,718
- We promise to listen.
- Would you?

494
01:00:24,794 --> 01:00:26,386
Come on, tell us all about it.

495
01:00:26,662 --> 01:00:29,028
The Heralds' College,
or College of Arms...

496
01:00:29,265 --> 01:00:31,859
...consists of 13 members
of the royal household...

497
01:00:32,034 --> 01:00:34,696
...appointed by the sovereign
to superintend...

498
01:00:34,937 --> 01:00:37,804
...armourial, genealogical,
ceremonial and other matters.

499
01:00:39,242 --> 01:00:43,042
The 13 members are divided
into three categories...

500
01:00:43,246 --> 01:00:45,714
...kings, heralds and pursuivants.

501
01:00:45,882 --> 01:00:50,080
Their titles and offices
are of great antiquity.

502
01:00:50,286 --> 01:00:53,414
Well, the first Clarenceux
King of Arms...

503
01:00:53,623 --> 01:00:56,592
...was created in 1334...

504
01:00:56,792 --> 01:01:01,252
...and the first
Somerset Herald in 1448.

505
01:01:01,464 --> 01:01:03,932
Now, when we authorize
a coat of arms...

506
01:01:04,133 --> 01:01:06,397
...it can include all sorts
of funny things...

507
01:01:06,602 --> 01:01:08,763
...crescent moons, portcullises...

508
01:01:08,971 --> 01:01:13,601
...beasts couchant and rampant,
bars, bezants...

509
01:01:13,809 --> 01:01:15,777
Please, what is "bezant"?

510
01:01:15,978 --> 01:01:17,843
Gold balls.

511
01:01:19,382 --> 01:01:23,648
I brought a book on the subject
with a picture of my coat of arms.

512
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,688
Which includes four of them...

513
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:29,958
...if you'd care to see them.

514
01:01:30,159 --> 01:01:32,150
I'd love to. I'm in room...

515
01:01:32,361 --> 01:01:34,829
No, no. He will give the book to me.

516
01:01:35,031 --> 01:01:37,556
I will pass it to everyone in turn.

517
01:01:38,334 --> 01:01:42,862
- It is fairer like that.
- Of course. If you think so, fraulein.

518
01:01:56,519 --> 01:01:58,953
Is anything the matter, Sir Hilary?

519
01:02:00,690 --> 01:02:03,818
Just a slight stiffness coming on
in the shoulder.

520
01:02:03,993 --> 01:02:06,393
Due to the altitude, no doubt.

521
01:02:10,266 --> 01:02:12,598
The count will see you.
Grunther will take you.

522
01:02:12,835 --> 01:02:15,497
Thank you.
Please excuse me, ladies.

523
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:21,532
May all your allergies
be swiftly cured.

524
01:02:24,413 --> 01:02:27,473
- What a nice man.
- Sweet!

525
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,415
I know what he's allergic to.

526
01:02:35,224 --> 01:02:36,555
Bezants...

527
01:03:08,291 --> 01:03:10,122
Antisepsis.

528
01:03:30,846 --> 01:03:32,438
Please wait here.

529
01:03:50,933 --> 01:03:52,867
- Good evening, Sir Hilary.
- Good evening.

530
01:03:53,102 --> 01:03:54,933
Balthazar, Count de Bleuchamp.

531
01:03:55,137 --> 01:03:58,300
If you'll forgive me, that's what
I'm here to find out.

532
01:03:58,474 --> 01:04:01,307
To confirm. There can be
no doubt of the truth.

533
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:04,138
- Please, sit down.
- Lf there were no doubt...

534
01:04:04,347 --> 01:04:06,372
...I'm sure I would not
have been sent.

535
01:04:06,615 --> 01:04:10,984
Well, since you are here, I'll make
everything very plain to you.

536
01:04:12,488 --> 01:04:16,151
To begin with, I was born
without earlobes...

537
01:04:16,359 --> 01:04:20,090
...a well-known congenital distinction
of Bleuchamp ancestry...

538
01:04:20,296 --> 01:04:24,096
...like the Hapsburg lip
or the hawk nose of the Medicis.

539
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:27,792
Granted, but the fact that
you're a de Bleuchamp...

540
01:04:28,003 --> 01:04:29,903
...doesn't make you
the reigning count.

541
01:04:30,139 --> 01:04:32,107
I feel it in my blood
and in my bones.

542
01:04:32,308 --> 01:04:35,141
I'm afraid the college
will require more concrete proofs.

543
01:04:35,344 --> 01:04:37,141
And it shall have them.

544
01:04:37,313 --> 01:04:39,474
I have assembled all
the relevant documents...

545
01:04:39,682 --> 01:04:42,810
...title deeds, certificates
of birth and death.

546
01:04:43,018 --> 01:04:45,248
I'll send them to your room
for authentication.

547
01:04:45,488 --> 01:04:48,423
You've only to ask Fraulein Bunt
for anything you require.

548
01:04:48,591 --> 01:04:52,755
- Are you comfortable here?
- Yes, but puzzled by your clinic.

549
01:04:52,995 --> 01:04:57,364
The methods of the great pioneers
often puzzle conventional minds.

550
01:04:57,566 --> 01:05:00,160
I've devised a cure for allergies...

551
01:05:00,636 --> 01:05:03,366
...which depends on
holding an unusual...

552
01:05:03,539 --> 01:05:06,133
...and delicate
psychological balance.

553
01:05:06,342 --> 01:05:10,335
So I must impose rather special
conditions on my patients.

554
01:05:10,546 --> 01:05:13,037
And your laboratories?

555
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:16,150
The cure is not entirely
psychological, Sir Hilary.

556
01:05:16,352 --> 01:05:18,377
There are special vaccines
to be prepared.

557
01:05:18,587 --> 01:05:22,045
Vaccines which must be modified
to suit each individual case.

558
01:05:22,258 --> 01:05:24,055
So I'm a very busy man...

559
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:27,286
...and I cannot spare you
as much time as I might wish.

560
01:05:27,530 --> 01:05:29,623
To be confirmed
as Count de Bleuchamp...

561
01:05:29,799 --> 01:05:31,664
...you must give me
some of your time.

562
01:05:31,867 --> 01:05:35,303
I need details of your living
relatives, parents and grandparents.

563
01:05:35,538 --> 01:05:38,974
- The documents you will see...
- Can answer questions, but not all.

564
01:05:39,208 --> 01:05:41,039
Oh, one more thing.

565
01:05:41,243 --> 01:05:44,041
It would help if you could
accompany me to visit Augsburg.

566
01:05:44,213 --> 01:05:47,307
- Augsburg?
- The de Bleuchamps' ancestral home.

567
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:49,575
There are tombs in the cathedral...

568
01:05:49,785 --> 01:05:51,980
...and important records
in the city archives.

569
01:05:52,221 --> 01:05:54,485
You there to assist
with your personal knowledge...

570
01:05:54,723 --> 01:05:56,918
That may not be convenient
for some time...

571
01:05:57,092 --> 01:05:59,219
...but my title shall be recognized.

572
01:05:59,428 --> 01:06:02,124
You may proceed
with your preliminary research.

573
01:06:02,331 --> 01:06:03,923
I'll be happy to start immediately.

574
01:06:09,939 --> 01:06:11,770
Thank you, Herr Grunther.

575
01:08:34,249 --> 01:08:35,546
Sir Hilary!

576
01:08:37,086 --> 01:08:38,883
I brought you the book.

577
01:08:39,288 --> 01:08:42,587
- The illustrated book?
- No, don't turn it on.

578
01:08:42,791 --> 01:08:45,919
- I want to see the pictures.
- You're a picture yourself...

579
01:08:46,128 --> 01:08:48,460
...and twice as lovely
in the firelight.

580
01:08:48,631 --> 01:08:51,759
You are funny,
pretending not to like girls.

581
01:08:51,934 --> 01:08:53,424
Well, I don't usually.

582
01:08:53,602 --> 01:08:55,866
But you're not usual.

583
01:08:56,138 --> 01:08:59,107
That lipstick was an inspiration.
So are you.

584
01:08:59,274 --> 01:09:01,572
Oh, Sir Hilary.

585
01:09:01,777 --> 01:09:04,439
Call me "Hilly."

586
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,074
Hilly.

587
01:09:07,616 --> 01:09:08,913
What's your name?

588
01:09:09,118 --> 01:09:11,143
Ruby Bartlett, from Lancashire.

589
01:09:11,387 --> 01:09:14,618
- Morecambe Bay, actually.
- How did you get here?

590
01:09:15,090 --> 01:09:17,888
Do we have to talk about that now?

591
01:09:35,644 --> 01:09:37,475
It's true!

592
01:09:43,786 --> 01:09:45,515
How did you get here?

593
01:09:47,056 --> 01:09:49,820
I had this awful allergy
about chickens.

594
01:09:50,025 --> 01:09:51,720
My family has a chicken farm...

595
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:54,827
...and whenever I had to work on it
I nearly died.

596
01:09:55,698 --> 01:09:58,064
A specialist said
there was a Swiss clinic...

597
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:01,929
...where they cured you, free,
because they're doing research.

598
01:10:05,174 --> 01:10:08,575
Go on.
No, about the clinic, I mean.

599
01:10:09,645 --> 01:10:13,877
Well, the specialist had me meet
Fraulein Bunt in London...

600
01:10:14,083 --> 01:10:17,712
...and she said I had
a very interesting case.

601
01:10:17,986 --> 01:10:19,749
How right she was.

602
01:10:19,955 --> 01:10:21,855
Oh, Hilly!

603
01:10:22,524 --> 01:10:24,321
Oh, bother!

604
01:10:24,526 --> 01:10:28,656
No, Hilly.
It's part of the cure.

605
01:10:34,870 --> 01:10:36,667
Cassette number seven.

606
01:10:43,612 --> 01:10:45,102
Number eight.

607
01:10:50,052 --> 01:10:52,543
<i>Do you remember when you</i>
<i>first came here...</i>

608
01:10:52,755 --> 01:10:55,121
<i>... how you hated chickens?</i>

609
01:10:55,424 --> 01:10:58,257
<i>How you were sick</i>
<i>when you even saw one?</i>

610
01:10:58,994 --> 01:11:00,894
<i>But all that is over now...</i>

611
01:11:01,096 --> 01:11:03,997
<i>... for I have shown you</i>
<i>how foolish it was...</i>

612
01:11:04,199 --> 01:11:06,861
<i>... and your cure is nearly done.</i>

613
01:11:07,069 --> 01:11:09,435
<i>I have taught you</i>
<i>to love chickens...</i>

614
01:11:09,638 --> 01:11:13,233
<i>... to love their flesh,</i>
<i>their voice.</i>

615
01:11:13,442 --> 01:11:16,070
<i>Yes, your cure is nearly done.</i>

616
01:11:16,278 --> 01:11:19,509
<i>And soon you will go home...</i>

617
01:11:19,715 --> 01:11:23,617
<i>... to look after the chickens</i>
<i>that you love so much.</i>

618
01:11:23,819 --> 01:11:25,980
You do love me just a little,
don't you, Hilly?

619
01:11:26,155 --> 01:11:28,589
- <i>Learn one more thing before you go.</i>
- Ruby.

620
01:11:28,757 --> 01:11:32,454
<i>I must teach you</i>
<i>how to give them special care.</i>

621
01:11:33,762 --> 01:11:35,252
<i>I will tell you what to do.</i>

622
01:11:35,464 --> 01:11:38,092
- Ruby, wake up.
- <i>I will tell you when.</i>

623
01:11:38,267 --> 01:11:40,292
<i>I will tell you how.</i>

624
01:11:41,570 --> 01:11:44,164
<i>And after you've done</i>
<i>what I teach you...</i>

625
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:47,274
<i>... you will forget it forever.</i>

626
01:11:47,676 --> 01:11:49,268
<i>Forever.</i>

627
01:12:11,466 --> 01:12:13,832
Hilly, you old devil.

628
01:12:18,207 --> 01:12:22,109
- It is me, yes?
- Quite undeniably, yes.

629
01:12:23,512 --> 01:12:25,002
How did you get out?

630
01:12:26,448 --> 01:12:29,975
With a fingernail file.
It's so easy.

631
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:32,311
I wouldn't know.

632
01:12:35,324 --> 01:12:38,623
- I come to see the book, the pictures?
- Jolly good idea.

633
01:12:38,827 --> 01:12:40,454
Now, where did I put it?

634
01:12:41,830 --> 01:12:43,855
I had it a few moments ago.

635
01:12:44,333 --> 01:12:46,494
- Perhaps if we turn on the light?
- No.

636
01:12:47,402 --> 01:12:49,495
You're a picture yourself.

637
01:12:49,872 --> 01:12:52,102
And twice as lovely
in the firelight.

638
01:12:52,307 --> 01:12:55,037
- But, Sir Hilary...
- Hilly.

639
01:12:55,244 --> 01:12:57,906
But I think you do not
like girls, Hilly.

640
01:12:58,146 --> 01:13:01,479
Usually, I don't,
but you're not usual.

641
01:13:01,850 --> 01:13:04,114
Coming here was an inspiration...

642
01:13:04,319 --> 01:13:05,980
...and so are you.

643
01:13:07,022 --> 01:13:08,182
You'll need to be.

644
01:13:08,490 --> 01:13:11,357
- What you say?
- A miracle, our meeting like this.

645
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:13,687
I don't even know your name.

646
01:13:13,862 --> 01:13:17,025
I tell you all about myself later.

647
01:13:18,901 --> 01:13:20,368
In the morning.

648
01:14:00,108 --> 01:14:01,473
Hey.

649
01:14:02,044 --> 01:14:03,477
What about a lift to the top?

650
01:14:03,712 --> 01:14:06,272
It is not permitted.
All is private.

651
01:14:06,481 --> 01:14:08,881
But surely there's a restaurant,
a club up there.

652
01:14:09,084 --> 01:14:10,574
I've seen them advertised.

653
01:14:10,752 --> 01:14:13,312
- It's all closed now.
- Since when?

654
01:14:13,555 --> 01:14:15,716
- I've seen them advertised.
- You are mistaken.

655
01:14:15,924 --> 01:14:17,585
For many weeks,
they are finished.

656
01:14:17,793 --> 01:14:19,624
But I'd still like to get to the top.

657
01:14:19,828 --> 01:14:21,762
From here up, it's forbidden!

658
01:14:22,230 --> 01:14:24,255
Private! Closed!

659
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:26,828
All right.

660
01:14:54,529 --> 01:14:56,360
It's my turn now.

661
01:15:01,103 --> 01:15:02,832
- Sir Hilary!
- Good morning.

662
01:15:03,038 --> 01:15:05,802
Good morning.
Your stiffness of last night...

663
01:15:05,974 --> 01:15:07,635
...it is all gone?

664
01:15:08,443 --> 01:15:11,469
- For the time being.
- Then come and do curling with us.

665
01:15:11,646 --> 01:15:13,637
- Won't that be frightfully energetic?
- No.

666
01:15:13,982 --> 01:15:15,973
- We'll show you.
- Perhaps you'd teach me.

667
01:15:29,965 --> 01:15:32,456
- Have a go.
- We expect great things of you.

668
01:15:37,672 --> 01:15:40,140
We're leaving very soon.
I must see you.

669
01:15:40,342 --> 01:15:41,775
Eight o'clock tonight.

670
01:15:59,161 --> 01:16:00,856
And the man was alone?

671
01:16:04,666 --> 01:16:07,226
- Good morning, ladies.
- Good morning!

672
01:16:07,436 --> 01:16:10,234
Good morning, Sir Hilary.
How's your research?

673
01:16:10,505 --> 01:16:12,996
Riveting,
and very promising too.

674
01:16:13,208 --> 01:16:15,904
I've never heard anything
so ridiculous in all my life!

675
01:16:16,111 --> 01:16:18,238
Since when is climbing
a criminal offence?

676
01:16:18,447 --> 01:16:21,883
Excuse me.
Piz Gloria, sir, is private property.

677
01:16:22,084 --> 01:16:23,779
The whole bloody Alp?
Ridiculous!

678
01:16:23,952 --> 01:16:27,410
There are many signs, and my servant
warned you down at the station.

679
01:16:27,889 --> 01:16:29,754
Your throw, I think it is.

680
01:16:29,958 --> 01:16:32,859
I had my throw.
Made a mess of it, I'm afraid.

681
01:16:33,061 --> 01:16:35,188
That didn't count.
You can throw again.

682
01:16:35,397 --> 01:16:37,763
- Yes, go on.
- Very civil of you, fraulein.

683
01:16:37,966 --> 01:16:41,458
- Doesn't entitle these goons to
shoot at me. Who the hell are you?

684
01:16:41,636 --> 01:16:43,968
I am the director of this institute.

685
01:16:48,577 --> 01:16:52,308
You'll be sent back down and
will refrain from troubling us again!

686
01:16:52,481 --> 01:16:54,642
What about my belongings?

687
01:16:54,850 --> 01:16:57,216
- They will be sent later.
- But they're mine!

688
01:16:57,552 --> 01:17:01,079
We have certain rules
which must be observed.

689
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:06,389
- The authorities will hear about it!
- Good day.

690
01:17:10,966 --> 01:17:14,094
Director... Or count,
as I think I can now safely say...

691
01:17:14,636 --> 01:17:17,833
I thought I'd take the afternoon off,
so if you send the car down...

692
01:17:18,006 --> 01:17:20,133
But you've already had
the morning off.

693
01:17:20,375 --> 01:17:23,742
Must have a bit of fresh air.
Those ancestors are hard work.

694
01:17:23,945 --> 01:17:26,675
And the College of Arms
is being very well paid.

695
01:17:26,915 --> 01:17:29,679
- Lf you put it like that...
- I do put it like that.

696
01:17:29,851 --> 01:17:32,911
I'll show you what I've done,
then we'll plan the trip to Augsburg...

697
01:17:33,121 --> 01:17:34,486
...and finish it.
- Over Christmas?

698
01:17:34,689 --> 01:17:36,748
The archives will be closed,
will they not?

699
01:17:38,193 --> 01:17:41,287
Come, girls,
it's time for our massage.

700
01:17:42,430 --> 01:17:45,399
Girls, that is enough curling
for today.

701
01:17:49,905 --> 01:17:52,806
- I must see you tonight.
- Nine o'clock?

702
01:17:55,610 --> 01:17:59,046
Ten? Well, back to work.

703
01:18:00,048 --> 01:18:02,175
You've no idea how it's piling up.

704
01:18:21,002 --> 01:18:23,971
Ruby! It's me, Hilly.

705
01:18:26,074 --> 01:18:29,066
Hilly's so sad that Ruby's leaving.

706
01:18:30,145 --> 01:18:32,204
Has that old cow told you...?

707
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:34,439
Fancy meeting you here, fraulein!

708
01:18:55,370 --> 01:18:56,769
Merry Christmas, 007.

709
01:18:57,973 --> 01:18:59,270
I'm Sir Hilary Bray.

710
01:18:59,908 --> 01:19:01,773
No, no, Mr. Bond.

711
01:19:01,977 --> 01:19:04,411
Respectable baronets
from the College of Heralds...

712
01:19:04,579 --> 01:19:07,173
...do not seduce
female patients in clinics.

713
01:19:07,382 --> 01:19:10,749
On the other hand, they do get
their professional details right.

714
01:19:10,986 --> 01:19:14,854
The Bleuchamp tombs are not in
the Augsburg Cathedral, as you said...

715
01:19:15,056 --> 01:19:18,992
...but in the Saint Anna Kirche.
Sir Hilary Bray would've known.

716
01:19:20,195 --> 01:19:21,719
A small slip.

717
01:19:21,930 --> 01:19:24,490
Takes more than a few props
to turn 007 into a herald.

718
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:28,636
It'll take more than cutting off your
earlobes to turn you into a count.

719
01:19:28,870 --> 01:19:32,806
I may yet surprise you, but I'm afraid
you have no surprises left for me.

720
01:19:33,008 --> 01:19:35,772
I know all about your mission,
Mr. Bond.

721
01:19:36,011 --> 01:19:37,444
Your colleague...

722
01:19:38,246 --> 01:19:41,909
Such a keen climber,
such a brilliant conversationalist...

723
01:19:42,117 --> 01:19:43,607
...before he left us.

724
01:19:43,785 --> 01:19:46,151
- Of course he reported where I am.
- I doubt that.

725
01:19:46,721 --> 01:19:49,121
In any case, no one's going
to come to your rescue.

726
01:19:49,291 --> 01:19:54,058
In a few hours, the United Nations
will receive my yuletide greetings:

727
01:19:54,262 --> 01:19:58,631
The information that I now possess
the scientific means to control...

728
01:19:58,833 --> 01:20:01,825
...or to destroy the economy
of the whole world.

729
01:20:02,037 --> 01:20:05,006
People will have more important
things to think about than you.

730
01:20:05,173 --> 01:20:07,141
If they believe your threat.

731
01:20:08,209 --> 01:20:12,077
They will. In any case,
I have prepared a demonstration.

732
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:14,248
Remember that
disagreeable outbreak...

733
01:20:14,449 --> 01:20:17,850
...of foot-and-mouth disease
in England last summer?

734
01:20:20,188 --> 01:20:23,817
Well, I shall instruct them,
in very convincing terms...

735
01:20:24,059 --> 01:20:28,359
...exactly how I arranged that.
And my capacity has improved since.

736
01:20:29,164 --> 01:20:31,257
Allergy vaccines?

737
01:20:33,168 --> 01:20:36,194
Bacteria. Bacteriological warfare.

738
01:20:36,438 --> 01:20:37,803
With a difference.

739
01:20:38,006 --> 01:20:40,304
Our great breakthrough
since last summer...

740
01:20:40,508 --> 01:20:42,669
...has been the confection
of a certain...

741
01:20:42,877 --> 01:20:46,176
...Virus Omega.
- Infertility.

742
01:20:46,614 --> 01:20:48,878
Total infertility
in plants and animals.

743
01:20:49,117 --> 01:20:51,642
Not just disease in a few herds,
Mr. Bond...

744
01:20:51,853 --> 01:20:53,548
...or the loss of a single crop...

745
01:20:53,722 --> 01:20:56,589
...but the destruction
of a whole strain, forever...

746
01:20:56,791 --> 01:20:58,383
...throughout an entire continent.

747
01:20:58,626 --> 01:21:00,218
If my demands are not met...

748
01:21:00,395 --> 01:21:02,955
...I shall proceed with
the systematic extinction...

749
01:21:03,131 --> 01:21:06,532
...of whole species of cereals
and livestock all over the world.

750
01:21:06,735 --> 01:21:08,999
Including, I suppose,
the human race?

751
01:21:09,204 --> 01:21:11,399
I don't think, do you, Mr. Bond...

752
01:21:11,639 --> 01:21:13,732
...the UN will let it come to that.

753
01:21:13,975 --> 01:21:16,705
Not after their scientists
analyze a small sample...

754
01:21:16,911 --> 01:21:18,970
...of Virus Omega they have received.

755
01:21:19,214 --> 01:21:20,704
Epidemics of sterility.

756
01:21:21,416 --> 01:21:25,011
Nothing is born.
No seed even begins to sprout.

757
01:21:25,854 --> 01:21:28,322
- They'll find an antidote.
- Of course!

758
01:21:28,523 --> 01:21:30,548
If I give them enough time.

759
01:21:30,825 --> 01:21:32,349
They'll have time.

760
01:21:32,694 --> 01:21:35,390
Once they're warned, you'll have
a problem dispensing it.

761
01:21:35,630 --> 01:21:38,190
That problem has already
been solved.

762
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:42,234
I have been training
my own special "Angels of Death."

763
01:21:42,437 --> 01:21:43,597
Those girls.

764
01:21:43,772 --> 01:21:46,172
Those girls,
and many others like them.

765
01:21:47,142 --> 01:21:48,871
But exactly how?

766
01:21:50,945 --> 01:21:52,412
That will remain my secret.

767
01:21:54,149 --> 01:21:57,380
How many hundred millions do you
want for your services this time?

768
01:21:57,552 --> 01:22:00,385
This time? This time,
the price is of another kind.

769
01:22:00,588 --> 01:22:02,522
You'll be amused
when you know what.

770
01:22:02,724 --> 01:22:05,124
In the meanwhile,
I will keep you here as my guest.

771
01:22:05,293 --> 01:22:08,353
You'll be very useful in helping
to convince the authorities...

772
01:22:08,563 --> 01:22:10,554
...that I mean what I say...

773
01:22:10,899 --> 01:22:12,764
...and I'll do what I claim.

774
01:22:13,535 --> 01:22:15,969
Come. Let me show you
to your new quarters.

775
01:22:19,407 --> 01:22:22,103
You're likely to be with us
for some time, Mr. Bond.

776
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:23,743
So first...

777
01:22:23,945 --> 01:22:27,381
...a little therapy to soothe
your restless nature.

778
01:22:28,716 --> 01:22:31,412
Poor fellow. He was restless too.

779
01:22:31,619 --> 01:22:34,679
You perverse British,
how you love your exercise.

780
01:22:35,223 --> 01:22:39,216
Every year, dozens of amateur
climbers end in the same predicament.

781
01:22:39,794 --> 01:22:43,662
A kind of waxworks show
for morbid tourists.

782
01:22:44,332 --> 01:22:46,061
Dear, dear me.

783
01:22:53,241 --> 01:22:57,837
Now, now. Now, Mr. Bond, you
must learn to be absolutely calm...

784
01:22:58,079 --> 01:23:00,707
...before we can accept you
back into polite society.

785
01:23:51,366 --> 01:23:52,924
Presents!

786
01:23:55,770 --> 01:23:57,237
Going-away presents...

787
01:23:57,405 --> 01:24:00,636
...from the count himself,
in appreciation.

788
01:24:00,842 --> 01:24:02,867
- I want to open mine now.
- No.

789
01:24:03,077 --> 01:24:05,477
It is more fun to open them
all together, yes?

790
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:08,478
Please sit down.
We will wait for the others.

791
01:24:09,717 --> 01:24:11,685
Look, look, look!

792
01:24:54,896 --> 01:24:57,126
Eggnog on Christmas Eve.
Just like home!

793
01:24:57,332 --> 01:24:59,459
It is a treat
for the going-away party.

794
01:24:59,834 --> 01:25:02,598
- Your very good health, my dears.
- Cheers! Cheers!

795
01:25:02,837 --> 01:25:05,897
It has been so nice to cure you.

796
01:25:53,388 --> 01:25:57,324
It has something special in it
for the Holy Night celebration.

797
01:26:40,034 --> 01:26:44,232
<i>And now you're going on a journey.</i>
<i>A journey home.</i>

798
01:26:45,239 --> 01:26:47,707
<i>But first you must rest for a while.</i>

799
01:26:47,942 --> 01:26:51,070
<i>Rest. Rest.</i>

800
01:26:52,447 --> 01:26:53,846
<i>Rest...</i>

801
01:29:24,498 --> 01:29:27,467
<i>I will tell you when,</i>
<i>and I will tell you how...</i>

802
01:29:27,668 --> 01:29:29,659
<i>... but it must be our secret.</i>

803
01:29:29,871 --> 01:29:32,396
<i>Yours and mine. Our secret.</i>

804
01:29:33,374 --> 01:29:35,308
<i>And after you've done</i>
<i>what I teach you...</i>

805
01:29:36,177 --> 01:29:40,113
<i>... you will forget it forever.</i>

806
01:29:40,715 --> 01:29:43,548
<i>Forever. Forever.</i>

807
01:29:45,353 --> 01:29:48,049
<i>And now you may</i>
<i>open your eyes again.</i>

808
01:29:48,356 --> 01:29:50,517
<i>Each of you has been given</i>
<i>a present...</i>

809
01:29:50,725 --> 01:29:52,989
<i>... such a prettily wrapped present.</i>

810
01:29:53,194 --> 01:29:56,322
<i>Now is the time to open them.</i>
<i>Open them.</i>

811
01:30:02,003 --> 01:30:04,597
<i>You see, they're beautiful...</i>

812
01:30:04,772 --> 01:30:07,434
<i>... and you're longing to know</i>
<i>what's inside.</i>

813
01:30:09,543 --> 01:30:12,876
<i>You may use anything</i>
<i>but the atomizer...</i>

814
01:30:14,649 --> 01:30:16,947
<i>... which you must never touch,</i>
<i>never...</i>

815
01:30:17,652 --> 01:30:21,588
<i>... until I tell you how and where</i>
<i>to use it.</i>

816
01:30:21,789 --> 01:30:23,757
<i>Open the compact.</i>

817
01:30:27,295 --> 01:30:29,456
<i>Adjust the bottom control.</i>

818
01:30:31,766 --> 01:30:35,793
<i>Every night at exactly 12:00,</i>
<i>you must be alone...</i>

819
01:30:35,970 --> 01:30:38,302
<i>... so you can switch on</i>
<i>that receiver...</i>

820
01:30:38,906 --> 01:30:40,965
<i>... and listen for my voice.</i>

821
01:30:41,208 --> 01:30:44,177
<i>I'll tell you what to do,</i>
<i>I will tell you when...</i>

822
01:30:44,578 --> 01:30:46,273
<i>... and I will tell you how.</i>

823
01:30:46,447 --> 01:30:47,971
<i>After you've heard what I say...</i>

824
01:30:48,215 --> 01:30:51,150
<i>... push the mirror back</i>
<i>to conceal the receiver again.</i>

825
01:30:51,319 --> 01:30:54,288
<i>Push it back now</i>
<i>and close the case.</i>

826
01:31:00,194 --> 01:31:02,992
<i>Now rest again. Rest.</i>

827
01:31:04,699 --> 01:31:05,996
<i>Rest.</i>

828
01:31:06,567 --> 01:31:09,764
<i>In a few minutes, you will wake up.</i>

829
01:31:10,004 --> 01:31:12,905
<i>You will not remember</i>
<i>what I just told you...</i>

830
01:31:13,341 --> 01:31:15,707
<i>... until you return home.</i>

831
01:32:28,082 --> 01:32:31,711
- What a lovely present.
- I don't feel too good.

832
01:32:33,354 --> 01:32:36,084
Please, girls, we are in a hurry.

833
01:32:45,199 --> 01:32:46,826
Merry Christmas.

834
01:33:10,124 --> 01:33:12,319
Maybe you should've
been gift-wrapped.

835
01:35:20,654 --> 01:35:21,848
Flare.

836
01:35:27,962 --> 01:35:31,227
- He's making for the village.
- Head him off at the precipice.

837
01:36:28,722 --> 01:36:29,882
Idiot!

838
01:38:35,582 --> 01:38:38,244
Goodbye, girls. Merry Christmas.

839
01:38:38,452 --> 01:38:40,352
And a happy New Year.

840
01:38:45,092 --> 01:38:46,719
Goodbye!

841
01:39:50,324 --> 01:39:51,484
Bye!

842
01:40:15,682 --> 01:40:17,172
Come on.

843
01:42:06,493 --> 01:42:08,290
James.

844
01:42:11,965 --> 01:42:13,364
Darling, what is it?

845
01:42:13,567 --> 01:42:16,001
- There's people after me.
- Can I help?

846
01:42:16,236 --> 01:42:18,898
- Have you got a car?
- Outside.

847
01:42:21,475 --> 01:42:23,067
Let's get out of here.

848
01:42:34,221 --> 01:42:35,415
Stay close to me.

849
01:42:55,509 --> 01:42:56,703
Not far now.

850
01:43:01,682 --> 01:43:03,013
Near-side door.

851
01:43:24,871 --> 01:43:28,329
- Maybe he didn't see me.
- I wouldn't go "Banco!" on that.

852
01:43:28,542 --> 01:43:30,237
Giving up bad habits?

853
01:43:30,444 --> 01:43:34,005
- Where are we heading?
- Nearest post office to contact London.

854
01:43:35,315 --> 01:43:37,977
I know, Feldkirch.
Why are they looking for you?

855
01:43:38,852 --> 01:43:41,252
I suspect they're trying to kill me.

856
01:43:42,255 --> 01:43:43,654
Drive on!

857
01:43:48,962 --> 01:43:50,156
No sign of them yet.

858
01:43:50,697 --> 01:43:53,165
Or of someone saying thank you.

859
01:43:53,567 --> 01:43:57,560
Thank you, Tracy. You've got
sharp eyes and beautiful...

860
01:43:58,338 --> 01:44:01,364
Earlobes. What were you doing
so near Piz Gloria?

861
01:44:01,575 --> 01:44:03,566
Now I have a new interest in life.

862
01:44:03,777 --> 01:44:05,267
Winter sports? Very wholesome.

863
01:44:05,479 --> 01:44:09,415
Just one winter sportsman,
and Papa told me where to find him.

864
01:44:14,187 --> 01:44:16,621
Just keep my mind on your driving.

865
01:44:20,060 --> 01:44:23,086
Good. There it is, James. Hurry.

866
01:44:43,817 --> 01:44:45,284
James!

867
01:45:10,277 --> 01:45:11,301
Shoot at them!

868
01:45:13,547 --> 01:45:14,571
Good girl.

869
01:45:56,723 --> 01:45:58,384
That crowd might discourage them.

870
01:46:23,149 --> 01:46:25,208
Looks like we've hit the rush hour.

871
01:46:39,032 --> 01:46:40,624
We must stop them!

872
01:46:42,435 --> 01:46:43,868
How do we get out?

873
01:46:54,748 --> 01:46:56,272
Knock him out of the way!

874
01:47:05,825 --> 01:47:07,884
I hope my big end
will stand up to this.

875
01:47:25,779 --> 01:47:27,747
James! How do we get out?

876
01:47:46,933 --> 01:47:48,332
Keep straight!

877
01:48:03,316 --> 01:48:06,308
- We can get out there.
- Lf you say so.

878
01:48:19,332 --> 01:48:21,766
We didn't even stop for the prize.

879
01:48:22,802 --> 01:48:25,498
I told you that crowd
would discourage them.

880
01:48:44,991 --> 01:48:46,982
That's all we need right now.

881
01:48:58,605 --> 01:48:59,833
Pull in there.

882
01:49:11,351 --> 01:49:13,444
Keep moving. I'll open the doors.

883
01:49:32,639 --> 01:49:35,073
Sorry about the accommodations,
contessa.

884
01:49:35,275 --> 01:49:37,470
We should have rung ahead
and booked.

885
01:49:38,878 --> 01:49:40,539
If only I'd got through to London.

886
01:49:40,713 --> 01:49:42,943
- At least you'll get another chance.
- But when?

887
01:50:04,437 --> 01:50:07,270
Let's get some rest.
We'll push on as soon as we can.

888
01:50:08,108 --> 01:50:10,008
At least it's dry.

889
01:50:36,002 --> 01:50:38,664
What really went on
up there, James?

890
01:50:40,106 --> 01:50:43,041
Her Majesty's Secret Service
is still my job.

891
01:50:44,911 --> 01:50:48,472
But there isn't anything you can do
about it at the moment, is there?

892
01:50:48,648 --> 01:50:50,115
No.

893
01:50:55,955 --> 01:50:58,651
Then why are you thinking
about it now?

894
01:51:00,193 --> 01:51:01,785
I'm not.

895
01:51:06,666 --> 01:51:08,531
I'm thinking about us.

896
01:51:13,506 --> 01:51:18,534
Tracy, an agent shouldn't be
concerned with anything but himself.

897
01:51:21,748 --> 01:51:25,684
I understand. We'll just
have to go on the way we are.

898
01:51:26,152 --> 01:51:27,312
No.

899
01:51:29,322 --> 01:51:31,847
I'll have to find
something else to do.

900
01:51:34,394 --> 01:51:35,986
Are you sure, James?

901
01:51:39,032 --> 01:51:40,465
I love you.

902
01:51:41,501 --> 01:51:44,197
I know I'll never find
another girl like you.

903
01:51:47,707 --> 01:51:49,038
Will you marry me?

904
01:52:00,286 --> 01:52:01,617
Do you mean it?

905
01:52:02,422 --> 01:52:03,787
I mean it.

906
01:52:17,070 --> 01:52:20,130
Mr. And Mrs. James Bond.

907
01:52:21,007 --> 01:52:24,499
Of Acacia Avenue, Tunbridge Wells.

908
01:52:25,078 --> 01:52:26,978
How about Belgrave Square?

909
01:52:27,146 --> 01:52:29,376
Or the Via Veneto, Rome.

910
01:52:29,649 --> 01:52:32,550
Paris, convenient for Le Touquet.

911
01:52:32,752 --> 01:52:35,744
Monaco, handy for the Rainiers.

912
01:52:38,224 --> 01:52:41,057
I wonder how much they're asking
for this place.

913
01:52:45,398 --> 01:52:48,333
The proper time for this
is our wedding night.

914
01:52:49,802 --> 01:52:51,929
And that's my New Year's resolution.

915
01:52:52,138 --> 01:52:54,971
- Whatever you say, darling.
- And that is yours.

916
01:53:01,114 --> 01:53:02,581
Good night, Tracy.

917
01:53:04,350 --> 01:53:06,045
Good night, James.

918
01:53:24,304 --> 01:53:26,363
It's not New Year yet.

919
01:54:17,957 --> 01:54:19,117
- James!
- Keep going!

920
01:54:58,598 --> 01:55:00,395
- Simple!
- Good girl.

921
01:55:35,101 --> 01:55:36,193
He had lots of guts.

922
01:55:45,278 --> 01:55:46,905
You three keep going.

923
01:56:30,389 --> 01:56:32,186
Let's head for the trees!

924
01:57:04,991 --> 01:57:07,357
- James!
- Keep going!

925
01:57:13,299 --> 01:57:15,358
Tracy, cling onto me!

926
01:58:06,419 --> 01:58:10,446
A grave deep enough, I think,
to prevent even 007 from walking.

927
01:58:14,594 --> 01:58:15,959
Get the girl.

928
01:58:44,690 --> 01:58:47,386
<i>United Nations, sir. Red scrambler.</i>

929
01:58:48,628 --> 01:58:49,890
M here.

930
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:56,891
Yes, we're standing by
as instructed.

931
01:58:59,005 --> 01:59:00,597
I understand.

932
01:59:03,209 --> 01:59:04,506
Thank you, sir.

933
01:59:05,544 --> 01:59:07,444
No decision
has been announced yet.

934
01:59:07,647 --> 01:59:09,638
Of course, it's a total news blackout.

935
01:59:09,849 --> 01:59:12,716
But my informant was very plain.

936
01:59:12,952 --> 01:59:15,978
- How plain, sir?
- They're going to buy Blofeld off.

937
01:59:18,624 --> 01:59:20,524
Sit down.

938
01:59:21,060 --> 01:59:23,858
- And the price?
- Amnesty.

939
01:59:24,063 --> 01:59:26,395
A full pardon for all past crimes.

940
01:59:26,565 --> 01:59:28,829
Official recognition of his title...

941
01:59:29,035 --> 01:59:33,438
...when he retires into private life
as Count de Bleuchamp.

942
01:59:34,740 --> 01:59:37,504
He seems to set great store by that.

943
01:59:38,744 --> 01:59:40,473
A very curious thing, snobbery.

944
01:59:40,680 --> 01:59:43,148
- When will they conclude the deal?
- Blofeld wants to know...

945
01:59:43,349 --> 01:59:46,841
...the council's decision not later
than midnight the day after tomorrow.

946
01:59:47,019 --> 01:59:49,681
That gives us time
to get to Piz Gloria first. In force.

947
01:59:49,855 --> 01:59:52,346
No, 007. My instructions are clear.

948
01:59:52,558 --> 01:59:55,721
Destroy the institute and destroy
Blofeld and his virus with it.

949
01:59:55,961 --> 01:59:59,488
It's been rejected as too risky.
Those girls...

950
02:00:00,833 --> 02:00:03,324
God knows how many,
let alone where.

951
02:00:03,536 --> 02:00:07,563
If we destroy the center of
communication controlling the girls...

952
02:00:07,773 --> 02:00:09,104
...they can do nothing.

953
02:00:09,275 --> 02:00:12,733
I have my orders, you have yours.
Forget it.

954
02:00:12,978 --> 02:00:15,344
The girl who helped me escape,
we just leave her?

955
02:00:16,082 --> 02:00:19,745
This department is not concerned
with your personal problems.

956
02:00:20,219 --> 02:00:24,019
This department owes her a debt.
She saved my life.

957
02:00:24,223 --> 02:00:25,713
Operation Bedlam is dead.

958
02:00:27,727 --> 02:00:29,991
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

959
02:00:30,529 --> 02:00:32,121
I understand.

960
02:00:34,033 --> 02:00:37,230
<i>Your call to Marc Draco,</i>
<i>head of Draco Construction.</i>

961
02:00:37,436 --> 02:00:38,926
- Hello, Draco?
- <i>Yes, who is it?</i>

962
02:00:39,138 --> 02:00:41,129
- James Bond.
- <i>Thank God, James.</i>

963
02:00:41,307 --> 02:00:43,275
I'd like to interest you
in a demolition deal...

964
02:00:43,442 --> 02:00:46,070
...that requires aerial activity
to install equipment.

965
02:00:53,018 --> 02:00:56,146
Are you sure we're going to find
Teresa when we get up there?

966
02:00:56,388 --> 02:01:00,449
I'm pretty certain. If not, there's
a good reason for going anyway.

967
02:01:00,626 --> 02:01:02,423
So you've explained.
Quite a crusade.

968
02:01:06,665 --> 02:01:08,963
It is a time for celebration.

969
02:01:09,568 --> 02:01:12,594
Perhaps, if they agree.

970
02:01:12,805 --> 02:01:17,037
They can do nothing else
and you know it, and they know it.

971
02:01:17,610 --> 02:01:21,842
I shall be able to offer you anything
your heart could wish for.

972
02:01:22,815 --> 02:01:24,510
Paid for with how many lives?

973
02:01:24,683 --> 02:01:29,052
Oh, come now, Tracy,
don't be so proud.

974
02:01:29,421 --> 02:01:33,016
Your own father's profession
is not entirely within the law.

975
02:01:33,192 --> 02:01:37,492
His brotherhood also have exotic
ways to keep it a closed shop.

976
02:01:39,698 --> 02:01:43,099
<i>Basle approach calling</i>
<i>unidentified aircraft.</i>

977
02:01:43,302 --> 02:01:45,429
<i>You're flying</i>
<i>in controlled airspace.</i>

978
02:01:45,604 --> 02:01:48,368
<i>We have no flight plan filed on you.</i>

979
02:01:48,641 --> 02:01:52,077
I think some people don't know
we're crusaders.

980
02:01:53,879 --> 02:01:57,474
Now, if you're very, very nice
to me...

981
02:01:57,683 --> 02:01:59,844
...I could make you my countess.

982
02:02:00,619 --> 02:02:02,951
But I'm already a countess.

983
02:02:03,389 --> 02:02:07,086
Whereas if you displease me, I can
promise you a very different estate.

984
02:02:07,293 --> 02:02:09,318
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes?

985
02:02:09,528 --> 02:02:12,190
There is something on the radio
you should hear.

986
02:02:13,599 --> 02:02:15,726
- Excuse me.
- <i>This is Zurich information...</i>

987
02:02:15,968 --> 02:02:18,402
<i>... calling unidentified aircraft.</i>
<i>Over.</i>

988
02:02:19,171 --> 02:02:22,504
<i>This is Zurich information</i>
<i>calling unidentified aircraft.</i>

989
02:02:22,708 --> 02:02:24,573
- Well?
- That helicopter is one of three.

990
02:02:24,743 --> 02:02:27,644
- None have answered air control.
- And?

991
02:02:27,813 --> 02:02:29,872
There are suspect aircraft
in the vicinity.

992
02:02:30,115 --> 02:02:33,050
- <i>pilot's name and destination.</i>
<i>Over.</i>

993
02:02:33,686 --> 02:02:37,679
Zurich, this is Foxtrot, Gulf, Sierra,
leading Red Cross helicopter flight...

994
02:02:37,890 --> 02:02:40,688
<i>... carrying Red Cross medical</i>
<i>supplies to Italy.</i>

995
02:02:40,893 --> 02:02:42,520
<i>What's the trouble? Over.</i>

996
02:02:42,728 --> 02:02:45,253
<i>We have no record</i>
<i>of your flight plan.</i>

997
02:02:45,497 --> 02:02:46,657
<i>Over.</i>

998
02:02:49,768 --> 02:02:53,602
<i>I repeat, we have no record of your</i>
<i>flight plan or registration. Over.</i>

999
02:02:53,772 --> 02:02:57,264
Then your registrations
must be out-of-date. Over.

1000
02:02:57,509 --> 02:02:59,943
<i>Foxtrot, Gulf, Sierra,</i>
<i>this is Zurich information.</i>

1001
02:03:00,179 --> 02:03:02,238
<i>You must land at Zurich and report.</i>

1002
02:03:02,448 --> 02:03:04,507
<i>I say again,</i>
<i>land at Zurich and report.</i>

1003
02:03:04,717 --> 02:03:07,845
- <i>Over.</i>
- Do you wish to commit murder?

1004
02:03:08,087 --> 02:03:10,146
I told you, this is a mercy flight...

1005
02:03:10,356 --> 02:03:13,655
<i>... carrying blood plasma</i>
<i>and emergency equipment...</i>

1006
02:03:13,859 --> 02:03:16,919
<i>... for the victims of the Italian</i>
<i>flood disaster...</i>

1007
02:03:17,429 --> 02:03:19,260
<i>... at Rovigo.</i>

1008
02:03:19,465 --> 02:03:20,591
<i>I repeat:</i>

1009
02:03:20,799 --> 02:03:24,030
Mercy flight. You understand me?

1010
02:03:25,271 --> 02:03:26,795
- <i>Gulf, Sierra?</i>
- <i>Yes?</i>

1011
02:03:27,039 --> 02:03:29,803
<i>Zurich. Very well,</i>
<i>you may proceed. Out.</i>

1012
02:03:30,042 --> 02:03:31,942
You see? It is nothing.

1013
02:03:32,177 --> 02:03:33,405
Seems to have settled it.

1014
02:03:33,612 --> 02:03:36,638
In case one or both of us
is delayed on the way home...

1015
02:03:36,815 --> 02:03:39,045
...it's better to have
a rendezvous for later.

1016
02:03:39,218 --> 02:03:42,710
Before we start getting sentimental,
I think we're being followed.

1017
02:03:42,922 --> 02:03:46,323
I've been thinking
about your proposition.

1018
02:03:47,960 --> 02:03:50,622
Please, tell me more.

1019
02:03:50,829 --> 02:03:54,265
<i>This is military air control.</i>
<i>There is no record of your mission.</i>

1020
02:03:54,466 --> 02:03:56,400
<i>Alter course to Zurich and land.</i>

1021
02:03:56,568 --> 02:03:59,059
<i>Fighters have been dispatched</i>
<i>to intercept you. Over.</i>

1022
02:03:59,271 --> 02:04:04,573
I suggest you check your records
again, carefully. Over.

1023
02:04:04,777 --> 02:04:07,302
<i>I repeat, return to Zurich</i>
<i>and land. Over.</i>

1024
02:04:07,513 --> 02:04:11,506
Check with Geneva. Check
with the Red Cross in Geneva.

1025
02:04:12,484 --> 02:04:14,748
Meanwhile, call off your air force.

1026
02:04:14,954 --> 02:04:18,412
- It is making my passengers sick.
- <i>Foxtrot, Gulf, Sierra...</i>

1027
02:04:18,624 --> 02:04:22,116
- <i>... you are carrying passengers?</i>
- Of course I am.

1028
02:04:23,162 --> 02:04:27,292
Distinguished representatives
of the world press.

1029
02:04:27,866 --> 02:04:30,664
They've had enough
of your nonsense. So have I.

1030
02:04:30,869 --> 02:04:32,461
<i>Over and out.</i>

1031
02:04:37,376 --> 02:04:41,972
There's a lot more to tell,
but there will be plenty of time later.

1032
02:04:42,448 --> 02:04:44,643
Take me to the Alpine room.

1033
02:04:44,883 --> 02:04:46,748
Are you unhappy here?

1034
02:04:48,187 --> 02:04:50,246
I want to see the dawn.

1035
02:04:51,156 --> 02:04:53,989
So poetic a pleasure.

1036
02:04:54,560 --> 02:04:57,825
What were all the world's charms
to mighty Paris...

1037
02:04:58,030 --> 02:05:01,693
...when he found that first dawn
in the arms of his Helen?

1038
02:05:03,535 --> 02:05:07,164
When do you expect the signal
accepting your terms?

1039
02:05:07,373 --> 02:05:10,399
Any time before midnight tonight.

1040
02:05:11,477 --> 02:05:15,038
"Thy dawn, O master of the world,
thy dawn.

1041
02:05:15,280 --> 02:05:18,078
For thee, the sunlight
creeps across the lawn.

1042
02:05:18,283 --> 02:05:20,911
For thee, the ships are drawn
down to the waves.

1043
02:05:21,687 --> 02:05:25,714
For thee, the markets throng
with myriad slaves.

1044
02:05:26,091 --> 02:05:29,060
For thee, the hammer
on the anvil rings.

1045
02:05:29,795 --> 02:05:31,092
For thee...

1046
02:05:31,730 --> 02:05:34,290
...the poet of beguilement sings."

1047
02:05:41,440 --> 02:05:43,874
- Helicopters! An attack!
- Get all positions covered!

1048
02:06:20,379 --> 02:06:21,573
Look to the girl!

1049
02:08:24,269 --> 02:08:26,863
- Tracy! Darling!
- Thank God, Teresa!

1050
02:08:27,906 --> 02:08:29,066
James, wait!

1051
02:08:30,275 --> 02:08:31,503
Guns make me nervous!

1052
02:08:31,710 --> 02:08:34,907
You've done your share.
Get her to safety.

1053
02:08:40,285 --> 02:08:41,343
Come on! Let's go!

1054
02:08:42,521 --> 02:08:43,715
And you!

1055
02:08:43,922 --> 02:08:46,482
Get the circuit set up now!
Let's go!

1056
02:09:25,831 --> 02:09:27,958
- All points covered?
- Yes, sir.

1057
02:10:26,458 --> 02:10:27,482
All set to blow?

1058
02:10:27,659 --> 02:10:30,787
The fuse is set for exactly
five minutes and 10 seconds.

1059
02:10:30,996 --> 02:10:32,623
The place will be sealed forever.

1060
02:10:32,831 --> 02:10:35,391
Will that give the Englishman
time to get out?

1061
02:10:35,901 --> 02:10:37,459
He knows the schedule.

1062
02:10:49,247 --> 02:10:51,078
- Where are you going?
- Where's James?

1063
02:10:51,249 --> 02:10:53,717
- He'll join us soon.
- But we can't leave him!

1064
02:10:53,885 --> 02:10:56,080
- He doesn't need help!
- I won't go without him!

1065
02:10:56,254 --> 02:10:57,812
You'll have to!

1066
02:10:59,624 --> 02:11:02,388
Spare the rod and spoil the child!

1067
02:11:12,671 --> 02:11:15,572
Five, four, three...

1068
02:11:15,774 --> 02:11:17,867
...two, one. Now!

1069
02:15:03,268 --> 02:15:04,428
He's branched off.

1070
02:15:29,894 --> 02:15:33,330
Never mind that.
Go and get the brandy, huh?

1071
02:15:33,531 --> 02:15:35,931
Five-star Hennessy, of course.

1072
02:15:59,424 --> 02:16:01,153
Your Royal Highnesses...

1073
02:16:01,359 --> 02:16:05,227
...my lords, ladies and gentlemen...

1074
02:16:05,430 --> 02:16:09,230
...the toast is,
the bride and bridegroom:

1075
02:16:09,434 --> 02:16:13,165
Mr. And Mrs. James Bond.

1076
02:16:21,746 --> 02:16:24,180
- Good luck, Teresa.
- Thank you.

1077
02:16:39,397 --> 02:16:41,490
Anyway, it's a pleasure...

1078
02:16:41,733 --> 02:16:45,100
...to meet the man who cost me
three of my best operatives.

1079
02:16:45,336 --> 02:16:48,533
Yes, November '64, the bullion job.

1080
02:16:48,740 --> 02:16:52,676
You even got away with quite
a chunk of the haul. Tell me...

1081
02:16:58,616 --> 02:17:00,106
Congratulations, 007.

1082
02:17:00,285 --> 02:17:03,015
I must confess that I've sometimes
thought you a little...

1083
02:17:03,188 --> 02:17:06,749
- Irresponsible?
- That's exactly the word. Thank you.

1084
02:17:06,991 --> 02:17:10,757
- This time, my boy, I can't complain.
- Nor can I.

1085
02:17:12,564 --> 02:17:13,588
- Teresa?
- Yes, Papa?

1086
02:17:13,765 --> 02:17:16,928
Look, James, I know that we haven't
always exactly seen...

1087
02:17:17,135 --> 02:17:20,036
Anyway, don't forget, if there's
anything you ever need...

1088
02:17:20,205 --> 02:17:23,538
Thank you. This time I've got the
gadgets, and I know how to use them.

1089
02:17:26,010 --> 02:17:28,877
Remember, obey your husband
in all things.

1090
02:17:29,080 --> 02:17:31,640
- You promise me?
- But of course I will.

1091
02:17:31,883 --> 02:17:34,215
As I always obeyed you.

1092
02:17:36,755 --> 02:17:40,020
Of course. Well, James,
I wish you luck.

1093
02:17:40,892 --> 02:17:44,328
For the first and last time.
Remember?

1094
02:17:44,496 --> 02:17:49,729
An old proverb: "Her price is far above
rubies, or even your million pounds."

1095
02:17:50,101 --> 02:17:52,626
Just because you are Mrs. Bond...

1096
02:17:52,837 --> 02:17:54,828
...don't forget my birthday.
- Have I ever?

1097
02:17:55,073 --> 02:17:58,065
Both of you, maybe all of you.

1098
02:17:59,778 --> 02:18:01,643
Come on, James.

1099
02:18:02,514 --> 02:18:05,677
Very happy. Be happy, my darling.

1100
02:18:06,384 --> 02:18:07,442
Come on.

1101
02:18:09,053 --> 02:18:10,452
On your way.

1102
02:18:11,589 --> 02:18:14,183
- Goodbye!
- Drive carefully!

1103
02:18:25,770 --> 02:18:28,671
Miss Moneypenny,
what would you do without me?

1104
02:18:28,873 --> 02:18:30,602
I always cry at weddings.

1105
02:18:30,809 --> 02:18:33,937
007 never had any respect
for government property.

1106
02:18:38,850 --> 02:18:41,341
You know, I haven't given you
a wedding present yet.

1107
02:18:41,586 --> 02:18:43,144
I had an idea about that.

1108
02:18:43,321 --> 02:18:45,687
Three girls, three boys.

1109
02:18:45,890 --> 02:18:48,450
- Pleased?
- Not bad for a start.

1110
02:18:50,328 --> 02:18:53,525
But, darling, now we have
all the time in the world.

1111
02:19:04,642 --> 02:19:06,041
Say it with flowers!

1112
02:19:06,244 --> 02:19:09,179
He's got a point. We do look like
an ad for a flower shop.

1113
02:19:09,514 --> 02:19:12,847
That reminds me, I didn't even
send you flowers.

1114
02:19:16,054 --> 02:19:19,114
Anyway, you have given me
a wedding present.

1115
02:19:19,891 --> 02:19:23,383
The best I could have: A future.

1116
02:19:24,229 --> 02:19:25,890
Mrs. Bond, shut...

1117
02:19:27,165 --> 02:19:30,157
...up. And don't eat it all at once.

1118
02:19:31,536 --> 02:19:34,061
- He loves me...
- Instinctively.

1119
02:19:34,272 --> 02:19:37,036
- Infuriatingly.
- Intensely.

1120
02:19:37,242 --> 02:19:38,470
In...

1121
02:19:38,743 --> 02:19:41,541
- In...
- In?

1122
02:19:41,713 --> 02:19:43,647
Indubitably.

1123
02:19:45,183 --> 02:19:47,083
First a boy, and then a girl.

1124
02:19:56,561 --> 02:19:58,256
It's Blofeld!

1125
02:19:59,631 --> 02:20:01,428
It's Blofeld.

1126
02:20:29,127 --> 02:20:30,424
It's all right.

1127
02:20:31,696 --> 02:20:35,063
It's quite all right, really.
She's having a rest.

1128
02:20:37,268 --> 02:20:39,099
We'll be going on soon.

1129
02:20:45,777 --> 02:20:49,440
There's no hurry, you see.
We have all the time in the world.
