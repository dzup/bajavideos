1
00:00:56,634 --> 00:01:00,229
BASED ON REAL EVENTS

2
00:02:12,677 --> 00:02:15,043
Mateo, son,
what are you doing there?

3
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:23,546
You're absolutely frozen, darling.

4
00:02:25,022 --> 00:02:27,183
Did you have another nightmare?

5
00:02:28,392 --> 00:02:30,690
Come on, get back into bed.

6
00:02:33,731 --> 00:02:35,164
That's it.

7
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,559
Can I sleep with you?

8
00:02:37,802 --> 00:02:41,465
Don't you worry, okay?
I'm going to get a glass of water.

9
00:02:51,716 --> 00:02:55,880
THE MUD BOY

10
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,779
Come on, wake up.

11
00:03:35,593 --> 00:03:37,584
I've got to go.

12
00:03:37,895 --> 00:03:40,056
This bed is so comfortable.

13
00:04:19,403 --> 00:04:21,633
Come on, get up,
there's warm bread.

14
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:30,213
Come on, move it!

15
00:04:30,348 --> 00:04:32,339
Three get off here.

16
00:04:42,293 --> 00:04:43,988
Let's see.

17
00:04:52,603 --> 00:04:55,572
What do you dream about
that scares you so much?

18
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,708
You dream about what happened
that night, don't you?

19
00:05:03,447 --> 00:05:06,075
Roque said he was going
to teach me a job.

20
00:05:06,384 --> 00:05:10,115
Did he? What's wrong? Don't you want
to be my assistant anymore?

21
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,031
Aren't you going to say goodbye?

22
00:05:26,103 --> 00:05:27,832
It doesn't matter.

23
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,040
I'm still worried about Mateo.

24
00:05:35,312 --> 00:05:38,247
You should find work for the kid.

25
00:05:39,417 --> 00:05:41,248
It's about time
he brought some money in.

26
00:05:41,385 --> 00:05:42,784
Doing what?

27
00:05:42,887 --> 00:05:46,288
Rolling cigarettes 17 hours a day
for one peso a week?

28
00:05:47,725 --> 00:05:49,625
I want something different.

29
00:05:49,894 --> 00:05:52,692
What do you want,
to turn the boy into a gentleman?

30
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:58,800
At least you'd get him off the streets,
where he's in danger.

31
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:04,064
You're spoiling him, Estela.

32
00:06:04,408 --> 00:06:07,707
You know what I think,
the boy needs a bit of discipline.

33
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,117
You sleep with me when it suits you...

34
00:06:14,218 --> 00:06:16,948
and you think you have the right
to tell me how to bring up my son?

35
00:06:17,054 --> 00:06:21,218
Hey, don't speak like that,
as if I only came by once a month.

36
00:06:21,358 --> 00:06:23,189
Come on...

37
00:06:25,963 --> 00:06:27,692
After all...

38
00:06:29,366 --> 00:06:33,700
for several years now
it's suited me virtually every day.

39
00:07:25,122 --> 00:07:26,817
You won the race.

40
00:07:27,525 --> 00:07:30,187
-But look.
-Did you steal them?

41
00:07:31,095 --> 00:07:34,496
They're yours for two cents.
They'd be perfect for your mother.

42
00:07:36,901 --> 00:07:38,732
I don't have any money.

43
00:07:38,936 --> 00:07:40,733
They cost ten cents in the shop.

44
00:07:40,938 --> 00:07:43,372
If you like,
I'll show you how to get them.

45
00:07:44,141 --> 00:07:46,268
My mother says stealing is wrong.

46
00:07:46,377 --> 00:07:49,175
All mothers say that, idiot.
You're a coward.

47
00:07:49,914 --> 00:07:51,745
I'm not a coward.

48
00:08:07,164 --> 00:08:08,495
-Excuse me.
-Palacios...

49
00:08:08,632 --> 00:08:11,567
Bring me a strong coffee,
then tell me about it.

50
00:08:13,437 --> 00:08:15,632
And don't look at me like that!
You are not my mother.

51
00:08:15,739 --> 00:08:19,197
It's just you look
like the living dead, boss.

52
00:08:19,944 --> 00:08:22,310
That is exactly what I am.

53
00:08:33,157 --> 00:08:35,318
Are you looking for something, sir?

54
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,954
-Shall I help with those cases?
-No, thanks.

55
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:44,928
Do you want to earn twenty cents?

56
00:08:45,069 --> 00:08:47,162
Yes, of course.
Who doesn't?

57
00:08:47,338 --> 00:08:49,568
Come here. Look...

58
00:08:50,474 --> 00:08:52,237
I'm a photographer.

59
00:08:52,309 --> 00:08:55,801
I'd like to take some photos
of you with that girl.

60
00:08:55,913 --> 00:08:57,574
Do you know her?

61
00:09:13,931 --> 00:09:16,593
You're the most beautiful woman
in the neighborhood.

62
00:09:36,887 --> 00:09:39,048
Let's see.
Come over here.

63
00:09:41,892 --> 00:09:44,452
That's it, there.

64
00:09:44,962 --> 00:09:49,331
Together, look that way.

65
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,064
Very good.
What a pretty face!

66
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:55,297
That's right. Wait here.
I'm going to prepare the equipment.

67
00:09:58,142 --> 00:10:00,440
Give me the money without her seeing.

68
00:10:10,354 --> 00:10:12,822
Let's see, get a bit closer to her.

69
00:10:12,923 --> 00:10:15,153
A bit more. Really close.

70
00:10:15,225 --> 00:10:17,750
Right next to each other.

71
00:10:18,462 --> 00:10:21,954
Very good. But don't look at me,
look at each other.

72
00:10:22,733 --> 00:10:24,200
Let's see.

73
00:10:24,501 --> 00:10:26,526
Good, very good.

74
00:10:26,603 --> 00:10:30,130
Perfect. Let's see.
Now, give her a kiss.

75
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,505
Give her a kiss.

76
00:10:34,378 --> 00:10:37,711
That's it.
Hold it there.

77
00:10:38,215 --> 00:10:42,083
Perfect. Very good, very good.

78
00:10:42,386 --> 00:10:46,186
Let's see, now pull her skirt down.

79
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,820
Don't be afraid, pull it down.

80
00:10:56,633 --> 00:10:58,533
Go on, pull it down.

81
00:11:01,271 --> 00:11:03,967
That's it... More...

82
00:11:06,276 --> 00:11:07,675
Very good.

83
00:11:07,778 --> 00:11:11,077
Very good. Let's see, one more.

84
00:11:11,382 --> 00:11:14,749
Now, pull her knickers down.

85
00:11:17,321 --> 00:11:19,255
Go on, pull them down.

86
00:11:19,656 --> 00:11:21,886
Don't be afraid, pull them down.

87
00:11:25,429 --> 00:11:27,090
No, I don't want to!

88
00:11:30,434 --> 00:11:32,231
All right, stay there.

89
00:11:34,371 --> 00:11:36,965
Little devil!
Watch where you're running!

90
00:11:37,074 --> 00:11:38,473
Mateo!

91
00:11:38,909 --> 00:11:42,174
Come on, slacker!
Get to work, this is the last one.

92
00:11:42,946 --> 00:11:44,811
Go on, man, go on!

93
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,083
Be careful, son!

94
00:11:54,224 --> 00:11:57,352
I have enough work sewing clothes.
Don't make me wash them.

95
00:11:58,062 --> 00:11:59,859
Come on, help me pick them up.

96
00:11:59,963 --> 00:12:01,294
No.

97
00:12:01,398 --> 00:12:04,231
Mateo, help me, now! Come on.

98
00:12:05,736 --> 00:12:07,135
I don't want to.

99
00:12:07,237 --> 00:12:10,764
And what do you want,
for me to beat you, like Octavio says?

100
00:12:15,612 --> 00:12:18,479
What's up with you?
I work my fingers to the bone...

101
00:12:18,682 --> 00:12:20,843
to give you everything you need
and this is how you repay me?

102
00:12:30,527 --> 00:12:32,461
Where did you get this from?

103
00:12:33,697 --> 00:12:35,892
I can bring you money too...

104
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,797
Like Octavio does.

105
00:12:41,572 --> 00:12:44,507
Go to your room, right now.
Now, Mateo!

106
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:48,970
Come on, Mateo, stop crying.
I won't punish you if you promise...

107
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:52,202
-you'll never do it again.
-I'm scared, mum.

108
00:13:55,345 --> 00:13:57,210
Another nightmare?

109
00:13:58,582 --> 00:14:00,641
Listen, tomorrow
we're going to the hospital...

110
00:14:00,784 --> 00:14:03,412
-so the doctors can see you.
-No, no, mum.

111
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,555
I don't want to tell anyone else,
just you. Promise me.

112
00:14:07,558 --> 00:14:10,550
Look, there's no need to feel ashamed.

113
00:14:11,061 --> 00:14:13,359
Lots of children have nightmares.

114
00:14:16,366 --> 00:14:19,028
But this time I wasn't asleep.

115
00:14:31,081 --> 00:14:32,912
What's this?

116
00:14:35,118 --> 00:14:36,949
Mateo, what's this?

117
00:14:37,521 --> 00:14:39,182
I found it.

118
00:14:40,524 --> 00:14:42,253
Look at me.

119
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,428
The money you gave me,
did you find that too?

120
00:15:19,496 --> 00:15:21,760
I don't think he was raped,

121
00:15:21,965 --> 00:15:24,866
but I won't know for sure
until the autopsy is done.

122
00:15:35,512 --> 00:15:37,776
You can't go on like this, Petrie.

123
00:15:38,315 --> 00:15:40,283
You need more sleep.

124
00:15:41,418 --> 00:15:45,286
You won't bring your wife back to life
by destroying yourself.

125
00:15:47,024 --> 00:15:49,458
It's not just that, Soria...

126
00:15:51,161 --> 00:15:54,688
The problem is the emptiness
that seems to invade all of us.

127
00:15:56,433 --> 00:15:58,492
It doesn't matter what we do.

128
00:15:59,503 --> 00:16:02,370
Every day a ship arrives
full of starving people.

129
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,444
They live like animals...

130
00:16:09,713 --> 00:16:11,908
and so they become animals.

131
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,551
You're wrong there.

132
00:16:16,486 --> 00:16:20,320
Animals aren't capable
of perversions like this.

133
00:16:39,109 --> 00:16:40,633
What do you think?

134
00:16:45,816 --> 00:16:47,477
Looks like magnesium.

135
00:16:54,358 --> 00:16:55,985
-Good morning.
-Yes?

136
00:17:01,131 --> 00:17:02,689
For you.

137
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:07,159
What do you want?

138
00:17:07,871 --> 00:17:09,338
To come in.

139
00:17:10,674 --> 00:17:12,642
It's complicated.

140
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:14,768
It's going to take a lot more than that.

141
00:17:15,045 --> 00:17:19,175
-Don't you understand my problem?
-That has nothing to do with us.

142
00:17:19,516 --> 00:17:22,679
-Is she the owner of the house?
-Mrs. Eulalia Galán, the owner.

143
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:25,686
Superintendent Lautaro Petrie,
in charge of this case.

144
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:27,256
Very well, lady.

145
00:17:27,457 --> 00:17:30,654
You say you gave the keys
to Mr. Luchessi and Mr. Marino,

146
00:17:30,861 --> 00:17:34,524
they returned them to you and told you
they'd found a dead body in the house,

147
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:36,663
and you let them go.

148
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,702
A real fright they got,
those two gentlemen.

149
00:17:40,303 --> 00:17:44,034
-Do you give the keys to just anyone?
-I've got to look after the shop.

150
00:17:44,207 --> 00:17:47,734
I give people the keys
and later they give them back to me.

151
00:17:47,944 --> 00:17:49,605
But just in case they forget,

152
00:17:49,713 --> 00:17:51,874
I write down all the addresses.

153
00:17:52,682 --> 00:17:55,981
You have all the details of the people
who have visited the house recently?

154
00:17:56,086 --> 00:17:58,020
Yes, of course, I have them here.

155
00:18:04,494 --> 00:18:06,724
Mr. Luchessi and Mr. Marino...

156
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,321
Live in Colombres Street 642.

157
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:12,429
They wanted to rent the house
as a painting studio.

158
00:18:12,636 --> 00:18:16,367
There are lots of artists
in the neighborhood: actors,

159
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,475
-models...
-Any photographers?

160
00:18:23,613 --> 00:18:24,841
Yes.

161
00:18:25,649 --> 00:18:27,708
Yes. Mr. Garcés.

162
00:18:27,951 --> 00:18:30,442
He lives at Chile Street, 84.

163
00:18:30,554 --> 00:18:34,217
He visited the house two weeks ago,
he seemed very interested.

164
00:18:34,724 --> 00:18:37,215
Can we keep the notebook
to check the other details?

165
00:18:37,294 --> 00:18:40,491
Octavio!
How did this idiot get in here?

166
00:18:40,697 --> 00:18:43,860
Sorry, sir.
He must have slipped past.

167
00:18:49,673 --> 00:18:51,265
Is this yours?

168
00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:55,241
-No, it's not mine.
-All right.

169
00:18:55,479 --> 00:18:58,039
You and I have to talk
back at the police station.

170
00:19:00,517 --> 00:19:01,984
What is it, Palacios?

171
00:19:02,185 --> 00:19:04,983
Can't you even stop
scum like that getting in?

172
00:19:12,562 --> 00:19:14,689
Can I tell you something, mum?

173
00:19:16,433 --> 00:19:18,526
Of course you can.
Come here.

174
00:19:21,371 --> 00:19:22,531
What?

175
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,108
I think they've killed
my friend Arturo.

176
00:19:26,843 --> 00:19:28,435
I saw it.

177
00:19:31,548 --> 00:19:33,243
Why do you say that?

178
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,608
What did you see? Tell me.

179
00:19:38,321 --> 00:19:41,154
They beat him
and there was a lot of blood,

180
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:44,919
then they hanged him by the neck
on the merry-go-round.

181
00:19:48,965 --> 00:19:50,523
Mateo...

182
00:19:51,735 --> 00:19:53,327
I think
you're still having nightmares...

183
00:19:53,403 --> 00:19:56,497
about what happened that night
when you were little.

184
00:19:59,376 --> 00:20:02,539
But that doesn't give you the right
to those tempers of yours,

185
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,377
or to treat me bad.

186
00:20:11,588 --> 00:20:14,079
Are you going to tell me
where you got that?

187
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:22,089
A man dropped it and I picked it up.

188
00:20:44,254 --> 00:20:47,485
Superintendent,
come and see this.

189
00:21:15,285 --> 00:21:17,879
What kind of man could do
something like this?

190
00:21:31,968 --> 00:21:33,492
Is everything okay?

191
00:21:34,204 --> 00:21:36,001
It's Mateo.

192
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,274
He says he saw how they killed
a friend of his.

193
00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:41,276
-Today?
-Yes.

194
00:21:41,778 --> 00:21:43,712
I promised I wouldn't tell you, but...

195
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,973
I don't know what's wrong with him.

196
00:21:49,552 --> 00:21:51,110
Let's go in.

197
00:22:06,002 --> 00:22:09,563
-And where did this come from?
-He said he found it.

198
00:22:14,144 --> 00:22:17,602
Today I saw a box like this one
in the house where they killed a boy.

199
00:22:18,715 --> 00:22:20,580
Your son is in serious trouble.

200
00:22:20,684 --> 00:22:23,050
Perhaps it was there he saw the murder.

201
00:22:23,186 --> 00:22:26,678
No, he says he saw it in a dream,
while he was here with me.

202
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:30,155
And if your kid tells you he flew
right over to the other side of town,

203
00:22:30,226 --> 00:22:32,956
-do you believe him as well?
-Listen, Octavio.

204
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,962
I know my son,
I know when he's lying.

205
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:38,862
I'm sure there are bad things
going on in his head.

206
00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:40,534
Okay.

207
00:22:41,971 --> 00:22:46,237
Soria, the police doctor,
is an acquaintance of mine.

208
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:50,976
Tomorrow we'll go to see him,
ask him to have a look at the boy.

209
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,775
But we'll have to keep
an eye on him all the same.

210
00:22:57,187 --> 00:22:59,485
You've been too lenient with him.

211
00:23:07,497 --> 00:23:10,466
Darling, Octavio knows a doctor...

212
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:12,567
who's going to have a look
at you tomorrow.

213
00:23:12,902 --> 00:23:14,767
You're a liar, mum!

214
00:23:15,004 --> 00:23:18,132
-You promised you wouldn't tell anyone!
-Don't speak to me like that, Mateo.

215
00:23:18,374 --> 00:23:21,810
And you! You can just keep out of it!

216
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,603
-Mateo, please!
-Don't touch me!

217
00:23:25,415 --> 00:23:27,542
Calm down.
You see what he's like?

218
00:23:27,617 --> 00:23:29,608
-All right, let go of him.
-I'm going out...

219
00:23:29,719 --> 00:23:32,813
see if he calms down a bit.
Calm down!

220
00:23:33,156 --> 00:23:36,785
Listen to me, calm down!
You get a hold of him!

221
00:24:03,186 --> 00:24:04,744
Son!

222
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:08,721
Son!

223
00:24:15,398 --> 00:24:18,663
I swear I'll kill the son of a bitch
who did this.

224
00:24:19,702 --> 00:24:21,636
I swear, son.

225
00:24:45,161 --> 00:24:47,721
It seems that someone let things
get a bit out of hand.

226
00:24:47,931 --> 00:24:50,661
A photographer,
who's a bit queer, you see?

227
00:24:50,834 --> 00:24:53,325
But he doesn't really do
any harm to anyone.

228
00:24:53,837 --> 00:24:57,705
With dead kids you don't make money.
And people get nervous.

229
00:24:58,007 --> 00:24:59,838
So, do you know who it was?

230
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:03,270
You wouldn't want to bump
the photographer off, would you?

231
00:25:03,446 --> 00:25:07,212
What are you saying?
No, I'd take the backhander,

232
00:25:07,317 --> 00:25:09,945
but murder,
that's something quite different.

233
00:25:10,153 --> 00:25:13,247
I was just asking to know
if Estela's son was mixed up in it.

234
00:25:13,356 --> 00:25:16,484
Don't give me none of that fagot stuff.

235
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,322
There's a man,

236
00:25:18,494 --> 00:25:22,760
with lots of influence,
who's very worried about this thing,

237
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:27,667
because he's going to lose
a lot of money. You understand?

238
00:25:27,937 --> 00:25:30,633
And the person that sorts this out...

239
00:25:31,007 --> 00:25:33,475
will make a good deal of money.

240
00:25:34,878 --> 00:25:38,211
That Spanish woman you're screwing...

241
00:25:38,514 --> 00:25:40,982
You could give her a nice present.

242
00:25:41,084 --> 00:25:43,177
I don't need to give her presents.

243
00:25:43,586 --> 00:25:46,578
Where's she going to go,
single, with a kid and no house?

244
00:25:46,756 --> 00:25:50,487
As you wish,
but don't give me no crap, right?

245
00:25:51,094 --> 00:25:52,959
Be off with you!

246
00:26:08,244 --> 00:26:10,007
Read all about it!

247
00:26:10,179 --> 00:26:13,046
Boy murdered in Pavón Street!

248
00:26:13,349 --> 00:26:15,544
Read all about it!

249
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,683
<i>A disgusting, brutal crime!</i>

250
00:26:29,198 --> 00:26:32,031
I thought we could at least
avoid the photograph.

251
00:26:35,171 --> 00:26:37,435
Is there anyone among us
who doesn't have a price?

252
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:42,841
Did you find anything out?

253
00:26:43,012 --> 00:26:46,106
It seems it was a mistake.
Now, the perverts...

254
00:26:46,182 --> 00:26:48,377
are not satisfied
with forcing young kids.

255
00:26:48,985 --> 00:26:51,852
Now they also take photos of them
to sell them,

256
00:26:52,622 --> 00:26:56,183
but until this thing yesterday, as far
as we know, they hadn't killed anyone.

257
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,328
In this city, everything is sold.

258
00:27:00,496 --> 00:27:03,863
The police, innocence,

259
00:27:04,033 --> 00:27:05,933
silence...

260
00:27:07,103 --> 00:27:09,867
Money is destroying our souls, Palacios.

261
00:27:14,677 --> 00:27:16,611
I won't say anything.

262
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,948
Don't be so stubborn.

263
00:27:19,048 --> 00:27:21,812
You should be grateful
that Octavio is helping you.

264
00:27:37,367 --> 00:27:38,834
Hi, Mateo.

265
00:27:39,502 --> 00:27:40,935
Lady.

266
00:27:41,871 --> 00:27:46,035
Octavio told me you're not well
and that you've been having nightmares.

267
00:27:50,913 --> 00:27:54,041
-So, you don't sleep well?
-He's got a very lively imagination.

268
00:27:54,117 --> 00:27:57,450
He says he was at the place
where they killed the boy.

269
00:28:00,223 --> 00:28:03,249
-Is that right?
-No. I wasn't there, just...

270
00:28:03,426 --> 00:28:06,623
He also says he has visions,
as if he were a saint.

271
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:11,061
Would you mind leaving me
alone with the boy for a moment?

272
00:28:12,035 --> 00:28:14,970
-I want to ask him a few questions.
-Don't worry, darling.

273
00:28:15,071 --> 00:28:17,596
-The doctor just wants to help you.
-Come on.

274
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,247
Do you know who's under there?

275
00:28:30,987 --> 00:28:32,784
And how do you know?

276
00:28:32,889 --> 00:28:34,413
Did you know him?

277
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:36,954
It's Arturo, he lived on my block.

278
00:28:38,294 --> 00:28:40,455
Do you know who killed him?

279
00:28:41,364 --> 00:28:44,731
The boy needs to understand.
He's got to stop acting up.

280
00:28:50,006 --> 00:28:52,941
You'll see, from now on
he's going to behave better.

281
00:28:56,479 --> 00:28:58,538
Will you just stop?
Everything just makes you angry.

282
00:28:58,614 --> 00:29:00,582
Please, leave me alone.

283
00:29:04,821 --> 00:29:06,721
If I understood correctly,
in your dream you saw...

284
00:29:06,823 --> 00:29:09,383
how they beat your friend
until they killed him.

285
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:12,484
Yes, but he didn't die from the beating.

286
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:16,060
He was strangled with a cord.

287
00:29:18,134 --> 00:29:20,500
Mateo, this is the superintendent.

288
00:29:20,703 --> 00:29:23,228
He's in charge of all of us.

289
00:29:23,906 --> 00:29:26,875
-This is Octavio's son.
-I'm not Octavio's son.

290
00:29:27,243 --> 00:29:30,269
Right, but when you grow up you want
to be a policeman like him, don't you?

291
00:29:30,446 --> 00:29:32,209
I'm never going to be a policeman.

292
00:29:32,381 --> 00:29:34,281
And how come you know
so much about crimes...

293
00:29:34,383 --> 00:29:36,374
if you don't want to be a policeman?

294
00:29:46,696 --> 00:29:48,630
The boy's healthy...

295
00:29:49,398 --> 00:29:52,731
but those nightmares he has
are because he's a bit weak.

296
00:29:52,935 --> 00:29:56,393
If anything strange happens to him
or if he has nightmares again, tell me.

297
00:29:56,606 --> 00:29:58,597
I have a friend
at the San Roque Hospital...

298
00:29:58,708 --> 00:30:01,472
who would see him
without charging you anything. Okay?

299
00:30:03,513 --> 00:30:05,708
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much.

300
00:30:17,126 --> 00:30:19,788
No sign of violence
in the genital region.

301
00:30:20,596 --> 00:30:22,689
He wasn't sexually abused.

302
00:30:31,908 --> 00:30:34,399
The wounds on the head
aren't very deep.

303
00:30:35,144 --> 00:30:36,873
The boy was right.

304
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:41,016
He didn't die from the beating,
he was strangled to death.

305
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:43,042
When a crime appears in the papers,

306
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:45,144
you always get some loony
claiming to have had visions...

307
00:30:46,355 --> 00:30:49,290
Ignorance is the perfect
breeding ground for fantasy.

308
00:30:50,993 --> 00:30:53,723
So how did he know how he died?

309
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:57,422
The press didn't say anything
about the cord,

310
00:30:58,868 --> 00:31:00,961
nor can it be seen in the photo.

311
00:31:01,237 --> 00:31:05,230
Well, because his father told him,
or because he really was there.

312
00:31:05,575 --> 00:31:07,202
Who knows?

313
00:31:07,543 --> 00:31:10,512
Perhaps he has relations
with the same pervert.

314
00:31:11,881 --> 00:31:15,248
The truth is almost always hidden
in the simplest answers,

315
00:31:15,418 --> 00:31:17,352
or the most likely ones.

316
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,078
You should know that.

317
00:31:19,555 --> 00:31:21,147
I know,

318
00:31:21,224 --> 00:31:24,523
but sometimes
it's more human to believe.

319
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:41,199
What the fuck are you doing?
You little bastard!

320
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,574
Son of a bitch!

321
00:31:44,013 --> 00:31:47,676
Give it to me, give it to me,
you son of a bitch!

322
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:51,342
Get out of my sight, bastard!

323
00:31:52,521 --> 00:31:54,989
Give me the bottle!
Give me the bottle!

324
00:31:58,794 --> 00:32:00,386
What are you looking at?

325
00:32:00,463 --> 00:32:03,796
Can't you see I'm teaching
this little shit a lesson?

326
00:32:05,401 --> 00:32:07,335
I never want to see you again!

327
00:32:08,638 --> 00:32:10,833
Never again in my whole life!

328
00:32:29,792 --> 00:32:32,454
The clothes I need urgently
are marked with pins.

329
00:32:32,528 --> 00:32:34,894
These can wait a week,
more or less.

330
00:32:35,031 --> 00:32:38,091
I'm pretty busy at the moment,
I'll see if I can.

331
00:32:38,301 --> 00:32:40,531
But you have to tell me
if you can or not.

332
00:32:40,703 --> 00:32:42,967
I promised them two days at the most.

333
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,271
All right. In two days
I'll bring them to you.

334
00:33:32,521 --> 00:33:34,751
Help me!

335
00:33:35,291 --> 00:33:38,522
Help me!
Help me!

336
00:33:39,028 --> 00:33:40,859
Help me!

337
00:33:48,237 --> 00:33:50,102
-God almighty!
-Bring water!

338
00:33:50,606 --> 00:33:53,473
-Bring water!
-Bring water! Help! Help!

339
00:34:06,255 --> 00:34:08,223
What have they done?

340
00:34:09,892 --> 00:34:12,053
Sons of bitches!

341
00:34:12,161 --> 00:34:15,619
What have they done to my girl?

342
00:34:26,375 --> 00:34:29,435
Mateo! Mateo, please! Mateo!

343
00:34:39,088 --> 00:34:40,953
She began to scream.

344
00:34:43,292 --> 00:34:46,784
I couldn't move.
He knew I was there.

345
00:34:46,996 --> 00:34:49,965
He? Who's he?

346
00:34:53,169 --> 00:34:55,194
The murderer.

347
00:34:56,338 --> 00:34:57,862
Did you see him?

348
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,001
No.

349
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:03,508
There were only people in the shadows.

350
00:35:06,048 --> 00:35:08,608
I know he's the same one
that killed Arturo.

351
00:35:09,585 --> 00:35:11,348
He doesn't want me to see him.

352
00:35:17,927 --> 00:35:19,861
Why did you go out into the street?

353
00:35:20,529 --> 00:35:23,157
I knew he was going to hurt her.

354
00:35:23,566 --> 00:35:25,659
I didn't want to leave her alone.

355
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,870
Why did you light the match?

356
00:35:31,073 --> 00:35:32,973
I didn't light it.

357
00:35:34,143 --> 00:35:36,941
I just saw the box and I picked it up.

358
00:35:39,081 --> 00:35:42,175
How could you see the fairground
from your nightmares...

359
00:35:42,585 --> 00:35:44,143
and the street at the same time?

360
00:35:44,253 --> 00:35:45,880
I don't know...

361
00:35:46,121 --> 00:35:48,180
I only saw the fairground.

362
00:35:51,327 --> 00:35:54,854
Why are telling us all these stories
about enchanted fairgrounds...

363
00:35:55,631 --> 00:35:57,758
instead of telling us the truth?

364
00:36:02,037 --> 00:36:04,801
Well, all right.

365
00:36:07,643 --> 00:36:11,670
Stick him in a cell for the night,
see if he comes to his senses.

366
00:36:20,656 --> 00:36:24,319
If you want to know my opinion,
I think it's as suspicious as you do.

367
00:36:25,861 --> 00:36:27,726
But the visions...

368
00:36:29,865 --> 00:36:32,891
No one would invent
such an incredible alibi.

369
00:36:34,169 --> 00:36:37,536
Unless he was retarded...
or a child.

370
00:36:58,694 --> 00:37:02,528
Mateo will spend the night in the cell.
Tomorrow, I'll question him again.

371
00:37:02,831 --> 00:37:06,028
But he didn't do anything.
He was with me in Lupoff's shop.

372
00:37:06,135 --> 00:37:08,103
I only want him to tell me the truth.

373
00:37:08,571 --> 00:37:11,005
It's the second time
he's been related to an attack.

374
00:37:11,106 --> 00:37:13,631
There's one boy dead and the girl's
condition is very serious.

375
00:37:14,677 --> 00:37:18,010
-Let me speak to him, superintendent.
-Shut up, Estela.

376
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,808
The boy already thinks
you can always protect him.

377
00:37:20,983 --> 00:37:23,952
He needs discipline.
Leave it up to the superintendent.

378
00:37:24,053 --> 00:37:26,078
Mateo's telling us fantasies.

379
00:37:26,388 --> 00:37:29,050
If he doesn't collaborate,
he'll go to the reformatory.

380
00:37:29,258 --> 00:37:32,455
That would do him good,
that way he'd learn how to behave.

381
00:37:32,595 --> 00:37:34,586
Just shut up, will you?

382
00:37:35,164 --> 00:37:39,032
Superintendent, if you let me speak
to him I promise he'll collaborate.

383
00:37:39,134 --> 00:37:40,863
And why don't you collaborate?

384
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:44,371
Why don't you start by telling him
that the boy had a box...

385
00:37:44,573 --> 00:37:47,542
Like the one they found in the house
where Arturo was killed?

386
00:37:47,943 --> 00:37:49,740
He's spoilt, that kid!

387
00:37:49,845 --> 00:37:51,904
You're no one to tell me
how to bring up my child.

388
00:37:52,114 --> 00:37:54,241
When you tried giving him beatings
all you managed...

389
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:56,614
was to make him even more rebellious.
Don't make me shut up, no!

390
00:37:57,086 --> 00:38:00,487
Leave me alone, Octavio.
I can do this alone. Go, Octavio!

391
00:38:02,324 --> 00:38:05,487
Octavio, the lady is right,
this is not the right place.

392
00:38:06,395 --> 00:38:08,295
Why don't you go back to work?

393
00:38:17,673 --> 00:38:20,005
Is that thing
about the box of film true?

394
00:38:21,744 --> 00:38:24,406
He told me he found it in the street,
but I didn't believe him.

395
00:38:25,581 --> 00:38:27,208
Superintendent,
if you let me speak to him,

396
00:38:27,282 --> 00:38:31,048
I promise to tell you
everything he tells me. Please.

397
00:38:32,721 --> 00:38:34,086
All right.

398
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:36,151
I have to go out for a moment.

399
00:38:36,692 --> 00:38:38,626
I'll get someone
to take you to the cells,

400
00:38:39,161 --> 00:38:41,652
but then you have to tell me
everything he says.

401
00:38:41,764 --> 00:38:43,322
Yes, of course.

402
00:39:00,182 --> 00:39:02,912
It seems that the photographer
gave a false address.

403
00:39:04,486 --> 00:39:08,388
He knows I can see him, mum,
that's why he wants them to catch me.

404
00:39:10,459 --> 00:39:11,824
If I make friends with the murderer...

405
00:39:11,927 --> 00:39:15,192
and I see his face,
I can tell the cops.

406
00:39:15,864 --> 00:39:17,263
Yes, of course.

407
00:39:18,367 --> 00:39:20,562
But it's very important
that the police trust you,

408
00:39:21,003 --> 00:39:22,300
do you understand?

409
00:39:22,371 --> 00:39:25,499
If they think you're lying to them,
they'll lock you up in the reformatory.

410
00:39:26,942 --> 00:39:28,637
Do you believe me, mum?

411
00:39:34,116 --> 00:39:36,550
Where did you get that box of film from?

412
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:43,883
I stole it off a photographer...

413
00:39:46,061 --> 00:39:47,426
And the money?

414
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:49,994
The photographer gave it to me...

415
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:53,466
to help him take some photos
of a little girl with no clothes on.

416
00:40:09,084 --> 00:40:10,483
Excuse me...

417
00:40:10,586 --> 00:40:14,147
Do you know anyone
by the name of Garcés?

418
00:40:14,823 --> 00:40:16,381
No. No.

419
00:40:23,832 --> 00:40:25,424
And a photographer?

420
00:40:30,539 --> 00:40:32,234
I'm superintendent Petrie.

421
00:40:33,342 --> 00:40:36,675
Mr. Cebrián, the owner,
he's a photographer.

422
00:40:38,413 --> 00:40:40,347
-Could we speak to him?
-No, he's not here.

423
00:40:40,716 --> 00:40:43,378
He's never here during the day.
He usually comes here in the evening,

424
00:40:43,452 --> 00:40:45,283
to work in the laboratory.

425
00:40:46,388 --> 00:40:49,824
-Do people often use those plates?
-They're not plates, they're rolls.

426
00:40:50,259 --> 00:40:52,819
You load one
and you can take several photos.

427
00:40:53,128 --> 00:40:55,528
The boss imports them
from the United States.

428
00:41:05,274 --> 00:41:07,242
We'll continue later.

429
00:41:10,779 --> 00:41:12,747
He also says there's a photographer...

430
00:41:14,249 --> 00:41:18,777
who takes photos of naked children.

431
00:41:19,822 --> 00:41:21,790
We know that.

432
00:41:25,394 --> 00:41:27,453
If you know,
why don't you stop him?

433
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:32,267
That man offered my son money
to help him take photos of a girl.

434
00:41:33,168 --> 00:41:35,796
-Don't you think it's disgusting?
-Lady...

435
00:41:36,438 --> 00:41:40,272
In this country you can do
whatever you want with your body.

436
00:41:40,342 --> 00:41:42,537
It's a moral question,
not a criminal one.

437
00:41:47,583 --> 00:41:49,210
Can I take Mateo?

438
00:41:49,318 --> 00:41:53,482
No, not tonight.
Perhaps he'll remember more tomorrow.

439
00:41:56,458 --> 00:41:58,016
Valentín.

440
00:42:03,465 --> 00:42:06,957
Is that job still up for grabs?

441
00:42:11,974 --> 00:42:14,670
-So you want to be a murderer now?
-How much?

442
00:42:14,776 --> 00:42:16,266
I told you,

443
00:42:16,545 --> 00:42:19,537
enough to put that Spanish woman
of yours in her place.

444
00:42:19,615 --> 00:42:22,379
She's been getting
airs and graces recently.

445
00:42:22,484 --> 00:42:26,784
Just shut up about my Spanish woman.
I want to do it for the money, right?

446
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:29,855
The guy is half crazy.

447
00:42:31,326 --> 00:42:34,762
What you have to do is bump him off,
but make it look like suicide.

448
00:42:35,998 --> 00:42:37,863
Can you do that?

449
00:42:38,634 --> 00:42:40,568
Are you kidding?

450
00:42:40,802 --> 00:42:42,861
Those faggots...

451
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:47,040
He'll have snuffed it
before he knows what's hit him.

452
00:42:48,744 --> 00:42:51,542
It seems that everything points
to the photographer.

453
00:42:52,581 --> 00:42:54,742
In the Larrondo case, it's obvious,

454
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:58,717
but nobody saw a photographer
anywhere near the Lupoff girl.

455
00:43:01,189 --> 00:43:04,818
Mateo's mother told us
the boy worked for him.

456
00:43:06,128 --> 00:43:08,790
Perhaps the boy tried to get the girl
to go along with him,

457
00:43:08,964 --> 00:43:10,727
she refused and...

458
00:43:10,866 --> 00:43:13,835
I can't imagine the boy
setting the girl on fire.

459
00:43:15,938 --> 00:43:17,200
I don't know.

460
00:43:17,339 --> 00:43:19,603
Larrondo and Mateo were friends.

461
00:43:21,109 --> 00:43:25,102
Sometimes a person can transmit things
mentally to someone else,

462
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,580
images and sensations,
without having to be present.

463
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,584
You don't believe that stuff
about visions, do you?

464
00:43:33,889 --> 00:43:35,948
There are special people...

465
00:43:37,225 --> 00:43:41,184
Occasions on which one mind
can be affected by another.

466
00:43:43,165 --> 00:43:46,134
Sir, the cars are ready.

467
00:43:47,102 --> 00:43:49,502
I hope the photographer is in the store.

468
00:43:50,272 --> 00:43:52,365
And that he can clarify our doubts.

469
00:43:53,642 --> 00:43:56,270
I think we're all going crazy.

470
00:46:20,288 --> 00:46:21,949
He's still warm.

471
00:46:23,291 --> 00:46:25,452
Do you think it was suicide?

472
00:46:27,095 --> 00:46:30,030
No one packs his cases
to travel to the otherworld.

473
00:46:38,406 --> 00:46:38,707
Read all about it!

474
00:46:38,707 --> 00:46:40,299
Read all about it!

475
00:46:40,509 --> 00:46:44,036
The Pavón Street murderer found dead!

476
00:46:44,212 --> 00:46:46,680
<i>Read all about it!</i>

477
00:46:46,882 --> 00:46:50,477
<i>A girl burnt alive was his last victim!</i>

478
00:46:56,158 --> 00:46:58,524
Did you like spending the night alone?

479
00:47:06,535 --> 00:47:08,867
You can't go on treating me bad.

480
00:47:12,974 --> 00:47:14,202
Last night I was working...

481
00:47:14,376 --> 00:47:17,038
so that they'd leave
your little darling in peace.

482
00:47:18,747 --> 00:47:21,272
Now there’s a dead man
to take the blame.

483
00:47:31,293 --> 00:47:33,158
Estela, come with me, please.

484
00:47:45,373 --> 00:47:47,967
Now your son doesn't look so innocent.

485
00:47:53,715 --> 00:47:55,546
Mateo told me he only did it once.

486
00:47:58,286 --> 00:48:00,481
-Have they arrested the photographer?
-The law doesn't allow us...

487
00:48:00,589 --> 00:48:03,922
to arrest the dead,
even if they deserve it.

488
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:08,688
If Mateo had told us
about the photographer earlier,

489
00:48:09,231 --> 00:48:12,462
perhaps we could have prevented
the thing with the Lupoff girl.

490
00:48:15,637 --> 00:48:19,596
Superintendent, Soria is asking
if you can go down to the cells.

491
00:48:20,075 --> 00:48:22,202
You and the lady.

492
00:48:26,181 --> 00:48:27,876
No!

493
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:30,147
Leave me alone!

494
00:48:36,558 --> 00:48:38,992
What's wrong, darling?
What's wrong?

495
00:48:39,361 --> 00:48:41,625
No, please!
Mummy!

496
00:48:41,796 --> 00:48:43,923
Please, help me! Mummy!

497
00:48:44,065 --> 00:48:46,932
He's burying her alive!
He's burying her alive!

498
00:48:47,369 --> 00:48:50,031
-Mummy!
-He's going to kill her!

499
00:48:50,171 --> 00:48:52,696
Help! Mummy, help!

500
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:57,205
Where is he burying her?

501
00:49:00,015 --> 00:49:02,779
Could you tell us
where he's burying her?

502
00:49:07,956 --> 00:49:09,218
Yes.

503
00:49:31,546 --> 00:49:34,413
This is the place,
but this house wasn't here.

504
00:49:37,285 --> 00:49:39,253
It's all right, darling.

505
00:49:41,189 --> 00:49:43,089
Very good, lady.

506
00:49:43,391 --> 00:49:45,256
You can take the boy home.

507
00:49:46,328 --> 00:49:48,489
Let's hope
the death of the photographer...

508
00:49:48,596 --> 00:49:50,723
will put an end to this nightmare.

509
00:49:53,201 --> 00:49:55,260
Make sure he learns how to write.

510
00:49:55,770 --> 00:49:59,570
With the stories he invents
he could become a great novelist.

511
00:50:07,982 --> 00:50:10,542
Do you still believe
the boy has visions?

512
00:50:12,821 --> 00:50:14,345
I don't know.

513
00:50:15,757 --> 00:50:19,090
Perhaps the opiate I injected him with
altered his perception.

514
00:50:21,196 --> 00:50:24,256
Don't you think that maybe
the boy's experiencing a memory?

515
00:50:26,034 --> 00:50:28,434
This house must have been built
not long ago.

516
00:50:29,137 --> 00:50:31,071
You read too much, Soria.

517
00:50:33,775 --> 00:50:36,073
Are you going to let him go,
just like that?

518
00:50:37,779 --> 00:50:40,612
Mateo doesn't see visions,
but he knows something.

519
00:50:41,249 --> 00:50:43,479
He says that there's just one murderer,

520
00:50:43,752 --> 00:50:45,947
that Arturo was strangled to death...

521
00:50:46,988 --> 00:50:49,923
In Cebrián's photos
there are no signs of violence.

522
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:53,322
Arturo seems to be collaborating,
like Mateo, for money.

523
00:50:55,063 --> 00:50:57,793
But the birds
at the back of the house...

524
00:50:57,999 --> 00:51:00,524
indicate the presence of an undesirable.

525
00:51:01,669 --> 00:51:03,694
Someone who could have seen
how they take the photos...

526
00:51:03,805 --> 00:51:05,466
and then attack the boy.

527
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:10,771
This is not finished.

528
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:15,174
We're going to keep Mateo
under discreet surveillance.

529
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,642
<i>Perhaps he'll give himself away,</i>

530
00:51:17,819 --> 00:51:19,844
or lead us to the real murderer.

531
00:51:31,933 --> 00:51:33,195
Something wrong?

532
00:51:36,337 --> 00:51:37,964
I know.

533
00:51:38,606 --> 00:51:40,767
It's that Spanish tart
you're screwing.

534
00:51:41,609 --> 00:51:45,136
She's driving me crazy
with that bloody kid of hers.

535
00:51:45,814 --> 00:51:49,910
The thing is that bitch has got you
well and truly by the balls.

536
00:51:52,554 --> 00:51:56,183
If you like,
we can get the boy in the street.

537
00:51:57,358 --> 00:51:59,826
Those people baulk at nothing.

538
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:09,361
And where are you going to work
now that Blas has kicked you out?

539
00:52:11,606 --> 00:52:13,904
I don't know.
Maybe I'll get some odd jobs...

540
00:52:13,975 --> 00:52:16,000
here and there to earn some money.

541
00:52:16,578 --> 00:52:19,570
Well... If you like, you can come
with me and keep watch.

542
00:52:24,419 --> 00:52:27,513
No, I don't want to steal. I...

543
00:52:27,889 --> 00:52:30,050
I tried it and I don't like it.

544
00:52:31,092 --> 00:52:32,684
What's up? You go if you like.

545
00:52:32,894 --> 00:52:36,455
I'm saying it because I don't intend
to work all my life as a lamplighter.

546
00:52:36,831 --> 00:52:40,289
I prefer staying at home and sleeping,
not going out robbing like you.

547
00:52:41,302 --> 00:52:42,769
You're a thief.

548
00:52:46,107 --> 00:52:49,372
I'm a thief? Give me the bottle back,
because it's stolen, too.

549
00:52:50,745 --> 00:52:52,372
Go on, give it back to me!

550
00:53:03,825 --> 00:53:06,191
-What, Ramirito, who's winning?
-The elephant.

551
00:53:06,294 --> 00:53:07,886
Very good.

552
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:18,163
You have to forgive me, Estela.

553
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:21,165
I only wanted to help you.

554
00:53:24,913 --> 00:53:26,881
I bought you a present.

555
00:53:41,396 --> 00:53:45,127
Not even the finest ladies
have a ring like this one. Try it on.

556
00:53:45,233 --> 00:53:46,700
Are you crazy?

557
00:53:48,436 --> 00:53:50,666
This ring must have cost a fortune.

558
00:53:53,041 --> 00:53:54,269
Well.

559
00:53:56,144 --> 00:53:57,543
You see, darling?

560
00:53:59,414 --> 00:54:01,814
I know how to do things properly too.

561
00:54:06,387 --> 00:54:08,082
Let's get married...

562
00:54:09,891 --> 00:54:13,520
and have a child together. Yes?

563
00:54:16,064 --> 00:54:17,691
I've already got a child.

564
00:54:18,866 --> 00:54:20,128
Yes...

565
00:54:23,104 --> 00:54:25,129
Where did you get the money from?

566
00:54:26,941 --> 00:54:29,637
A job. You know...

567
00:54:30,945 --> 00:54:32,742
Did you kill the photographer?

568
00:54:39,921 --> 00:54:43,948
You blame me, but it was the chief
who threw your son in the slammer.

569
00:54:44,826 --> 00:54:47,590
Without my help, your little treasure
would be in real trouble.

570
00:54:48,563 --> 00:54:50,258
Take the ring back.

571
00:54:50,565 --> 00:54:52,658
It's too expensive.

572
00:54:52,834 --> 00:54:55,530
And keep your voice down,
you'll wake up the boy.

573
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:12,510
What did you give the chief
to let the boy go?

574
00:55:14,055 --> 00:55:15,955
That's why you don't want the ring.

575
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,895
He said that with the photographer's
death everything was solved.

576
00:55:22,463 --> 00:55:23,623
Of course,

577
00:55:24,298 --> 00:55:27,631
because they'll blame
the Lupoff girl on him as well.

578
00:55:28,002 --> 00:55:29,401
And do you know why?

579
00:55:30,071 --> 00:55:32,665
Because they don't give a damn
about what's going on around here.

580
00:55:32,874 --> 00:55:36,537
They just want a culprit
to keep the press happy.

581
00:55:36,744 --> 00:55:40,236
Then, if the kids are in danger,
they don't care about that!

582
00:55:40,815 --> 00:55:43,909
They need someone like me
to solve the problem for them.

583
00:56:01,335 --> 00:56:03,667
You're chucking me
out of my house, Estela.

584
00:56:07,709 --> 00:56:09,870
Where do you expect me to sleep now?

585
00:56:11,379 --> 00:56:14,815
Go and sleep in a whorehouse
like you do whenever you fancy.

586
00:57:37,899 --> 00:57:40,424
He attacks children
because he likes hurting them.

587
00:57:41,803 --> 00:57:45,261
But can't you tell us
anything about him? Anything.

588
00:57:45,673 --> 00:57:47,971
I don't know, whether he's blond...

589
00:57:48,976 --> 00:57:50,773
or has a big nose.

590
00:57:51,579 --> 00:57:54,343
I can't see him.
It's as if I saw through his eyes.

591
00:57:55,983 --> 00:57:59,282
Okay, okay. Don't worry.

592
00:57:59,754 --> 00:58:01,016
Don't worry.

593
00:58:01,823 --> 00:58:05,418
We're proud of you.
You saved that baby's life.

594
00:58:05,693 --> 00:58:07,854
I think it's the same man
who did this to me,

595
00:58:07,962 --> 00:58:11,796
-at the fairground when I was a kid.
-You didn't tell us about that.

596
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:16,001
Was it the same fairground
you see in your nightmares?

597
00:58:16,838 --> 00:58:20,001
Yes, but now it's different
and it scares me.

598
00:58:20,975 --> 00:58:23,136
There, I saw
how he buried the girl alive,

599
00:58:24,045 --> 00:58:26,912
how he burned a boy's eyes
with a cigarette.

600
00:58:27,682 --> 00:58:30,617
I also saw him beat
another one to death with a club,

601
00:58:31,152 --> 00:58:33,848
and in a tent I saw him
set that girl on fire.

602
00:58:37,191 --> 00:58:40,752
Palacios, have them check the archives.

603
00:58:41,329 --> 00:58:45,060
I want to know everything about attacks
on minors in the last five years.

604
00:58:47,869 --> 00:58:49,268
What are you waiting for?

605
00:58:50,972 --> 00:58:52,439
As you wish.

606
00:59:02,583 --> 00:59:04,346
Thank God!

607
00:59:04,552 --> 00:59:07,180
Son! Son! Where have you been?

608
00:59:07,255 --> 00:59:10,816
Mateo's fine. Let's go inside
and I'll tell you everything.

609
00:59:11,025 --> 00:59:12,515
Thank you so much.

610
00:59:31,445 --> 00:59:32,878
Well...

611
00:59:34,448 --> 00:59:36,814
Are you going to tell me
what happened to Mateo...

612
00:59:36,918 --> 00:59:39,944
or do I have to read it
in the police reports?

613
00:59:45,326 --> 00:59:47,726
The nightmares started six years ago.

614
00:59:49,096 --> 00:59:52,532
It was the local celebration
and I took Mateo to the fairground.

615
00:59:54,969 --> 00:59:57,733
There, I met a neighbor
who asked me to dance.

616
01:00:00,207 --> 01:00:03,233
I left Mateo
at the edge of the dance floor...

617
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,474
and when the dance ended
he had disappeared.

618
01:00:11,886 --> 01:00:14,150
I searched for him everywhere.

619
01:00:15,623 --> 01:00:17,284
Everywhere.

620
01:00:19,593 --> 01:00:22,460
When they found him,
he had that wound on his face.

621
01:00:24,198 --> 01:00:28,066
Someone had hit him
and thrown him against some wires,

622
01:00:30,538 --> 01:00:32,563
but my son started to scream,

623
01:00:34,208 --> 01:00:36,699
and a policeman heard him
and went to help him,

624
01:00:38,612 --> 01:00:40,307
and the other one escaped.

625
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:45,214
And you've felt guilty every since.

626
01:00:47,788 --> 01:00:51,918
You know? I couldn't stand it
if anybody ever hurt him ever again.

627
01:00:54,362 --> 01:00:56,125
That boy needs you.

628
01:00:58,933 --> 01:01:00,833
Try not to leave him alone.

629
01:01:10,911 --> 01:01:14,870
By the way,
even though it's none of my business,

630
01:01:16,484 --> 01:01:19,180
Mateo said that Octavio
wasn't his father.

631
01:01:20,755 --> 01:01:24,350
No, Octavio is the policeman
who found him.

632
01:01:25,626 --> 01:01:27,355
I owe him my son's life.

633
01:01:30,998 --> 01:01:33,558
If he hadn't been doing the round
that night,

634
01:01:34,435 --> 01:01:36,232
Mateo would be dead now.

635
01:01:40,508 --> 01:01:42,373
You are very brave, Estela.

636
01:01:44,512 --> 01:01:47,879
If you need anything,
whatever it is, let me know.

637
01:01:48,049 --> 01:01:49,676
Thanks, superintendent.

638
01:01:51,385 --> 01:01:53,512
No, you don't have to see me out.

639
01:02:25,219 --> 01:02:26,880
Don't worry.

640
01:02:28,689 --> 01:02:30,748
I only came to get my things.

641
01:02:32,293 --> 01:02:34,124
You can take whatever you like.

642
01:02:34,595 --> 01:02:36,392
This is still your house.

643
01:02:42,403 --> 01:02:43,870
Right.

644
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:47,735
What was the superintendent
doing in my house?

645
01:02:48,042 --> 01:02:49,771
Octavio, please.

646
01:02:49,910 --> 01:02:51,605
Octavio, please, what?

647
01:02:52,146 --> 01:02:53,738
-Octavio...
-What?

648
01:02:54,582 --> 01:02:56,311
-I wasn't doing anything.
-Nothing?

649
01:02:56,517 --> 01:02:58,747
Nothing.
Octavio, don't...

650
01:02:59,353 --> 01:03:02,015
So now you want to screw
with the boss?

651
01:03:02,223 --> 01:03:04,350
Octavio, please, no.

652
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,696
Your man's not good enough for you now.

653
01:03:17,505 --> 01:03:20,099
You prefer that toff...

654
01:03:27,148 --> 01:03:30,276
Well, I'm going to show you
how a pimp fucks.

655
01:03:33,888 --> 01:03:36,254
So you can get used to it, whore!

656
01:04:00,548 --> 01:04:02,106
Come with us.

657
01:04:02,316 --> 01:04:04,807
Give us money, please.

658
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,354
Fuck you, bastard.

659
01:04:08,722 --> 01:04:09,882
Idiot.

660
01:04:26,941 --> 01:04:28,340
What are you doing here?

661
01:04:29,577 --> 01:04:31,841
Didn't I tell you I never wanted
to see you again?

662
01:04:34,148 --> 01:04:36,878
Boss, I want to work again.

663
01:04:39,353 --> 01:04:41,446
If you stole the bottle off me,

664
01:04:42,122 --> 01:04:44,750
how the fuck
do you expect me to trust you?

665
01:04:47,628 --> 01:04:49,118
Get out of here.

666
01:04:53,167 --> 01:04:55,101
Get out of here!

667
01:04:57,571 --> 01:04:59,698
Out of here, you piece of shit!

668
01:05:02,176 --> 01:05:05,270
You'll be sorry, you old bastard.

669
01:05:13,587 --> 01:05:15,851
Fucking brat!

670
01:05:27,835 --> 01:05:29,735
And what's the police station like?

671
01:05:34,208 --> 01:05:36,073
Did you see any dead bodies?

672
01:05:41,415 --> 01:05:42,939
And murderers?

673
01:05:46,887 --> 01:05:49,185
How do I know
if they're murderers or not?

674
01:05:51,325 --> 01:05:52,758
You up for a race?

675
01:05:53,193 --> 01:05:55,991
-A short one.
-As far as Marcial's bar?

676
01:05:56,764 --> 01:05:57,992
Okay.

677
01:05:58,098 --> 01:05:59,963
How are you doing, Estela?

678
01:06:33,534 --> 01:06:35,229
It was up to here!

679
01:06:56,156 --> 01:06:58,954
That devil was playing at races
with the others.

680
01:06:59,126 --> 01:07:01,094
I don't know how he managed it.

681
01:07:01,528 --> 01:07:05,362
The girl has bruises, burns,
and a cord around the neck.

682
01:07:32,092 --> 01:07:35,357
This time I was too late. Too late.

683
01:07:37,097 --> 01:07:38,724
Did you see anything new?

684
01:07:38,932 --> 01:07:43,494
It's Josefina, who that man
took photos of me with.

685
01:07:44,738 --> 01:07:48,538
The killer burnt her eyes
with a cigarette to make her scream,

686
01:07:50,744 --> 01:07:53,941
and when he got bored of that
he strangled her with a cord.

687
01:07:57,384 --> 01:07:59,181
But I couldn't see him.

688
01:08:09,763 --> 01:08:12,323
-Take the boy home.
-But sir, the boy was...

689
01:08:12,466 --> 01:08:14,627
Didn't you understand my orders,
officer?

690
01:08:14,835 --> 01:08:16,325
Yes, sir.

691
01:08:22,876 --> 01:08:24,537
She was strangled to death,

692
01:08:24,845 --> 01:08:26,870
about six hours ago.

693
01:08:33,854 --> 01:08:35,515
With the same type of cord?

694
01:08:35,856 --> 01:08:37,483
Yes,

695
01:08:37,658 --> 01:08:40,320
the kind used for pulleys
in construction.

696
01:08:41,562 --> 01:08:42,961
And the burns?

697
01:08:43,096 --> 01:08:45,121
Cigarette burns.

698
01:08:45,399 --> 01:08:48,562
The girl was undoubtedly still alive
when they were done.

699
01:08:49,603 --> 01:08:53,232
In my opinion,
it's a sadist who enjoys...

700
01:08:53,307 --> 01:08:55,036
seeing people suffer.

701
01:08:55,776 --> 01:08:58,768
The same person
who tortured the birds in Pavón St.

702
01:09:11,925 --> 01:09:13,324
Excuse me.

703
01:09:15,162 --> 01:09:17,596
I have to ask you some questions.

704
01:09:18,499 --> 01:09:21,434
Lady, you were the last one
to see the girl, right?

705
01:09:22,102 --> 01:09:25,094
No, it was Gregorito,

706
01:09:25,973 --> 01:09:27,668
our son.

707
01:09:28,742 --> 01:09:30,733
I read in your declaration...

708
01:09:31,645 --> 01:09:35,638
that you believe a man accompanied her
and offered her money to go with him.

709
01:09:36,550 --> 01:09:38,711
That's what Gregorio says.

710
01:09:40,888 --> 01:09:42,753
But it wasn't a man,

711
01:09:45,259 --> 01:09:46,988
it was a boy.

712
01:09:49,062 --> 01:09:51,758
That boy took my Josefina
off with him.

713
01:10:02,509 --> 01:10:03,840
Excuse me.

714
01:10:05,712 --> 01:10:07,942
The Lupoff girl has died.

715
01:10:09,149 --> 01:10:11,617
The burns were too serious.

716
01:10:16,223 --> 01:10:18,987
Should we continue investigating
the death of the photographer,

717
01:10:19,393 --> 01:10:21,486
or do we assume it was suicide?

718
01:10:22,829 --> 01:10:25,889
Following the tracks of a pimp
in this city...

719
01:10:26,099 --> 01:10:28,624
is like trying to put fences
around the Pampa.

720
01:10:28,802 --> 01:10:30,531
Stop fucking about, Palacios.

721
01:10:32,739 --> 01:10:34,297
I want everyone off their arses...

722
01:10:34,408 --> 01:10:36,501
to find out who bought photos
off Cebrián.

723
01:10:36,710 --> 01:10:39,975
Everyone? We're going to keep Mateo
under surveillance, aren't we?

724
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:41,477
Are you deaf?

725
01:10:41,648 --> 01:10:43,616
I want all the officers...

726
01:10:43,684 --> 01:10:46,175
after the maniac
who bought those photos.

727
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:55,788
Excuse me...
Mr. Estévez, I presume.

728
01:10:56,363 --> 01:10:57,955
Yes, that's right.

729
01:10:59,333 --> 01:11:03,326
I'm sorry to speak to you
at such a difficult time,

730
01:11:06,807 --> 01:11:08,832
but I want you to know
that they're covering up...

731
01:11:08,909 --> 01:11:11,571
the main suspect
of your daughter's murder.

732
01:11:22,122 --> 01:11:23,680
Why are you ignoring me?

733
01:11:26,727 --> 01:11:28,752
What? Is something up?

734
01:11:29,997 --> 01:11:32,329
Did you hear
about what happened to Josefina?

735
01:11:32,933 --> 01:11:35,902
She's dead. Mateo found her.

736
01:11:39,006 --> 01:11:40,405
Oh, yes?

737
01:11:41,408 --> 01:11:43,342
Did it frighten you, Mateo?

738
01:11:44,211 --> 01:11:45,678
A bit.

739
01:11:55,155 --> 01:11:56,679
Look what I brought you.

740
01:11:58,325 --> 01:12:00,919
Mateo. Do you want one?

741
01:12:19,613 --> 01:12:22,946
I came because...

742
01:12:23,984 --> 01:12:25,576
I've changed my mind.

743
01:12:27,621 --> 01:12:29,452
I've got something for you,

744
01:12:30,123 --> 01:12:31,681
if you’re interested.

745
01:12:33,326 --> 01:12:34,918
Money?

746
01:12:35,495 --> 01:12:37,190
I'll tell you on the way.

747
01:12:37,964 --> 01:12:39,295
Well, okay.

748
01:12:43,537 --> 01:12:44,799
Mateo...

749
01:12:47,574 --> 01:12:49,542
Be careful where you go.

750
01:12:57,951 --> 01:12:59,111
Excuse me.

751
01:13:01,788 --> 01:13:05,280
You are the father of the girl
who burnt to death, aren't you?

752
01:13:35,555 --> 01:13:37,546
Cayetano, someone's coming!

753
01:13:44,731 --> 01:13:47,666
Shit, it's you, you son of a bitch!

754
01:13:52,739 --> 01:13:55,037
I'll skin you alive!

755
01:14:07,154 --> 01:14:10,851
Fiore, did Cayetano come home?

756
01:14:12,759 --> 01:14:15,125
Awhile ago.

757
01:14:16,797 --> 01:14:18,389
What's he done now?

758
01:14:21,701 --> 01:14:23,134
Where did you put my money?

759
01:14:30,377 --> 01:14:33,710
Little bloody devil!

760
01:14:34,181 --> 01:14:36,342
Come here, come here!

761
01:14:42,789 --> 01:14:46,748
That boy's a devil! He's a devil!

762
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:49,485
It's because of the attacks
that torment him!

763
01:14:51,097 --> 01:14:52,291
Come here!

764
01:14:52,499 --> 01:14:54,399
Little bastard, come here!

765
01:15:02,709 --> 01:15:04,734
Mum! Mum!

766
01:15:05,245 --> 01:15:07,577
What's wrong, son?
What's wrong?

767
01:15:07,881 --> 01:15:09,644
I know who is the murderer.

768
01:15:09,983 --> 01:15:11,348
I saw him.

769
01:15:12,886 --> 01:15:15,150
<i>Read all about it!</i>

770
01:15:15,355 --> 01:15:17,846
<i>The streets are not safe!</i>

771
01:15:18,058 --> 01:15:21,516
<i>The police are covering up
the killer of children!</i>

772
01:15:21,728 --> 01:15:23,457
<i>Read all about it!</i>

773
01:15:23,663 --> 01:15:26,097
<i>The streets are not safe!</i>

774
01:15:26,299 --> 01:15:30,099
The police are covering up
the killer of children!

775
01:15:45,518 --> 01:15:47,179
Are you sure?

776
01:15:54,127 --> 01:15:57,688
I know him, too.
He lives in the neighborhood.

777
01:15:58,865 --> 01:16:01,356
I once met his mother in Lupoff's store.

778
01:16:02,168 --> 01:16:05,160
She told me he'd just come out
of the Marcos Paz reformatory.

779
01:16:07,741 --> 01:16:10,369
More or less
when the nightmares started?

780
01:16:10,944 --> 01:16:12,639
Yes, that's right.

781
01:16:13,513 --> 01:16:16,243
About two months ago.

782
01:16:17,150 --> 01:16:18,549
Here he is.

783
01:16:19,519 --> 01:16:21,419
Cayetano Santos Godino.

784
01:16:21,488 --> 01:16:23,922
He lives at General Urquiza 370.

785
01:16:25,125 --> 01:16:26,717
He was a witness...

786
01:16:27,093 --> 01:16:29,653
to an attack on a boy
who was beaten to death.

787
01:16:31,298 --> 01:16:33,163
The case was never solved.

788
01:16:36,970 --> 01:16:40,269
He was also a witness
in another unsolved case.

789
01:16:43,376 --> 01:16:45,276
A boy burnt on the eyelids.

790
01:16:45,812 --> 01:16:47,336
Very good, Palacios.

791
01:16:47,914 --> 01:16:50,747
Have someone take the lady
and the boy home.

792
01:16:50,951 --> 01:16:52,976
We'll go to Urquiza Street.

793
01:17:12,539 --> 01:17:15,997
Excuse me,
does Cayetano Santos Godino live here?

794
01:17:26,853 --> 01:17:28,650
Yes, he lives here.

795
01:17:28,888 --> 01:17:30,913
But he's not here right now.

796
01:17:33,393 --> 01:17:35,418
Who are you, the police?

797
01:17:37,330 --> 01:17:38,627
May l?

798
01:17:42,602 --> 01:17:44,263
Where does the boy sleep?

799
01:17:45,071 --> 01:17:47,437
There, in the little bed.

800
01:17:53,146 --> 01:17:55,046
He run away last night.

801
01:17:56,282 --> 01:17:58,375
We can't cope with him any more.

802
01:18:00,387 --> 01:18:02,082
Take him away.

803
01:18:03,123 --> 01:18:05,353
Take him to the reformatory.

804
01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:09,358
We don't want him any more.

805
01:18:15,335 --> 01:18:19,499
This time it's because of
the robbery of old Blas, isn't it?

806
01:18:20,073 --> 01:18:22,439
Petrie, come and see this.

807
01:18:36,322 --> 01:18:38,256
Those marbles are nice.

808
01:18:39,692 --> 01:18:42,058
When I was little
I liked them a lot too.

809
01:18:51,704 --> 01:18:53,035
Do you want it?

810
01:18:54,307 --> 01:18:55,865
Do you?

811
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:02,871
If you want a bigger one, this big,

812
01:19:03,183 --> 01:19:05,413
come with me, I've got more.
Do you want one?

813
01:19:21,568 --> 01:19:22,899
This is it.

814
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:29,264
Come in.

815
01:19:29,843 --> 01:19:31,708
I've got the big sweet in here.

816
01:19:40,053 --> 01:19:41,680
Where's the sweet?

817
01:19:43,690 --> 01:19:46,250
There, under that metal sheet there.

818
01:20:02,542 --> 01:20:05,409
Help! Help!
Somebody help me!

819
01:20:05,578 --> 01:20:07,170
Please, help me!

820
01:20:39,812 --> 01:20:41,279
Stop, Cayetano!

821
01:20:44,817 --> 01:20:46,307
Are you speaking to me?

822
01:20:50,190 --> 01:20:51,817
What's wrong with you?

823
01:20:52,158 --> 01:20:55,286
What? You're dead?

824
01:20:59,065 --> 01:21:00,293
You're dead!

825
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:03,665
You're dead, you're dead!

826
01:21:09,008 --> 01:21:10,635
Were you calling? What's wrong?

827
01:21:10,810 --> 01:21:13,244
He had an attack,
but it's over now.

828
01:21:13,413 --> 01:21:14,812
Poor kid.

829
01:21:14,914 --> 01:21:17,474
Please, help me carry him
into the bedroom.

830
01:21:19,185 --> 01:21:20,880
Why did you die?

831
01:21:23,890 --> 01:21:26,085
Don't you want to be my friend
no more?

832
01:21:28,761 --> 01:21:31,525
Well, if you're not going
to speak to me, I'm off.

833
01:21:35,902 --> 01:21:39,599
If you want to get out of here,
tell your mummy to come and help you.

834
01:21:53,353 --> 01:21:54,615
Gesualdo!

835
01:21:56,956 --> 01:21:59,220
Where have you been?

836
01:22:04,330 --> 01:22:07,822
Excuse me, you haven't seen a boy
of about five years old, have you?

837
01:22:08,101 --> 01:22:09,363
He's called Gesualdo.

838
01:22:09,669 --> 01:22:10,931
No.

839
01:22:11,304 --> 01:22:14,000
But don't worry.
You go to the police station,

840
01:22:14,107 --> 01:22:16,598
they'll tell you what to do,
and I'll look for him round here.

841
01:22:17,543 --> 01:22:19,477
Thanks. Thanks.

842
01:22:48,174 --> 01:22:50,108
He told us he was weak.

843
01:23:09,962 --> 01:23:11,395
Excuse me, sir.

844
01:23:11,664 --> 01:23:14,758
This man has come to report
the disappearance of another boy.

845
01:23:15,168 --> 01:23:17,534
Show him into my office immediately.

846
01:23:20,573 --> 01:23:21,835
May l?

847
01:23:22,208 --> 01:23:23,505
Come in.

848
01:23:27,380 --> 01:23:28,574
Sit down.

849
01:23:42,762 --> 01:23:44,389
Do you know that boy?

850
01:23:49,502 --> 01:23:51,197
I don't know him,

851
01:23:52,638 --> 01:23:54,538
but I've just spoken to him.

852
01:23:56,809 --> 01:23:59,243
He told me he'd help me
look for Gesualdo.

853
01:23:59,812 --> 01:24:02,303
Could you take us to the place
where you met him?

854
01:24:03,950 --> 01:24:05,281
Of course.

855
01:24:05,518 --> 01:24:07,918
Don't take him!

856
01:24:08,121 --> 01:24:09,918
Please, don't take him!

857
01:24:10,323 --> 01:24:13,986
Hand the body over to the family.
He's already suffered enough.

858
01:24:14,293 --> 01:24:15,817
I'll take charge.

859
01:24:16,162 --> 01:24:19,029
I don't know if you're still interested.

860
01:24:19,465 --> 01:24:23,128
An informer told me the address
of Cebrián's client.

861
01:24:39,419 --> 01:24:41,785
-Please don't take him!
-Don't worry.

862
01:24:41,854 --> 01:24:43,719
Don't worry.
The superintendent told me...

863
01:24:43,923 --> 01:24:45,948
The superintend told me
you can take him home.

864
01:24:46,159 --> 01:24:47,888
Thank you.

865
01:24:51,998 --> 01:24:55,593
What have they done to you,
my little boy?

866
01:25:12,351 --> 01:25:14,376
<i>-Who is it?
-Superintendent Petrie.</i>

867
01:25:26,566 --> 01:25:28,500
Mateo had another attack,
didn't he?

868
01:25:28,701 --> 01:25:29,861
Yes.

869
01:25:31,170 --> 01:25:33,331
Cayetano has killed another child.

870
01:25:36,943 --> 01:25:39,434
Would you mind if I saw the boy?

871
01:25:40,012 --> 01:25:41,445
No, not at all.

872
01:25:41,948 --> 01:25:44,143
He had a nose bleed again.

873
01:25:45,551 --> 01:25:47,041
He's in there.

874
01:25:58,130 --> 01:25:59,757
How are you doing, friend?

875
01:26:00,032 --> 01:26:01,590
Tired.

876
01:26:06,439 --> 01:26:07,997
Does your stomach hurt?

877
01:26:08,574 --> 01:26:10,064
A bit.

878
01:26:13,145 --> 01:26:17,411
Mateo, you're the only one I can trust.

879
01:26:18,317 --> 01:26:21,252
Cayetano has escaped,
and as he knows we've discovered him,

880
01:26:21,354 --> 01:26:23,481
he almost certainly won't go back home.

881
01:26:23,689 --> 01:26:25,418
I don't know where to look for him.

882
01:26:25,491 --> 01:26:28,085
We've asked around,
no one knows anything.

883
01:26:28,294 --> 01:26:29,852
There's a boy.

884
01:26:30,796 --> 01:26:32,491
He's called Roque.

885
01:26:33,065 --> 01:26:34,930
They're friends.

886
01:26:36,035 --> 01:26:39,266
He lives near Marcial,
two blocks from here.

887
01:26:41,908 --> 01:26:43,170
Thanks.

888
01:26:59,458 --> 01:27:00,857
Lady.

889
01:27:05,231 --> 01:27:07,927
I'm very sorry I didn't believe
your son from the start.

890
01:27:08,034 --> 01:27:09,729
No, don't worry.

891
01:27:09,936 --> 01:27:12,097
You've been very kind to us.

892
01:27:17,043 --> 01:27:19,034
You deserve it, lady.

893
01:27:19,478 --> 01:27:20,945
Good night.

894
01:27:31,891 --> 01:27:33,552
We don't know where the boy is,

895
01:27:33,759 --> 01:27:37,957
but Roque said he'd go to the wake
of that boy who was killed.

896
01:27:39,632 --> 01:27:42,362
My God, if they don't do
something about this...

897
01:27:42,501 --> 01:27:45,265
we're going to have
to tie our kids to the doors.

898
01:28:16,769 --> 01:28:19,237
-Who is it?
-Where's the murderer?

899
01:28:19,372 --> 01:28:21,340
-Where's the boy?
-What are you talking about?

900
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:22,998
<i>Your son!</i>

901
01:28:25,177 --> 01:28:27,236
<i>Come on, he's getting away!</i>

902
01:28:52,138 --> 01:28:55,505
Die! Die, you son of a bitch!

903
01:29:03,916 --> 01:29:05,474
Cayetano Santos Godino.

904
01:29:08,054 --> 01:29:09,316
What is it?

905
01:29:09,889 --> 01:29:11,823
You're going to have to come with us.

906
01:29:13,059 --> 01:29:15,220
Die! Die, son of a bitch!

907
01:29:38,484 --> 01:29:42,045
My love!
No, my darling, no!

908
01:29:45,591 --> 01:29:47,650
No, my love, no.

909
01:30:41,547 --> 01:30:42,980
What's up?

910
01:30:45,985 --> 01:30:48,283
Tonight I just want to get drunk.

911
01:30:52,391 --> 01:30:55,554
You said it. What good is talking?
Life's a bitch.

912
01:30:59,398 --> 01:31:04,062
I remember after killing that boy,

913
01:31:06,205 --> 01:31:07,638
Arturo,

914
01:31:10,476 --> 01:31:13,673
I went to the shed and I masturbated,

915
01:31:16,715 --> 01:31:19,081
Like when I killed Josefina.

916
01:31:19,985 --> 01:31:23,079
Don't you feel any remorse
for what you did?

917
01:31:26,025 --> 01:31:28,585
I don't understand
what you're asking me.

918
01:31:29,361 --> 01:31:31,693
You don't know what remorse is?

919
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:36,067
No, sir.

920
01:31:37,603 --> 01:31:40,436
Do you think you have the right
to kill children?

921
01:31:41,106 --> 01:31:42,971
But I'm not the only one,

922
01:31:43,843 --> 01:31:45,868
there are others that do it as well.

923
01:31:50,349 --> 01:31:51,907
Why did you kill them?

924
01:31:52,117 --> 01:31:54,415
Because I like it.

925
01:31:56,422 --> 01:31:57,821
And the wake?

926
01:32:00,659 --> 01:32:03,492
You went to the wake
of the last child you killed.

927
01:32:04,797 --> 01:32:06,059
I wanted to see him.

928
01:32:06,265 --> 01:32:07,459
Why?

929
01:32:09,869 --> 01:32:12,838
I wanted to see
if he had the nail in his head.

930
01:32:37,096 --> 01:32:39,087
You still love me.

931
01:32:40,766 --> 01:32:43,633
No, Octavio, not anymore.

932
01:32:54,847 --> 01:32:57,281
Have you ever tried to strangle a man?

933
01:32:58,617 --> 01:33:02,815
No, no. Men are too big, and I can't.

934
01:33:05,057 --> 01:33:07,548
Well, if I find him asleep, yes.

935
01:33:09,361 --> 01:33:11,625
What do you feel
when you strangle someone?

936
01:33:15,067 --> 01:33:16,329
I don't know.

937
01:33:17,536 --> 01:33:18,935
I like it.

938
01:33:24,209 --> 01:33:26,575
My whole body shakes...

939
01:33:28,781 --> 01:33:31,045
Like if I want to bite.

940
01:33:31,383 --> 01:33:34,944
The way I did with that boy,
I sank my teeth into him like a dog...

941
01:33:37,389 --> 01:33:39,687
Then, I'm thirsty...

942
01:33:41,593 --> 01:33:44,460
and my throat burns
as if I had a fever.

943
01:34:11,557 --> 01:34:12,956
I'm sorry.

944
01:34:14,793 --> 01:34:16,727
I'm so sorry.

945
01:34:18,897 --> 01:34:21,024
The culprit has already paid for it.

946
01:34:22,534 --> 01:34:24,764
That's not justice, Estela.

947
01:34:25,738 --> 01:34:27,467
That's revenge.

948
01:34:29,508 --> 01:34:31,635
For us there never can be justice.

949
01:34:31,910 --> 01:34:33,969
I'll make do with revenge.

950
01:34:50,996 --> 01:34:52,691
One more question.

951
01:34:54,099 --> 01:34:55,896
Have you ever cried?

952
01:34:57,936 --> 01:35:01,269
No, l...

953
01:35:05,577 --> 01:35:07,044
Yes...

954
01:35:07,846 --> 01:35:09,404
Once,

955
01:35:11,583 --> 01:35:15,383
when I wanted to kill a boy
