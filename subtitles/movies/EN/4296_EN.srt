00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,030
The season was the beginning of
spring and that day it was raining.

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,370
Sec.1 [Introduction]

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,910
That's why Her hair, and my body too,
were heavy with humidity.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,580
The air surrounding us was saturated with
the immensely pleasant fragrance of the rain.

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:26,050
The Earth on its axis turned
quietly without a sound,

6
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,720
and in this world, Her and my body
continued to loose heat peacefully.

7
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:36,530
I am currently not at home.
Your business, please.

8
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,200
That day I was picked up by Her.

9
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,410
That's why

10
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,480
I am Her cat.

11
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:55,350
She and Her Cat
Their Viewpoints

12
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,300
Sec.2 [Her Days]

13
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,230
She was kind, like a mother,

14
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,430
and beautiful, like a lover.

15
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,640
That's why I quickly became
enamored of Her.

16
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,110
She lives alone,

17
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,250
and leaves for work every morning.

18
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,710
I don't know the details of Her work,

19
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,050
nor am I interested.

20
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,180
But I

21
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,450
very much like the way She looks
leaving the room in the morning.

22
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,390
Her long hair, properly tied up.

23
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,790
The faint smell of cosmetics
and perfume.

24
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,590
She places Her hand
upon my head and...

25
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,730
I'll go and come back, okay?

26
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,260
So She says aloud.

27
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,930
So She says aloud,
straightens up Her back,

28
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,660
and with a pleasant sound
echoing from Her shoes,

29
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,670
She opens the heavy iron door.

30
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:53,670
A smell like grassy places wet with rain
in the morning remains for a while.

31
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,080
Sec.3 [His Days]

32
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,820
Summer has come,

33
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,550
and I have a girlfriend too.

34
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,150
It's the young cat, Mimi.

35
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,150
Mimi

36
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:08,960
Mimi is small and cute, and
really good at being spoiled,

37
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,630
but after all I like

38
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,290
a woman who is more adult,

39
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,430
like She.

40
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,430
Mimi ; Chobi

41
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,100
Say, Chobi?

42
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,160
Mimi; Chobi

43
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,160
What is it, Mimi?

44
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,030
Please marry me.

45
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,700
Say, Mimi,

46
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,970
I've said this numerous times,

47
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,770
but I have an adult lover.

48
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:21,440
Not true.

49
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,770
It's not, "not true."

50
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,240
Let me meet her.

51
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,570
You can't.

52
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:25,240
Why?

53
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,970
Say, Mimi,

54
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,040
I've said it numerous times,

55
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,380
but we'll have this kind of talk after
you've become more of an adult

56
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,580
or something.

57
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,850
This kind of conversation
goes on forever.

58
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,720
Please come over to play again, okay?

59
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:37,990
Definitely, okay?

60
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,850
Really come over, okay?

61
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,190
Really, really come over, okay?

62
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,530
In this way, my first summer passes,

63
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,060
and gradually cooler breezes
begin to blow.

64
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,400
Sec.4 [Her Loneliness]

65
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,060
One day like that,

66
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,000
after a long, long
telephone conversation,

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,400
She cried.

68
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,350
I didn't understand the reason,

69
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,750
but She cried for a
long time by my side.

70
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,220
I think She is not the one at fault.

71
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,360
Only I am always watching.

72
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,690
She is always kinder
than anyone else.

73
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,890
She is more beautiful
than anyone else.

74
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,630
She lives more earnestly
than anyone else.

75
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,700
I can hear Her voice.

76
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,300
Someone...

77
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,440
Someone, someone...

78
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,440
Someone save me.

79
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,040
Sec.5 [She and Her Cat]

80
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,110
In the darkness that has no end,

81
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:43,050
this world that we are aboard
continues to revolve.

82
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,520
The season has changed,
and it is now winter.

83
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,060
The scenery of snow that, to me,
should be the first I've seen,

84
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,530
I have the feeling I've
known it from long ago.

85
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,790
The winter mornings are late,

86
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,600
so even when it becomes time
for Her to leave the house,

87
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,060
it is still dark outside.

88
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,730
The sight of Her, engulfed
in a very heavy jacket,

89
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,470
seems practically like a big cat.

90
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:07,080
She, who wore the scent of snow,

91
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,610
and Her slender, cold finger tips,

92
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:13,150
the sound of the black clouds
streaming by far in the upper sky,

93
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,220
Her soul, and my feelings,
and our room...

94
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,760
The snow inhales the sounds of all,

95
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,760
but only the sound of the
electric train that She boarded,

96
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,030
reached my upright ears.

97
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,700
I,

98
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,030
and probably Her too.

99
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,240
This world...

100
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,300
This world

101
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,240
I think we like it.

102
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,240
I think we like it.

103
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:47,240
