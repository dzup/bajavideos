1
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:22,122
My name's André...

2
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:23,521
André Moussah.

3
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:26,854
I'm 28, single and an American citizen.

4
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,590
Paris is a spectacular city,
but I'm too busy to make the most of it.

5
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,963
I also do business in Argentina, Chile,
a little in China...

6
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,593
Not much in the U.S., in fact,

7
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:40,537
but I love to chill in my apartment
overlooking Central Park.

8
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,541
Back to Paris.
I've made a lot of friends here.

9
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,306
I expected the French to be more hostile
about Iraq and all that,

10
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,313
but not at all.

11
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:54,751
Maybe it's down to me
being such a cute, fun-loving kind of guy,

12
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:58,255
who's pretty hot in bed.
So, yeah, I'm doing good.

13
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:02,222
I can honestly say, without bragging,
I'm a good guy.

14
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,430
That's about all I can tell you about me,

15
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:09,297
my ambitions and dreams...

16
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,697
Because I lie to myself

17
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:15,468
and the whole world, all day long!

18
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:20,745
You piece of Yankee shit!

19
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,871
You think we'd buy that crap?

20
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:26,383
I'm not American.
I won my green card in the lottery.

21
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:28,477
I'm from Morocco originally.

22
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:30,486
I don't like Arabs either!

23
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:34,588
Stop hitting me!

24
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:37,524
You got it wrong, I can explain.

25
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:38,722
10 seconds.

26
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:53,173
If not, I'd have paid it back ages ago.

27
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,338
You haven't got a cash card?

28
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:58,280
If I did, I'd be at the bank. There. Now.

29
00:01:58,418 --> 00:01:59,350
Shut it!

30
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:02,751
Keep it shut.
When you open it, you piss me off more.

31
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,187
You don't get it.

32
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,191
Not even "okay." You shut it 100%.

33
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,155
You understand 100%?

34
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:12,390
Not a single word. Breathe, that's all.

35
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,298
That's good.

36
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:23,873
Must be hard for a Yank

37
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,706
to keep his trap shut!

38
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:28,705
Always preaching!

39
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:32,014
Not a word. Quiet!

40
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,310
Listen carefully to what I have to say.

41
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:37,890
You remember Mr. Mamoud?

42
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,862
You owe him money.

43
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,934
€40,000!
Not your stinking dollars, euros.

44
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:54,600
You pay up tonight
or I come looking for you,

45
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:56,140
and break your fingers.

46
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:59,439
If that doesn't work, your arms.
Then your legs...

47
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,013
Then your head...

48
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:04,882
I know that song, I...

49
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:07,077
You have till tonight.

50
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,155
That's till midnight. Then, it's tomorrow

51
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:12,224
and tomorrow, you're dead!

52
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,560
See you later.

53
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,233
Race you to the car!

54
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:26,270
Two things were suddenly crystal clear.

55
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,806
I really had to change my life.

56
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:30,398
And I definitely hated Paris!

57
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:31,844
Monsieur Frank.

58
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,405
Please!

59
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,454
I don't get you, André.

60
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:55,591
I treat you good, I introduce you to people,
I lend you money,

61
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,533
and what do I get in return?

62
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:00,095
- I can explain...
- Nothing. Not even a call.

63
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:04,905
And now you drag me up here?
Do I look like a tourist?

64
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:08,572
No, you're not a tourist.
Let me explain.

65
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,041
I'm listening.

66
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:14,176
If he'd pull me up, it'd be easier to talk.

67
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,754
I can hear you fine from here.
Spit it out.

68
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,188
I lost everything, passport, credit cards...

69
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,523
- I went to Amex and...
- Drop him!

70
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,427
Please, don't drop me!

71
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,159
Please, Monsieur Frank!

72
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,398
There's more?

73
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:35,497
Tonight! I'll pay tonight!
On my mother's life!

74
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,939
I don't know her!

75
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,840
On anybody else's life then!

76
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,311
How? You're in over your head!

77
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,438
I don't know...

78
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,608
I can't think straight like this.

79
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,847
My men are everywhere.

80
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:49,887
I know.

81
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:53,852
Don't try running.

82
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,558
That'd be a terrible idea.

83
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:58,724
You have until midnight.

84
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:01,057
Thank you, Monsieur Frank.

85
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:39,633
Boy, am I glad to see you!

86
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,897
Do you have some I.D., sir?

87
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,101
It's cool, I'm American.

88
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,547
You cancel your credit cards?

89
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,444
All of them.
I can't get any cash.

90
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,676
It's a hassle.
Paris is expensive.

91
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,184
Tell me about it!

92
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,755
A new Amex card takes 24 hours, no?

93
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:59,551
Sure, with proof of identity.

94
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:02,958
- I can't prove my identity.
- A vicious circle.

95
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:07,055
And it's Saturday.
All my friends are away for the weekend.

96
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,100
Baldwin Street... Is that Manhattan?

97
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,069
No, Brooklyn. Number 720. Fifth floor.

98
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:14,332
- Phone number?
- It's okay, I got it.

99
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:18,500
You have info like that on your computer?

100
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:20,374
And your three convictions.

101
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,106
Really?

102
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,778
Does it say that was ages ago?
I was young.

103
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,851
Three months ago?

104
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,651
You have that one, too?

105
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,725
Powerful computer...

106
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,158
It mention it was a misunderstanding?

107
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:43,861
The report has it down as fraud.
Six months suspended.

108
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,631
That's right.

109
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,400
I intend to appeal
as soon as I'm home.

110
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:49,941
We won't be able to help.

111
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:53,068
The police will take down
a complaint for robbery

112
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:55,204
and give you temporary I.D.

113
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:00,944
Look, sir...

114
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:05,150
I'm a U.S. Citizen,
protected by the Constitution

115
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,056
my great-grandparents fought for
all their lives.

116
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:12,164
I have the right to assistance
when in desperate need.

117
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,094
Your grandparents were Algerian.

118
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,101
If they fought for independence,
it certainly wasn't America's.

119
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:21,401
And your green card requires you
to respect certain rules,

120
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:24,670
which you clearly didn't bother to read.

121
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,244
These state clearly

122
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:30,441
your visa can be withdrawn
in case of serious or repeated crimes.

123
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:34,110
In your case both apply, exceedingly!

124
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:37,984
If I may voice a personal opinion,
the only person

125
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,287
who can do anything for you
is yourself.

126
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,123
Please leave quietly

127
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,891
or else I'll have to call security.

128
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,481
André! You got my money?

129
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,350
What do you want?

130
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,617
I was thinking...

131
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,226
I had it in mind to...

132
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:36,764
I can't take any more.

133
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:39,444
I'm at the end of my rope.

134
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:43,245
What's wrong, fella?

135
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:44,815
I'm in the shit!

136
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,976
I borrowed huge sums of money,

137
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,278
but I was a little bit off
in my calculations.

138
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:53,552
I can't pay up.
If I don't, they're gonna ice me.

139
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,286
You wanna file a complaint?

140
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:00,592
No way! Why'd I wanna do that?

141
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,359
They'll ice me twice as hard.

142
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:06,963
What can I do for you?

143
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:11,874
I thought maybe...

144
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:20,176
Lock me away
while I think this through.

145
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,084
Is this "Candid Camera?"

146
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,684
No, it's not "Candid Camera!"

147
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,889
I'm hanging by a thread.
Screw "Candid Camera!"

148
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,626
As a favor, lock me up!

149
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:37,134
An Arab without I.D.,
what's the problem?

150
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:39,302
What?

151
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,108
You scumbags!

152
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:49,881
Dirty cowards!

153
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,350
Fuck the police!

154
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,342
Woken up, have you?

155
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,048
It's too late.

156
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:29,948
I'll do myself in.

157
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,086
My death will be on your consciences!

158
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,864
Nobody gives a shit, huh?

159
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:56,108
I'll do it.

160
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,143
Is that what you want?

161
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:05,248
Why did you abandon me?

162
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:12,122
Why do you never answer me?

163
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,266
What are you doing?

164
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,739
Same as you.

165
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:29,938
Meaning?

166
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,485
No, "mademoiselle," no.

167
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:45,759
Don't worry...

168
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:49,467
I'm coming. It's okay. I'm here.

169
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,649
I don't fucking believe it!

170
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:14,651
I can't even kill myself
without someone fucking me up.

171
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,786
Can't I have a moment's peace
to die with dignity?

172
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:21,924
It's Sunday morning.
Couldn't you sleep in like everybody else?

173
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:24,264
- I couldn't sleep.
- Find your own bridge!

174
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,702
There's heaps of them in this town!

175
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,899
Didn't you see it was taken?

176
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,942
We had the same idea...
Funny, huh?

177
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,273
Yeah, I'm dying of laughter.

178
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,506
Tell me why you'd want to jump anyway?

179
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:38,474
Probably the same reason as you.

180
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:40,752
- I doubt that.
- Why?

181
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,756
My problem is I feel stupid,
ugly and completely useless.

182
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,381
I doubt you could relate to that.

183
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,792
They are exactly the same.
I am stupid and ugly...

184
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:52,291
On the inside.

185
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:55,490
Yeah, but you have the outside
to hide it.

186
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,064
I have nothing to hide.

187
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:00,299
I can see that.

188
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:05,343
How can a girl like you
get so down on herself?

189
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,576
You're young and beautiful...

190
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:10,705
You can have anything you want.

191
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,442
And just what do I want?

192
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:15,019
How do I know!
I'm not a clairvoyant!

193
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,282
To be rich probably.
Don't we all?

194
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,725
Travel, splash your cash...
Get dolled up.

195
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:23,486
Buy dresses and furs...

196
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:25,620
Stuff that women like!

197
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:27,494
What would you like?

198
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,967
To breathe!
That's what I need

199
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,538
and time to refocus.
I mean, look at me!

200
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,903
It's what's inside that counts, right?

201
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,909
Easy for you to say!
You're pretty well equipped.

202
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,913
Who'd be dead, too,
without me to save her?

203
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,278
Who'd be dead without me to save?

204
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:47,709
Got a smoke?

205
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:52,754
I can't face head games right now.
Not a Sunday morning.

206
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:55,827
You're right.
So, what do we do now?

207
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:04,258
What do you mean?

208
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,964
You saved my life.
I guess you had a reason.

209
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,132
I didn't think.
I just jumped, sheer instinct.

210
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,108
You can’t just let people die.

211
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:16,545
I completely agree.
So, what do we do now?

212
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,479
We do nothing.
You leave me alone.

213
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:22,076
Men! You're all the same.

214
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:24,519
You jump in, then you throw us away!

215
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:28,218
Enough!
I'm in no mood to quarrel either.

216
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:29,294
See you.

217
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:45,807
What's your name?

218
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:47,445
Angela.

219
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,105
If I leave you here, will you try again?

220
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,411
- Try what?
- Jumping off bridges!

221
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:54,484
Maybe...

222
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:58,020
- Couldn't you maybe change your mind?
- Why?

223
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,681
What do you mean, why?

224
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,155
Because you...

225
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:05,824
You're beautiful.

226
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:08,422
And it would be a waste to lose you.

227
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:13,302
And I never accomplished anything
in my life. So knowing I saved someone...

228
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,202
That might help me.

229
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,775
If you'd do that for me,
I'd appreciate it.

230
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:19,811
I'll see what I can do.

231
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,937
- Thank you.
- No problem.

232
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,108
Goodbye.

233
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:38,586
- Why not devote your life to a cause?
- Such as?

234
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:42,189
Orphans in India,
children with AIDS in Africa...

235
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,995
Why go so far?

236
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:45,502
You're right.

237
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:47,963
Misery is everywhere.

238
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:52,005
Then why not help people in distress
here in Paris.

239
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:54,739
- People who need you.
- People like you?

240
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:58,248
Yes, no! Me, I'm fine.

241
00:16:58,384 --> 00:16:59,851
Oh, yeah, you're doing great!

242
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:02,977
Trying to kill yourself
five minutes ago.

243
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,794
If you had my life,
would you know what to do with it?

244
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:18,900
Give a dog a bone,
would he know what to do?

245
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:22,201
Of course, I would.

246
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,666
Okay, it's a deal.

247
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:27,838
I am yours.

248
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,247
- Are you making fun of me?
- Not at all.

249
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:35,718
It made a lot of sense what you said.
You're right.

250
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,379
You're a good cause.

251
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,252
I'm all yours.

252
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,722
- You're joking.
- Not at all.

253
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,728
Could we go buy some smokes?

254
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,800
You mean you'll stay next to me?

255
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:52,359
And I'll do anything you want.
No questions asked.

256
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:56,440
Now, you're making fun of me.

257
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:58,465
Try me.

258
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,908
Kiss me.

259
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,652
Again?

260
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:11,619
Okay, I believe you.

261
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,454
Right, can we get some smokes?

262
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,629
Let's start with drying off.

263
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:38,774
Okay, they're done.

264
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,652
- Give me your undies.
- No, it's okay.

265
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:43,721
Come on, don't be such a pussy.

266
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:47,519
I dried mine.
It feels so much better.

267
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,787
- They're all warm.
- I said it's okay!

268
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,730
You know this is the ladies' room, right?

269
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:57,927
Oh, really?

270
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:00,163
So tell the gentleman
to dress elsewhere.

271
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,271
Who?

272
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:04,342
The guy in the stall,
who you gave the pants to.

273
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:07,879
Oh, looks can be deceiving.
That's a woman.

274
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:10,648
Really? With a voice like that?

275
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:14,583
On the inside, he's a woman.
The outside doesn't count.

276
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,826
- What was that about?
- Nothing, just girl talk.

277
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,895
So what do we do now?

278
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,622
Now...

279
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:31,226
How about some breakfast before work?
I'm dying of hunger.

280
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:34,829
Less "dying," please.
Right now, I'm...

281
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,168
Thanks.

282
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,214
And give me some space,
it feels weird.

283
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:54,587
And stop saying "okay"
whenever I open my mouth.

284
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,764
You want half?

285
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:07,533
I'm not hungry.

286
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:10,369
Eat! You need to build up your energy.

287
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:14,309
See that? It's going down south.
I love the south.

288
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:15,971
Me, too.

289
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:18,113
I dreamed of moving...

290
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,707
Why didn't you?

291
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,248
- One day maybe.
- Why not today?

292
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:27,184
- Today's not a good idea.
- Sure it is.

293
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:30,557
Hop on a train, next stop the beach,
just the two of us.

294
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,156
The sea shimmers...

295
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,066
- You know that song?
- By heart.

296
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:38,693
- Shall we go?
- Where?

297
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:39,896
Down south.

298
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,309
We can’t just take off like that.

299
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,104
I have problems to take care of.

300
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:47,940
Problems? Can I help?

301
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,282
Maybe.

302
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,612
Super, what do I have to do?

303
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,620
Nothing. Just stay close by.

304
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:57,916
Is that all?

305
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,583
That way, they'll think...

306
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:03,552
That we're...

307
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:07,865
That we're together.
That'll blow them away.

308
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:11,367
They'll start to respect me.
See what I mean?

309
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,528
Not at all.

310
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:13,900
Of course not.

311
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,742
First, I'd like to thank you
for welcoming us.

312
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:20,835
- Cut the crap.
- Right.

313
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,471
I owe you money.

314
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,413
Not a great amount for you,
but a huge one for me.

315
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:29,146
I'm waiting for news from my business
in Argentina.

316
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:30,482
What business?

317
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:33,088
Olive oil.

318
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:37,593
It's winter.
No olive oil for five months.

319
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:40,426
True... I was relying on our stocks,

320
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:42,466
but it all got stolen.

321
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:45,263
People are starving down there.

322
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,205
Even so, stealing olive oil!

323
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:54,603
- Who's the girl?
- Who?

324
00:21:57,449 --> 00:22:00,350
Her? She's my partner.

325
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:02,215
- So, Frank...
- First names?

326
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:04,152
- Of course not.
- Well then!

327
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:08,090
I thought, " You can't pay Frank.
Stop kidding yourself.

328
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:10,286
"You can cut him " in."

329
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:12,590
I swear I'm sitting on a gold mine.

330
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,859
If it's your mine, count me out.

331
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,030
- I cut some great deals.
- You're a loser.

332
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:25,132
The few times you barely came through,
it was cuckold's luck.

333
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:27,871
Good thing you never got married.

334
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:31,073
Look at you. A bum!
You stink a mile away.

335
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:33,081
Who'd even throw you a dime?

336
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:34,916
I'm sorry.

337
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:39,514
I had no time to shave.
I worked my ass off to get your cash.

338
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:41,091
But when you are in a hole...

339
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:44,685
Stop the drama.
You dug your hole all by yourself.

340
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:52,232
You have six more hours to get my 30,000

341
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:54,601
or I'll have two Serbs on you.

342
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,105
Two Serbs?

343
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,338
Two Bosnians, if you prefer.

344
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:01,509
Come on, Frank...

345
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,542
In that case...

346
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,883
Don't you have a little job?
A shitty job, anything.

347
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,686
I think I know what he'd enjoy.

348
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,121
Just a second...

349
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:24,935
Zip your lip.
You want to get me fired.

350
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:28,062
You're already fired.
You negotiate like an amateur.

351
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:29,606
An amateur?

352
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:32,776
Cut to it.
Quit beating around the bush?

353
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:34,707
What bush?

354
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,313
Just shut up
and let me close the deal...

355
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,476
- Some deal!
- Shut the fuck up!

356
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:42,052
Shut it.

357
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,360
Where were we?

358
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:02,197
Let your friend do the talking.
She seems smarter than you.

359
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:04,207
No problem.

360
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:07,369
If you want to talk with her...
We're partners.

361
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,470
Me or her, it's the same.

362
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,138
Can you take over?

363
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:13,580
Where do you want to do it?

364
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,953
My study upstairs will be more quiet.

365
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:17,953
Perfect.

366
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:28,164
You're the best.

367
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:39,635
This guy, he's a killer.
He'll fuck you over...

368
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:42,941
It's cool.
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.

369
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:45,615
Be good.

370
00:24:58,063 --> 00:24:59,724
Where were you? It's been an hour!

371
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,629
I was five minutes.
It worked out fine.

372
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:05,703
Listen to you!
The guy's a killer!

373
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,499
He could have croaked you.

374
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,666
Must be my lucky day.
Here, this is for you.

375
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,677
What's this?

376
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:16,213
Paper with pictures on it.
It's called money.

377
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,450
- What about my debts?
- History.

378
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:23,315
He wiped the slate clean.
You're virgin snow.

379
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:27,448
You can breathe again
and build yourself back up.

380
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,584
What did you do?
Sell your mother or what?

381
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:30,661
Course not!

382
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:32,753
Come on, tell me what happened.

383
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,059
What do you care?
Your problem's solved.

384
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:37,794
Look to the future now. Onward!

385
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:42,229
Onward, my ass!
If it's dirty money, I don't want it.

386
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,739
What's dirty money?

387
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:46,333
If you did nasty stuff, keep it.

388
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:50,107
When you got to an ATM,
do you ask where the cash is from?

389
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:52,648
From the ATM.
That's good enough for me.

390
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:54,776
I'm your ATM today.

391
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,855
Take your cash
and shut the fuck up!

392
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,587
It'll come in handy...

393
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,029
How much is there?

394
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,927
Enough to pay the Spaniard.

395
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:08,556
Ah... That's genius.

396
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,263
How do you know about the Spaniard?

397
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:17,068
Everybody knows about your debts.

398
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:19,143
- I don't want it!
- Why the hell not?

399
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,678
'Cause I'm sure you did
nasty shit with Frank.

400
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,475
I'm not a pimp!

401
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:25,810
- Nonsense...
- Yes, sense! Give me that.

402
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,952
Don't think I didn't see you shaking it.

403
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:32,751
- I was shaking it?
- Flashing your panties. I saw you.

404
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:33,882
A trick of the eye!

405
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:37,291
I saw it in his eyes.
He didn't hear a word I said.

406
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:39,955
You have to admit
you were pretty slow.

407
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:43,193
I was talking business
with its codes and language.

408
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:44,893
Body language!

409
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:47,836
You appear weak,
and then you pounce!

410
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,635
He's not a kitten.
You're dealing with a criminal.

411
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:52,369
And you were bad like a fifth grader.

412
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:56,243
I have my dignity. Principles.
You wouldn't understand.

413
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:58,576
So why didn't you act on them?

414
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:02,676
He was as soft as a marshmallow.
You could have gotten 10,000 easy.

415
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:05,585
No way in hell!
I thought about it.

416
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:09,023
The brain is big,
why use just a little bit?

417
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:12,119
You are so wrong.
I use it all!

418
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,095
I think around the clock.

419
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,894
Now, I'm thinking it's "adios."

420
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:19,869
You think little. Pay your little debts,
your little plane ticket,

421
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,997
hurry home
and sell your little studio in Brooklyn.

422
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:28,537
You know about my penthouse?

423
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,615
Call that a penthouse? A rat hole?

424
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:33,809
I bought it at a good price...
And the market value...

425
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:36,887
Forget your studio in Brooklyn.
That's not the problem.

426
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:39,957
Your problem
is that you're always running

427
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:43,323
without stopping, thinking...
Taking a breath!

428
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:47,756
Getting oxygen to your brain...
So it'll be happy

429
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:51,302
and help you make the right decisions.

430
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:52,563
Breathe!

431
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:54,763
Breathe!

432
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,732
That's right. Look...

433
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:03,239
Head up!

434
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,488
The clouds...

435
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,327
The birds...

436
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:19,157
Life...

437
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:21,095
It's all around.

438
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,170
Isn't this the most beautiful city?

439
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,004
How should I have handled Frank?

440
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,381
By telling him the truth, that's all.

441
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:42,710
What truth?

442
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:46,583
The only one you don't want to hear.

443
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,487
The money I owe
is tainted by prostitution, drugs...

444
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:54,497
I'll never pay it back.
I hate that shit.

445
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:56,066
This is it, slime ball,

446
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:58,965
I refuse to waste my time with lowlifes.

447
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:01,469
Bravo, André.

448
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,097
I should have said that?

449
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:04,436
Didn't you think it?

450
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:06,476
You can't always say what you think.

451
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,739
Why not?
Life might be cooler, no?

452
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,576
And we could make the most of Paris.

453
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,581
How about a cruise on the Seine?

454
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:15,710
This is no time for boat trips!

455
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:17,651
Oh, yeah?
When is a good time?

456
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:21,749
When there's no stress.
Right now, I'm stressed.

457
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,452
It'll only take five minutes.

458
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:24,789
Stop it.

459
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,422
- Anyway, I can't swim.
- Liar! You jumped in to save me!

460
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:31,969
I wasn't thinking.
Now I am and I remember I can't swim.

461
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:36,166
- Pretty please!
- No, no, no! Forget it!

462
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:38,242
When I say no, I mean it.

463
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:45,640
I always dreamed
of taking a boat ride up the Seine.

464
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,718
It's so romantic.

465
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:49,285
I feel sick.

466
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,947
I'm happy. Here. Now.

467
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:54,752
At this precise moment.

468
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:57,726
You save my life,
you fulfill my dreams...

469
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,797
See, you are able to do good.

470
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:01,490
It only works on you.

471
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:04,796
- We should do this again at night.
- Absolutely not!

472
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:07,235
The boats with all their lights on...

473
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:10,501
So pretty from up above,
winding downstream,

474
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:12,906
like baubles of light gliding along.

475
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:15,980
- From up above?
- Up there. From the sky.

476
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,781
Come on, chill a little.

477
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:26,413
You're so tense.

478
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:30,051
It makes you all wrinkly just there,
like a turtle.

479
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:32,153
You never had money problems.

480
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:34,163
No, I never had any.

481
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:36,496
What? Problems or money?

482
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:37,557
Either.

483
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:42,103
Good for you,
but I always have problems with both.

484
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:44,573
You have money now to pay your debts.

485
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,474
I owe the Spaniard much more.

486
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:50,412
No sweat, let's go make more money!

487
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:52,243
Let's go make more money!

488
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:55,284
Oh, snap your fingers,
here comes the moolah?

489
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:57,320
Didn't I just score 20,000 in five minutes?

490
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:58,821
That's not the same.

491
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:01,915
Yes, it is the same.
How much do you need to be happy?

492
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:05,560
- What are you talking about?
- Your debts? How much do you owe?

493
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:08,126
- In total?
- Obviously.

494
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:10,258
I've absolutely no idea.

495
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:12,733
30...

496
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:14,464
35...

497
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:16,972
With interest, let's say 50,000.

498
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:20,272
- I'm so in the shit.
- 50,000? Spilled milk!

499
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,868
Come on, let's go!

500
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:24,379
- Go where?
- Where there's music.

501
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:25,981
What for?

502
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:28,244
I like to work to music.

503
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,054
- How you doing?
- I'm fine.

504
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:41,299
You want a fuck in the restroom?

505
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:43,096
You want a fuck in the restroom?

506
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:47,362
A straight-talker, huh?
Might I ask your name first?

507
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:49,838
You won't need it. Well?

508
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:53,469
How much are you willing to pay?

509
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,375
I see.
Why should I pay?

510
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:58,448
What you don't pay for
has no value.

511
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,641
Good point.

512
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:00,978
Well? How much?

513
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:05,689
- 500.
- 1,000 and I'll do it all.

514
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,988
That's a deal.

515
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:25,870
Here. 1,000...

516
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:28,503
What's that for?

517
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,945
The tall blonde said to give it to you.

518
00:32:57,175 --> 00:32:58,608
Angela?

519
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,209
What?

520
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:14,148
- What are you doing?
- Guess.

521
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:16,660
You can't do this.

522
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,626
I don't want you to do that for me.

523
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:22,192
I thought you needed cash.

524
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:26,926
Yes, I do,
but I still have some moral values.

525
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:28,801
I don't want you doing this.

526
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:32,637
I'm grateful. I'm thankful.
It's a very kind gesture...

527
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:34,974
But I can't let you do it.

528
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,979
It's no big deal.

529
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:38,673
It is a big deal.

530
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,443
Of course it is!

531
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:42,780
Stop now and come out here.

532
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:45,253
Let's say I'm doing it for me

533
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:48,883
and you're keeping the money
so I don't spend it all.

534
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:53,225
I don't feel well.
Please, come out and let's go.

535
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:55,060
Just do as she asked.

536
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,600
Now back off, I'm nearly done!

537
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:04,398
Honestly, I...
I can't leave you here like this.

538
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:09,036
Go back to the bar
or we'll be here all night.

539
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,716
- I'll be at the bar.
- Go!

540
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:49,776
500, isn't it?

541
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:51,980
Party's over.

542
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,142
Don't be rotten. Just five minutes.

543
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:56,644
I just told you, no more!

544
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:00,523
- You had it three times!
- No, I didn't. Not even once.

545
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:03,423
I've been waiting in line for hours.

546
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:05,996
Be a good chap.
Here, I'll give you 1,000.

547
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:10,066
Keep your money!
I told you, the kid's tired.

548
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,261
Tired? She's had everybody here.

549
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,634
One more won't make any difference.

550
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,297
It certainly will!

551
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:18,875
Just "one more" makes me realize.

552
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:19,943
Realize what?

553
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:22,239
I don't want her being damaged.

554
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:24,672
Not for my benefit.

555
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:27,384
I don't deserve that.

556
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:31,952
And I don't want
to join the asshole club like you.

557
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:35,082
Scram before I lose my temper.

558
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,796
See where telling the truth gets you?

559
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:42,866
You didn't have to insult him.

560
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:45,095
Especially the stuff about his mom.

561
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,467
It just popped out.

562
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:50,598
Good, you're improving.
You spoke from the heart.

563
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:53,233
At this rate, I won't last the night.

564
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:55,608
You're always whining, aren't you?

565
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,681
Did you see the evening I had?

566
00:36:57,782 --> 00:37:00,318
In a bar, pimping you out.
I'm ashamed.

567
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:02,616
You'd rather have been in my shoes?

568
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,957
So, drop it.

569
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:12,325
I thought having money
would cheer you up.

570
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:15,365
It's in your pocket now, so smile.

571
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:18,902
I wanna pay off my debts first.
Then I'll smile.

572
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:31,808
What are you gawking at?

573
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,654
Stay close by just in case.

574
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:39,847
You come across a paper bag?

575
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:42,824
- Always humiliating me.
- You don't need me for that.

576
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,656
There you go again.

577
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:47,390
- I treat you like you treat me.
- I should've let you drown!

578
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:48,988
- Pardon?
- Nothing.

579
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:08,214
Don't start! I'll die with shame.
No more dancing.

580
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:10,084
Don't start!

581
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:12,018
I'm kind of famous here.

582
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:31,341
Pedro!

583
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:34,002
You want me to lose my shirt?

584
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:49,353
You got some nerve coming here.
Lost your memory?

585
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,623
I made a quick roundtrip to Argentina.

586
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,960
- What for?
- Business. Didn't you know?

587
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:56,033
Well, now you know.

588
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:58,328
So you can pay me back?

589
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:00,436
That's why I'm here.

590
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:02,233
Straight up?

591
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,168
I'm impressed.

592
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,202
- Drink?
- Why not? With pleasure.

593
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:10,280
- What'll it be?
- Vodka tonic.

594
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:12,443
What about your chick?

595
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:14,551
Should I answer or cluck?

596
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:16,852
- Just answer.
- The same, please.

597
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:18,854
Two vodka tonics for my pals.

598
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,083
- She's pretty.
- Yeah, I know.

599
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,354
We met on a... In Argentina.

600
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,854
Very blonde for a Latina, huh?

601
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:31,401
Yeah, her mother's from Sweden.

602
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:36,606
Hi, my name's Pedro.
You can call me Pepito.

603
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,471
If you'd like a job here,
no problem!

604
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:41,545
In Spanish or Swedish?

605
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:43,374
Answer... Doesn't matter.

606
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:45,839
Very pleased to meet you, too.

607
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:50,785
You've got a cool place here,
it's got flavor.

608
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:58,490
Good accounts make good friendships.
How much do I owe you?

609
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,963
17,000 plus interest, let's say

610
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:04,662
€20,000.

611
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:05,861
Are we cool?

612
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:07,429
We're cool.

613
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:10,702
I take back all that I said about you.

614
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:13,140
- And God knows I said a lot!
- Fair enough.

615
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,940
I should've called when I fell behind.

616
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:18,378
Six months isn't a little bit behind...

617
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:22,077
A little bit...

618
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:24,153
Yeah, you should've called.

619
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:25,949
That's true, isn't it?

620
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:28,854
It's always nice to hear from friends.

621
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:31,691
Really?

622
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:34,125
I'm touched by that.

623
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:36,529
Plus, you're looking good, too!

624
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:37,931
I'm a little better.

625
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:40,128
- You seem more stable.
- That's true.

626
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:43,071
I'm getting there.
I wasn't in good shape.

627
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:44,641
- Now, I'm better.
- That's good!

628
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:46,607
You were on a slippery slope.

629
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:48,675
I know. I know...

630
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:52,676
I even know guys
who put contracts on your head.

631
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:53,977
Is that true?

632
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,983
It didn't come from me, okay?

633
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,546
Anyway, I'd rather die
than defaulting my debts.

634
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:01,750
- Easy now...
- I swear!

635
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:05,022
Yesterday morning,
I nearly topped myself.

636
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:10,158
I... I was on a bridge.

637
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:12,763
I climbed over the rail

638
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,538
and I nearly jumped.

639
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,005
Don't screw up now.

640
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:21,771
This one's counting on you now.
Can't let her down.

641
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:23,608
I didn't, believe me.

642
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:28,549
Let me help you get back in the saddle.

643
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:35,150
I have a nag running in Miami,
called Brutus.

644
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:39,218
30-to-1.
I have a guy, he doped the favorites.

645
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:43,164
They'll drag their feet like donkeys.
But my horse, he's on speed.

646
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:45,326
He'll blow them away!

647
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:47,461
What if they test them?

648
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:51,007
I bribed the vet.
Brutus, number 7 in the third race.

649
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:53,406
- 30-to-1. Can you imagine!
- I imagine!

650
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:56,071
- This is only for you, André.
- No problem.

651
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:59,114
- Don't drive the odds down now.
- You can trust me.

652
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:02,379
That's my gift.
For your return to business!

653
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:06,455
Thanks a lot. Seriously.

654
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:10,523
Number 7, in the third.
Live it up!

655
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,259
Diego, whatever my friends drink,
it's on me!

656
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,593
Señorita!

657
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,994
Did you see that?

658
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:20,434
With you next to me...
The respect I get!

659
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,733
He was eating out of my hand, Pepito.

660
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,334
Okay, what do we do now?

661
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:27,273
Make shit loads of money.

662
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:43,589
Miami. In the third.
All on number 7. Brutus.

663
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:45,594
I feel that you're
about to lose my money.

664
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:47,994
I'll pay you back. Triple.

665
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,558
Thank you!

666
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:55,069
Let me show you...

667
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:04,280
Come on, horsy!

668
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,383
He's in front!

669
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:17,453
Look at that, the Spaniard was right!

670
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:19,791
Come on, come on...

671
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:23,156
He's easing back, taking a breather.

672
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:28,061
What's going on?
Oh, it's an American tactic.

673
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:32,270
He's catching his breath.
He's gonna go for the sprint!

674
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:34,640
Come on, fight! Catch them!

675
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:38,973
He's easing off too much.

676
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:42,715
Why is he walking?

677
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:58,757
He said number 7.

678
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,731
He... He said put it all on 7.

679
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:04,333
I put it all on 7.

680
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:05,999
And number 1 won?

681
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:12,209
I lost it all.

682
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:14,840
With a name like that,
what did you expect?

683
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,714
Why'd you say that?

684
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,414
Brutus! Caesar's buddy.

685
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:21,957
Killed him. Stabbed him in the back.

686
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:25,688
- Why didn't you say?
- You should have listened in school!

687
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:27,561
Yeah, right.

688
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:31,457
What's with the smoking?

689
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:35,265
Where I live, there's no smoking.
Can't even sneak one.

690
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:36,600
I'm catching up.

691
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:38,971
Cancer's all you'll catch.
Give me that.

692
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:44,280
- How about some breakfast?
- I'm flat broke.

693
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:45,439
No worries.

694
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:49,617
I kept one, just in case
business went bad.

695
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:50,914
Give it to me.

696
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:53,717
It's a dodgy neighborhood.

697
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:57,752
Thank you.

698
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:01,722
Get me back in the saddle?
What a joke!

699
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:03,959
Back to earth with a bang!

700
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:05,467
Yeah, me, too.

701
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:10,472
No croissants where you live?

702
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:13,805
- He ever give you a tip before?
- Course not.

703
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:18,348
So what made you think
he'd give you one now?

704
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:21,543
- I don't know... I believed.
- Because he flattered you.

705
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:24,978
All right, he suckered me.
Happy now?

706
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:28,124
Since you have such low self-esteem,
you fall for flattery.

707
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:29,453
I fall?

708
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:33,162
You don't seem to mind when I fell for you!

709
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:34,890
And why are you busting my balls?

710
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:39,094
Who are you?
How come you dropped into my life?

711
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:41,763
I didn't come. I fell out of the sky.

712
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:45,134
Off a bridge! I was there.

713
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:47,143
So was I. Before that...

714
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:50,270
- I fell from the sky.
- What do you mean?

715
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:54,784
- From a plane?
- No, the sky. Upstairs.

716
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,444
That's where I live.

717
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:12,659
I'm an angel, if you prefer.

718
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:14,694
An angel?

719
00:46:14,805 --> 00:46:17,774
The real thing.
Big, white wings and all.

720
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:20,776
So where are your big,
white wings and all?

721
00:46:20,878 --> 00:46:23,108
You expect me to spread them in a café?

722
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:24,373
Achain-smoking angel?

723
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:27,382
Why do you give a fuck? I'm immortal.

724
00:46:28,218 --> 00:46:30,083
Okay, so you're an angel.

725
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,046
I'm open-minded. You're an angel.

726
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:34,283
Well, it's a good start.

727
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:37,485
So what's going on upstairs?
What's happening?

728
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:39,892
Nothing special. It's just routine.

729
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:42,898
Come on, tell me honestly.
What's it like?

730
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,093
You don't believe me?

731
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:48,560
A leggy blonde who smokes like a chimney

732
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:51,038
isn't exactly how one pictures an angel.

733
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:54,139
You're not even gonna show me your wings.

734
00:46:54,244 --> 00:46:56,576
Screw my wings!
I can't spread them here.

735
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:59,739
One, they're too big
and two, unfurling your wings

736
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:01,942
means your mission's accomplished.

737
00:47:02,085 --> 00:47:06,988
And you're being an ass, it's unlikely
I'll be going home soon.

738
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:09,558
What mission?

739
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:13,428
- To help you.
- You haven't since I met you.

740
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:17,022
You mess it up by lying all the time,
even to yourself.

741
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:20,898
And not just little yarns.
You lie to yourself profoundly.

742
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:23,529
You're scared.
Scared of you, scared the whole time.

743
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,232
You're shut like an oyster.

744
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:28,311
You came from heaven
to tell me I'm an oyster?

745
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:31,711
To help you grasp
how things work inside there.

746
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:35,808
To help you know exactly who you are,
so you accept it.

747
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:38,314
- Is that all?
- It's enough!

748
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:40,047
You're a kind of shrink?

749
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:42,125
It won't cost you €100.

750
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:47,855
Right, let's recap.
You're an angel,

751
00:47:47,998 --> 00:47:50,933
on your cloud, waiting for your mission?

752
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:53,059
Simplistic, but more or less.

753
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:57,129
Someone yells out,
"Angela, can you take case 12,737?"

754
00:47:57,241 --> 00:48:00,642
You don't choose.
You take what you're given.

755
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:04,980
If angels started to pick and choose,

756
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:06,106
the dispatchers would go mad.

757
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:10,016
Yeah. Can't upset the dispatchers.
Then?

758
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:12,687
Once you get your mission,

759
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:15,519
you go to Wardrobe.
That's my favorite part!

760
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:18,755
- And what'd you pick for a costume?
- Sexy bitch!

761
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:21,387
- Sexy bitch suits you.
- Thank you!

762
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:23,159
I've already tried most of everything.

763
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:26,862
I thought it'd be fun
to try something weird for once.

764
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:30,298
- You been doing it for long?
- 300 years or so.

765
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:32,238
I'm still a junior.

766
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:35,705
What's so funny?

767
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:44,884
It's extraordinary! What a story!

768
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:48,625
I never met a girl with such imagination.

769
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:54,125
You should write books, or encyclopedias.

770
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:55,892
We'd cash in!

771
00:48:57,734 --> 00:48:59,861
You still don't believe me?

772
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:02,764
No!

773
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:25,655
There is no worse pain for an angel
than to be rejected

774
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:29,095
by their human half,
having failed the mission.

775
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:31,463
Don't get in such a state.

776
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:38,038
Try to understand. I'm such a clown,
The Man Upstairs sends you?

777
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:40,040
But, yeah, what's the problem?

778
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:43,442
On earth,
we have to see it to believe it.

779
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:46,515
When were you here last?
It's a materialistic world now.

780
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:49,949
With all the satellites, science, TV,

781
00:49:50,053 --> 00:49:52,385
people don't believe in miracles anymore.

782
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,354
They need proof, see?

783
00:49:57,728 --> 00:49:59,320
Little something?

784
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:05,495
You men are all the same!
Always wanting proof, reassurance...

785
00:50:05,602 --> 00:50:08,571
Isn't that my problem?
No self-confidence?

786
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:13,036
If I have faith in you,
maybe I'll have faith in me.

787
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:21,849
Don't tell anyone.
I don't want to get fired.

788
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,252
- I swear.
- Please don't swear!

789
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:28,889
I promise.

790
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:51,780
Does that suit you?

791
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:53,610
How did you do that thing?

792
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,081
Are you kidding me!

793
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:58,484
Here's your proof.
And you still don't believe me?

794
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:01,082
- How did you...
- You're a real idiot!

795
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:03,682
Forget miracles, you need hitting.

796
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:09,159
I... I didn't see the thing... Cigarette...

797
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:11,826
I... I wasn't concentrating.

798
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:16,603
Angela, I'm asking you sweetly.
Please do it again.

799
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,168
Please?

800
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:20,237
Last time I'll ask.

801
00:51:20,844 --> 00:51:22,004
Okay.

802
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:47,329
Waiter! Another coffee

803
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:49,701
and a vodka tonic for him, please.

804
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,942
- Why me?
- Don't ask me. Not my department.

805
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:10,484
Surely because you're good inside,
and don't know it yet.

806
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,921
I'm here to help you learn.

807
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:15,793
I'm your reflection. Your image.

808
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,158
I am you.

809
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:29,410
- I'm a 6-foot sexy bitch?
- A little, on the inside.

810
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:35,347
- I'm not a woman.
- Yes, partly.

811
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:38,016
You're even more feminine
than masculine, in fact.

812
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:42,080
It's from there you derive
your sensitivity, humor, spirit...

813
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:44,251
Those are feminine characteristics.

814
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:46,329
Men are hunters.

815
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:50,122
You're not cut out for hunting.

816
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:53,361
From the male traits
you only kept the bad ones.

817
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:57,599
Lies, ambition,
fear of not making the grade,

818
00:52:57,707 --> 00:53:00,301
fear of being judged, fear of loving.

819
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:10,185
- You see all that in me?
- All.

820
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:15,189
And let me tell you,
you're mind-blowingly hot on the inside.

821
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:23,594
The outside's my problem.

822
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:26,332
Let's go outside.

823
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,900
Is it me losing feathers?

824
00:54:01,605 --> 00:54:03,163
On my back? Am I?

825
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:08,604
I need calcium. I have to eat.

826
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,348
Cheese is good for calcium.

827
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:16,112
Double cheese, double ham,
double salad, please.

828
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,247
Stop looking like you'll eat me.

829
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:21,221
Sorry, it's just...

830
00:54:22,492 --> 00:54:24,221
I'm not used to...

831
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:26,820
Someone next to me.

832
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,296
- Time to learn.
- Yeah, I know.

833
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,391
My whole life I've been in the shit.

834
00:54:33,903 --> 00:54:35,871
No one ever helped me out.

835
00:54:36,473 --> 00:54:38,839
- Never.
- But it's now that you're in the shit.

836
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:39,931
Why?

837
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:43,308
Because now you have no more excuses
to stay in it.

838
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:44,779
Thanks.

839
00:54:44,914 --> 00:54:47,109
- Do you have mustard, please?
- On the counter.

840
00:54:47,217 --> 00:54:48,275
It's free.

841
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,183
Can I take a napkin?

842
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:56,955
Mustard's free.
The sandwich is €8.

843
00:54:58,161 --> 00:55:00,356
I put a 10 on the counter.

844
00:55:01,598 --> 00:55:04,260
Look, no €10!

845
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:08,061
- It must have blown away.
- Never put €10.

846
00:55:08,171 --> 00:55:11,971
Don't mess with Romanians.
Many here! Pay!

847
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:15,243
Save your tickets for tourists.
I'm a Parisian I...

848
00:55:15,345 --> 00:55:16,403
You pay!

849
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:18,912
Or else no get out alive! Get it?

850
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:20,914
Can I finish the negotiation?

851
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,085
"Voilà," it's better like that!

852
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:25,586
- How much do I owe you?
- It's on the house!

853
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:33,058
We clear?

854
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:38,259
Can't miss your masculine side, huh?

855
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:41,361
- Why did you do that?
- What did I do?

856
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:42,938
What is this?

857
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:46,771
- Where'd you get that?
- Why didn't you pay the guy?

858
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:49,105
Let's discuss this later.

859
00:55:49,212 --> 00:55:51,544
It wasn't even your money.
I gave it to you.

860
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:53,478
Precisely, it's all we had left.

861
00:55:53,616 --> 00:55:55,811
Stop sticking your finger in the dyke!

862
00:55:55,885 --> 00:55:57,819
You're cracked and full of holes!

863
00:55:57,921 --> 00:55:59,548
- Excuse me.
- You, shut it!

864
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:02,648
You're like a guy who takes
more bread to finish his cheese,

865
00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:04,818
then more cheese to finish his bread.

866
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:08,159
And the French take more wine
to finish both,

867
00:56:08,264 --> 00:56:10,892
then wonder why lunch lasts till 3:00 p.m.

868
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,865
What a stupid example!

869
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:14,834
I don't even like cheese.

870
00:56:14,938 --> 00:56:17,202
I'm just trying to solve my problems here.

871
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:19,036
You can't understand that.

872
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:22,771
You jump off a bridge, screw around,
smoke unfiltered. No problem.

873
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:25,575
Putting down my credibility
won't elevate yours.

874
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:30,513
You're a real head twist!
Why do you intellectualize everything?

875
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:32,315
It drives me crazy!

876
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:35,391
I only point out the mechanisms
that put you in the shit.

877
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:37,619
She's right. You're in deep shit.

878
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:45,566
Listen, mate, let me settle this.
I'll be right with you.

879
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:49,601
Thought you were here to help.
Why are you sucking my light?

880
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:50,900
You were shining bright?

881
00:56:51,007 --> 00:56:54,340
Maybe not bright,
but I was seeing things clearly.

882
00:56:54,444 --> 00:56:55,741
So why jump off a bridge?

883
00:56:57,847 --> 00:56:59,974
See?
That proves that she's after me!

884
00:57:00,116 --> 00:57:02,414
Do you remember our deal?

885
00:57:02,485 --> 00:57:04,510
Shut up and stay close, remember?

886
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:05,678
That's true.

887
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:07,346
All right then.

888
00:57:07,957 --> 00:57:10,619
So shut up and don't say a word.

889
00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:13,826
Don't even say "okay."

890
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:16,891
You shut up 100%.

891
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:19,462
You understand 100%?

892
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:23,605
Can we get down to business now?

893
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:28,272
- Angela, you know "Simon says"?
- I love it.

894
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:29,970
Simon says, crush them!

895
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:40,817
- That'll give us some air.
- What do we do now?

896
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:44,090
Not a word.

897
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:47,260
Now, we go.

898
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:51,364
We go that way!

899
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:56,661
Angela, I'd like to know more about you.

900
00:57:57,273 --> 00:57:59,241
About your past, on the earth.

901
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:00,973
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

902
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:04,741
I want to know.
What were you like as a kid?

903
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:10,475
We lived in the Paris projects.

904
00:58:11,354 --> 00:58:13,686
I was the oldest of eight kids.

905
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:15,280
I raised them.

906
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:22,529
Mom split when I was 15.
Dad was drunk from dawn to dusk.

907
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,864
I took the kids to school

908
00:58:25,969 --> 00:58:28,938
and turned tricks to buy food.

909
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:32,373
I died of ovarian cancer at age 23.

910
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:35,073
You poor thing, how awful!

911
00:58:38,214 --> 00:58:39,772
That's not a real life.

912
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:45,619
And I thought I had problems.

913
00:58:47,657 --> 00:58:50,956
- What's funny?
- You swallow anything. Like a fish.

914
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:52,584
It wasn't true?

915
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:56,424
I was a rich kid from Jersey.

916
00:58:56,933 --> 00:59:00,596
Dad worked for the U.N.
And Mom brought people together

917
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:03,763
by getting laid at cocktail parties.

918
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:06,307
On my 16th birthday, I got a Ferrari

919
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:08,969
and took aim at the nearest wall,

920
00:59:09,078 --> 00:59:12,343
so Daddy would notice me at last,
at my funeral.

921
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:14,416
I'm lost.
Which was your life?

922
00:59:14,517 --> 00:59:16,917
Which makes your life more bearable?

923
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:20,721
I don't know.

924
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:22,449
I can invent thousands,

925
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:26,552
but yours remains the same.
You have to accept it.

926
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:30,898
I understand what you're saying.

927
00:59:32,702 --> 00:59:34,397
I... I'm working on it.

928
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:38,507
I still want to know you.

929
00:59:39,475 --> 00:59:40,874
Who were you?

930
00:59:41,644 --> 00:59:42,906
Before?

931
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:56,318
I don't know who I am.

932
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,950
You don't know?

933
00:59:58,461 --> 01:00:00,691
You're from up there.
You're pretty well connected.

934
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:03,766
We can't access our past.
It's top secret.

935
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,060
Really?

936
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:07,667
That sucks.

937
01:00:11,574 --> 01:00:13,098
Do my questions bother you?

938
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:17,236
If you're really interested in me,
maybe you'll take an interest in yourself.

939
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:18,438
I'm not interesting.

940
01:00:18,581 --> 01:00:21,482
Of course you are.
You're good-looking, intelligent...

941
01:00:21,584 --> 01:00:24,485
- Bullshit.
- But, yes, I promise you.

942
01:00:24,587 --> 01:00:27,613
It's all in there,
but you won't see it or let it out.

943
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:29,282
I'm trying...

944
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:34,219
- It's not easy.
- But, yes, it is. I'll show you.

945
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:39,393
Look into the mirror.
What do you see?

946
01:00:44,874 --> 01:00:46,068
I see...

947
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:49,108
- An exceptional girl.
- Thank you.

948
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:51,112
Next to her, what do you see?

949
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:55,610
I don't know.

950
01:00:55,752 --> 01:00:57,686
- You're progressing.
- You think so?

951
01:00:57,787 --> 01:01:01,655
Before you saw only shit.
Now, at least, you see nothing.

952
01:01:01,791 --> 01:01:03,383
You've cleaned up well.

953
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:06,826
Now, you need to fill the empty shell.

954
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:09,931
You can't leave it empty.

955
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:12,627
Look hard. In front of you.

956
01:01:12,735 --> 01:01:15,727
Anything catch your eye
in this handsome face?

957
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:23,205
Not much.

958
01:01:23,312 --> 01:01:25,371
Look into your eyes.

959
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,005
What do you see?

960
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:35,553
Kindness.

961
01:01:35,658 --> 01:01:38,183
Yes, lots of it.

962
01:01:38,294 --> 01:01:39,522
What else?

963
01:01:46,436 --> 01:01:47,994
They're not bad-looking.

964
01:01:48,104 --> 01:01:49,935
Beauty, exactly.

965
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,201
They're beautiful.

966
01:01:52,308 --> 01:01:53,605
What else?

967
01:01:58,981 --> 01:02:00,346
Maybe...

968
01:02:01,684 --> 01:02:03,208
A little gentleness?

969
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:05,046
Yes, lots.

970
01:02:06,522 --> 01:02:07,887
And love?

971
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:12,555
Sure, lots of love.

972
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:15,195
Too much, maybe.

973
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:17,892
If there's too much,
it has to come out.

974
01:02:18,034 --> 01:02:19,968
- Say you love me.
- Pardon?

975
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:22,264
- You don't love me?
- Yes, a lot...

976
01:02:22,371 --> 01:02:23,770
I mean...

977
01:02:23,873 --> 01:02:27,969
I feel a sort of affection,
but it may be friendship...

978
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:30,204
Do you love me or don't you?

979
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,544
From the very first day.

980
01:02:38,855 --> 01:02:40,117
The very first second.

981
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:41,850
So, say it.

982
01:02:49,565 --> 01:02:51,362
It's hard to say.

983
01:02:52,301 --> 01:02:53,632
Do you know why?

984
01:02:54,403 --> 01:02:57,338
Because no one ever said it to you.
Am I right?

985
01:02:59,142 --> 01:03:02,475
It's hard to love yourself
when no one reflects that.

986
01:03:07,483 --> 01:03:08,814
I love you, André.

987
01:03:10,419 --> 01:03:12,853
See, you've received love.

988
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:15,753
Now, you can give some in turn.
Go on...

989
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:23,798
I love you, Angela.

990
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:28,663
Or whatever your name is.

991
01:03:28,771 --> 01:03:30,329
You're right.

992
01:03:30,439 --> 01:03:32,566
Say it again without my name.

993
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:38,378
I love you.

994
01:03:40,283 --> 01:03:41,648
That's good.

995
01:03:42,552 --> 01:03:45,316
Now, look yourself in the eye

996
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:46,786
and say it.

997
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:01,262
I can't.

998
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:03,133
Of course you can.

999
01:04:03,573 --> 01:04:07,873
Look at your body,
battered by the lack of love and trust...

1000
01:04:09,278 --> 01:04:12,008
Don't you see it deserves a little care?

1001
01:04:12,648 --> 01:04:15,708
Don't reject your wounded body.

1002
01:04:16,118 --> 01:04:20,248
It's suffered in silence all this time.

1003
01:04:21,824 --> 01:04:25,089
Tell your body how important it is,

1004
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:26,855
that it has its place.

1005
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:30,256
Give it what it deserves.

1006
01:05:02,498 --> 01:05:04,193
I'm proud of you.

1007
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:08,960
Can we go eat? I'm starving.

1008
01:05:10,606 --> 01:05:14,042
You and food!
Were you starved of affection?

1009
01:05:14,143 --> 01:05:16,338
Stick to your own role, okay?

1010
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:17,637
Sure.

1011
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:31,386
- How can we pay?
- We'll do the dishes.

1012
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:35,120
That worked in the times of Charlemagne.

1013
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,823
We'll spend Christmas in jail.

1014
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:39,527
Stop whining for once and enjoy it.

1015
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:41,366
The wine is good, huh?

1016
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:44,064
- What is it?
- Château Cheval Blanc.

1017
01:05:45,141 --> 01:05:47,939
That's €1,000 a bottle!

1018
01:05:48,044 --> 01:05:50,478
1,500.
The most expensive on the list.

1019
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:53,912
It's stupid.
Price doesn't equal quality.

1020
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:56,041
What do you know?
You're in olive oil.

1021
01:05:56,185 --> 01:05:58,278
I know a little about wine...

1022
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:01,652
They must have a good bottle
at a reasonable price.

1023
01:06:02,158 --> 01:06:04,956
Look, Saint Chignan '98.
I'm sure that it's good.

1024
01:06:05,027 --> 01:06:06,392
Sommelier.

1025
01:06:06,495 --> 01:06:09,020
- What are you doing?
- Let's taste it.

1026
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:12,165
A Saint Chignan '98, please.

1027
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:16,738
Of course. It's reaching maturity.
A hint of spice, full bouquet...

1028
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:19,603
A good wine and a great choice,
my favorite.

1029
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:21,506
Do you do half-bottles?

1030
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:23,703
Never, it's by the liter here!

1031
01:06:26,182 --> 01:06:27,672
You're insane!

1032
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:30,217
I'm just trying to please you.
You've had a long day.

1033
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:31,843
Is that your mission?

1034
01:06:32,455 --> 01:06:35,754
It's to teach you a lot in a little time.

1035
01:06:35,858 --> 01:06:37,553
So you lose your desire to jump.

1036
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:40,220
If you plan to pay by hustling in the john,

1037
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:42,058
I won't wait at the bar.

1038
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:44,132
- Hustling?
- Don't act innocent.

1039
01:06:44,233 --> 01:06:45,860
I was there. I saw you.

1040
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:49,429
You saw or you heard?

1041
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:57,104
What?

1042
01:06:57,513 --> 01:06:59,174
What are you doing?

1043
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:01,281
Guess.

1044
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:04,385
I don't want you doing this.

1045
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:05,920
Don't you need the cash?

1046
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:08,490
I do, but I have some moral values.

1047
01:07:08,624 --> 01:07:11,092
I'm grateful for the kind gesture,

1048
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:12,660
but I can't let you do it.

1049
01:07:12,728 --> 01:07:14,491
It's no big deal.

1050
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:15,859
Yes, it is.

1051
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:18,993
Stop now, ask him to leave
and come out here.

1052
01:07:19,101 --> 01:07:21,194
Back off, I'm nearly done!

1053
01:07:25,975 --> 01:07:29,138
And Frank, in his office?
What did you do?

1054
01:07:32,948 --> 01:07:35,781
- You didn't!
- Just kidding.

1055
01:07:37,086 --> 01:07:38,678
That's a relief.

1056
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:41,221
Where'd you get the cash?

1057
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:53,424
You didn't!

1058
01:07:53,536 --> 01:07:56,130
Make up your mind.
Which do you prefer?

1059
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:58,873
I prefer we go.

1060
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:10,380
Just one night?

1061
01:08:15,124 --> 01:08:16,785
Do you have any luggage?

1062
01:08:16,892 --> 01:08:18,689
One piece. Out front.

1063
01:08:33,075 --> 01:08:34,565
Feeling better?

1064
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:36,275
I guess.

1065
01:08:36,378 --> 01:08:38,209
Are you coming to bed?

1066
01:08:38,848 --> 01:08:42,147
- I'm watching the moon.
- It won't leave. Come to bed.

1067
01:08:42,251 --> 01:08:43,878
Paris is beautiful.

1068
01:08:45,654 --> 01:08:47,485
I couldn't see

1069
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:49,581
beyond the end of my own nose.

1070
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:53,087
- Angela?
- What?

1071
01:08:54,663 --> 01:08:55,891
I think I love you.

1072
01:08:55,998 --> 01:08:58,432
Come on, you're missing something.

1073
01:08:58,501 --> 01:09:02,369
You lack affection,
so you latch onto the first thing.

1074
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:03,665
In this instance, me.

1075
01:09:03,772 --> 01:09:05,967
I swear you make me feel good.

1076
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:09,877
I like how you shake me up,

1077
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:11,947
without ever judging me.

1078
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:14,177
It makes me warm inside.

1079
01:09:15,618 --> 01:09:18,519
I haven't felt that for so long, if ever.

1080
01:09:19,288 --> 01:09:21,222
You just want to fuck.

1081
01:09:21,357 --> 01:09:22,722
No, I don't.

1082
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:25,720
Well, yeah, but...

1083
01:09:26,896 --> 01:09:28,591
It's stronger, hotter.

1084
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:30,632
You're getting sentimental.

1085
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:33,327
- Let's fuck.
- What are you doing?

1086
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:36,429
I don't please you anymore?

1087
01:09:37,072 --> 01:09:39,939
Of course you do,
but I don't want just a fuck.

1088
01:09:40,075 --> 01:09:42,100
I'd love to make love,

1089
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:45,476
but only when I feel liberated.

1090
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:48,043
Wake me up when you are.

1091
01:09:49,818 --> 01:09:51,342
It won't be long.

1092
01:09:52,488 --> 01:09:55,286
Come on. Come to bed now.

1093
01:09:55,391 --> 01:09:58,360
I can't sleep with you chewing on your bit.

1094
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:00,792
I'm not. I'm enjoying the room.

1095
01:10:01,297 --> 01:10:02,594
It's incredible.

1096
01:10:02,665 --> 01:10:04,462
By the way, how will we pay?

1097
01:10:04,833 --> 01:10:06,858
I cut a deal with the concierge.

1098
01:10:07,436 --> 01:10:08,494
How's that?

1099
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:12,005
He plays the ponies.
So I gave him a tip.

1100
01:10:12,107 --> 01:10:14,598
- A ruse?
- No, he'll win 10,000.

1101
01:10:15,578 --> 01:10:18,376
- You know the result?
- Every race, any place.

1102
01:10:18,514 --> 01:10:21,176
You're shitting me?
Why didn't you say earlier?

1103
01:10:21,317 --> 01:10:24,809
I did, but you had sawdust in your head.

1104
01:10:24,954 --> 01:10:29,618
Anyway, I can't divulge stuff like that.
It's absolutely forbidden.

1105
01:10:30,426 --> 01:10:34,055
If it's forbidden,
why did you tell me you're an angel?

1106
01:10:37,933 --> 01:10:39,628
I shouldn't have.

1107
01:10:40,469 --> 01:10:41,834
But why did you?

1108
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:53,438
What are you doing, Angela?

1109
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:55,379
Going to see your pal Frank.

1110
01:10:55,551 --> 01:10:57,519
In the middle of the night?
To say what?

1111
01:10:57,653 --> 01:10:59,587
Me? Nothing.
You'll be doing the talking.

1112
01:10:59,688 --> 01:11:02,851
We'll go there and you can unload on him.

1113
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:04,858
That way I can go back.

1114
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:06,789
Angela!

1115
01:11:09,064 --> 01:11:10,964
Okay and what do I say to him?

1116
01:11:11,634 --> 01:11:12,965
Don't start again.

1117
01:11:13,068 --> 01:11:15,969
I explained it to you.
The truth, nothing but the truth.

1118
01:11:16,071 --> 01:11:17,538
The truth, no problem.

1119
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:20,302
Does it hurt there?
Feel all knotted up?

1120
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:22,568
Less but it's still there.

1121
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:25,647
You need to get it out once and for all.

1122
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:27,715
What's out isn't in, got it?

1123
01:11:27,816 --> 01:11:30,410
Yeah, I got it.
What happens then?

1124
01:11:30,753 --> 01:11:34,280
Then, you're all clean inside.
Just need to fill up.

1125
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:37,249
Can't I fill up with you?

1126
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:38,826
Oh, please, not again.

1127
01:11:38,927 --> 01:11:40,758
Angela, I'm in love with you.

1128
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:44,021
You see everything.
You sense everything.

1129
01:11:44,099 --> 01:11:46,897
How come
you can't see something this simple?

1130
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:50,404
Concentrate, I'm begging you. Right there.

1131
01:11:51,573 --> 01:11:52,938
What do you feel?

1132
01:11:55,778 --> 01:11:59,009
- I feel something but...
- I feel exactly the same.

1133
01:12:00,616 --> 01:12:02,641
Now I have a name for it...

1134
01:12:04,053 --> 01:12:08,786
Okay, let's go see Frank,
this is starting to get out of control.

1135
01:12:10,793 --> 01:12:13,819
What if this is
where it starts to be something...

1136
01:12:16,498 --> 01:12:18,398
Like the truth for once?

1137
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:22,333
I'm sick of it, Angela.

1138
01:12:24,473 --> 01:12:27,033
Sick of screwing up,

1139
01:12:27,142 --> 01:12:28,575
sick of lying...

1140
01:12:32,481 --> 01:12:34,711
For the first time, I want to be true.

1141
01:12:38,554 --> 01:12:41,114
I want to say what I feel,

1142
01:12:41,223 --> 01:12:42,918
whatever it may be.

1143
01:12:45,761 --> 01:12:47,319
Do you know what I feel?

1144
01:12:47,429 --> 01:12:48,691
Be quiet.

1145
01:12:58,073 --> 01:12:59,836
"Mademoiselle," please...

1146
01:13:01,276 --> 01:13:03,608
This is not the time to fuck with me!

1147
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:09,610
Sorry to barge in so late at night.

1148
01:13:09,752 --> 01:13:12,687
André has something to say
and I've had enough.

1149
01:13:12,821 --> 01:13:15,551
I wanna go home.
Let's get this over with.

1150
01:13:15,657 --> 01:13:16,589
Excuse me?

1151
01:13:16,725 --> 01:13:19,319
- Who's she?
- You. Shut your face!

1152
01:13:19,428 --> 01:13:21,623
André, come on! He's here.

1153
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:22,924
In his bed.

1154
01:13:23,031 --> 01:13:24,999
What the hell is going on?

1155
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:30,065
Talk of breaking the rules.

1156
01:13:30,172 --> 01:13:32,003
The door, the bodyguards...

1157
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:35,904
And he's why you chose this hotel.

1158
01:13:36,011 --> 01:13:37,603
You'll get fired.

1159
01:13:37,713 --> 01:13:38,702
That's my problem.

1160
01:13:38,847 --> 01:13:42,806
Get a move on,
say your piece and vamoose.

1161
01:13:56,565 --> 01:13:58,362
You're not gonna kill me?

1162
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:06,937
Your coffee's not bad.

1163
01:14:10,312 --> 01:14:13,247
André, I... I'm sorry.

1164
01:14:14,016 --> 01:14:16,712
I know I offended you.
It was dumb of me.

1165
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:19,813
- We on a first name basis?
- Course not.

1166
01:14:20,389 --> 01:14:24,826
I took advantage of you.
I shouldn't have, it's so low.

1167
01:14:26,061 --> 01:14:29,497
How about a joint venture?
If you have time?

1168
01:14:29,598 --> 01:14:31,156
I'm begging you.

1169
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:37,363
Don't kill me.
Be cool, don't kill me.

1170
01:14:39,441 --> 01:14:41,705
I'm sorry I borrowed from you.

1171
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:43,437
I truly regret it.

1172
01:14:44,413 --> 01:14:47,143
Setting foot in your shit club
cost me time and money,

1173
01:14:47,282 --> 01:14:50,342
distracted me
from legitimate business in Paris.

1174
01:14:51,019 --> 01:14:52,816
But it was meant to be.

1175
01:14:52,921 --> 01:14:56,687
If you think you're shit,
you're drawn to shit, that's life.

1176
01:14:57,426 --> 01:14:59,690
It's why we got on so well.

1177
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:02,524
We enjoyed despising each other.

1178
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:10,732
One day, an angel came into my life.

1179
01:15:12,107 --> 01:15:14,769
A magnificent woman who opened my eyes.

1180
01:15:16,712 --> 01:15:19,943
And God knows,
it's so good to have your eyes open.

1181
01:15:21,416 --> 01:15:24,385
I can watch the sun rise over Paris.

1182
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:27,387
The lights flicking off one after the other.

1183
01:15:28,457 --> 01:15:30,084
I can see it all.

1184
01:15:32,561 --> 01:15:34,188
All thanks to her.

1185
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:37,758
She was good enough to never judge me.

1186
01:15:41,637 --> 01:15:43,434
To love me for what I am.

1187
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:46,968
Even if it's not much.

1188
01:15:52,781 --> 01:15:55,215
I'm happy for you, honestly.

1189
01:15:55,317 --> 01:15:57,615
But you won't kill me, will you?

1190
01:16:01,156 --> 01:16:02,589
I'll pity you.

1191
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:08,822
See that, Angela? I showed him!
For the first time ever. Where are you?

1192
01:17:09,524 --> 01:17:11,583
- What are you doing?
- I'm going home.

1193
01:17:11,693 --> 01:17:13,251
You can't do that.

1194
01:17:13,362 --> 01:17:17,526
Stop! I did exactly as you asked.
I'm empty.

1195
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:19,328
We can start over.

1196
01:17:19,434 --> 01:17:21,629
Together, choose good things to fill with.

1197
01:17:21,737 --> 01:17:23,398
You're a big boy, choose yourself.

1198
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:26,407
I don't want to.
I want to do it with you.

1199
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:29,236
Because I love you.
I want to spend my life with you.

1200
01:17:29,344 --> 01:17:31,938
If you leave,
I go back to square one.

1201
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:33,479
All that for nothing!

1202
01:17:33,582 --> 01:17:35,982
Destroy it all if you want to.

1203
01:17:36,084 --> 01:17:40,316
I took every risk for you.
I'm sure to get fired.

1204
01:17:40,422 --> 01:17:44,290
Do me a favor,
live the life you should live.

1205
01:17:45,627 --> 01:17:47,652
What if my life's with you?

1206
01:17:47,763 --> 01:17:51,130
It isn't!
I know your future by heart.

1207
01:17:51,967 --> 01:17:54,128
In two months, you set up a company

1208
01:17:54,236 --> 01:17:57,603
that will become a market leader in olive oil.

1209
01:17:57,673 --> 01:18:00,665
You will meet Catherine,
an attractive lawyer,

1210
01:18:00,776 --> 01:18:03,745
you will father three beautiful children.

1211
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:06,439
You want to know their names?

1212
01:18:06,581 --> 01:18:09,550
Find out how good they are at school?

1213
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:13,818
I want to know why you're crying.

1214
01:18:13,922 --> 01:18:16,789
Because I always do after a mission.

1215
01:18:16,892 --> 01:18:19,156
I'm made for greetings not goodbyes.

1216
01:18:19,261 --> 01:18:21,229
Does that answer your question?

1217
01:18:22,397 --> 01:18:23,830
Listen to me.

1218
01:18:24,166 --> 01:18:27,499
What you did for me is enormous.
I'll be eternally grateful.

1219
01:18:27,602 --> 01:18:30,196
Eternally! Don't use words
you don't know the meaning of.

1220
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:33,500
I'm sorry.

1221
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:37,436
You taught me the essential.
Never lie.

1222
01:18:40,515 --> 01:18:42,073
That's right. It's the most important.

1223
01:18:42,217 --> 01:18:44,242
So, begin with yourself!

1224
01:18:47,089 --> 01:18:49,250
Stop... Listen! Look at me!

1225
01:18:49,357 --> 01:18:51,723
Look me in the eye!

1226
01:18:53,228 --> 01:18:54,286
Leave me alone.

1227
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:56,227
Know what I see in those eyes?

1228
01:18:56,331 --> 01:18:58,299
A woman who doesn't want to go,

1229
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:01,528
who's sick of not knowing who she is.

1230
01:19:01,636 --> 01:19:04,503
Nobody gave you love either
or you’ve forgotten.

1231
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:05,562
Be quiet.

1232
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:06,732
I love you.

1233
01:19:07,275 --> 01:19:08,367
I love you.

1234
01:19:10,112 --> 01:19:11,909
I can't live without you.

1235
01:19:12,013 --> 01:19:14,174
What good is it to live with me?

1236
01:19:14,316 --> 01:19:19,015
All you'll get is a fallen angel
who burned her wings.

1237
01:19:19,121 --> 01:19:22,215
I don't care!
I love you as you are.

1238
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:34,731
I don't know who I am!

1239
01:19:34,836 --> 01:19:37,896
I have no past.
Do you understand that?

1240
01:19:37,973 --> 01:19:38,962
I know...

1241
01:19:40,175 --> 01:19:44,043
How can I build anything

1242
01:19:44,146 --> 01:19:46,614
if you don't know where I'm from?

1243
01:19:46,748 --> 01:19:50,479
I've no idea where I'm from!

1244
01:19:56,424 --> 01:19:57,391
I know.

1245
01:20:04,166 --> 01:20:06,066
I know you've no past.

1246
01:20:08,103 --> 01:20:10,128
Let me give you a future.

1247
01:20:15,911 --> 01:20:17,378
What do I do?

1248
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:19,340
My God!

1249
01:20:21,016 --> 01:20:22,711
What should I do?

1250
01:20:24,786 --> 01:20:26,720
Leave him out for once.

1251
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:44,038
What's happening?
What's going on?

1252
01:20:54,649 --> 01:20:57,015
I have to go. It's time.

1253
01:20:57,118 --> 01:20:59,882
Don't go, I'm begging you.
I love you.

1254
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:02,085
I love you, too.

1255
01:21:04,726 --> 01:21:05,920
I have to go.

1256
01:21:40,962 --> 01:21:43,089
We're going to fall!

1257
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:20,187
Shit!

1258
01:24:37,505 --> 01:24:39,735
My name's André Moussah.

1259
01:24:39,841 --> 01:24:42,207
I'm 28 and I am free.
