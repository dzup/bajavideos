THE HOLY GIRL

2
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:41,424
<i>Look,</i>

3
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:47,100
<i>look at the extreme vileness</i>

4
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:51,207
<i>that is singing like this</i>
<i>to you today.</i>

5
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:56,511
<i>What is it, Lord,</i>
<i>you want of me?</i>

6
00:01:56,816 --> 00:02:02,948
<i>What is it, Lord,</i>
<i>you want of me?</i>

7
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:38,381
<i>Give me wealth</i>

8
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:42,721
<i>or poverty.</i>

9
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:47,532
<i>Give consolation...</i>

10
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:48,325
Who is it?

11
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:51,868
<i>... or despair.</i>

12
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:57,107
<i>Grant me hell</i>

13
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,541
<i>or grant me heaven...</i>

14
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,780
The woman at the photocopy store.

15
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:07,851
<i>... radiant sun,</i>

16
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:12,890
<i>for I have given in to you,</i>

17
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:20,227
<i>for I have given in to you.</i>

18
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:24,466
She's short of air.
She doesn't know how to breathe.

19
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,332
It's bad for
the blood supply to the brain.

20
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,196
Corridor number 11.

21
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,605
Listen carefully.
Dr. Gutiérrez,

22
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,841
Dr. Vesalio, Dr. Olaz? Bal

23
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:12,640
and Dr. Jano, please follow me
along here to your left.

24
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:14,883
Everyone else,
follow the maid.

25
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:21,622
- Doctor, this is your corridor.
- Of course.

26
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,065
Is it the one behind?

27
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:30,335
No, it's this pipe here.

28
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,369
Put on your shoes!

29
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,208
But nothing's happening.

30
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,856
Dr. Jano,
this way, please.

31
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,160
We did some renovations,

32
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,661
but that was a while ago.

33
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,625
You can
listen to music on this.

34
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,036
Hello, how are you?

35
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,675
Hello, how are you?

36
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:14,344
I'll leave you the numbers
of the taxi service

37
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:15,844
for going into the center,

38
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,210
You're there in 15 minutes.

39
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,384
Massages, until 7:00,

40
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,645
8:00 or 9:00,
the masseuse is there.

41
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,948
But you can also go later.

42
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,685
Carlitos, my old friend!

43
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,953
- How are you?
- Fine, and you?

44
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,027
I'll see you later.

45
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,697
No, I told Dr. Vesalio

46
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,163
that you were sleeping
in this room.

47
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,858
In the other bed, of course.

48
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:39,705
I didn't know...

49
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,004
- You left this downstairs.
- Thank you, girls.

50
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:48,078
And forgive me.
They're the girls from Theriaca,

51
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,145
from the lab.

52
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,680
Girls! Just a second.

53
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,075
It's some perfume.

54
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:55,845
Your room will be free tomorrow.

55
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:07,424
The important thing is always
to be alert for God's call.

56
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,530
God calls us
and that is a vocation.

57
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,534
He calls us to save
and to be saved.

58
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,601
And that is the only meaning

59
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,934
our existence should have.

60
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:20,442
What do I have to do?
What is my role in the Divine Plan?

61
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,443
Is it this? Is it that?

62
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,540
What matters is to be
alert for the call

63
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:27,382
and not lose hope.

64
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:41,498
- What's that?
- It's coming from the street.

65
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,300
But what is the call like?

66
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:50,032
Is it something
you'll recognize?

67
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:52,504
Like a voice in the night?

68
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,874
But I get really scared
at night

69
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,573
and if I feel that
a voice is calling me

70
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,343
I'll think it's the Devil.

71
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,748
- Don't be silly.
- And the fear of God?

72
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:05,287
That something
completely different.

73
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,755
You can't confuse
ugliness with beauty,

74
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,928
or happiness with horror.

75
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:11,926
What if He asks me
to kill someone,

76
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:13,660
like He did with Abraham?

77
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,830
I'd think it was the Devil.

78
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,026
Don't compare yourself
to people in the Bible.

79
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:21,132
Before you go, we must
organize the photocopies.

80
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:23,632
Who's going to make them?

81
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:24,867
The photocopies...

82
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,777
- You've got the material?
- And the money.

83
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,641
I didn't bring any material

84
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:32,875
but I heard a story
that explains about a vocation.

85
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:34,886
It's a bit horrific.

86
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:37,180
- Is it short?
- No, it's quite long.

87
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,823
Why is it horrific?

88
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:42,321
Yesterday she was kissing a man
much older than her.

89
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,954
The same one as before,
with the hairy knuckles.

90
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,157
She couldn't breathe.

91
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:51,234
- He had his tongue down her throat.
- Girls, I have to go.

92
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:53,136
Really.

93
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:55,636
She never kissed
the other guy like that.

94
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,366
And he kept groping her.

95
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,471
She was shaking,
like she had epilepsy.

96
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:12,586
What can I have?
Anything tasty left?

97
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,985
- An escalope with something light?
- A salad?

98
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:17,787
A fried egg.

99
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:20,597
Go on.

100
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:22,658
It's a craving.

101
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:26,004
Manuel rang.

102
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,829
They're expecting twins.

103
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,137
He told me to tell you.

104
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,702
Twins...

105
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,012
Are they boys?

106
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:41,652
How could he know
if they're boys?

107
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:43,980
She isn't even
two months pregnant.

108
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:47,525
It's too early to tell,
Helenita.

109
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,291
Here, Florinda,

110
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,400
take this and check it.

111
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:04,670
My hair is so dry.

112
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,173
You shouldn't use
the hotel shampoo too often.

113
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:09,940
It's terrible.

114
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:13,011
It's all we can get
with the budget we have.

115
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,481
What should I do?

116
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,256
Do I call
and congratulate him?

117
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:24,329
Or should I wait
until he tells me himself?

118
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,426
Mirta...

119
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:29,158
What should I do?

120
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:33,472
Do I call and congratulate him
or wait for him to tell me?

121
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:35,296
He asked me to tell you,

122
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,771
so he knows that you know.

123
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,877
Don't get involved
in my affairs.

124
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,145
I'll eat something and go.

125
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,182
This room is freezing.
It's like a grave.

126
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:36,554
Don't say that,
you're scaring me.

127
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:41,588
You're freezing.

128
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:43,330
Don't say that.

129
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:48,771
Did you know you're going
to have twin stepbrothers?

130
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:52,535
Amalia...

131
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:56,506
- Are you listening?
- Don't say "stepbrothers", mom.

132
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,010
Who told you?

133
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:01,280
Your dad told Mirta.

134
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:05,282
Did you know?

135
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,020
See what he's like?

136
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:12,054
I'm always the last to hear.

137
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,473
There'll be a lot
of interesting lectures,

138
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,838
and several seminars.

139
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,408
Who's that?

140
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:34,211
One of the speakers.
The hotel is full of doctors.

141
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,323
They're attending
a very long congress.

142
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:43,193
Their hair will be
completely frizzled.

143
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,990
Don't use the hotel shampoo.

144
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,210
- 34?
- What?

145
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:07,611
I didn't say anything.

146
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,817
Lord, have mercy on us.
Christ, have mercy on us.

147
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:15,118
Lord, have mercy on us.
Christ, hear us.

148
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,522
Christ, hear us. Heavenly Father,
have mercy on us.

149
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,890
God the Son,
redeemer of the world.

150
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:21,794
Holy Mary, pray for us.
Holy Mother of God.

151
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,231
Virgin of Virgins,
Mother of the Divine Grace.

152
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:28,236
Mother most pure, Mother
most chaste, Mother without fault,

153
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,341
Mother most kind,
Mother most admirable,

154
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:32,909
Mother most wise,
Mother of the Creator,

155
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,740
Virgin most powerful,
Virgin most merciful,

156
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:37,673
Virgin most faithful,
Mirror of Justice,

157
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:40,147
Throne of eternal wisdom,
Cause of our joy,

158
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:41,478
Spiritual vessel,

159
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:44,212
Vessel of grace,
Vessel of true devotion,

160
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:46,584
Mystical Rose, Tower of David,
Tower of Ivory...

161
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:32,464
Mystical Rose, Tower of David,
Tower of Ivory...

162
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,870
Gate of heaven,
Star of the morning,

163
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:38,042
Health of the sick,
Refuge of sinners,

164
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:46,516
Comfort of the afflicted.

165
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,516
Queen of the Angels,
Queen of the Patriarchs,

166
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,656
Queen of the Prophets,
Queen of the Apostles...

167
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:55,088
Why must you memorize that?
Is there nothing more useful to do?

168
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:57,922
Amalia?

169
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,360
I'm talking to you.

170
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:03,160
Amalia!

171
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:06,133
Don't shout.
I learned it because I like it.

172
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:10,002
Lamb of God, who takes away
the sins of the world, forgive us.

173
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,945
Don't speak to me like that!

174
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,645
Good evening, Dr. Jano.

175
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:16,678
See you tomorrow.

176
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:20,045
Would you like a book of Spanish
ballads? They're really long.

177
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,651
"A-hunting goes the master,
as he always does,

178
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,846
the hounds are weary...

179
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,455
The hounds are weary..."

180
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:42,305
What time is it?

181
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,732
Aren't you wiped out?

182
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:48,509
<i>Mom!</i>

183
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:51,041
<i>Mom!</i>

184
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,321
What are you doing?

185
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:05,295
My key...

186
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,160
I can't find my key.

187
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:09,858
I can't get into my room.

188
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:11,965
Go and brush your teeth.

189
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,996
Why are you up so late?

190
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:17,599
I was watching a beautiful film.

191
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,810
I can't sleep anyway.

192
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:31,313
I can't believe Manuel didn't
tell me about the twins.

193
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:33,721
I can't believe it.

194
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:39,958
- Why don't you ask Mirta for a key?
- No, no.

195
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,892
Why not sleep in Amalia's room?

196
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,503
No, I'll lie down here
with you and Amalia.

197
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:48,832
I'd prefer that.
Look at the time.

198
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,969
If I tell Mirta,
she'll scream at me for hours.

199
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,203
Don't let her. I'm sick
of her interfering in my life.

200
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:00,142
Move over.

201
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,415
Oh, Lord, she's awake!

202
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,654
Sleep.

203
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:09,856
What a beautiful child!

204
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,791
Just like her mother.

205
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,637
That child, Helena,

206
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:22,940
is a blessing.

207
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:47,027
Hello?

208
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:49,728
Excuse me.

209
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:51,500
It's a friend.

210
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:56,571
An excellent idea. We need
a good close for the congress.

211
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:59,642
I had to share
with a colleague last night.

212
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,411
I'll call you at noon.

213
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:04,138
Love to the kids.

214
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:08,009
- Do you know Jano?
- Yes, we've met already.

215
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:10,846
How are you doing, doctor?

216
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:13,820
Cuesta wants me
to do a dramatization

217
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:15,288
to close the congress,

218
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:19,191
about the doctor-patient
relationship. I love the idea.

219
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:23,495
I'm going to show the difficulties
of interpretation,

220
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:25,192
what a good examination entails.

221
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,531
We may have to do
a few hearing tests.

222
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,773
It would have to be a case

223
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:32,302
that's very well documented
with studies,

224
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:35,810
and we could contrast it
with the patient's statements.

225
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:37,345
Yes, of course.

226
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:39,779
I forgot my shaving cream.

227
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,053
Jano, I'll have to steal yours.

228
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:44,814
- Well, I must be going...
- No, hang on.

229
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:47,457
Let's settle this.
It's a great idea.

230
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:50,628
I saw it done at a congress.
It's very didactic.

231
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:52,554
What we must find

232
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:55,296
is a patient
with an interesting problem.

233
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,628
- Thank you.
- I'll come by later.

234
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:00,796
Look at the time.

235
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:05,309
My Lady and Mother,
I offer myself to you,

236
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:07,911
I consecrate to you today
my eyes, my ears, my tongue,

237
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:09,740
my heart, my whole being,

238
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:11,575
for I am all yours.

239
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:14,581
Keep me and protect me
as your own. Amen.

240
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:16,518
Now!

241
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:21,756
Two red dots.

242
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,126
They have a yellow rim

243
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:26,954
and are slightly separated.

244
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,268
Some green lines.

245
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,332
Like rays?

246
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:35,636
Yes, they gradually disappear.

247
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:47,448
Things look different.

248
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,658
White seems much whiter.

249
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,339
Do you think a vocation

250
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,878
can be to save
just one person?

251
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:18,741
It's not much, is it?

252
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,208
Not at all.

253
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:23,245
It's perfect.

254
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:35,398
Your hair is so shiny!
Don't cut it.

255
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,661
Do we fit?

256
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:41,371
Your son?
What a coincidence!

257
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:43,106
The same school...

258
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:50,947
I met your kids
at the party for Felipe's kids.

259
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:55,516
When is it?

260
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:58,548
They'll pick us up
after the lecture.

261
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:46,769
Will you give me that?
I have to move Dr. Jano's things.

262
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:17,960
Hello!

263
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:20,738
Grandma...

264
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:50,398
What are you doing here?

265
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:52,931
Did you see grandma?

266
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,833
- She went to some kind of group.
- A prayer group.

267
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,435
- Did she say when she'd be back?
- In a while.

268
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:03,538
I've got the photocopies.

269
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:08,513
But did she say when?

270
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,299
Well, I'm off.

271
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:32,875
When grandma comes,
tell her that...

272
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:03,674
I don't want
pre-marital relations.

273
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,702
When will grandma be back?

274
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:10,044
She's coming later.

275
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:35,034
No, don't talk to me.

276
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:40,671
A complete examination
of the upper respiratory tract,

277
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:44,810
a good rhinoscopy,
a good laryngoscopy.

278
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:48,816
A proper study means that,
in a good interview,

279
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,750
and generally this is
what's hardest for us,

280
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:54,585
a good interview
will allow us to identify

281
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:57,087
all the symptoms and situations

282
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:59,363
that lead to a diagnosis,

283
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:02,192
and this should be done
at least twice,

284
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:06,201
that is, before and after
any medical treatment

285
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,269
or surgical treatment.

286
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:10,434
Well, that's everything.

287
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,340
Doctor, how was it?

288
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,106
Interesting, a bit long.

289
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:22,181
The lab people are here.
I have to speak to the director.

290
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,281
You know him quite well,
you can introduce me.

291
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,961
This is Dr. Jano. He and I studied
together. Do you remember?

292
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:33,994
- No. Hello.
- My sister Helena.

293
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,325
My pleasure.

294
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:40,196
Yes, I want to hear your lecture.
It should be very interesting.

295
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:43,033
The relationship
between doctor and patient...

296
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:44,731
No, that's Dr. Vesalio.

297
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:46,706
Mine is about
a case of Meniere.

298
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:49,642
I'll go along anyway,
because I like to attend

299
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:52,749
all the congresses we organize,
as a listener,

300
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:55,682
provided there are
no slides of operations.

301
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,912
No, it's mostly statistics.

302
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,426
We're all wiped out

303
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:10,601
and Sonia broke her shoe.

304
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:26,506
Weren't you a diver?

305
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,457
Yes.
I was a diver, years ago...

306
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:44,063
We don't have a cold pool anymore.
It was too expensive.

307
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:48,005
Now we just have the thermal pool.
But it's no use.

308
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:49,298
You've got a call.

309
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:51,168
- Who is it?
- Don Manuel's wife.

310
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:53,207
- What Manuel?
- Don Manuel.

311
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:57,044
- What Manuel?
- Your ex-husband.

312
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:01,080
- Tell her I'm busy.
- Very well.

313
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:14,488
One night,
a man was driving a truck

314
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:16,793
and before he crossed a bridge

315
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:19,937
a woman appeared,
desperately asking for help.

316
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:23,039
The woman came up to his window
and said,

317
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:27,202
"There's been an accident,
a car has fallen into the ditch.

318
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,178
Two people are dead
but there's a baby alive.

319
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:33,351
Please, call the firemen.
We must save the baby."

320
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:37,619
The firemen arrived,
they pulled the car out of the ditch

321
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,050
and turned it over.

322
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:41,054
Look, that's the bridge.

323
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:45,555
They found a couple
who were dead

324
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:48,562
but the woman was holding
a baby who was alive.

325
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,824
And the truck driver realized

326
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:53,869
that it was the same woman
who had asked him for help.

327
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:05,916
I think it's here.

328
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:17,593
What's this?

329
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:19,662
A hand!

330
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:22,758
Girls, a hand! A hand!

331
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:24,366
Jose, come on!

332
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,801
Girls, there's a hand!

333
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:36,042
Amalia, this way!

334
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,555
Jose, come on!

335
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:54,322
Don't leave me here!

336
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,131
Jose, over here!

337
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:57,794
Where are you?

338
00:28:58,002 --> 00:28:59,026
Where are you?

339
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:01,103
Jose, wait for me!

340
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:06,004
Enemy, I'll not go with you.
I'm going with God.

341
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:10,108
Girls, those are shots!

342
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:12,849
Go away, enemy.
I'll not go with you...

343
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:39,608
Last night I was talking
to one of the doctors.

344
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:41,142
Very pleasant.

345
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:42,377
That's him.

346
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:52,456
You've got a call.
Your ex-husband's wife.

347
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:54,281
Don't say that.

348
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:56,023
Tell her I'm not here.

349
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:57,285
Don't put it through.

350
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:04,367
Does she want me
to congratulate her?

351
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:08,971
Just do it,
and get it over with.

352
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:12,337
I won't, because
no one told me personally.

353
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:14,205
Maybe she wants to tell you.

354
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:16,973
Yes,
that she's expecting twins.

355
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:25,847
Did you meet Dr. Jano?

356
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:27,481
He's married.

357
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:33,089
It's impossible
to talk to you, Mirta.

358
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:35,766
Mom,

359
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:37,766
some day I'll poison you.

360
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:42,399
You'll never get a job
as a chef afterwards.

361
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:45,041
I'm not a cook, mom,

362
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:49,278
I'm a physiotherapist.

363
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:50,707
Dry your eye.

364
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:54,714
And then I saw the Lord who was
cradling an enemy of mine

365
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:57,410
who was dead
and for whom I had prayed.

366
00:30:57,622 --> 00:30:59,556
He said to me,
"Here is our son.

367
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:01,816
Who do you love more,
me or our son?"

368
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,153
I answered that I loved
our son more,

369
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:07,889
that is, I'd rather suffer
in this world to save a soul

370
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:10,701
than be in heaven
with our Lord."

371
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,332
How's that?

372
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:15,129
I don't understand it.

373
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,002
- What book is it from?
- It's a photocopy.

374
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,307
But who wrote it?

375
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,547
M. D. V.
17th Century.

376
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:35,989
Girls,
when you bring material

377
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:37,684
you must know the source.

378
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,193
Now, read it again.

379
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:46,503
"One day I was dressed
as Divine Charity

380
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:49,405
and then I saw the Lord
who was cradling

381
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:51,700
an enemy of mine
who was dead

382
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,543
and for whom I had prayed.

383
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,170
He said to me,

384
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:57,547
"Here is our son.

385
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:01,113
Who do you love more,
me or our son?"

386
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:05,118
I answered that I loved
our son more,

387
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:09,291
that is, I'd rather suffer
in this world to save a soul

388
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:11,995
than be in Heaven
with our Lord."

389
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:16,162
She'd rather save a man
than be with God, I think.

390
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:19,564
We'll never make any headway
if you don't collaborate.

391
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:22,806
We've discussed vocations
for two weeks and got nowhere.

392
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:25,339
But isn't the Divine Plan
the plan for salvation?

393
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:29,035
This woman says she'd do
anything to save someone.

394
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,673
You must be willing
to do anything,

395
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:34,477
even if it scares you,
even if you have to lie.

396
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,509
- Can you lie?
- Apparently.

397
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:39,053
The mother saved her child
in the accident.

398
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:42,090
I don't want to hear
that accident story again,

399
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:43,223
is that clear?

400
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:46,329
She was talking about my story,
not the accident.

401
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:47,657
I meant the accident.

402
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:50,190
Isn't being a mother
a vocation?

403
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:55,429
There is a lot of material
that can help us think

404
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,733
about our role in God's plan

405
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:00,441
and help us to be prepared
for the call.

406
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:02,377
Don't listen to her.

407
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,710
She just wants tongue kisses.

408
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,507
Since she's been
with that guy...

409
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:09,152
I bet they've had
pre-marital relations.

410
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:11,379
If you ask her she'll deny it,

411
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:13,181
but I don't think she can...

412
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:20,060
Page 177.

413
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:24,332
"In our lives, there are
also mysterious callings,

414
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:27,402
more or less clear,
more or less urgent,

415
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:29,334
that come directly from God

416
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,737
and show each person
his role in the Christian community.

417
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,509
All means are good
in God's hands

418
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:38,375
for calling us."
That's clear.

419
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,011
God sends us signs,
that's what matters.

420
00:33:46,891 --> 00:33:48,381
They say we look alike.

421
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,826
Who says that?
Dr. Jano?

422
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:58,860
Jano looks like dad,
before he got sick, don't you think?

423
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:01,802
He's an attractive man,
isn't he?

424
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,972
He said he was here a few times
as a student.

425
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:08,479
I should have
kept up my studies.

426
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:10,509
Why didn't I do that?

427
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,376
Did I give them up
when I got married?

428
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:15,149
No, long before.

429
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:18,011
Look at your hands.

430
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:20,957
A surgeon's hands.

431
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,322
You've got no spots
or anything.

432
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,664
We must stop the kids
running up and down the corridor.

433
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:33,799
Mirta is worn out.

434
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:35,534
She's difficult.

435
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,204
Poor Mirta.
She's in a bad way.

436
00:34:58,062 --> 00:35:00,326
Excuse me,
may I spray this?

437
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:08,164
Who's that?

438
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:10,370
I don't know, she must be new.

439
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:12,368
She's pretty.

440
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:22,811
You have to understand that

441
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:25,386
this is all Mirta has got.

442
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:27,552
This is her life.

443
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,150
Because you've got

444
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:32,488
Amalia,

445
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:34,121
and I...

446
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:39,696
You've got me, and Amalia,

447
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:41,903
and your own children too.

448
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:43,337
Of course.

449
00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:48,573
I need my children to help me.

450
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:53,411
When the Chilean woman
took my kids, it really hurt me.

451
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:56,685
I know that.

452
00:35:57,255 --> 00:36:00,816
You should call your kids,
at least on their birthdays.

453
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,292
What I'm saying is that Mirta,
good or bad,

454
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:06,789
is a help,

455
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:11,266
even if it's just so that I can
lie down here for a while

456
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:12,936
when I don't feel well.

457
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:15,096
I'm not saying she isn't.

458
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:17,433
That's invaluable.

459
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,176
Goodbye.
I'll see you tonight.

460
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,359
Thank you.

461
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,430
I was sent some marinated pigeon.
Do you like it?

462
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:19,625
I certainly do.

463
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:23,603
Why don't you dine at my table?
You can meet my daughter.

464
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:25,708
- I don't think you know her.
- No, I don't.

465
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:29,606
I've been divorced
for several years.

466
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,108
I didn't know.

467
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,852
See you later.

468
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:45,986
Do it very neatly.

469
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,657
Very neatly,
above the lines.

470
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:52,062
If it's too faint to read,
look at the book.

471
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:54,200
- Do it carefully.
- All right!

472
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,965
That maid is filthy!

473
00:37:58,609 --> 00:37:59,701
Do you know

474
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:02,912
she leaves the laundry sink
full of hairs?

475
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:06,282
Why do you let her
wash her hair in the sink?

476
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:08,983
What's the sign, Jose?

477
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:11,518
What sign are we waiting for?

478
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:15,582
The other day, she was brushing
her teeth at the kitchen sink.

479
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,758
You have to tell me
things like that.

480
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,430
I can't do everything
in the house!

481
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:23,161
Did you say anything?

482
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:26,029
She said you don't let her use
our bathroom.

483
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,832
She's got such a nerve!

484
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:30,301
They're incredible.

485
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:41,178
Jose, I think I've got a mission.

486
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:42,784
How do you know?

487
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,454
Did you get a sign?

488
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:06,902
Oh, my God!

489
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:27,456
He's dead,
those are reflex movements.

490
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:32,864
We have to call an ambulance.

491
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:55,682
My head is splitting.

492
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:01,693
Mom,

493
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,392
a man was saved
by a miracle today.

494
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:08,201
He fell from the second floor
into Josefina's patio

495
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,033
and he wasn't killed.

496
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,500
That's terrible!

497
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,678
- A workman?
- No, a neighbor.

498
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:19,674
It's all the same.

499
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,545
It's terrible.

500
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:25,218
It was a miracle he survived.

501
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:30,190
I don't know what to wear.
What time is it?

502
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:31,925
Let's see.

503
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,826
I've still got time.

504
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,839
Well, my pretty little girl.

505
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:57,414
Josefina is going to cut her hair
and donate it to the V irgin's wig.

506
00:40:57,988 --> 00:41:00,013
How awful.
That's her grandma's idea.

507
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:05,792
There's pigeon for supper

508
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:08,624
and I told Dr. Jano
to join us for dinner.

509
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,061
Tidy yourself up a bit.

510
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:12,195
Dr. Jano?

511
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:14,994
Don't breathe,
you'll get an allergy.

512
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:24,576
I didn't know what to say,
so I said yes.

513
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:28,051
But I don't like you
hanging around that hotel all day.

514
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:31,411
I don't know
why Helena doesn't realize

515
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:34,386
that her daughter
needs a house, a home.

516
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:36,757
You can't rear...

517
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:42,325
Helena was reared in an hotel,
it seems normal to her.

518
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:50,065
We must have
Turkish blood in the family,

519
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:51,673
we all like smoking

520
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:53,909
and Turkish baths.

521
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:55,442
May I have the shampoo?

522
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:03,711
And at the same time
she's very kind.

523
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:05,853
She sent us this box.

524
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:07,387
Mom, the shampoo!

525
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:11,024
Here,
leave some in the bath tub.

526
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:16,733
It's a specialty,
a branch of medicine.

527
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,030
But I forget how it happened.

528
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:23,069
Maybe because
my mother sang.

529
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:26,569
Well, my mother loved to sing

530
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:29,245
and I'd go with her to the doctor
because she'd get hoarse,

531
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:30,910
very often.

532
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:33,015
Freddy, I'm ready.
Shall we start?

533
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:35,912
He's a photographer.

534
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:43,385
But it didn't arouse
my curiosity at the time.

535
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:46,221
My daughter sings.

536
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:47,761
Go and play.

537
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:50,362
Isn't she having dinner?

538
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:54,064
No, she'd arranged
to meet a friend.

539
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:56,197
I thought you were an actress.

540
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:00,542
Excuse me.

541
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:08,549
What?

542
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:12,612
I thought you were an actress.

543
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:13,380
Helena!

544
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:16,719
Shall we have a photo taken
with the doctors?

545
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:24,625
Everyone close together.

546
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,198
Another one.
And smile!

547
00:43:32,509 --> 00:43:33,498
That's it.

548
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:35,912
Very good.

549
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:57,566
No...

550
00:43:57,935 --> 00:43:59,027
Oh, yes.

551
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:00,930
No, I'm not an actresss.

552
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:05,300
Freddy told us

553
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:07,135
that you

554
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:11,311
used to put on plays in the hotel
when you were kids.

555
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:14,983
I don't know why
I saw you as an actress.

556
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:17,176
Maybe because of
Esther Williams.

557
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,282
Esther Williams.

558
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:23,853
A wonderful swimmer,
but as an actress...

559
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:27,526
No, we used to put on plays
with the staff.

560
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,296
Everyone used to look at you
in the pool.

561
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,701
I guess
there weren't many girls

562
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:37,169
who dived from 30 feet
in those days.

563
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:40,237
- Does your ear hurt?
- No.

564
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:44,043
The hotel was always a bit remote.
It wasn't easy.

565
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:47,043
- There were no drama classes.
- It's bothering you.

566
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:52,682
No, it might be water.
At times, especially in this ear,

567
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:56,692
I get a kind of whistling,
mostly at night.

568
00:44:57,061 --> 00:45:00,519
Do you fall asleep with the TV on,
or listening to music?

569
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:04,258
Dr. Vesalio, you'll make her dizzy.

570
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:05,332
One more time!

571
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:19,212
So, do you fall asleep with
the TV on, or listening to music?

572
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:23,215
Yes, I often fall asleep
watching TV.

573
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:27,156
That can cause sounds
inside your ear,

574
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:30,560
but if you take a mouthful of air
or move these joints,

575
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:31,785
they sometimes stop.

576
00:45:31,995 --> 00:45:33,963
It must be because
of all the diving.

577
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:35,688
Our coach was deaf,

578
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:38,729
but from birth.

579
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:40,164
What kind of sound?

580
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:42,194
Like a whistling

581
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:44,999
or like a badly-tuned radio.

582
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:48,140
They seem like distant voices
if the frequencies are low.

583
00:45:48,612 --> 00:45:51,342
Generally speaking,
most people hear things.

584
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:54,039
What does the patient hear?
How does he hear?

585
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:55,975
That's what my work is.

586
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:01,123
Do you hear those sounds
at night,

587
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:03,657
and when you watch TV
do they stop?

588
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:09,131
They usually show
the films I like at night.

589
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:15,029
With the hours I work
I could easily have been an actress.

590
00:46:15,672 --> 00:46:17,970
The Doctors' Union
has got theater workshops.

591
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:21,774
Some doctors take part
in the plays they put on.

592
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:23,508
That's wonderful!

593
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:25,442
You too?

594
00:46:25,649 --> 00:46:26,707
Yes, once.

595
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:30,284
- Really? What part did you play?
- A doctor.

596
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:33,852
I didn't have
to rehearse a lot.

597
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:46,788
I'm taking the kids
to put vinegar on them.

598
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:52,160
Come along.

599
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:03,803
What are you doing in there?
Get out!

600
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:06,278
Kids, go to the kitchen with Mirta.
Come on.

601
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,830
Hello, how are you?
Sit down.

602
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:23,090
- No.
- Please.

603
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,806
They're organizing
an outing for tonight.

604
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:34,606
Dr. Vesalio is tipsy already.

605
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,478
I don't think he'll last.

606
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:54,121
Did you see how the water
cooling system has improved?

607
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:19,451
- How are you, Helena?
- Very well, doctor.

608
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,782
Your colleagues are happy.

609
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:26,124
- Are they bothering you?
- No, not at all.

610
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:35,263
Are you dining in the hotel
or going out with your friends?

611
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,206
No, I'm dining here.

612
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:47,013
A glass...

613
00:49:48,518 --> 00:49:49,610
Thank you.

614
00:49:50,387 --> 00:49:52,287
- Want some?
- No, thanks.

615
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:55,858
Doctor...

616
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:00,286
What about
the patient-doctor relationship,

617
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:01,555
the dramatization?

618
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:06,632
They're trying to find
a hospital patient.

619
00:50:08,872 --> 00:50:10,897
It would be a good end
to the congress.

620
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:15,067
Yes, but it has to be
an interesting pathology.

621
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:19,338
What about
some kind of acufens?

622
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:21,713
Possibly.

623
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:22,850
Why not?

624
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,587
"A woman of the world

625
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:29,858
was driving very fast
with her friends one night.

626
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,528
She crashed
and saw them burn to death

627
00:50:32,729 --> 00:50:34,924
without being able
to save them.

628
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:37,323
She walked for four days

629
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:40,059
until she collapsed from thirst,
wanting to die.

630
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:42,568
Then she heard
a voice saying to her,

631
00:50:42,906 --> 00:50:44,999
"Rest now, sleep,

632
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,938
tomorrow you will be the fountain
that will ease thirst."

633
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:49,906
The woman returned to the city,

634
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,510
gave up her life of comfort

635
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:55,250
and devoted herself
to tending the poor."

636
00:50:57,287 --> 00:50:58,549
Well, Jose.

637
00:50:58,755 --> 00:50:59,847
What do you think?

638
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:02,352
It's horrible, she made it up.

639
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:04,059
Is it so hard
to make photocopies?

640
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:05,728
- Did you write it?
- No.

641
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:08,864
You have
to photocopy texts from books.

642
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:10,360
It isn't so hard.

643
00:51:10,934 --> 00:51:13,835
I can understand the bit
about the woman's vocation,

644
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:15,402
but the people
who were killed...

645
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:17,004
Don't you have a vocation yet?

646
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:18,832
Amalia's got one!

647
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,411
Do you have a vocation?

648
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:30,576
What was their vocation?
Because they died

649
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:33,051
and that helped the woman
find her vocation.

650
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:35,815
She finds hers and is saved.

651
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:37,083
What about them?

652
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:39,759
They were born
to burn to death.

653
00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:42,329
Girls, this isn't
getting us anywhere.

654
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:43,829
I have to go.

655
00:52:25,896 --> 00:52:26,692
Helena...

656
00:52:27,698 --> 00:52:30,189
- Could I have a word with you?
- Of course.

657
00:52:38,141 --> 00:52:39,130
Very nice.

658
00:52:40,711 --> 00:52:43,111
Look,
Dr. Vesalio has an idea

659
00:52:43,313 --> 00:52:45,178
that may interest you.

660
00:52:45,749 --> 00:52:48,377
We'd like you to participate
in the closure.

661
00:52:49,252 --> 00:52:50,150
What is it?

662
00:52:50,354 --> 00:52:53,152
We want to act out
a visit to the doctor.

663
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:56,684
It wouldn't be very much,
just a short scene,

664
00:52:56,893 --> 00:52:59,020
but we'd do it properly,
set up a surgery...

665
00:52:59,696 --> 00:53:01,994
Don Manuel's wife
is on the phone.

666
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:04,592
- No.
- She's insisting.

667
00:53:04,801 --> 00:53:05,665
No!

668
00:53:05,869 --> 00:53:08,064
I won't speak to her.
Doesn't she realize?

669
00:53:11,108 --> 00:53:14,134
I was trying to persuade her
to take part in the scene, but...

670
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,074
At first, I thought it was
a stupid idea too,

671
00:53:19,282 --> 00:53:22,683
but I saw it at an international
congress and it's amazing.

672
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:24,920
It was a singer

673
00:53:25,489 --> 00:53:27,457
who had a problem
with volume and tone

674
00:53:27,658 --> 00:53:29,592
because of some
botched-up surgery.

675
00:53:30,027 --> 00:53:34,157
How can we interpret correctly
what the patient wants to tell us?

676
00:53:34,398 --> 00:53:36,423
- Well...
- It isn't so easy.

677
00:53:36,633 --> 00:53:37,793
Let's not keep on.

678
00:53:38,001 --> 00:53:41,767
But it's very interesting.
She was a well-known singer.

679
00:53:42,205 --> 00:53:43,467
What was her name?

680
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,171
A real beauty!

681
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:50,111
As far as that goes,
the doctor did have a good eye.

682
00:55:22,873 --> 00:55:24,340
Hello, doctor!

683
00:55:25,642 --> 00:55:27,769
Have you seen this?
It's fantastic.

684
00:55:28,011 --> 00:55:31,003
He's not playing anything.

685
00:55:33,483 --> 00:55:34,450
I was leaving.

686
00:55:39,022 --> 00:55:40,853
Dr. Jano!

687
00:55:41,491 --> 00:55:42,515
How are you?

688
00:55:46,163 --> 00:55:50,156
This morning I saw one of
the lab girls coming out of a room,

689
00:55:50,534 --> 00:55:52,126
one of the rep girls, I think.

690
00:55:53,136 --> 00:55:56,037
This is a congress,
not a casino.

691
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,003
And it isn't the first time
this week.

692
00:56:00,477 --> 00:56:02,445
This is a medical congress.

693
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,748
We're only asking
for a week of decent behavior.

694
00:56:07,017 --> 00:56:08,314
It isn't that much.

695
00:56:09,319 --> 00:56:12,049
Give me wealth

696
00:56:12,455 --> 00:56:17,825
or poverty.

697
00:56:18,695 --> 00:56:24,827
Give consolation or despair.

698
00:56:25,669 --> 00:56:28,297
Grant me hell

699
00:56:28,505 --> 00:56:31,338
or grant me heaven,

700
00:56:31,975 --> 00:56:36,912
sweet life,
radiant sun,

701
00:56:37,547 --> 00:56:41,813
for I have given in to you,

702
00:56:42,385 --> 00:56:47,322
for I have given in to you,

703
00:56:48,225 --> 00:56:51,422
I have given in.

704
00:57:06,843 --> 00:57:08,310
This way, please.

705
00:57:10,614 --> 00:57:11,706
How is it going?

706
00:57:11,915 --> 00:57:14,884
Mr. Hoffer,
Mrs. Helena Tiscornia.

707
00:57:15,585 --> 00:57:17,450
We're going do a cubicle trial.

708
00:57:22,292 --> 00:57:23,452
If you'd be so kind...

709
00:57:53,857 --> 00:57:54,653
Can you hear me?

710
00:57:56,526 --> 00:57:57,857
Can you hear my voice?

711
00:57:58,795 --> 00:57:59,853
Good.

712
00:58:04,301 --> 00:58:05,233
Dog.

713
00:58:05,602 --> 00:58:06,466
Dog.

714
00:58:06,903 --> 00:58:07,870
White.

715
00:58:08,772 --> 00:58:09,602
White.

716
00:58:10,106 --> 00:58:11,232
Quote.

717
00:58:11,808 --> 00:58:12,775
Quote.

718
00:58:13,109 --> 00:58:14,133
Knot.

719
00:58:14,477 --> 00:58:15,375
Knot.

720
00:58:15,812 --> 00:58:16,870
Kiss.

721
00:58:17,147 --> 00:58:18,079
Hiss.

722
00:58:19,482 --> 00:58:21,450
- Tail.
- Tail.

723
00:58:22,752 --> 00:58:23,741
Defy.

724
00:58:24,621 --> 00:58:25,485
Defy.

725
00:58:25,689 --> 00:58:27,987
- Ship.
- Ship.

726
00:58:28,358 --> 00:58:29,325
Nice.

727
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:31,285
Rice.

728
00:58:31,861 --> 00:58:32,885
Mule.

729
00:58:33,697 --> 00:58:34,664
Mule.

730
00:58:35,332 --> 00:58:36,321
Mass.

731
00:58:37,133 --> 00:58:38,065
Mass.

732
00:58:38,468 --> 00:58:40,333
- Niche.
- Niche.

733
00:58:41,104 --> 00:58:42,571
- Handy.
- Handy.

734
00:58:43,139 --> 00:58:44,936
- Bothers.
- Mothers.

735
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:04,680
What do you think?

736
01:00:07,490 --> 01:00:11,358
Can you plug the gadget
into the piped music system?

737
01:00:11,561 --> 01:00:12,858
What kind of plug is it?

738
01:00:13,363 --> 01:00:15,854
Look, it's plugged into
the electric organ.

739
01:00:16,232 --> 01:00:18,359
- Is that called an organ?
- No.

740
01:00:21,871 --> 01:00:22,860
It's in behind.

741
01:00:27,877 --> 01:00:29,469
What do you think?

742
01:00:42,725 --> 01:00:43,987
Now, try it out.

743
01:03:06,703 --> 01:03:07,795
Don't follow me!

744
01:03:25,021 --> 01:03:25,919
Here.

745
01:03:28,491 --> 01:03:31,654
Here, take a taxi,
and don't come back to the hotel.

746
01:03:40,737 --> 01:03:43,001
You're filling your eyes
with microbes.

747
01:03:51,714 --> 01:03:53,272
Did he touch you in the hotel?

748
01:03:56,586 --> 01:03:58,349
I know what I have to do.

749
01:04:01,024 --> 01:04:01,615
Hello.

750
01:04:06,496 --> 01:04:07,793
We have to tell someone.

751
01:04:09,032 --> 01:04:10,659
We could ask Inés.

752
01:04:11,601 --> 01:04:14,399
- I bet she'll know what to do.
- You promised...

753
01:04:14,604 --> 01:04:17,164
You promised you wouldn't
tell anyone if I told you.

754
01:04:18,308 --> 01:04:20,970
We don't have to tell anyone.
It's my business.

755
01:04:21,811 --> 01:04:23,472
It's my mission, I know that.

756
01:04:24,614 --> 01:04:27,742
Don't cry anymore.
I promise I won't tell anyone.

757
01:04:28,318 --> 01:04:29,751
Not a single word.

758
01:04:31,788 --> 01:04:32,846
Give me a kiss.

759
01:04:38,361 --> 01:04:39,953
Will I get the photo?

760
01:04:49,372 --> 01:04:50,600
What are you doing?

761
01:04:51,741 --> 01:04:53,265
Photocopies for grandma.

762
01:05:07,523 --> 01:05:08,990
What is it, the stigmata?

763
01:05:09,692 --> 01:05:11,922
No, the suffering
of the Passion.

764
01:05:15,031 --> 01:05:16,430
Those photocopies.

765
01:05:18,468 --> 01:05:21,096
I need them,
I'll come and get them today.

766
01:05:22,438 --> 01:05:24,565
- At grandma's house?
- Yes.

767
01:05:25,141 --> 01:05:26,073
Ciao.

768
01:05:30,012 --> 01:05:32,242
For a few words, doctor!

769
01:05:32,682 --> 01:05:34,616
But they weren't legible.

770
01:05:34,984 --> 01:05:37,680
It isn't the first malpractice case
over handwriting.

771
01:05:43,893 --> 01:05:45,485
This is lawyers' doings.

772
01:05:45,695 --> 01:05:49,028
Putting a doctor on trial
for his handwriting!

773
01:05:49,565 --> 01:05:50,589
I saw the prescription.

774
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:53,928
It wasn't terrible, but you couldn't
read the dosage clearly.

775
01:05:54,337 --> 01:05:55,861
It's possible.

776
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:03,738
You can't smoke in here, mom.

777
01:06:04,013 --> 01:06:06,641
You know very well
where you should be now.

778
01:06:08,084 --> 01:06:10,985
I left it all ready.
You just have to cut and serve.

779
01:06:11,187 --> 01:06:12,211
Dry your eye.

780
01:06:12,955 --> 01:06:14,650
My hands are covered with oil.

781
01:06:24,033 --> 01:06:25,261
I come in,

782
01:06:27,170 --> 01:06:29,138
I sit down,
we shake hands...

783
01:06:34,310 --> 01:06:35,242
I come in,

784
01:06:35,978 --> 01:06:37,104
we shake hands,

785
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:38,738
and I sit down.

786
01:06:41,884 --> 01:06:43,647
And then, well, doctor...

787
01:06:44,187 --> 01:06:46,018
I think that you...

788
01:06:46,522 --> 01:06:47,784
Don't worry.

789
01:06:48,057 --> 01:06:50,924
Just answer the questions
spontaneously,

790
01:06:51,394 --> 01:06:52,861
as we've been doing.

791
01:06:54,330 --> 01:06:55,820
Of course, you're right.

792
01:07:06,275 --> 01:07:07,105
Well...

793
01:07:16,152 --> 01:07:17,642
Finish your coffee, Jano.

794
01:07:39,375 --> 01:07:41,400
I'd like to know what you think...

795
01:07:47,950 --> 01:07:49,144
I don't know what to wear.

796
01:07:55,358 --> 01:07:57,258
You'll think it's stupid,

797
01:07:58,194 --> 01:07:59,661
but I can't decide.

798
01:08:03,466 --> 01:08:06,731
I'm going to be on a stage,
even if it is only a platform.

799
01:08:07,403 --> 01:08:08,893
They're all lovely.

800
01:08:12,842 --> 01:08:13,866
This one?

801
01:08:15,077 --> 01:08:16,271
That one would do.

802
01:08:22,919 --> 01:08:23,943
And this one?

803
01:08:24,954 --> 01:08:25,921
Yes...

804
01:08:26,689 --> 01:08:29,658
I'll put it on
and we'll go over it all again.

805
01:08:40,303 --> 01:08:41,395
It doesn't suit me.

806
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:52,847
Thanks for the coffee.

807
01:09:02,491 --> 01:09:04,254
Hello?
I'll put her on.

808
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:06,018
Maria Callas, for you.

809
01:09:06,729 --> 01:09:08,856
You only turn up at meal times.

810
01:09:09,065 --> 01:09:11,693
This isn't an hotel.
Excuse me, Amalia.

811
01:09:12,501 --> 01:09:14,059
This isn't an hotel.

812
01:09:14,403 --> 01:09:17,930
It's a family home.
There's a big difference

813
01:09:18,741 --> 01:09:20,436
and you don't see that.

814
01:09:20,643 --> 01:09:22,634
Mom,
Amalia lives in an hotel.

815
01:09:25,748 --> 01:09:27,613
What did I ask you to do today?

816
01:09:28,484 --> 01:09:30,748
Try asking me for the car later.

817
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:33,079
No more car!

818
01:09:33,289 --> 01:09:36,417
We can't practice here.
My brothers have all got lice.

819
01:09:36,659 --> 01:09:38,251
That's the other idiot!

820
01:09:38,594 --> 01:09:40,494
Make me look like a skinflint.

821
01:09:42,264 --> 01:09:44,255
Until I'm gone,
you won't know...

822
01:09:44,467 --> 01:09:47,334
- What did she say?
- You've got whooping cough.

823
01:09:47,536 --> 01:09:49,333
I don't have whooping cough.

824
01:09:49,538 --> 01:09:51,631
You do,
because if I spin you round

825
01:09:51,941 --> 01:09:53,272
you get whooping cough.

826
01:09:53,476 --> 01:09:54,500
No, try it.

827
01:09:54,777 --> 01:09:55,471
Try it!

828
01:09:55,678 --> 01:09:57,771
...do what you want.

829
01:09:58,381 --> 01:10:01,248
And I hope you're not
like the Correa brothers.

830
01:10:01,450 --> 01:10:03,975
They didn't stop
until they destroyed their mother.

831
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:05,448
And look where they are.

832
01:10:05,655 --> 01:10:06,781
Where are they?

833
01:10:09,458 --> 01:10:10,686
One is divorced.

834
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:13,494
The other is in Spain
on a two-year scholarship.

835
01:10:13,696 --> 01:10:16,096
You see?
The other one out of the country.

836
01:10:16,832 --> 01:10:17,799
Juan Pablo,

837
01:10:18,401 --> 01:10:20,869
don't you want to take
elocution class with Inés?

838
01:10:21,070 --> 01:10:23,095
Inés isn't a speech therapist,
she's a loony.

839
01:10:23,305 --> 01:10:25,865
She can give me classes
in my room.

840
01:10:37,319 --> 01:10:38,547
- Good morning.
- Hello.

841
01:10:38,754 --> 01:10:39,721
Good morning, doctor.

842
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:45,789
How are you doing?

843
01:10:45,995 --> 01:10:46,984
Atilio...

844
01:10:53,669 --> 01:10:55,796
Well, Freddy,
where are the baths?

845
01:11:07,483 --> 01:11:08,507
Hugo...

846
01:11:08,784 --> 01:11:09,443
Yes?

847
01:11:10,019 --> 01:11:12,283
- Do you remember Dr. Jano?
- No.

848
01:11:12,488 --> 01:11:14,115
To be honest, I don't.

849
01:11:14,557 --> 01:11:17,321
My daughter Amalia,
Dr. Jano, Dr. Cuesta...

850
01:11:17,526 --> 01:11:18,458
Say hello.

851
01:11:29,839 --> 01:11:32,535
What were you doing?
Are you purifying the mud?

852
01:11:32,875 --> 01:11:34,433
This is ready.

853
01:11:34,744 --> 01:11:36,974
Fifteen minutes in the mud,

854
01:11:37,747 --> 01:11:39,271
then a shower
and a lie-down.

855
01:11:40,182 --> 01:11:41,171
Dr. Jano!

856
01:11:47,356 --> 01:11:48,380
Dr. Jano!

857
01:11:51,594 --> 01:11:53,619
It seems
they're looking for you.

858
01:11:56,999 --> 01:11:59,729
Dr. Jano, you have a call.
You can take it in the booth.

859
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:17,583
Hello?

860
01:12:18,154 --> 01:12:19,178
Yes, thank you.

861
01:12:20,890 --> 01:12:22,289
Hello, how are you?

862
01:12:23,192 --> 01:12:24,591
What about the kids?

863
01:12:26,562 --> 01:12:27,859
Kind of so-so.

864
01:12:29,698 --> 01:12:31,666
I've been away a long time.

865
01:12:34,503 --> 01:12:35,663
Put her on.

866
01:12:41,644 --> 01:12:42,633
Hello, sweetheart.

867
01:12:43,712 --> 01:12:44,644
Yes.

868
01:12:45,848 --> 01:12:47,816
No, there's no cold pool.

869
01:12:50,686 --> 01:12:52,176
No, the diving board is gone.

870
01:12:53,689 --> 01:12:56,954
I told your mother I didn't know
if it was worth you coming.

871
01:12:59,895 --> 01:13:01,157
No, it isn't that.

872
01:13:01,997 --> 01:13:03,726
I don't like you
traveling at night.

873
01:14:42,031 --> 01:14:42,759
There she is.

874
01:14:42,965 --> 01:14:43,932
Hello, Jose.

875
01:14:47,903 --> 01:14:48,597
How are things?

876
01:14:48,804 --> 01:14:49,702
Fine.

877
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:52,432
Pour her coffee.

878
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:56,801
- Have you got a temperature?
- Yes, she has.

879
01:14:58,147 --> 01:14:59,307
The photos!

880
01:14:59,815 --> 01:15:00,873
Exactly.

881
01:15:01,817 --> 01:15:02,784
What's wrong?

882
01:15:03,986 --> 01:15:06,921
There's some problem between
one of the girls and a doctor.

883
01:15:07,122 --> 01:15:09,113
I'm not surprised.

884
01:15:13,929 --> 01:15:15,123
Freddy, if you please...

885
01:15:27,443 --> 01:15:28,467
There's Jano.

886
01:15:49,031 --> 01:15:50,157
Is that him?

887
01:15:54,136 --> 01:15:55,125
How are you?

888
01:15:55,738 --> 01:15:57,103
We've got the photos.

889
01:16:03,345 --> 01:16:04,437
Doctor...

890
01:16:05,981 --> 01:16:07,448
There's a little problem.

891
01:16:07,850 --> 01:16:10,284
Dr. Vesalio is withdrawing
from the congress.

892
01:16:10,519 --> 01:16:13,044
He left me these papers
to give to you.

893
01:16:13,255 --> 01:16:15,314
They're the tests
they did on Helena,

894
01:16:15,758 --> 01:16:19,592
so that you or Dr. Cuesta can do
the representation, the closure.

895
01:16:21,430 --> 01:16:22,260
What?

896
01:16:23,699 --> 01:16:25,929
That boy is so intelligent but...

897
01:16:26,535 --> 01:16:28,969
He went out last night
with one of the rep girls

898
01:16:29,338 --> 01:16:32,432
and he just got back
twenty minutes ago.

899
01:16:33,542 --> 01:16:36,477
The lab has replaced the girl,
they fired her.

900
01:16:36,678 --> 01:16:38,976
Dr. Vesalio made a scene.

901
01:16:39,181 --> 01:16:40,239
He says he's leaving.

902
01:16:40,649 --> 01:16:42,640
It's one way to ruin a career.

903
01:16:43,619 --> 01:16:44,517
My career?

904
01:16:44,853 --> 01:16:46,514
No, no, his career.

905
01:16:46,822 --> 01:16:49,518
He's an expert in his field
but easily tempted.

906
01:16:50,025 --> 01:16:53,153
He does this at all the congresses,
he can't resist.

907
01:16:53,362 --> 01:16:54,124
Who?

908
01:16:54,329 --> 01:16:55,455
Dr. Vesalio.

909
01:16:56,899 --> 01:16:59,527
Why don't you tell him to stay?
He'll listen to you.

910
01:17:00,069 --> 01:17:02,037
But I hardly know him.

911
01:17:03,238 --> 01:17:06,730
As you were sharing a room
I thought you were friends.

912
01:17:08,077 --> 01:17:11,069
No, that was just for one night,
the hotel had a problem.

913
01:17:17,753 --> 01:17:18,549
Excuse me.

914
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:25,285
He's odd.

915
01:17:27,262 --> 01:17:28,160
Very odd.

916
01:17:30,365 --> 01:17:32,299
Going off like that,
so suddenly,

917
01:17:34,336 --> 01:17:35,394
without a word to me

918
01:17:35,604 --> 01:17:38,334
and with the representation
in a few days.

919
01:17:40,876 --> 01:17:43,401
He got me into this mess
and now he disappears.

920
01:17:45,180 --> 01:17:46,909
There are a thousand questions...

921
01:17:47,116 --> 01:17:49,584
What do I care?
I know what I've got.

922
01:17:49,785 --> 01:17:51,810
It won't change my life.
Just the opposite.

923
01:17:53,522 --> 01:17:57,151
I'm going crazy, always thinking
about that noise in my ear.

924
01:17:58,127 --> 01:18:00,425
- The family is coming.
- Oh, mom!

925
01:18:00,562 --> 01:18:02,860
Why "Oh, mom"?
Dry that eye!

926
01:18:04,066 --> 01:18:05,795
That man has a family.

927
01:18:06,602 --> 01:18:07,899
That torments him.

928
01:18:09,004 --> 01:18:10,232
He's not a bastard.

929
01:18:10,572 --> 01:18:12,802
He obviously has
a sentimental conflict.

930
01:18:16,845 --> 01:18:18,608
You know, I think that too.

931
01:18:20,616 --> 01:18:21,708
Poor man.

932
01:18:27,523 --> 01:18:28,785
Stay by me,

933
01:18:28,991 --> 01:18:33,155
I still have caresses
that you don't know.

934
01:18:36,165 --> 01:18:38,326
I don't think
I can open my eyes.

935
01:18:39,034 --> 01:18:40,501
Open them.

936
01:18:41,637 --> 01:18:42,501
Look at me.

937
01:18:44,173 --> 01:18:45,504
I'm asking for the stigmata.

938
01:18:52,281 --> 01:18:53,976
I can see you a bit
when you move,

939
01:18:54,183 --> 01:18:55,775
but I'm going to stay like this.

940
01:19:03,425 --> 01:19:04,289
All right.

941
01:19:05,494 --> 01:19:06,722
Open them now.

942
01:19:09,064 --> 01:19:10,361
One, two, three...

943
01:19:10,632 --> 01:19:11,257
Now!

944
01:19:24,413 --> 01:19:26,142
If my words,

945
01:19:27,249 --> 01:19:29,149
trembling with love,

946
01:19:30,018 --> 01:19:33,647
don't waken any passion
in your mind...

947
01:19:36,491 --> 01:19:39,051
It's amazing
how quickly I can learn.

948
01:19:44,099 --> 01:19:45,726
I've got the gift of learning.

949
01:19:48,136 --> 01:19:49,467
Open your eyes.

950
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:53,974
The guy who groped you
isn't that old.

951
01:19:54,843 --> 01:19:56,071
What's his name?

952
01:19:59,214 --> 01:20:00,841
Open your eyes, idiot.

953
01:20:23,372 --> 01:20:24,703
You opened your mouth!

954
01:20:24,906 --> 01:20:27,136
No, you stuck your tongue in.

955
01:20:30,078 --> 01:20:31,443
Stay by me,

956
01:20:31,747 --> 01:20:33,840
I still have caresses

957
01:20:34,216 --> 01:20:37,811
that you don't know
of all of me.

958
01:20:38,654 --> 01:20:42,146
And I'll invent
some new ones for you

959
01:20:43,058 --> 01:20:46,289
so that you'll stay with me.

960
01:20:46,828 --> 01:20:48,386
Take this off, it's burning!

961
01:20:48,597 --> 01:20:50,656
You have to give it time
to work.

962
01:20:52,267 --> 01:20:55,202
Have you noticed that
Dr. Jano is a bit withdrawn?

963
01:20:57,372 --> 01:20:59,397
Why not go to his room,
kind of casually,

964
01:20:59,608 --> 01:21:01,269
and see what's wrong with him?

965
01:21:01,476 --> 01:21:03,944
- I can't go out like this.
- I'll comb it for you.

966
01:21:04,546 --> 01:21:06,446
I look like I've got more hair,
don't I?

967
01:21:07,049 --> 01:21:08,243
I'm worried.

968
01:21:09,318 --> 01:21:12,481
I have to do that performance
and I'm really going off the idea.

969
01:21:12,821 --> 01:21:15,483
You should
devote all your time to that.

970
01:21:17,192 --> 01:21:20,821
- Mirta can't do everything.
- I'm here, aren't I?

971
01:21:21,296 --> 01:21:23,127
That's why I'm telling you.
Go on.

972
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:34,138
- Freddy...
- Hello, doctor, how are you?

973
01:21:34,343 --> 01:21:35,332
Fine.

974
01:21:37,346 --> 01:21:38,608
Come in.

975
01:21:40,549 --> 01:21:43,450
- Is the room comfortable?
- Yes.

976
01:21:43,652 --> 01:21:46,621
My family are coming,
I've reserved a room for the kids.

977
01:21:46,822 --> 01:21:49,689
It's been years
since I saw your wife.

978
01:21:50,192 --> 01:21:53,161
I'd just had my youngest son
at the time.

979
01:21:54,062 --> 01:21:54,858
Right.

980
01:21:56,031 --> 01:21:57,896
Your kids must be big now.

981
01:21:59,000 --> 01:21:59,864
Yes.

982
01:22:05,107 --> 01:22:06,597
Well, I must be going.

983
01:22:20,889 --> 01:22:23,084
- What did he say?
- Fine, fine.

984
01:22:23,892 --> 01:22:24,859
He's fine.

985
01:22:30,532 --> 01:22:31,863
I'm going to call Chile.

986
01:22:33,802 --> 01:22:36,532
I'd like the kids to come
and help me with the hotel.

987
01:22:36,738 --> 01:22:40,196
Mirta is very good, I know,
but family is family.

988
01:22:43,211 --> 01:22:45,611
Mirta is almost family.

989
01:22:46,415 --> 01:22:47,541
I know that.

990
01:22:51,086 --> 01:22:52,781
Look at the time.

991
01:22:53,188 --> 01:22:54,678
What's the time in Chile?

992
01:22:55,390 --> 01:22:57,858
Have you got the number?
It must be really late.

993
01:22:58,193 --> 01:22:59,820
How old are they now?

994
01:23:00,362 --> 01:23:01,829
They must be pretty grown up.

995
01:23:03,698 --> 01:23:05,962
Know what?
I'll call the Carrera Hotel,

996
01:23:06,168 --> 01:23:08,830
my friend Francisco,
so he can tell me the time.

997
01:23:12,707 --> 01:23:14,572
Have you got
the Chilean's number?

998
01:23:18,713 --> 01:23:19,304
Hello.

999
01:23:20,182 --> 01:23:22,514
Mr. Francisco Gutiérrez,
please.

1000
01:23:23,885 --> 01:23:25,113
Hello, Francisco.

1001
01:23:25,454 --> 01:23:26,853
This is Freddy from Argentina.

1002
01:23:28,657 --> 01:23:29,954
Yes, a very long time...

1003
01:23:31,026 --> 01:23:32,186
How many years?

1004
01:23:38,467 --> 01:23:39,092
Listen,

1005
01:23:39,301 --> 01:23:41,997
what time is it there?

1006
01:23:43,472 --> 01:23:44,700
What time?

1007
01:23:46,908 --> 01:23:48,705
It can't be.

1008
01:23:50,412 --> 01:23:51,140
Hello?

1009
01:23:56,485 --> 01:23:57,349
Were you cut off?

1010
01:23:57,552 --> 01:24:00,020
No, but the poor guy
would have talked for hours.

1011
01:24:00,589 --> 01:24:02,819
I'm going
to call the kids anyway.

1012
01:24:03,492 --> 01:24:05,653
They'll understand
it's an emergency.

1013
01:24:09,598 --> 01:24:12,158
- Is this my address book?
- No, it's mine.

1014
01:24:15,604 --> 01:24:16,571
It's all the same.

1015
01:24:20,609 --> 01:24:23,100
Do you remember
my wedding suit?

1016
01:24:24,813 --> 01:24:26,644
You couldn't pay
for that today.

1017
01:24:38,026 --> 01:24:39,015
The Chilean.

1018
01:24:48,169 --> 01:24:49,363
The Chilean.

1019
01:24:50,739 --> 01:24:52,036
With that voice!

1020
01:25:10,592 --> 01:25:12,150
We should call a doctor.

1021
01:25:13,962 --> 01:25:15,759
Would you like something to eat?

1022
01:25:16,498 --> 01:25:18,125
Yes, thanks,

1023
01:25:18,433 --> 01:25:20,230
but nothing reheated.

1024
01:25:20,435 --> 01:25:22,426
Then try another hotel.

1025
01:25:29,878 --> 01:25:32,608
I'm sorry about the time,
but I didn't want just anyone.

1026
01:25:43,224 --> 01:25:45,192
Dr. Vesalio left in the end.

1027
01:25:46,328 --> 01:25:47,955
What a pity,
such a jolly man.

1028
01:25:53,868 --> 01:25:54,857
Sit up.

1029
01:25:56,538 --> 01:25:57,937
Does your throat hurt?

1030
01:25:58,707 --> 01:25:59,696
Open your mouth.

1031
01:26:02,477 --> 01:26:04,377
What about that food?

1032
01:26:05,981 --> 01:26:06,913
Stick out your tongue.

1033
01:26:10,852 --> 01:26:11,876
Take a deep breath.

1034
01:26:15,790 --> 01:26:19,783
Sometimes, when you're asleep,
you stop breathing for a few seconds.

1035
01:26:20,762 --> 01:26:22,059
You could suffocate.

1036
01:26:22,764 --> 01:26:25,130
She's all right,
it's just a chill.

1037
01:26:25,967 --> 01:26:27,958
Come and sleep with me,
darling.

1038
01:26:33,108 --> 01:26:34,405
Fifty.

1039
01:26:38,146 --> 01:26:39,738
Fifty-five.

1040
01:26:43,118 --> 01:26:44,585
Sixty.

1041
01:26:48,356 --> 01:26:49,414
Sixty-five.

1042
01:26:50,625 --> 01:26:52,923
- What's wrong?
- A bee stung me.

1043
01:26:53,361 --> 01:26:54,453
Seventy.

1044
01:26:57,799 --> 01:26:59,494
Seventy-five.

1045
01:27:02,637 --> 01:27:04,764
Dad, look!
It's incredible!

1046
01:27:06,841 --> 01:27:07,933
Eighty-five.

1047
01:27:09,744 --> 01:27:10,938
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I am.

1048
01:27:11,146 --> 01:27:12,477
It's a long time.

1049
01:27:16,751 --> 01:27:18,878
You need a haircut.

1050
01:27:25,860 --> 01:27:26,884
Five.

1051
01:27:28,863 --> 01:27:30,660
Wait, start over again.

1052
01:27:37,205 --> 01:27:38,263
Don't talk to me.

1053
01:27:44,279 --> 01:27:45,405
Don't talk to me!

1054
01:27:49,184 --> 01:27:50,276
Mom!

1055
01:27:54,889 --> 01:27:55,981
Mom!

1056
01:28:10,438 --> 01:28:11,462
My God!

1057
01:28:12,607 --> 01:28:14,097
What did you do to grandma?

1058
01:28:18,313 --> 01:28:19,746
Something horrible happened.

1059
01:28:21,249 --> 01:28:23,080
I was telling Juli? N about it.

1060
01:28:23,485 --> 01:28:25,214
He's the only one
who listens to me.

1061
01:28:26,354 --> 01:28:27,412
It's horrible.

1062
01:28:29,791 --> 01:28:32,157
A doctor at the congress
interfered with Amalia.

1063
01:28:32,427 --> 01:28:34,156
My God, that's awful!

1064
01:28:36,664 --> 01:28:37,722
What happened?

1065
01:28:37,932 --> 01:28:38,489
Juli? N,

1066
01:28:38,700 --> 01:28:40,099
get dressed and get out.

1067
01:28:40,301 --> 01:28:42,166
The doctor is a friend
of her mother.

1068
01:28:42,370 --> 01:28:44,895
I didn't know what to do,
he told me to tell you.

1069
01:28:45,106 --> 01:28:46,232
Of course.

1070
01:28:47,275 --> 01:28:50,244
- Did Amalia tell her mother?
- No, she didn't dare.

1071
01:28:52,147 --> 01:28:53,136
See what I mean?

1072
01:28:53,348 --> 01:28:55,578
- We have to tell Helena.
- No, mom.

1073
01:28:55,784 --> 01:28:56,478
Please.

1074
01:28:56,785 --> 01:28:59,345
I'll tell Amalia to tell her,
please.

1075
01:28:59,554 --> 01:29:01,249
Jose, we're going home.

1076
01:29:05,593 --> 01:29:06,560
Sweetheart,

1077
01:29:06,761 --> 01:29:07,921
fold this.

1078
01:29:08,129 --> 01:29:10,290
Is the representation
starting at 6:00?

1079
01:29:10,498 --> 01:29:11,089
Stop that!

1080
01:29:11,299 --> 01:29:13,859
A bit later,
at 6:15 or 6:30.

1081
01:29:14,335 --> 01:29:16,064
Is there dinner afterwards?

1082
01:29:16,271 --> 01:29:17,704
Yes, there's dinner.

1083
01:29:17,906 --> 01:29:20,067
Don't pour shampoo
on the bees!

1084
01:29:20,275 --> 01:29:23,142
This is the hive.
They're getting away, hurry!

1085
01:29:23,344 --> 01:29:25,209
Hand me my purse, please.

1086
01:29:25,814 --> 01:29:27,714
Quick, they're outside!

1087
01:29:28,516 --> 01:29:30,484
I'll take the kids for a walk.

1088
01:29:31,085 --> 01:29:33,610
- I'll keep a front seat for you.
- Yes, do that.

1089
01:29:33,955 --> 01:29:35,980
Come on, kids.

1090
01:29:36,257 --> 01:29:38,418
They're getting out
the other side.

1091
01:30:15,730 --> 01:30:18,290
I'm going to tell your mother
everything.

1092
01:30:41,823 --> 01:30:43,484
I wanted to tell you something.

1093
01:31:26,801 --> 01:31:28,029
You're a good man.

1094
01:31:34,142 --> 01:31:35,268
You're a good man.

1095
01:31:55,530 --> 01:31:56,519
Did I hit you?

1096
01:32:24,792 --> 01:32:25,918
Come in.

1097
01:32:46,547 --> 01:32:48,674
I feel the same.
It's madness.

1098
01:33:17,545 --> 01:33:19,069
We should be going.

1099
01:33:49,077 --> 01:33:50,169
Good evening.

1100
01:33:50,378 --> 01:33:53,779
We have to talk to Helena.
It's urgent.

1101
01:33:54,248 --> 01:33:55,806
I'm very sorry!

1102
01:33:56,084 --> 01:33:58,450
She's at the closure
of the congress.

1103
01:33:58,653 --> 01:34:00,120
You can wait in the hall.

1104
01:34:11,099 --> 01:34:12,293
I'm going to find Amalia.

1105
01:34:13,334 --> 01:34:16,929
Don't come back
until I've spoken to her mother.

1106
01:34:19,173 --> 01:34:20,231
Josefina!

1107
01:34:21,676 --> 01:34:25,271
Get rid of that long face.
You're helping her.

1108
01:34:25,546 --> 01:34:26,570
Remember.

1109
01:34:33,020 --> 01:34:34,146
Elevator!

1110
01:34:36,157 --> 01:34:37,181
- Mirta.
- Yes?

1111
01:34:37,391 --> 01:34:41,020
I must speak urgently to Helena
about a very serious situation

1112
01:34:41,229 --> 01:34:43,527
that has occurred
here in the hotel.

1113
01:34:44,332 --> 01:34:46,163
Stop that!

1114
01:34:47,168 --> 01:34:48,157
What's wrong?

1115
01:34:48,970 --> 01:34:50,528
Go and see what it is.

1116
01:34:51,339 --> 01:34:52,306
Stop that.

1117
01:34:58,246 --> 01:35:01,738
Right, I would ask you all
to please take your seats,

1118
01:35:01,949 --> 01:35:03,610
and if we could have
some silence

1119
01:35:04,185 --> 01:35:06,483
we'll get ourselves organized.

1120
01:35:14,629 --> 01:35:16,927
Doctors,
if we can all take our seats...

1121
01:35:20,835 --> 01:35:21,995
You can sit there.

1122
01:35:22,603 --> 01:35:24,571
I think there's going
to be a scandal.

1123
01:35:24,872 --> 01:35:26,635
They're going to report a doctor

1124
01:35:26,841 --> 01:35:29,275
who interfered
with the girl from the hotel.

1125
01:35:29,510 --> 01:35:30,340
You know the one?

1126
01:35:31,512 --> 01:35:33,946
The girl at the pool,
with brown hair.

1127
01:35:37,151 --> 01:35:40,018
Dr. Jano, if you'd come round
this way, please.

1128
01:35:45,159 --> 01:35:46,626
As you all know,

1129
01:35:46,994 --> 01:35:48,757
today,
to close this congress,

1130
01:35:48,963 --> 01:35:51,989
we are going to present
a public consultation.

1131
01:35:52,967 --> 01:35:56,459
So I would ask for
a big round of applause for Helena

1132
01:35:57,038 --> 01:35:59,632
who is going to participate
as our patient.

1133
01:36:07,949 --> 01:36:10,884
The first part
of this representation

1134
01:36:11,519 --> 01:36:13,919
is an interview
with Dr. Jano.

1135
01:36:22,997 --> 01:36:23,827
Doctor...

1136
01:36:39,113 --> 01:36:41,274
- Your tie.
- It's fine without a tie.

1137
01:36:44,218 --> 01:36:46,584
Dr. Jano,
we're waiting for you.

1138
01:37:35,436 --> 01:37:36,562
Jose!

1139
01:37:37,204 --> 01:37:38,466
When did you get here?

1140
01:37:41,876 --> 01:37:43,400
What are you doing?

1141
01:37:44,045 --> 01:37:45,637
Are you allowed in now?

1142
01:37:45,846 --> 01:37:47,074
You want me to come in?

1143
01:37:53,521 --> 01:37:54,510
Are you allowed?

1144
01:37:54,722 --> 01:37:56,587
The water is so warm.

1145
01:38:27,988 --> 01:38:29,319
You notice that smell?

1146
01:38:31,859 --> 01:38:32,723
Yes.

1147
01:38:34,362 --> 01:38:35,420
Orange blossom.

1148
01:38:39,633 --> 01:38:40,998
I'll always take care of you,

1149
01:38:42,303 --> 01:38:44,498
because you have
no brothers or sisters.

1150
01:38:45,139 --> 01:38:46,231
I'm your sister.

1151
01:38:47,842 --> 01:38:51,300
Next year,
I'll have twin brothers.

1152
01:38:51,779 --> 01:38:52,973
I mean, sisters.

1153
01:38:59,820 --> 01:39:01,879
Hello, hello.
Did you hear?

1154
01:39:02,879 --> 01:39:12,879
