0
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,951
Paris, Two Thousand Ten.

1
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,032
Faced with rampant crime in certain
suburbs, or barrios,

2
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,111
the government authorized
the construction of an isolation wall

3
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,320
around cities classified as high risk.

4
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,593
Come on! Let’s go! I'm starving.

5
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,715
They ain't ready yet.

6
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,076
OK. They're ready.
Help yourself. Go on.

7
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,630
I must have an effect on you fags, huh?

8
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,435
I step outtake my car,
and you're already hot to trot.

9
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,999
We don't want no shit here, K Two.

10
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,152
Whaddya talking about.
It's just a friendly visit that's all it is.

11
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,193
Sniff... Smells good here too

12
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,430
Merguez?

13
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,593
Delicious!

14
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,470
Want some?

15
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,719
So... is your boss around?

16
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,076
We ain't seen him today.

17
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,832
That's okay. I don't mind waiting.

18
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,118
C'mon relax. Go on, search me.
I ain't armed clean as a choir boy.

19
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,156
Look, we don't want no shit.
You better go back.

20
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,597
What's with you guys?
We can't communicate

21
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,671
for once we're together,
and y'get all nervous and shy.

22
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,715
So get movin', will ya?

23
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,075
We don't feel like talkin'
The boss ain't here.

24
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,799
We told ya. If you want,
we'll tell him you were.

25
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,798
That's really nice of you

26
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,635
Anyone got a piece of paper?
I'll leave him a number.

27
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,631
No, I'll write it on the wall.
Won't get lost that way.

28
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,948
Nothing on the wall.

29
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,235
Oh I forgot. This is Mister Clean's
apartment building.

30
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,673
Real fancy guy your boss is, huh?

31
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,639
Yeah, it hurts you to see a building
still standing in this shithouse of a city.

32
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,278
I think it's great.

33
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,032
It makes the city more lively.

34
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,395
So, where do I write the number?

35
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,429
Gimme your hand.

36
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,435
Gimme your hand,

37
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,590
I said. If I was gonna cut you,
I'd a done it a long time ago.

38
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,319
Look at him, armed to the teeth,
and he's scared of a pen.

39
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,957
Don't worry man about it.
I'm not gonna press hard.

40
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,032
Why do you wanna see Leito?

41
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,599
He's got some stuff I want.

42
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,433
Things that belong to me.

43
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,110
There you go.
Now, you got a good reason not to wash.

44
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,509
Now that was a nice friendly visit.

45
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,669
Why don't we shake on it, huh?

46
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,475
What's your name?

47
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,277
Tarik.

48
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,875
Tarik, let's shake.
That's better. Don't be afraid.

49
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,955
This is worth a picture.
I wish I had my camera.

50
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,474
Right guys? Smile, come on.

51
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,710
It's okay. They're with me.

52
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,597
So you feel like talkin' all of a sudden,

53
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,795
but it's too late.

54
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,190
You go up the stairs.
I'll take the elevator

55
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,072
For once, it's not broken.

56
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,796
Call downstairs, the elevator's coming.

57
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,793
You could do it yourself, you know.

58
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,718
Tarik, who's comin' up?

59
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,950
Tarik!

60
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,229
Fuckin' thing never works right.

61
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,955
Hey move it, we got visitors.

62
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,634
Look, if I don't watch the end,
I won't be able to follow tomorrow.

63
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,678
Tarik, would you say somethin'?

64
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,870
Tarik!

65
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,789
- Tarik.
- The picture's gone. Hurry, fix the antenna!

66
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,108
Hey, I ain't your nigger.

67
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,428
You do it man.

68
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,592
Tarik, will you answer me!

69
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,114
You're too worked up man.
It's probably the food being delivered.

70
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,839
That's bullshit. Since when do
they deliver an hour early, huh?

71
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,036
You're such a pessimist.

72
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,629
Leito's apartment,

73
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,119
you wouldn't know the number huh?

74
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,715
It's fourteen.

75
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,716
Thanks.

76
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,754
Son of a bitch!
There ain't no numbers on the doors!

77
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,592
Get 'em all opened!

78
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,554
I'm lookin' for Leito.

79
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,436
It's not here, I swear!

80
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,919
Then tell me where it is, asshole!

81
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,195
Down the hall and left.
He got his name on the door.

82
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,475
You're coming with me.

83
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,198
I don't trust signs.

84
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,469
Go right...

85
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,795
left...

86
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,669
the third door.

87
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,034
What're ya tryin' to do, get me killed?

88
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,078
Alive, remember?
Taha wants him alive.

89
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,870
Move over...

90
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,919
On three, huh?

91
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,797
One... two...

92
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,148
Catch the bastard!

93
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,235
Get it open!

94
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,112
Come on!

95
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,874
The roof, hurry!

96
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,518
The stupid fuck!

97
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,750
There he is!

98
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,236
Stop me if I'm wrong.

99
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,675
You get ripped off twenty kilos of power.

100
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,910
At nine, you know who did it,
and you go to get it back.

101
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,069
How many were ya?

102
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,116
Ten, twelve.

103
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,235
Ten, twelve huh?

104
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,675
And about noon, seven of you come
back empty-handed.

105
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,749
Anything else?

106
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,760
Well, we coulda iced the guy,
but you wanted him alive so...

107
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,910
That's fantastic.
Before long, it'll be my fault.

108
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,992
That's not what I wanted to say.
He's like... a...

109
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,469
like a bar of soap, he's...

110
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,788
Oh, is that so?

111
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,551
Well, yeah.

112
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,790
Let's see, fifty a gram, twenty kilos.

113
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,791
Don't bother counting. It's a million,

114
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,359
in euros.

115
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,556
That's very expensive soap, huh?

116
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,590
So, which one of you
has a suggestion for me

117
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,954
so he doesn't slip away again?

118
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,677
Me! Me, I uhh I got an idea.

119
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,399
K Two, that's great. Go on.

120
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,833
Well, since it was Leito
who dumped all the dope,

121
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,155
then he's gotta give us the cash for it.

122
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,309
That's just common sense.

123
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,310
I asked you for an idea.

124
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,310
Wait, hold on!

125
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,389
Go on.

126
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,839
His sister Lola.

127
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,595
Leito's sister works at the supermarket.
If we've got her,

128
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,432
he won't stay in hiding for long.

129
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,200
That's what I call an idea.
Go and get her.

130
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,395
We'll be right out.

131
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,917
Come on, the boss wants to see you.

132
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,837
The boss is waiting, I said.
You heard, so get off your ass...

133
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,148
He never comes in on Tuesdays.

134
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,630
I'm not talkin' about that scumbag.
I mean my boss and yours Taha.

135
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,870
Taha can go fuck himself.

136
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,309
Let's me go!

137
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,032
Let's me go.

138
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,909
What the fuck is wrong
with everyone today?

139
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,596
Hey K Two, is she my birthday present?

140
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,830
I'd love a piece of her.
She looks just my size!

141
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,996
Watch your hands.

142
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,433
Hey, we gotta search her. Huh?

143
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,192
We already did. She's clean.

144
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,271
C'mon, share the wealth.
Leave us her panties.

145
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,952
When I come back, I'll bite your balls off!

146
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,359
I got other plans for you mouth.

147
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,112
You'll like it a lot more.

148
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,713
That's for openers, slimeball!

149
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,310
Hands off her I said. She's for Taha.

150
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,436
And you cut that shit out, okay?

151
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,236
It's me.

152
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,469
K Two is here.

153
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,633
I know your face. Show me the girl.

154
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,109
Okay, bring her up here.

155
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,638
Make sure he knows we got his sister.

156
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,755
Spread the news.

157
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,678
I wish I could see the cocksucker
when they tell him what happened.

158
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,710
You're lookin' at him now,
you son of a bitch.

159
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,877
Why don't I cut you now
and that'll be the end of it.

160
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,633
Cut me and there's a pack of wild dogs
that're gonna be out a master,

161
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,995
and that might not be too cool.
What're you after?

162
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,149
You see Taha, that's the difference
between us two.

163
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,434
You never know what's in my head,

164
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,239
but I know all the shit going on in yours.

165
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,959
I'm always a step ahead
because I know what you're thinking.

166
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,031
Hold it, K Two. It's okay.

167
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,997
Stay nice and calm.
We're just talkin'.

168
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,229
Yeah, just talkin'.

169
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,515
Look, tell me what the fuck you want.

170
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,919
Stop busting my balls
and let's get this over with.

171
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,228
Two things.

172
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,355
Yeah, go on.

173
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,398
Y'leave my building alone. No dealing
for five hundred meters around it.

174
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,637
Yeah okay. What else?

175
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,269
That's easy. Your life for my sister's.

176
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,995
I let you go.

177
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,435
I walk out with her, and if none
of your guys move, we got a deal.

178
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,669
Y'know, you shoulda gone into business.

179
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,590
Yes or no?

180
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,272
Okay, it's a deal.

181
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,588
I got your word?

182
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,795
She ain't enough?

183
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,236
Give the order.

184
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,992
K two, let her go.

185
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,150
You heard me. Wait downstairs.

186
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,071
K Two, will ya stop your fuckin' thinking
and do what I'm tellin' ya to do?

187
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,871
Get down now
or you'll never get up again!

188
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,838
Look, I kept my word.
She's free, so now let go of me.

189
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,035
Patience, Taha.

190
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,076
Y'think you're gonna get outta here
in one piece?

191
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,151
Y'think every here is your buddy huh?

192
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,474
Listen,

193
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,312
I got a deal with this guy, okay?

194
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,391
I said that he and his sister could go.

195
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,754
And so make sure nobody moves,

196
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,955
and everything'll be cool.

197
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,870
Hey you...

198
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,234
Open your mouth.

199
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,879
Chew it, pig! C'mon, eat me!

200
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,398
She's my kinda girl.

201
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,674
You can't have her. Go on.

202
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,358
Move it!

203
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,433
Let's go!

204
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,678
Okay, let's go.

205
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,070
Clear the way. C'mon, move it.
This way. Faster.

206
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,350
Hey, get rid of this fuckin' thing.
Hurry. Move it.

207
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,952
Go on! Go on, move!

208
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,994
Stop your vehicle. Stop your vehicle.

209
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,552
Okay, hold it. We brought you a customer.

210
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,237
We want the inspector.

211
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,955
Make way for us. We're comin' in.

212
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,749
Son of a bitch.

213
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,074
Hey, can't you settle your scores
someplace else,

214
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,115
'cause we're closing up here.

215
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,633
It's Taha. Taha Ben Mamoud.

216
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,199
Doesn't the name mean
something to you?

217
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,033
I know him, but I told you we're closing up
by order of the government.

218
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,509
So if you can't show me some proof,
I can't do anything.

219
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,713
Five kilos of heroin taken from off
his desk, with two wit nesses.

220
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,835
How's that?

221
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,912
There are too many of them outside.
We're outnumbered.

222
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,511
Okay okay, since you insist,

223
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,113
but first your weapons.

224
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,918
Hand 'em over, and you men,
keep your eye on Taha.

225
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,956
Oh, poor na? Ve Leito.

226
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,359
I'll bet you really think it's gonna
change something, don't you?

227
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,317
Maybe not much,
but you gotta start somewhere.

228
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,595
Now we're gonna eliminate
the paperwork, okay?

229
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,194
You go into the cell, and you go pick up
your dope and clear out.

230
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,269
Don't that for Chrissake!

231
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,157
If you let him go,
it'll be worse than before.

232
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,719
It won't be worse 'cause we're getting out.

233
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,233
When the shit falls, we'll be far away.

234
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,833
You won't be here,
but it's still gonna go on,

235
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,751
and you're the ones
who're supposed to stop it.

236
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,319
I'll bet that you still believe that.

237
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,436
The barbed wire
and the walls, did you forget that?

238
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,431
They're gonna put a lid on it
and blow it all up.

239
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,317
That's what they'll do to make
the shit disappear.

240
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,628
As for you, be grateful you're here

241
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,439
'cause there are some guys outside ready
to make dead meat out of you.

242
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,835
Why the hell are you still here?

243
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,151
Like you said, there are a lotta guys
out there all ready to do what I tell'em to.

244
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,559
Stop that shit, Taha. You're free.
Y'got your dope.

245
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,039
What the hell more do y'want?

246
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,191
The girl.

247
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,478
No! No!

248
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,355
Now get out.

249
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,475
No!

250
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,551
I'm warning you, touch me and you'll...

251
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,156
Lola! Lola!

252
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,515
Don't worry. I'll take good care of her.

253
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,591
Gentlemen, it's always a pleasure
to do business with you.

254
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,153
So long.

255
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,313
No, no!

256
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,315
Take her to my office, tie her up,
and give her two grams.

257
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,674
That'll calm her down.

258
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,189
Okay, okay, let's get back to work now.

259
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,478
I didn't have any choice, kid.

260
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,230
I've been in this area for fifteen years.

261
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,554
I'm retired as of tonight,
and I'd like to take advantage of it.

262
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,155
It was her or me. I'm sorry.

263
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,190
You shoulda chose my sister.
You're already dead.

264
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,913
<i>Six Months Later</i>

265
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,473
Digame Pedro,
what you got against my car?

266
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,390
My name's not Pedro.

267
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,392
Who gives a fuck your name's not Pedro?
I'm talkin' about my car, cojone.

268
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,110
What if I crashed your head in every time
I wanted you to keep quiet?

269
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,879
Hey, it's only a car.

270
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,829
No, it's not only a car.
It's my car, maricon.

271
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,235
I just had it overhauled,
and it cost a fortune.

272
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,232
So I suggest you show
some fucking respect for my car

273
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,038
or you'll find yourself under the wheels.

274
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,319
Comprende?

275
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,590
Forget it Carlos.
He didn't do it on purpose.

276
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,677
C'mon, what the fuck's the matter
with that guy, huh?

277
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,228
I'm sick of these kids
who don't respect anything.

278
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,276
Anybody can close a door
without slamming it.

279
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,511
It's okay, he's gonna take good care
of your car from now on. Right Pedro?

280
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,635
My name's not Pedro.

281
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,676
What's more, the door's got a squeak.

282
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,193
The garage takes a fortune

283
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,953
and gives me back the car
with a squeaky fucking door!

284
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,237
I'll get rid of the squeaking, Carlos.
I promise you.

285
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,230
We gotta recruit better, Benito.
It's getting bad.

286
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,117
Remind me to talk to Frank.

287
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:56,632
Okay.

288
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,517
I'm tired of getting
all these Portuguese guys.

289
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,875
Sawdust in the head. Campesinos.

290
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,757
I'll talk to Frank about it. Don't worry.

291
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,559
I want men with an education, damn it.

292
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,315
Hire good prospects as soon as
they get outta school.

293
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,153
Guys who wanna use their brains instead
of hanging out all day.

294
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:15,119
Benito, there are six million unemployed
in this fuckin' country.

295
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,555
Two or three shouldn't be
so fuckin' hard to find.

296
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,115
Yeah, Frank'll get us
some good men, that's for sure.

297
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,232
Well, what're ya standin' there for?

298
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,836
Very good.

299
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,314
Place your bets.

300
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,635
Twenty seven.

301
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,914
You won't forget me Carlos?

302
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,513
No problem Mr. Keijman.

303
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,271
End of the week, as usual, huh?

304
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,789
Hijo de puta.
He's got balls that asshole, huh?

305
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,633
Remindin' me about his kickback
with all the money he owes us.

306
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,431
People got no education nowadays, Benito.

307
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,589
Get downstairs!

308
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,229
Hola. Que tal?

309
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,195
Everything okay, Sammy?

310
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,554
No, things are pretty terrible.

311
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,949
Oh yeah? What's wrong now?

312
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,718
Everyone you see is a cop.

313
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,916
One there, and two there.

314
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,433
They've already spent an hour
choosing a can of corn.

315
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,794
They're perverts.

316
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,757
Perverts? What're they doing
in the food section?

317
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,955
Nada. They're just waiting for two AM

318
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,679
when the hookers use
the coffee machine there. See?

319
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,878
You got here at one ten,

320
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,633
and outside,
look what's happening now.

321
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,716
What's that?

322
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,598
Perverts, and I don't think they're gonna
spend hours looking for corn.

323
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,914
Anything else suspicious?

324
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,355
Yeah, most of our regular players
didn't show up tonight,

325
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,590
and it just happens to be the day
we transfer our money.

326
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,675
Yeah, and so you're saying...

327
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,990
...that a real big transfer
can be very tempting.

328
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,718
All you have to do is put the cops
onto the deal,

329
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,756
and you get ten percent
of the money with no risk.

330
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,909
How d'you know that anyway?

331
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,399
'Cause I've already been offered it.

332
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,469
You must've been tempted.

333
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,279
How can you be sure it was a real cop
who approached you?

334
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,395
You're pretty clever, huh?

335
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,993
It's the only way to stay alive.

336
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:09,990
That's for sure.

337
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,235
You went to school, right?

338
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,116
Economics.

339
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:12,950
Bachelor's degree.

340
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,600
Yeah, I was right. Y'see the difference?

341
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,552
So somebody's tryin' to rob us, huh?

342
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,038
And rob us big time.

343
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,759
Didn't I tell you that that Pedro guy
was pretty fuckin' weird?

344
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,193
Hijo de puta.

345
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,190
His name wasn't Pedro.

346
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,510
Who cares what his name was?
I ain't puttin' up any monument huh?

347
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,272
Okay, grab all the money and let's go.

348
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,435
No one's goin' anywhere.
Sacks down, hands up, huh?

349
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,714
Benito, what're ya doing?

350
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,234
I'm not Benito anymore.
The name's Damien.

351
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,551
First Attack Division Carlos Montoya.
You're under arrest, you hear?

352
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,278
Benito, you've gotta...

353
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,634
You have the right to remain silent.

354
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,109
Whatever you say
can be used against you.

355
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,590
Any threatening gesture or false movement
will be considered as a refusal

356
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,240
to cooperate thus putting my agents
in a position of self defense. Clear?

357
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,070
What does all that shit mean?

358
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,559
It means one false move,

359
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,039
and I paint the place red, Capito?

360
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,998
Yeah yeah. And how do ya think
you're gonna get outta here in one piece?

361
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,832
We're gonna stick around here some more.

362
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,797
Sammy, you and your friends clear out.

363
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,677
Why the hell did ya let them go?

364
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,072
Because you're the big one.

365
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,798
Chameleon in place. Are you guys all set?

366
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,677
We are Chameleon. Here it comes.

367
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,870
What do we do now?

368
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,234
What are you asking me for?

369
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,150
You went to school.

370
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,468
C'mon, enough of that.

371
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,835
What's goin' on?

372
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,988
You okay? Nothing broken?

373
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,509
No no, I'm okay.

374
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,555
Glad to hear it.

375
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,677
Chameleon to carrier. The delivery's ready.

376
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,079
Commencing operation.

377
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,911
Okay, c'mon out of there Sir, please.

378
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,273
What now Einstein?

379
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,711
Step on it. It's getting hot over here.

380
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,673
The wire damn it.

381
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,790
Hey, you better send me
some ammo and quick.

382
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,789
They didn't take the money.
Go on, shut the door.

383
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,393
Go on, they're waiting for you.

384
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,350
What a great sense of timing you guys go.

385
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,876
Okay guys, go go go go. Come on!

386
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,952
This way. This way please, everyone.

387
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,119
- Just keep moving. C'mon.
- Come on, come on man. Easy does it.

388
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,553
Good job.

389
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,390
Captain.

390
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,156
You're the fuckin' biggest son of a bitch
I ever met, you scumbag!

391
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,112
That's the first compliment I've had all day.

392
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,031
When I think I trusted you like a brother.

393
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:41,950
A brother?

394
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,952
You mean like washing your car
for six months before giving me a real job?

395
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,315
Oh, that door of yours,
the one that squeaks?

396
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,149
It doesn't squeak anymore.

397
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,318
It's Captain Tomasso, Colonel.

398
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,435
Thank you. Show him in.

399
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,475
Hello Damien.

400
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,793
I'd have much preferred simply
to congratulate you for last night's operation.

401
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,632
Unfortunately however,
we have a real emergency. Sit down.

402
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,518
I'd rather stand if it's okay with you.

403
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,316
As you like.

404
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,834
You know Mr. Kruger,
the Secretary of State for Defense,

405
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,911
and Mr. Corsini, his assistant.

406
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,272
They need a man of courage
for an extremely delicate mission.

407
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,113
Mr. Kruger, I'll let you explain the situation.

408
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,834
It happened yesterday. In the afternoon,

409
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,911
we were transferring material
in an armored vehicle

410
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,309
when we had
what you might call a little incident.

411
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,628
No no no no no no!

412
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,188
I don't want your dirty sponge.
It'll scratch the windows.

413
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,074
Shit!

414
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,792
One day, I'll get 'em for that.

415
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,754
The good news is that the vehicle
had a lot of tracers in it,

416
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,068
so we know exactly where it's located,

417
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,310
and we're asking you to get it back.

418
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,071
Where is it?

419
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,799
What's inside of the truck?

420
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,194
What is this shit anyway.

421
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,670
An experimental scatter type bomb,
sometimes known as a clean bomb.

422
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,479
It's a prototype based
on neutron technology.

423
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,436
Medium range, about eight kilometers.

424
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,476
The waves are of short duration
and are absorbed very fast.

425
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:33,836
The risk of polluting the atmosphere
is close toi zero.

426
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,592
You're worried they'll move the bomb.

427
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,236
Is that it? It wouldn't be so clean
in the center of town, would it?

428
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,958
Yes, and that's one
of our primary concerns.

429
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,758
What's more, the bomb is equipped

430
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,796
with a timing mechanism set
for twenty four hours.

431
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,156
Unfortunately, it was triggered accidentally,
and that was exactly an hour ago.

432
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,434
Y'mean that in twenty three hours, it'll...

433
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,112
It'll explode.

434
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,034
- K TWO.
- Yeah?

435
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,872
Y'got twenty four hours to sell this mother.

436
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,598
Can't be done. Too short.

437
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,715
Captain,

438
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,392
we're not asking for your advice on this.

439
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,833
We're trying to explain
your mission to you.

440
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,558
Colonel, you know the way I function.

441
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,039
I study the terrain for weeks and weeks.

442
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,235
Then it takes me months to infiltrate.

443
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,799
Damien, there are
two million people there,

444
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,279
and maybe half are the scum
of the earth,

445
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,351
but the other half are entitled
to our assistance.

446
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,634
So you're gonna change how you operate,

447
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,870
unless you don't care anymore
about saving innocent people.

448
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,315
But accepting a mission
that's a lost cause is totally crazy.

449
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,994
You want me to defuse a bomb
in the worst barrio,

450
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,593
Where I've never even been.
Couldn't be more attractive.

451
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,511
As far as the site goes,
we've found you a local guide.

452
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,955
Plus I've gotta work with someone.

453
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,793
He's a young man who was born there,
and he knows the barrio like a book,

454
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,915
so he'll save a lot of precious time.

455
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,195
And the guy, did you force him to do it,
or is he a volunteer?

456
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,874
He doesn't know yet. We're counting
on you to convince him.

457
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,995
Leito,

458
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,310
transfer.

459
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,276
Where to?

460
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,270
Shut up.

461
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,194
Prisoner 712, in the van.

462
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,718
Let me go! Let me go, godammit!

463
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,598
Come on, get up!

464
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,554
Prisoner 713 in the van.

465
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,992
Fuck, he bit me, the asshole!

466
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,109
You okay?

467
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,073
Never better.

468
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,958
The fucker thought I'd let him kick
the shit outta me without doin' anything.

469
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,878
I'm gettin' outta here.

470
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,869
You think playing around with the lock
is really gonna open the door?

471
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:17,270
You say that because y'don't know
who I am yet. The name's Phantoman.

472
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,794
And Phantoman doesn't plan spending
eight years locked up.

473
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,638
What'd they get you for?

474
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,313
I blew away five guys,

475
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,517
buy they weren't the right ones.
The guy I wanted got away.

476
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,555
What'd ya want him for?

477
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,798
He murdered my father
and my two brothers.

478
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,996
And it hurts to know
this guy is still breathing.

479
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,390
So soon as I'm outta here I head
for Barrio Thirteen

480
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,708
and finish the bastard off for good.

481
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,436
Does he live there?

482
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,590
Yeah, and he's gonna die there.

483
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,470
What's the guy's name?

484
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,596
Taha. Y'know him?

485
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,309
You're not missing much.

486
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,718
I made the big mistake of trying to do
some business with the guy.

487
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,758
He lives in a kind of hangar
with an army protecting him.

488
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,993
And he struts around the place.
Him and his human vegetable.

489
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,913
What human vegetable?

490
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,912
A junky. He keeps her on a leash
like a dog or something.

491
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,956
I never was anyone so doped up.

492
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,393
Lola's her name, I think

493
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,597
I'll be back in two minutes flat.

494
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,159
Hey, there's a space here in front.

495
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,719
Can I drop you somewhere?

496
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,793
Barrio Thirteen'll be fine.

497
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,393
You got it.

498
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,276
Damien.

499
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,713
Leito.

500
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,070
Okay, they've left the prison.

501
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,035
The plan's going according to schedule.

502
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,836
Are they still together?

503
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,514
Yes, they're in the front of the van.
It shouldn't be hard to spot them.

504
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,556
Excellent. Congratulations Colonel.

505
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,993
I wouldn't claim victory so quickly.

506
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,957
It's much easier to get out of prison than
it is to enter Barrio Thirteen.

507
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,508
And that is when we'll see how good
a guide your Leito is,

508
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,273
Because without him,
Damien's going to be out of luck.

509
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,430
Your captain can take care of himself.

510
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,191
I'm gonna need your help
because I don't know the way.

511
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,157
Any idea how we can sneak in discreetly?

512
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,434
Yeah. Go straight.

513
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,873
Hey, cut that shit out. What're ya doing?

514
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,188
I won't lose you this way.

515
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,751
Take those fucking things off me!

516
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,479
You wanna get inside?

517
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,551
Yeah.

518
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,198
Then from now on asshole,
I'm Phantoman,

519
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,235
and you're gonna do whatever I want.

520
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,514
Now floor it, huh?

521
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,919
What do I do now?

522
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,989
Go on, straight ahead.

523
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,959
Okay, turn right, now.

524
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,469
Turn right I said!

525
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,915
Hey, I heard you the first time,
but the wheel won't turn.

526
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,514
Okay, stop the car.

527
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,632
The brakes are gone too!

528
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,831
Then stop it against another car,
but go easy.

529
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,354
I didn't say to smash the car.

530
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,032
Okay sorry, I did the best I could,

531
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,350
but no one's stopping you
from getting a new driver.

532
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,589
Now let me go, huh?

533
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,716
What's wrong?
You should feel at home, man.

534
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,869
What're you talkin' about?

535
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,710
You're a cop,

536
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,597
and a cop who thinks
I'm an idiot doesn't live long.

537
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,954
C'mon Leito, let me go, y'hear?

538
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,598
This is where you wanted me to take you.

539
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,635
Okay, so you're here.

540
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,948
Now take out your police manual
and look at the page

541
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,553
that says, "I'm up shit's creek"

542
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,036
Leito, I'm not a cop for Chrissakes.

543
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,395
It's true. Let me go damn it.
It's thanks to me you’re out of jail.

544
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,677
Yeah, I wonder why you did that.
Somebody needed me to be set free.

545
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,990
But whatever the deal, count me out.

546
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,758
Even if it's to save your sister?

547
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,195
She doesn't need anyone
except her brother.

548
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,316
Fuck!

549
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,759
Hey, y'know that's my car
that you just fuckin' wrecked.

550
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,589
Sorry man. I broke outta jail an hour ago.

551
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,114
This piece of shit didn't have any brakes.
I was coming here for a little shelter.

552
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,315
For shelter?

553
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,473
You got bad directions man,

554
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,279
'cause this ain't no Monaco. It's Baghdad.

555
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,639
Tell 'em to calm down.

556
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,989
Cool it. Easy.

557
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,916
Sorry about your car,
but in exchange take mine.

558
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,989
How's that for a deal?

559
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,358
Well, did you sell the bomb or not?

560
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,759
It ain't about that, Taha.

561
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,750
It's Leito.

562
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,750
Leito?

563
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,989
He broke out an hour ago.

564
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,957
Won't be long before he starts bangin'
the door down.

565
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,839
Hey, wake up.

566
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,798
Your brother's on his way to rescue you.

567
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,355
Be careful.

568
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:23,757
Okay.

569
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,759
First of all, how'd you know I was a cop?

570
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,909
The way you move.

571
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,434
Nobody around her moves
or fights like that. It looks too clean.

572
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,192
When you come from the street,
you got one thing more.

573
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,156
Oh yeah, what?

574
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:50,797
Hate.

575
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,917
Right. Sorry to disappoint you,
hate wasn't part of my education like you.

576
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,150
They taught me Liberty,
equality, fraternity.

577
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,389
Water, gas, electricity.

578
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,391
You don't give a shit about laws,
do you, wise ass?

579
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,675
Sure I do, but I want 'em to be
the same for everybody.

580
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,751
But they are, and I'm here to make sure
that they're obeyed.

581
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,876
No no, you're just a pitbull
who bites for his master.

582
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,349
Yeah, when laws aren't obeyed,
that's what I do.

583
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:12,197
This is where I was born.
It was already pretty bad news.

584
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,635
Then they built a wall around us
when I was eighteen years old.

585
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,790
Did I do anything wrong to rate
that punishment?

586
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,791
No, I respected every fucking law
to the letter.

587
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,314
And I didn't quit school
in ninth grade to sell crack.

588
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,072
It's because they closed the school down.

589
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,635
The only thing I ever did wrong
was getting born here.

590
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,915
And what the hell
is burning people's cars gonna change?

591
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,070
You know any other way
for us to get heard?

592
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,789
Not immediately, no.

593
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,238
Want me to tell you what's goin' on,

594
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,548
and why I sprung you?

595
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,119
For a good cause I imagine. Am I right?

596
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,076
Yeah, for a good cause.

597
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,957
There's a bomb here
in this goddamn armpit of a barrio

598
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,190
and if I don't defuse it in two hours,

599
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,396
Barrio Thirteen's population will be zero.

600
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,357
So if I think the way you do,
I could say to myself,

601
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,750
"What the fuck do I care
if two million losers get snuffed?"

602
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,193
But no, there's always an asshole

603
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,431
who's willing to fight for the idea that
laws are made for everybody.

604
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,317
And now, you help me locate that bomb

605
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,516
or you protect your own precious
ass like all the bourgeois you criticize!

606
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,999
There's really a bomb around here?

607
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,350
I don't even wanna know
why it turned up here.

608
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,429
Who's got it, Taha?

609
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,197
That's right.

610
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,078
He's got your sister and my bomb.
That's two good reason to work together.

611
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,674
If you're lying again,
you're dead, man, huh?

612
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,190
Deal.

613
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,315
So what's your plan?

614
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,551
Tell me exactly what Taha's place is like.
I'll figure out how to sneak in.

615
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,279
I find the bomb, and once it's defused,

616
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,475
we go after your sister.

617
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,232
- While I do nothing.
- No,

618
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:32,710
you've gotta create a diversion.
Taha's gonna make you his priority.

619
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,473
That way, I'm sure not to be disturbed.
Y'think it'll work?

620
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,835
Y'got a telephone?

621
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,636
Yeah.

622
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,199
Hand it over.

623
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,634
- That's not Phantoman, it's James Bond.
- Okay, okay.

624
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:55,551
Yeah?

625
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:56,675
It's Leito.

626
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,988
How did you get my number?

627
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,752
You can buy anything in jail.

628
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:01,875
I heard you were out.

629
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,518
I'm over at the factory.

630
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,879
Hey wait, who're you calling?

631
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,553
Well, what do ya want?

632
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,200
Listen, I'm with a cop
who's got a deal for you.

633
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,993
I'll send K Two to get you.

634
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,588
What're you outta your fuckin' mind?

635
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,150
The plan was to sneak in for Chrissakes,
not to advertise that we're coming.

636
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,150
Discreet, man,

637
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,357
oblique, meaning never in their face,
playing it cooler than cool.

638
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,873
Forget your police manual, will ya?

639
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,359
You're in Barrio Thirteen here.

640
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,715
It's different here,
and I know Taha by heart.

641
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,074
Trust me, it's our only play.

642
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,195
So what's your plan, huh?

643
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,236
We fight his two hundred goons
and the winner's whoever's not dead?

644
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,548
No, no one's gonna die.

645
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,200
There's only one thing that works with Taha,
and if we use it, it'll give us time.

646
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:41,951
What's that?

647
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,314
His curiosity.

648
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,272
Who's this cop he's talkin' about?

649
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,112
What is this?
Whenever I ask a question, I get a mmm...

650
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,919
Hell of a vocabulary.
Okay, find out everything about the guy.

651
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,798
I mean everything.
And I want him here, not at the morgue.

652
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,555
I'll be right back.

653
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,151
Count me out. Too risky.

654
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,389
You're dead if you go it alone.

655
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,789
I've always worked alone,
and I'm still around so fuck off.

656
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:06,517
Ciao.

657
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,600
I know Taha's place like the back of
my hand all the exits,

658
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,635
even one I dug out myself.

659
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,631
Good, I'm happy for you.
I hope you didn't hurt your hands.

660
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,948
I know where the bomb is.

661
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,111
You'll never find it without me.

662
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,235
A couple of minutes ago you didn't know
there was a bomb.

663
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,435
What is this bullshit?

664
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:23,318
Taha's got a safety vault for valuable
things, and I know how to get in.

665
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,628
How'd ya know he put it in there?

666
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,153
Where's he gonna put it,
in the kitchen?

667
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:28,915
Okay, here's the deal.

668
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,389
I set you free, and you shut up
and do what I say. Okay?

669
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,515
No, I've got another deal.

670
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,477
You keep it shut and you pray
my sister is alive, and then you behave.

671
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,879
I'll get your bomb.

672
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,428
Now uncuff me before we're in deep
shit up to our necks.

673
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:42,790
Deal.

674
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,515
Is this guy the cop?

675
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,511
What a sense of deduction,
K Two. I'm impressed.

676
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:54,229
That's very funny. If Taha doesn't finish
you off, the pleasure'll be all mine.

677
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:54,832
C'mon, let's go.

678
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,480
Follow us, and no bullshit.
We're the nervous kind.

679
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,154
Guard duty isn't for sleeping!

680
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,798
Sorry, but I dozed off.

681
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,074
- Where is he?
- In the back.

682
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:25,954
Did you feed him?

683
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,909
He eats all the time.

684
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,795
I got some work for you,
so you can stretch your legs a bit.

685
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,595
They could wipe out the city
with all this shit.

686
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,077
That's the van that transported the bomb.

687
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,833
At least you're sure it's here.

688
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,356
Stay here. I'll pick you up on the way out.

689
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,919
Very funny.

690
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,117
Seems you got a new pal, a fuckin' cop.

691
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:24,830
He's no pal of mine.

692
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:27,115
He's the only one who can defuse
the bomb you stole yesterday.

693
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:27,916
The only one?

694
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,116
At countdown zero, everything goes
for eight kilometers.

695
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,713
And you of course have come to save us.

696
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:35,110
There's a code that'll stop the timer
and will save two million people or more.

697
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,111
The state sends us a brave cop to save us

698
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,112
from a nasty bomb that without
our pal here, is gonna go boom.

699
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:42,309
Great
story.

700
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,833
Thanks, Superman,
but let me be honest with you.

701
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,911
Y'see, we weren't planning on hanging
on to your bomb.

702
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,839
So, you want it back?

703
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,070
Yeah.

704
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,513
How much?

705
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,790
Taha, if I don't punch in the code
in an hour, the bomb will...

706
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,190
I know, it'll explode. So what?

707
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,191
It's no concern of mine,
as long as it's not where I live.

708
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,190
But if you don't want it to blow up
where you live,

709
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:01,951
well, like they say,
you better Cough up a little dough.

710
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,314
It'll kill millions of innocent...

711
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,995
But they shoulda thought of that before
when they made it, for example, huh?

712
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,594
So, how much?

713
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:15,070
A million... euros.

714
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,390
I have a million on my right for openers.

715
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,710
Do I hear a higher offer? K2?

716
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,430
Two million. I have a two million bid
on my left so,

717
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,509
who'll double that?

718
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:26,911
Here.

719
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,274
Nice bid, four million.

720
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,237
Four million, four million on my right.

721
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:31,753
Have you decided on a limit?

722
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,072
When y'think our lives aren't worth
the price, tell me, and I'll stop bidding.

723
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,036
Ten...

724
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:39,996
ten million on my left.

725
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,310
Good, now things are getting
a little lively.

726
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,073
Well, Blues Brothers?

727
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:45,910
Ten million.

728
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,956
There's only one of its kind.
Y'want it or not?

729
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,359
Well, since you've got no more
to fork up ten million's the price.

730
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,519
Ten million going once...

731
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,913
ten million going twice...

732
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,719
Twenty!

733
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,398
A handsome bid,
in the eleventh hour too.

734
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:07,315
K Two?

735
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,717
No, that's good. He can have it.

736
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,992
Twenty million.

737
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,270
Wrap it up.

738
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,431
Twenty million victims
that's about ten euros a head,

739
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,158
the price of a couple of burgers.

740
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:21,829
Cash or what?

741
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:22,910
Forget cash.

742
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,797
I couldn't ever get to the bank
and then bring the money back here.

743
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,154
The bomb would explode before.

744
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,229
Djamel,

745
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,356
give 'em our account number
in the Bahamas.

746
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:37,835
First, let me see the bomb.

747
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:38,557
That's funny.

748
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,996
I was sure you were gonna ask me that.
Help yourself.

749
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,478
Your bomb didn't have a launcher.

750
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,437
Lucky I always keep
some equipment around here.

751
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,795
We found a Russian
launcher we sort of modified.

752
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:54,835
Your baby's ready to go.

753
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:58,037
As for the direction, I decided to point it.
I'll let you guess.

754
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,230
Y'satisfied? You've seen your bomb.

755
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,393
Now, make the transfer.

756
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,430
You see, Leito,
I learned something from you.

757
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,512
Now it's me who's one step ahead.

758
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,950
Find me Kruger. It's urgent.

759
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:28,196
84735

760
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,475
zulu zulu fox delta charlie.

761
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:31,879
How much has to be transferred?

762
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:32,995
Twenty million euros.

763
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,476
Are you sure the bomb is there?

764
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:40,712
It's in front of me. I can even read
the 48 minutes left on the screen.

765
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,275
Captain, we don't have that kind of budget.

766
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,396
You've got to manage otherwise. I'm sorry.

767
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:55,989
Okay, I'm waiting.

768
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,599
They're making the deposit.

769
00:52:58,680 --> 00:52:59,999
Okay, thank you Colonel.

770
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,550
It's done. Twenty million euros
are in your account.

771
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,471
Now let me start on the bomb.

772
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,558
Our deal's not quite finished.

773
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:09,392
Djamel, call the Bahamas
and make sure the money's arrived.

774
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,118
That's what I'm doing.

775
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,316
The bank doesn't open
for another half an hour.

776
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,674
Let's hope it opens on time.

777
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,955
If you two don't mind,
go wait in the next room.

778
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,350
Get over there.

779
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,795
On your knees. Face the wall,
hands behind your head.

780
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,715
Yoyo, watch these two
until you hear from me.

781
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:41,430
What do we do now?

782
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,158
Hey, don't forget we did what you wanted.

783
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:45,470
If we'd have played it cool,
we wouldn't be here.

784
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,358
Yeah, and if your buddies
had paid the transfer,

785
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,429
we'd already be outta here.

786
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:49,748
Already dead, you mean.

787
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,310
You don't suppose
Taha would've let us out of here?

788
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,789
We'll never know,
since your pals refused to pay up.

789
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,911
Now at least you know
how much your life is worth.

790
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,834
Come on, To them,
I'm not worth anything at all.

791
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:07,996
Damien,

792
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,518
there's something not right
about this whole thing.

793
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:11,436
Like what?

794
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,748
Something. I dunno what.

795
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,636
They lose a bomb like we lose our keys.

796
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,233
They want to get it back,
but they won't pay.

797
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,550
Look, when it comes to blackmail,
they're very peculiar.

798
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,756
Hey super cop,
what're you, defending them?

799
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,793
No, but there are values, real values.

800
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,276
The ones I thought you defended too.

801
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,473
How much time we got?

802
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,792
37 minutes.

803
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:53,872
It wouldn't hurt to have an idea.

804
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,393
Yeah, it wouldn't, huh?

805
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:56,955
I think I got one.

806
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:59,156
Well?

807
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,152
Remember the tunnel I told you about?

808
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,275
The one that you dug?

809
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,349
That's right.

810
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:07,597
It starts in the toilet,
to the left of the elevator.

811
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,514
And Yoyo of course
is gonna let piss together.

812
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,478
No, but if we think up a good reason
to go and see Taha,

813
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:16,879
he'll take us to the elevator, huh?

814
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:21,550
Okay, and once we're at the elevator?

815
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:22,516
We improvise.

816
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:23,919
I've heard better plans, y'know.

817
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:24,989
Got another one?

818
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,350
No.

819
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,236
Then move it.

820
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:31,029
Get down right now.

821
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,519
We gotta see Taha. It's super urgent.

822
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:33,396
It is, huh?

823
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:35,312
Well for now,
you're gonna super get down

824
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,311
and super keep your mouth shut.
Got that?

825
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,033
You must be a super dickhead.

826
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,030
What's your name again?

827
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:41,075
What the fuck do you care?

828
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:44,596
It's for Taha. When he asks me whose
fault it was that he lost 20 million euros,

829
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,352
I don't wanna get the name wrong.

830
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:50,118
Listen, if you're fuckin' with me,
we're gonna have to snuff you.

831
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,316
Deal.

832
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,595
You three come with me.
The rest of you, cover us.

833
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:57,279
I wish I knew what we were doing.

834
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:58,952
Stay loose and just let it happen.

835
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,998
Get ready to go.

836
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:11,876
Now!

837
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,356
It's down there.

838
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,715
That's your way out.
Through the bowl? Great!

839
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,312
Jesus, you shoulda been a cop.
They'd've loved you.

840
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:52,991
Follow me.

841
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,514
What's goin' on down there?
What's happening?

842
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,477
Why don't y'answer when I call you?

843
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,199
We were in a tunnel.

844
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:03,918
I would like to know what the fuck
you're talkin' about.

845
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:04,989
Well, it was because
of those two assholes.

846
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:05,956
They got away through the tunnel.

847
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:09,510
We tried to catch up with them,
but then the walky talky...

848
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,591
Hold on a second.
Repeat that once more.

849
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,671
Leito and the cop, they...

850
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,110
Djamel,

851
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,031
what about the transfer?

852
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,075
We got problems, Taha.

853
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,070
He was bluffing?

854
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:33,876
Yeah.

855
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,109
I shoulda known!

856
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:37,072
You can't trust a cop. Never!

857
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:40,709
Even with a gun to his head.
But he'll pay for this, the bastard.

858
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,279
I'm gonna detonate their bomb.

859
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,156
Taha Taha,

860
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,753
I think you had better sit back down.

861
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,229
They used the Bahama account number

862
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:51,834
to move in on all of our numbered
bank accounts,

863
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,273
and they cleaned them all out.

864
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,397
What's that? All our...

865
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:57,553
Bahamas, Ryad,

866
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,200
Karachi, all of them, even London.
Nothing zero.

867
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:04,951
But how's that possible?

868
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,713
If I ever learn that I'll be king of the world.

869
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,715
In the meantime,
this dumb little accountant

870
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:12,949
is going back home.

871
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,319
Excuse me.

872
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:30,796
Hey Taha, if you're broke, then
how the fuck y'gonna pay us this week?

873
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:45,957
I got cash in the safe downstairs,
and no one's about to rip that off.

874
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,432
K Two, your piece. Hand it over.

875
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,038
K Two, give it tome, huh!

876
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:09,512
You are a bunch of fucking shitheads!

877
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,473
What do we do now, K Two?

878
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,835
First, we better find Leito and that cop.

879
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:46,999
Okay, move out everyone.

880
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:47,030
We better separate!

881
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:18,992
Outta the way! Move!

882
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,315
Police!

883
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:08,112
How long before the bomb goes off?

884
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:09,790
Ten minutes.

885
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,199
And you're sure you can defuse it?

886
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:12,793
Yeah. What's more, I'm the only one.

887
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,916
Well, you go and stop it, and...

888
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,149
and Leito stays with us.

889
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:17,514
No, I need him. He comes with me.

890
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:18,555
No can do.

891
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,392
Okay, Leito and me will stay here,
and you defuse the bomb.

892
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:21,833
How's that. You better go.

893
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:23,712
You got nine minutes.

894
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:30,359
Okay, you both go,
and I'll wait for you down below.

895
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,078
You gotta come down sooner or later, huh?

896
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,833
If I do the job, I'll bet even
you'll be glad to see a cop's face.

897
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:05,793
What the hell is that?

898
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,593
A present from Taha.

899
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,557
Let me handle this. I love presents.

900
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:02,711
Hey Mongol, y'ready now for me
to teach you a thing or two?

901
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,236
Go on.

902
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:54,998
Nice going. Where'd you learn that?

903
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:57,435
In a cookbook or a fishing manual.
I don't remember.

904
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,991
It's all over Lola. It's all over.

905
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,356
No. Sorry but it's far from over.

906
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:35,032
Fuck this man, I can't get through!

907
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:39,998
Okay, got it.

908
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:43,550
Hey, don't worry. He's an expert with cuffs.
He'll get 'em off in no time at all.

909
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:47,350
Hello.

910
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:50,238
Captain Tomasso. I'm in front of the bomb.
I need the code.

911
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:50,911
Where are you now?

912
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,434
In front of the bomb
with three minutes thirty left.

913
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:54,032
Gimme the code and we'll talk later.

914
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:55,553
Where are you? The exact spot.

915
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:59,155
On the roof of a building in Barrio 13.
Y'want a weather report as well?

916
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:01,071
Good work Tomasso.
We're all very proud of you.

917
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:02,912
Thanks, but time's running out.

918
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:04,594
9293...

919
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:06,238
929 what?

920
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:08,311
Three... seven zero nine B thirteen.

921
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,198
Seven zero nine B thirteen.
I'll call you back if I'm still alive.

922
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:21,471
B thirteen? Like Barrio Thirteen?

923
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:22,310
Yeah.

924
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,277
Doesn't it seem strange
that the bomb's code is Barrio 13?

925
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:26,351
9293, the two zones we're in.

926
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:27,509
Just coincidence.

927
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:29,709
Damien, wait. Hold on.

928
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,392
If the bomb wasn't scheduled
to come here,

929
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:33,471
why the hell does it have
the same numbers as this barrio?

930
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:35,437
Look, whatever it is, I gotta stop it, huh?

931
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:37,153
Damien, listen. What if it's the reverse?

932
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:38,150
Come on, the reverse of what?

933
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,196
You detonate the bomb
with your code instead.

934
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:41,633
Why send me then if they wanted
the fucking thing

935
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:43,676
to explode in the first place?
Explain that.

936
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,228
So it blows up right where they want
the center of Barrio 13.

937
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:47,389
Gimme the exact spot
was what your boss asked,

938
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,277
and you said Barrio 13.

939
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:50,759
Yeah, but that's a security measure.

940
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:52,068
It's a trap, Damien, I'm sure.

941
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,878
Get off my back and let me work.

942
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:02,072
I already saved your life once,
so trust me.

943
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,196
I'm a military officer with a mission.
That's what I do.

944
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:22,238
I'm sorry.

945
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:49,231
Cut this shit out Leito. In one minute
we're all gonna...

946
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:51,754
Open your eyes, Damien.
Nobody gives a shit about this barrio.

947
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,034
Twenty years
and they can't solve the problem.

948
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:56,237
They built a wall around us.
Now they're gonna clean it out for good.

949
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:59,073
How come there are no civil servants
here. No post office or school,

950
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:00,957
and just by chance,
the police station was shut down.

951
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:02,837
But the bomb was stolen, Leito.
They didn't make that up.

952
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:04,876
Oh yeah? The van was attacked
by some bad guys, right?

953
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,109
It was, yeah.

954
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:07,758
That's the story they told you, huh?

955
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:08,238
Yeah.

956
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:10,754
Then tell me why just before,
when we saw the van, it was intact.

957
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:13,308
Where were the signs of an explosion
or of a smashed in door?

958
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:14,594
Maybe it was a different one.

959
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:16,079
It was the same and you know damn well.

960
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:18,674
And once they were sure the bomb was
on the inside of Barrio 13,

961
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:21,957
and that it wasn't going anywhere,
they got their best pit-bull to set it in motion.

962
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:23,439
And you really accomplished that mission.

963
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,909
You stopped Taha from dumping it,
so it's all for us.

964
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,672
It can't be possible Leito.
Y'don't kill two million people

965
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,239
'cause you can't solve their problems.

966
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:52,232
No? They murdered six million because
none of them was blond with blue eyes.

967
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,519
Sorry Leito.

968
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:26,756
Sorry.

969
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:27,795
Don't do this, Lola!

970
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:30,553
I prefer dying for my brother's dumb ideas
than for yours.

971
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:01,515
It's over.

972
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,319
This time, it's really over.

973
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:09,388
No, it's not over.

974
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:29,836
You see? I said that even
you would be glad to see my face.

975
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:31,672
Y'got five minutes to leave here.

976
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:33,839
How about a souvenir?

977
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:36,272
Yeah, be my guest.

978
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:49,150
Thank you.

979
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:50,311
Nothing yet.

980
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,436
Jesus! It's well over an hour
that we've been waiting!

981
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:53,999
And if by tonight nothing happens,
then what?

982
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:57,356
I've no idea Corsini. For Chrissakes,
it's supposed to explode and that's that!

983
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:58,669
What's that?

984
01:11:58,760 --> 01:11:59,909
Sounds like a fight.

985
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,558
Go and have a look.

986
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:15,798
There. Mission accomplished.

987
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:16,551
Well, not quite.

988
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,870
At the last minute,
we couldn't remember the code.

989
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,109
We both tried, huh?

990
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:22,919
But it's my fault, totally.
It was me who forgot my numbers.

991
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,878
- You remembered yours, right?
- Oh yeah.

992
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:25,915
Hey, he's incredible.

993
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,195
We made an absolutely fantastic team,
you know.

994
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:30,032
And without Leito, I'd be dead now.

995
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,278
Okay, let's have it.

996
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:34,556
9293

997
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:35,709
Like the two zone numbers?

998
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:36,789
Yeah.

999
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:38,195
That's wild huh?

1000
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:39,872
A coincidence.

1001
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:43,277
Now we got seven zero nine.
Easy to remember. That's today's s date.

1002
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,590
Seven zero nine

1003
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:47,432
September 7th. End of summer vacation.

1004
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:48,476
Practical huh?

1005
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,313
A bomb explodes on the day
you know everyone's around for sure,

1006
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,470
and you get rid of all the scum in one shot.

1007
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:54,959
If I'm mistaken, stop me.

1008
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:57,430
Now then, the code...

1009
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:00,314
I think that I've got the rest of the code:

1010
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,072
B 13,

1011
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:05,436
like Barrio 13.
How could I have forgot?

1012
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:07,514
Why don't I give you the honor of finishing?

1013
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,955
Are you telling me you plan on blowing up
this bomb here in Paris?

1014
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:12,679
I'm sorry, but I thought the code
was to defuse the bomb.

1015
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:14,319
You mean that if I punch it,
it'll do the opposite?

1016
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,311
Stop playing the fool Tomasso.
You know perfectly well...

1017
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,118
No I don't. Explain it to me.
I wanna know what...

1018
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:19,599
Barrio 13 is uncontrollable.
It costs a fortune to the state,

1019
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:21,398
the taxpayers are worried... worried,
frightened

1020
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,675
and fed up paying for such scum!

1021
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:24,670
So we clean it out?

1022
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:25,590
With a bomb I guess, huh?

1023
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:27,989
Yes, it's not very democratic,
but it solves all the problems.

1024
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:29,229
Except one,

1025
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:30,309
yours, Sir.

1026
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,119
No, I beg of you, please...

1027
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:33,633
Look, why don't we clean up everything?

1028
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:34,630
You want us all killed.

1029
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:36,836
You should've thought of that first,
when you built it.

1030
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:37,909
No!

1031
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:54,756
Y'really thought
I was gonna go through with it. Why?

1032
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:57,479
For revenge? No. You don't always need
violence to solve problems.

1033
01:13:57,560 --> 01:13:59,869
There are ways much more democratic.

1034
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:02,635
Look out the window, and smile.

1035
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:07,432
Is the sound okay?

1036
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,033
What are you plotting, Tomasso?

1037
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:12,634
I'm doing my job Sir.
You know my job, don't you?

1038
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:13,948
I see that laws are obeyed
obeyed by everyone.

1039
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:18,636
I make sure that no one forgets that.
That's my job. No more, no less.

1040
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,472
Now, if you still don't understand

1041
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,956
you can see it all on network TV.

1042
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,670
<i>Barrio 13 is uncontrollable.</i>
<i>It costs a fortune to the state,</i>

1043
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:44,954

1047
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:49,997

01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:52,674

1049

1053

1054
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:05,911
<i>Except one, yours.</i>

1055
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:30,710
You sure you don't wanna stay
on this side?

1056
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,349
With the reward you'll get,
you can buy a real nice place.

1057
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:34,555
I got a nice place.

1058
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:37,395
Besides, this is where I live.
I was born here.

1059
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:39,592
Now all I want is to live here in peace?

1060
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:41,159
But you're gonna, Leito.

1061
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:43,709
They're gonna be demolishing
the wall next week.

1062
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:46,837
The police, the post office
and the schools all open next month.

1063
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:50,238
You know it's thanks to you all of that.

1064
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:51,594
You brother, are the greatest.

1065
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,398
I've been saying that for years.

1066
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:56,153
C'mon, will you smile?
You look so down.

1067
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:58,159
I hope things don't get messed up
on the way,

1068
01:15:58,240 --> 01:15:59,639
and that they keep their promises.

1069
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:02,188
Hey, these things aren't words.
They were voted on,

1070
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:04,750
and government
decrees have to be applied. It's the law.

1071
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:07,798
And there's always an asshole like me
around to see that laws are obeyed.

1072
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:11,477
Take care of yourself.

1073
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:14,279
You make it sound as
if I live in the barrio like you.

1074
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,518
Your neighborhood's
more dangerous than mine.

1075
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:17,914
I'm not so sure.

1076
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:22,195
Come and see us.

1077
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:25,315
Can't promise I...

1078
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:33,392
He'll come. Yeah.

1079
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:39,229
Hello.

1080
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:41,475
Thank you.

1081
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:45,755
Go on.
