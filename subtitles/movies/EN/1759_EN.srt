1
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,441
No6 Aragones takes the lead
over No. 5, Pasatiempo,

2
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:25,945
third is number 1 Cabalística, last
hundred meters to the finish,

3
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:31,416
6 El Aragonés leads over 5
Pasatiempo and they cross the line;

4
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,884
El Aragonés, second
No 5 Pasatiempo,

5
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:36,945
third No. 1 Cabalística, fourth
No. 4 You hey, Fifth is 2 Rítmico,

6
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:40,857
sixth is 7 and Cruz
Fierro comes in last.

7
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:44,727
El Aragonés with a time lapse of two
minutes twenty two seconds,

8
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:49,894
three fifths for the two thousand
meters, trainer José María Oji

9
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:55,874
and ridden to victory
by Lineo Leguizamo.

10
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:02,741
At this moment, he is being
congratulated and greeted,

11
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:07,149
alongside the entire presidential
committee, by the President ofthe

12
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,247
Republic, Lieutenant
Juan Domingo Perón.

13
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,821
Come on honey,
I'm tired.

14
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:18,489
You're always tired.
You're too fond of bed.

15
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,723
I'm going to see Santana.
I'll be right back.

16
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:29,664
Go for Brillosa on 5th,

17
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:32,540
La Pellegrina behind.
If he wins, you're set.

18
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:40,984
- What were the winning numbers?
- 38, I believe. Yesterday it was 86.

19
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,548
What's up with number 25?

20
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:47,320
Don't play it again.
Watch your bucks.

21
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,303
I saw your General.
She wasn't there.

22
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,573
Ok, Kiddo.

23
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:07,739
If you keep guarding him like that,
he'll be moved to the Treasury...

24
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:10,044
I said OK
If you can do better,

25
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:11,981
I'll talk to the police.
They can hire you.

26
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:15,077
Pass.
Now, ifit were Sinatra...

27
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,815
I'm going to talk to Nelly.

28
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:19,517
It would be an honor
to guard the General.

29
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,991
Yes, I'm sure...

30
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:27,498
I'm leaving. See you
tomorrow at the bureau.

31
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,466
- So long, my friend.
- See you.

32
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,695
Shall we go?

33
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,959
Lfl hadn't come to get you,
I'd still be waiting.

34
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:36,831
I told you already. I was discussing
work with Santana.

35
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:39,201
Well, What do you want to do then?

36
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,797
Nothing, take me home.

37
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:44,223
Hello?
Hello?

38
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:08,415
Here. The pervert paid,
he's grateful forthe cat.

39
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,649
He praised your professionalism...

40
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:12,156
Is that it?

41
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:16,089
Taking a cat from one poof and giving
it to another, what did you expect?

42
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:20,121
That shitty cat scratched
me all over, this sucks.

43
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,063
Anything else?

44
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:28,105
Yes, Nelly got us a
special security.

45
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,075
- If we have to guard the General,
I pass. - Don't be a trouble maker.

46
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:34,772
It's something else. The American
actress Ivonne de Carlo is arriving

47
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,407
and the police needs
more civil forces...

48
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,041
Ivonne de Carlo, who's she?

49
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:41,416
- Look.
- Oh, yes, yes...

50
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,792
A Union worker also called
for surveillance.

51
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,884
I had to turn it down.

52
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:52,294
Says they want to kidnap his son,
a dwarf called Juan Domingo.

53
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,331
You have to be a bastard
to call a kid Juan Domingo.

54
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:59,565
It's either Juan Domingo or Eva.
Depending on the sex, of course.

55
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:01,399
I didn't hear that.

56
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:08,243
- Di Sarli?
- No.

57
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,182
Don't tell me,
he's unmistakable.

58
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,480
Don't be stubborn,
it's the Fresedo Orchestra.

59
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,613
- I'll bet you five it's Di Sarli.
- If you want to lose...

60
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,691
Look, seems like they're
selling Mouriño to Boca.

61
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,629
How are you Kiddo?

62
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,993
Corvalán, for you it's Corvalan.

63
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,600
- How'd it go?
- Fine, fine.

64
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,375
Make me some coffee.

65
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:45,716
But without the poison, not
like your mother used to make.

66
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:56,920
After picking up the glass, get
yourself another job. Ok Totó?

67
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,891
My name is Sergio.

68
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:02,992
Leave that now and go
and buy some more coffee.

69
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:14,535
Each time I see him, I remember
his crazy mother, poor kid.

70
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:20,342
<i>We've just heard "Niebla del
Riachuelo"by Cobián & Cadícamo,</i>

71
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:24,287
<i>interpreted by Osvaldo
Fresedo's orchestra.</i>

72
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:28,054
- OK, I owe you five. - Don't worry,
it's all written down.

73
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:33,388
Listen. That pending matter with
the man we had to follow, remember?

74
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:36,826
The girl who's married
to Otero, the mechanic.

75
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:40,336
The bastard pays to see the face of
the guy having sex with his wife.

76
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:12,734
Hello? Hello?

77
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:22,104
<i>I will work night and day...
happy the shirtless...</i>

78
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:27,676
<i>I am with you to be
a rainbow of love...</i>

79
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:33,419
<i>I will be there night and day working
because that ishow committed I am</i>

80
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:40,056
<i>to this legion of Argentines who
is writing a brilliant page in this</i>

81
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:45,502
<i>country's history, I want my
people to know that I am ready...</i>

82
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,292
How are you dad?

83
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,158
Pretty good, considering.
And you?

84
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,424
I can't complain.

85
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,930
And your girlfriend?

86
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,366
I told you,
she's a friend.

87
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,702
- What was her name?
- Perla.

88
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:23,900
Perla, what does she do?

89
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:28,711
She teaches the piano.
Lives around the corner.

90
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:34,452
- Any news? - Looks like they're
selling Mouriño... to Boca.

91
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,283
And Lobo? How is he?

92
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,623
Yesterday I found some lumps.

93
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,292
I have to have him checked,
I'm worried.

94
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:47,624
So?

95
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:55,837
It seems a little muffled.
The FA seems a little low.

96
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,308
Good ear Kiddo.
You would have done well.

97
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:10,818
- It's not my thing.
- And what is ultimately?

98
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,092
You know, what I do.

99
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:24,795
Take it to Chicho. Tell him to
fine tune it. I'll pay him later.

100
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,268
Oh yeah? What with?

101
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:31,136
You'd be surprised at
what they still offer me.

102
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,681
Is there something
I need to know?

103
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:44,946
- Don't worry. I'm retired.
- Keep it up. No need to get upset.

104
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:05,007
Corvalán...

105
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,043
What is it?

106
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:16,918
Someone needs to talk to you.
It's confidential.

107
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:21,424
Whatever it is, I don't work at home.
Go to my office, ifl'm not there,

108
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:24,326
my partner will see you.
Here's the address.

109
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:28,161
I have the address already,
and you have my phone number.

110
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,295
Can we talk?

111
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:36,774
What do you want to talk about?

112
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:39,743
I've been told you're
good, is it true?

113
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,542
That depends. Once we followed
a man for six months and

114
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,381
the guy had been
dead forfive years.

115
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,317
I can't be more honest.

116
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:54,489
Sit down, I'm listening.

117
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:03,665
I need you to follow a man.
I want to know what he does,

118
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:07,638
where he goes, I want
photos and addresses.

119
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,233
The usual.

120
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,742
I'm willing to pay 2000
pesos for the job.

121
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:14,877
If you accept.

122
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,185
You still haven't told me
who do I have to follow.

123
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:27,022
Here's his information.

124
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:36,060
And half, in advance.

125
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,037
His name is Nicolás Perturato.

126
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,740
He was one ofthe guys
with you at the track.

127
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,745
- You have a good eye.
- It's my job.

128
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:57,253
Looks like your friend
is in a rush.

129
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,382
He's not my friend.
I have to go.

130
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:03,023
I want you to start
as soon as possible.

131
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:09,165
A chauffeur-driven Buick,
Kiddo, expensive clothes, jewels.

132
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:12,898
They must have good connections,
we have to make a good impression.

133
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,167
We may move up to the top league...

134
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,470
You let yourself be
easily impressed.

135
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,704
We can't waste an opportunity.

136
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:22,008
Jimmy three fingers started off
by buying Al Capone rubbers

137
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,072
and ended up making ten grand
for wiping out Lou Sorvino.

138
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,045
Yes but this isn't Chicago.

139
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:30,343
There are opportunities everywhere.
You gotta think bucks.

140
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,991
- I have two jewels, Kiddo.
- Let's see...

141
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:37,020
A billiard cue just like the one
Navarra used at Luna Park...

142
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:40,122
- The other?
- A Colt 38. Filed numbering.

143
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:43,191
- How much for the cue?
- Three fifty.

144
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:45,702
- No, it's too much.
- Three hundred for you.

145
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,295
- I'll tell you later.
- See you.

146
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:52,073
You know what? Tomorrow is Perla's
birthday and I can't think

147
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,941
where to take her.
Do you have any idea?

148
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,948
It's a delicate matter.
Let me think about it.

149
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:58,878
- See you.
- So long.

150
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,732
- What happened with the photos I
asked for? - I already got them.

151
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,868
- And where are they?
- I forgot to give them to you.

152
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,209
Here they are.

153
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:24,255
- Good morning. - Good morning.
- Good morning.

154
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:29,558
You know what? I bumped into Haydee
from the haberdashery. She's taken

155
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:32,160
charge ofthe Council and promised
to care for the neighborhood dogs.

156
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,903
And where do we come in?

157
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:40,368
She needs a hand. Seems like
there's a pervert on the loose.

158
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:42,011
A what?

159
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,707
A rapist.
He seems to like dogs.

160
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,914
A neighbortook her dog to the
vet's because it got aggressive

161
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:50,750
and she thought it odd.

162
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,090
And the vet told her that it
was normal in cases like this.

163
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:58,252
I don't know, maybe
it bit somebody...

164
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:03,191
Are you telling me that there's
a pervert who's into dogs?

165
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:04,826
Seems like it.

166
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,369
First the poof's cat,
now a dog rapist,

167
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,930
you're joking, aren't you?

168
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:13,806
I suppose you said no.

169
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:16,945
It's a delicate matter, but I
don't know, you have a dog.

170
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:25,052
I've been thinking about what
you said and I really have no idea.

171
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:27,622
What are you talking about?

172
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,694
Who's birthday is it today?

173
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:32,286
Perla's of course.

174
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:35,959
Just one thing, you've got some
money, don't take her

175
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:37,524
to that dump in Lujan.

176
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:41,267
That was my mother's
favorite place.

177
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,773
I take that back.

178
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:12,399
That one, with the blue eyes.

179
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,022
You never say a word,
but your quite the fiend.

180
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:22,402
Turn the light off,
it'll attract bugs.

181
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,711
You never loved anybody.

182
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:09,045
I love you, Lobo and Banfield.

183
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:13,515
In that order?

184
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,294
Depends on the day.

185
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:25,933
I'm dressing as a Hawaiian
next year at the Parade.

186
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:28,097
I can be Carnival Queen again.

187
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,535
You came in second.
Go to sleep.

188
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,601
You're a bore, Kiddo.

189
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:55,632
Tell me something...

190
00:23:56,768 --> 00:24:00,864
Some of your students
could be your lovers, right?

191
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:04,099
You don't say.

192
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:09,144
The redhead, the one
with the motorbike-

193
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,118
He's seventeen, he's a kid.

194
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:19,412
And the Japanese?
He's no kid.

195
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:24,485
His name is Hugo and
he's not Japanese.

196
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:26,053
To me he's Japanese.

197
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:31,729
Are you being serious?

198
00:29:57,328 --> 00:30:01,856
I wasn't sure whether to wait,
somebody could have been with you.

199
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:05,496
Don't worry, I account to no one.

200
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,403
I didn't think you'd be
so late getting home.

201
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:15,173
Following Perturato is not easy.
He moves around so much.

202
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,906
That's why I need you.

203
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,012
Do you have something for me?

204
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,384
The report is incomplete.
Plus, I don't have it here.

205
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:28,552
I see.

206
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:34,323
So, if you agree, my driver can
pick up whatever you have

207
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,493
- tomorrow by your office.
- Fine with me.

208
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:42,671
Now, if you told me what we were
looking for, it could be easier.

209
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:46,540
I never said it would be easy.

210
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,972
Good night.

211
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,994
There are a few photos that
still need development.

212
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:18,770
Very well.

213
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:22,942
That's all. I'll call you
ifthere's any news.

214
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:25,912
With your permission.

215
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:36,588
Isn't it odd? The chauffeur
checks her photos.

216
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,693
Maybe she asked him to.

217
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:42,528
Tell me something, that girlfriend
of yours, from the police, Nelly...

218
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,630
Could she do me a favor?

219
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:46,936
What do you need?

220
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:52,409
Info on the black De Soto.
Plate number YS170.

221
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,242
It's from Santa Fe.

222
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:58,113
Give Nelly two days and she'll
find out how many miles it has.

223
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,043
Ready, I've got them.

224
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:12,681
You're joking? There's none left.
Now you got me going.

225
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,419
Do you know how
Al Capone started?

226
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:21,529
He smuggled the first fifty bottles
ofwhisky in a coffin

227
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:22,827
at his mother's funeral.

228
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:26,236
Was the deceased inside?

229
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:28,830
No, the mother died
when he was seven.

230
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,507
But who was going to open the
coffin? It was all a decoy, get it?

231
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:35,509
Finish the game, we're closing.

232
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:38,779
Do you know if Mouriño got sold?

233
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:44,585
Mouriño is none ofmy business.
Three whiskies each, eighteen pesos.

234
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:47,353
Here, it's my round.
Give us two more.

235
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:48,915
Whiskies are drunk in twos.

236
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:53,062
- The rest you can place on 25,
to win. - Fine.

237
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:00,670
You're on the ball, Santana.

238
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:07,608
You have to read the game,
be patient, measure the shot.

239
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:10,939
As in life, you follow me?

240
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:12,714
Yes I get it.

241
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:16,519
Be alert.

242
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:21,756
There's always a sign that tells
you when it's time to hit.

243
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,358
You know what?

244
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:33,799
Something tells me that things
are going to change course.

245
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:41,638
And how does one know?

246
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,676
Good question.

247
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:49,179
Some say it's a word,
a gesture, a look.

248
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:54,986
Others say it's something
internal that sounds within.

249
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:01,231
One sign and everything changes.

250
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:04,200
No. One changes and does
what one never dare do before.

251
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,396
That's what they say.

252
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,106
Mr. Otero.

253
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:25,641
One moment...

254
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:32,453
Madam... Someone's here.

255
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:40,197
Good day.
Do you need anything?

256
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,629
Mr. Otero.

257
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,931
My husband's not here.
Can I help?

258
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:48,401
It's about a wheel.

259
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,607
Coco, he wants the boss.

260
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:56,241
He's on a tow. May be back
in an hour or so.

261
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:58,810
What is it about?

262
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:06,922
Chief, why don't you tell me
what you want?

263
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:11,924
The photos aren't great,
but there's something there.

264
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:17,330
It's what's not in them
that keeps you awake.

265
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:20,196
That's the nightmare.

266
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:25,474
Imagining he's with your woman,
kissing, touching and undressing her...

267
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,812
wanting to know if she screams
or cries when she comes

268
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,548
or if she takes it from behind.

269
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:39,018
That fucks up your life.

270
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:52,168
<i>Takes the lead over five and
six as they cross the line.</i>

271
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:56,036
<i>Number 4 wins... It paid off...</i>

272
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,200
The wind is going to change soon.

273
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:05,546
There's credit on the fifth, pays
ninety, it'll pay something.

274
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:08,312
- Are you betting?
- I don't know, we'll see.

275
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:13,246
- Did you see the lotto numbers?
- Don't tell me it was25?

276
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:15,617
I wish, it was35,
the birdie, again...

277
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,961
Before Ivonne de Carlo
there's another matter.

278
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:26,494
The cripple swindled a Czech over
some land. He took over 1000 pesos.

279
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:28,861
What do you say,
shall we take it?

280
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,264
What did you say her name was?

281
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:34,242
I didn't. Sbodova,
she's called Sbodova.

282
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:37,572
Usual terms, fees and expenses.

283
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:40,173
Plus the commission.
It's sacred.

284
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:43,015
No problem. The daughter,
Mirna, is paying.

285
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:44,645
The guy lives in an area
called La Moq,

286
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,382
We can pay him a visit tonight.

287
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,251
Fine by me.

288
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:54,924
Malas Artes is running the 7th.
Maybe we can recoup.

289
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:01,303
No offense.
You know, don't you?

290
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:11,106
Yes, there's nothing to hide.

291
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:13,577
Perla has another man.

292
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:18,317
A redhead, rides a motorbike.
One of those tough guys.

293
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:21,218
I have his address,
his affiliation.

294
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,953
You would have done the same...

295
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:28,630
I don't know.
I'm not so sure.

296
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:30,761
That's the way it is, Kiddo.

297
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:38,572
What's the matter?

298
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,582
A piece of advice. Get what you're
owed and put an end to the matter...

299
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,928
Weren't we supposed
to play in the top league?

300
00:39:58,028 --> 00:39:59,928
Yes, but it got very ugly.

301
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:03,865
The world's divided in two and
we're the good guys, remember?

302
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:11,837
BRUTAL MURDER,
MAFIA INVOLVED

303
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:44,074
Just two minutes. I had to make
up a story to be able to come.

304
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:46,466
- You want the story?
- What do you mean?

305
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:49,608
You hire me to follow a guy and
a few days later, he turns up dead.

306
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:51,205
What's this all about?

307
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:55,252
I'm not sure now, but his death had
nothing to do with the work you did.

308
00:40:57,421 --> 00:40:59,389
Tell me everything you know.

309
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,428
Have you ever been shot?

310
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:09,560
And you, have you shot anyone?

311
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:15,405
What are you proposing?

312
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,771
I want to know whether you can
protect me should the time come.

313
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:34,716
Why don't you tell me
what's going on?

314
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:38,421
The only thing I can say is that my
life's in danger

315
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:39,894
and I can't trust anyone.

316
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:43,756
Wait. I need the truth.

317
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:48,834
I'll call you.

318
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:08,919
Shouldn't you be at the funeral?

319
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,293
- Who died?
- Your friend Perturato.

320
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:16,523
I don't know him.

321
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,831
Strange. I saw them harassing
you the other day

322
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:22,872
and you gave them an
envelope with dough. Who are they?

323
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:28,338
Sometimes, it's best
not to know, Kiddo.

324
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:29,879
Now it's betterto know.

325
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:32,742
When you wanted me to find out who
wanted you out ofthe business,

326
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:35,341
- you didn't think the same.
- How many times must I hear it?

327
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:37,811
This once.

328
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:46,422
He was the Norwegian's
right hand man.

329
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:48,087
The Norwegian?

330
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:51,734
The guy who runs
the gambling and prostitution.

331
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:54,270
He's the big shot with
influence in higher circles.

332
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:59,002
He has several brothels.
Careful, kiddo, they're rough.

333
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:04,342
Are we even?

334
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:22,356
I thought you wouldn't come.

335
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,898
Better late than never.

336
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:26,630
Did you go by the office?

337
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:28,331
No. I couldn't.

338
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:29,770
There were a few calls.

339
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,702
The first, from Perla. She needs
to talk to you, call her.

340
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,768
I guess she's sorry...

341
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:36,870
Yeah, right...

342
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:40,450
The second, Otero the mechanic.
Asked ifthere was any news.

343
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:43,952
I'm on the case.

344
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:49,050
Lastly, Nelly,
about the DeSoto.

345
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:53,556
Says it's registered to
a Dino Capuano, from Rosario.

346
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:55,590
Does the name ring a bell?

347
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:59,397
Dino Capuano? No.
I have to ask Nelly a favor.

348
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:02,737
Tell her to find out everything
she can about this number.

349
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:07,137
- The brunette
- Yes.

350
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:09,909
What was the deal?

351
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,780
At this point, my head
is full of questions, Santana.

352
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:15,284
Any answers?

353
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:20,484
In an investigation, when things
seem certain, they're dodgy.

354
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:23,048
And when they're dodgy,
they're dodgy.

355
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:25,090
Is that the cripple?

356
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:28,093
- Remember the plan.
- You scare him and I'll take him

357
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:30,099
- for what he's got.
- Try to avoid violence.

358
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:33,034
Let me talk...
We get the money and run, OK?

359
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:34,593
- OK
- Come on.

360
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:50,646
Detective Santana.
What are you looking at, phony?

361
00:44:50,788 --> 00:44:53,154
We know who you are.
The Czech woman reported you.

362
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:55,006
You stole 1000 pesos with
this tale about the land.

363
00:44:55,041 --> 00:44:56,790
- Don't fool with me.
- What are you talking about?

364
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,384
- That you're a fraud.
- I'm a fraud? I want to do good,

365
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,963
be useful in this shitty life.

366
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,591
Don't fuck with me, bring the
dough. The land is in a swamp.

367
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:05,760
It's drying up.
It's a matter oftime.

368
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:08,066
You don't understand. If the upper
class cheat on the people,

369
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:10,436
where will we be then?

370
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,307
What are you talking about?

371
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:15,709
Don't you get it? I do what
the General says but doesn't do.

372
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:17,872
If Evita weren't sick, she'd do it.

373
00:45:17,948 --> 00:45:19,313
Did you mention the General?

374
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:22,511
I believed in him too. If you look
forthe money, it's not there

375
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:24,577
anymore. I gave it in church,
forthe poor.

376
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:27,146
You wash your mouth
before mentioning the General.

377
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:37,165
I thought we said no violence?

378
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:39,493
Son of a bitch,
talking like that.

379
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:42,428
When he's just given
the Union a 28%...

380
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,503
And when is it our turn?

381
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:47,037
Why don't you call
the Labor Minister?

382
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:48,908
You call him,
you're with the regime?

383
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:54,810
OK. You keep it up and one of these
days, you'll be reported to

384
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:56,546
the party and even I won't
be able to save you.

385
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:00,086
Nobody saves anyone.

386
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:03,651
Here, stop here.

387
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:11,964
Excuse me. Can you tell me
what we're doing here?

388
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:17,233
Do me a favor. Lend me 50 pesos.
I'll explain later.

389
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:20,510
I barely have 20.

390
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:23,139
Can I borrow them?

391
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:58,275
Hello Kiddo.
Can I call you that?

392
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:00,541
Nice to meet you.

393
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:02,847
This is Mirna Sbodova.

394
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,912
- From the race track.
- From the cloakroom.

395
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:10,983
I want to thank you. Arthur told me
you're waving the commission.

396
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:13,489
If he says so.

397
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:16,124
- Shall I make you something to eat?
- No. He must be tired.

398
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,758
Some other time...

399
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:20,167
- When you like.
- Thank you.

400
00:47:21,138 --> 00:47:23,163
- Take care.
- You too.

401
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:49,298
<i>Honey, are you there?</i>

402
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:56,767
<i>Want to come for dinner?
I'm making beef stew...</i>

403
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:13,416
Better. Much better.

404
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,660
Yes, much better.

405
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:23,125
- I'm costing you, kiddo.
- It's nothing, don't worry.

406
00:48:25,702 --> 00:48:30,730
Recently they spoke to me of a
Remington, five number combination.

407
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:35,701
Can you imagine that?
Like playing a Stradivarius.

408
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:39,209
Let me remind you that the last
experience wasn't too good.

409
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:41,914
If you had the courage.

410
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:45,144
- It's not about that.
- What then?

411
00:48:45,822 --> 00:48:48,814
Or would you rather
snitch all your life?

412
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:55,629
I'm not going that way again.

413
00:48:58,669 --> 00:48:59,727
It's getting late.

414
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:09,377
Nelly's been making inquiries.
Shall I tell you?

415
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:11,407
Please do.

416
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:14,941
Phone: 544894.

417
00:49:15,018 --> 00:49:18,977
Address: Federico Lacroze 1612.
Capital.

418
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:23,117
Property of Thomas Albrechtsen.

419
00:49:23,193 --> 00:49:30,793
Metal industry.
Alias the Norwegian. Follow me?

420
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:37,931
This man's been married 15 years.

421
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:40,306
To Gloria Ravel.

422
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:43,673
Age 30. Only child.

423
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:51,016
The Norwegian was partner to a
Sicilian, Vittorio Capuano in

424
00:49:51,088 --> 00:49:54,353
business associated with kidnapping
and extortion in Rosario.

425
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:56,984
One day, the partnership went
rotten and Capuano's tugs

426
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,119
disappeared one by one.

427
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:07,830
In the end, it seems the Sicilian,
his wife and family vanished...

428
00:50:07,904 --> 00:50:09,565
That's what they thought.

429
00:50:10,474 --> 00:50:14,968
In fact, someone
survived the massacre.

430
00:50:16,113 --> 00:50:19,708
Dino Capuano, the youngest son.

431
00:50:21,284 --> 00:50:23,377
That was ten years ago.

432
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:28,855
After that, the Norwegian came
here, an honorable businessman,

433
00:50:28,925 --> 00:50:31,416
pays his taxes,
makes donations to the Church.

434
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:36,288
And here's the best part: Every so
often, a body appears,

435
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,197
strangled with wire.

436
00:50:39,803 --> 00:50:41,737
That's his mark.

437
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:07,160
Capuano's son bought Perturato.

438
00:51:08,331 --> 00:51:12,131
The Norwegian found out,
that's why he was wiped.

439
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:20,738
Forget that woman.
She has a bad tune.

440
00:51:32,322 --> 00:51:34,085
Agency...

441
00:51:36,993 --> 00:51:38,358
Yes, I'll put you through...

442
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:47,102
<i>Laura, as usual,
is sad and gloomy.</i>

443
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:49,832
<i>I thought a love like mine
would triumph,</i>

444
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:54,366
<i>I've waited so patiently...
It's useless.</i>

445
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,912
<i>We've been married for a year.</i>

446
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:01,280
<i>Marriage is not for one year, two
or three, it's for all your life.</i>

447
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:03,581
<i>Believe me, I'm old...</i>

448
00:52:03,653 --> 00:52:05,484
I know who killed Perturato.

449
00:52:06,156 --> 00:52:07,987
We all knowthat.

450
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:11,393
Tomas Albrechtsen, the Norwegian,
killed him.

451
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:13,691
Alias, your housband.

452
00:52:15,031 --> 00:52:17,625
I dislike playing the fool.

453
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:21,127
- It wasn't deliberate.
- What was it then?

454
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:23,798
You have me follow Perturato.
I hand you a report.

455
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:26,138
2 days later, he's dead,
wrapped up in barbed wire.

456
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:28,776
There are things you don't know.

457
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:33,210
I'll tell you what I know.
You can fill in the gaps.

458
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:37,643
10 years ago, your husband
killed the Capuano family.

459
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:39,586
One of them escaped.

460
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:42,523
It seems he came back to settle
the score but he needed someone

461
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:44,856
to tell him the Norwegian's
movements.

462
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,131
That's where Perturato fits in.

463
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:51,167
He must have made a slip and
your husband became suspicious.

464
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:55,931
That's where I come in.
Your husband got you to hire me.

465
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:59,399
He doesn't need to hire anyone
to have one ofhis men followed.

466
00:52:59,476 --> 00:53:02,843
But you do.
You did your job very well.

467
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:07,144
You found the snitch and handed
it to him on a platter.

468
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:13,145
Why don't you make an effort and
try to be honest for once.

469
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:18,217
It was him or me.

470
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:24,725
Thomas was waiting for
Capuano's revenge for years.

471
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:28,662
He felt someone would betray him.
He suspected everyone.

472
00:53:29,072 --> 00:53:31,006
Including me.

473
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:35,374
I was afraid. Ifl didn't find
the traitor,

474
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:38,110
I was afraid he'd kill me.

475
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:43,113
You? Why?

476
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:48,550
Because he knows I hate him.

477
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:56,661
My mother died when I was 15,
after a long illness

478
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:59,702
and my family was full of debts.

479
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:07,009
That's when Tomas appeared.
My father thought it was the best.

480
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,477
Thomas was a rich man,
I'd be well looked after.

481
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:18,584
But the Norwegian longed for a son
and I never gave him one.

482
00:54:20,156 --> 00:54:22,624
That's why he despises me.

483
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:27,126
Now I'm in the middle
ofthis revenge.

484
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:29,422
Alone.

485
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:35,327
No one cares about me.

486
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:40,071
Please don't abandon me.

487
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:45,013
Stay with me.

488
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:05,892
Go home and wait for me there.

489
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:09,400
There's something
I still have to do.

490
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:14,639
I'll call you.
I give you my word.

491
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:57,813
Yes, don't tell me,
it got late again.

492
00:55:57,887 --> 00:56:01,880
Yes, I'm sorry. I came to tell you
not to count on me. I've got to go.

493
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:03,516
Why? What happened?

494
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:06,357
The situation is worse
than we thought.

495
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:07,987
They left here alone.

496
00:56:08,064 --> 00:56:10,191
I promised I wouldn't abandon her,
and I wanted you to know.

497
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:15,364
You're not seeing clearly.
You're confusing matters.

498
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:17,372
Maybe, but I've made my decision.

499
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,204
Then, you're making
the wrong decision.

500
00:56:20,276 --> 00:56:24,576
This is an important job.
You're not being professional.

501
00:56:25,615 --> 00:56:28,015
I found Otero's report at
the office and I'm still trying

502
00:56:28,084 --> 00:56:31,520
- to understand why you lied to me.
- It's all just gossip, Santana.

503
00:56:32,288 --> 00:56:36,748
Just another cuckold, 30 idiots
chasing a whore. Don't you see?

504
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:41,620
Yes... I see...

505
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:45,830
I see these are jobs that feed us.
And, if you don't agree,

506
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:48,564
It's the end of the road for us.

507
00:56:49,873 --> 00:56:51,465
No hard feelings.

508
00:56:52,342 --> 00:56:54,435
Whatever you say.

509
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:06,291
I went to pick up the photos from
the optician's. There are only 15.

510
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:09,031
- Want to see them?
- Not now Toto.

511
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:10,697
Sergio.

512
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:14,402
A certain Gloria called.
She said not to look for her,

513
01:00:14,477 --> 01:00:18,971
There was trouble at F. Lacroze
and she had to move somewhere safe.

514
01:00:22,518 --> 01:00:25,749
Santana looked worried.
He was looking for you.

515
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:32,022
- Where is he?
- At the bridge.

516
01:01:25,948 --> 01:01:27,916
Has she died?

517
01:01:27,984 --> 01:01:33,616
No, that's why we're here.
To pray for her quick recovery.

518
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:37,419
Poorwoman. She weighs 40 kilos and
they won't let her die in peace.

519
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:46,899
I heard on the radio they killed a
couple ofthe Norwegian's bodyguards

520
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:50,234
- They machine gunned them down.
- There were 4 of them.

521
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:52,664
You were there?

522
01:01:57,647 --> 01:01:59,171
You're mad.

523
01:01:59,816 --> 01:02:01,784
You've got the hots for a woman
who made you believe

524
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:03,785
you could win the race.

525
01:02:03,853 --> 01:02:07,289
I thought about what
you said before. You're right.

526
01:02:08,157 --> 01:02:11,092
You handle this job better than me.
I'm dead weight for you.

527
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:13,424
Don't talk nonsense,
we're partners.

528
01:02:14,163 --> 01:02:18,293
- It was an outburst.
- You don't need me, I can see that

529
01:02:18,534 --> 01:02:20,866
You're going to leave
now Sinatra's coming?

530
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:25,368
- It's confirmed.
- Not even ifthe Pope comes.

531
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:28,541
The agency is your world,
Santana, not mine.

532
01:02:28,611 --> 01:02:30,579
Think it over. Don't make
any brash decisions.

533
01:02:32,815 --> 01:02:36,649
I need to ask a favor. Ifl need
to hide away for a while...

534
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:41,246
I'm concerned about Lobo.
Please drop by to feed him.

535
01:02:43,793 --> 01:02:46,261
You can count on that.

536
01:03:58,401 --> 01:04:00,699
You can't come through.

537
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:05,038
You can't come through.

538
01:04:29,932 --> 01:04:32,730
- Do you know ifthere was a woman?
- No, I don't.

539
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:27,346
Back again, Kiddo.
Has anything happened?

540
01:05:30,526 --> 01:05:32,391
Can I help you?

541
01:05:38,901 --> 01:05:41,267
I don't think so, dad.

542
01:05:46,008 --> 01:05:48,875
- Do they treat you well here?
- Like a king.

543
01:05:49,912 --> 01:05:52,506
I owe you that.

544
01:05:54,884 --> 01:05:59,753
<i>...The Department of Information.
The doctors treating The First Lady</i>

545
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:02,985
<i>informed us this evening
that, at 1900 hours...</i>

546
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:07,519
<i>...that the state of her health
is serious...</i>

547
01:06:07,596 --> 01:06:11,293
<i>...having lost consciousness...</i>

548
01:08:33,976 --> 01:08:37,776
- I didn't know where to go.
So I came here. - They were here.

549
01:08:39,014 --> 01:08:40,811
They're looking for us.

550
01:08:46,922 --> 01:08:48,856
I'm sorry.

551
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:53,821
No one forced me to do anything.

552
01:08:58,534 --> 01:09:04,063
We can't stay here. They'll be
back. I'm sure ofit. Let's go.

553
01:09:36,438 --> 01:09:38,338
Where are we going?

554
01:09:38,407 --> 01:09:40,568
I know a place where
we can spend the night.

555
01:09:42,745 --> 01:09:44,508
And then?

556
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:50,475
I don't know.
If you have any ideas, tell me.

557
01:10:00,896 --> 01:10:03,763
Thomas had a lot
ofmoney stacked away.

558
01:10:09,338 --> 01:10:11,772
Enough to disappear.

559
01:10:14,643 --> 01:10:18,044
- Isn't it enough to be alive?
- No.

560
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:22,576
It's not enough.

561
01:11:26,382 --> 01:11:30,682
You can have the bed. It's pretty
comfortable. I'll sleep on the sofa.

562
01:11:35,324 --> 01:11:37,019
Do you come here often?

563
01:11:38,327 --> 01:11:40,318
Not anymore.

564
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:45,930
I don't know a thing about you.
Were you married?

565
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:04,578
You should eat something.

566
01:12:12,061 --> 01:12:14,359
We're both afraid
ofmaking a mistake.

567
01:12:15,197 --> 01:12:18,030
The difference is
I'm prepared to take a risk.

568
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:30,044
- Why should I take a risk?
- For a fortune, in cash.

569
01:12:30,946 --> 01:12:34,939
That's what the Norwegian keeps
in the safe at Federico Lacroze.

570
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:41,554
All we need is someone to open it.

571
01:13:05,247 --> 01:13:07,875
That's not so easy.

572
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:11,984
Lfwe don't take it the police will
when they go to search the house.

573
01:13:16,825 --> 01:13:18,986
Half of it could be yours.

574
01:13:24,032 --> 01:13:27,058
To what do I owe
so much generosity?

575
01:13:28,604 --> 01:13:31,232
What do you think?

576
01:18:11,219 --> 01:18:13,084
Corvalán!

577
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:16,821
Quick, get in!

578
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:37,368
- I owe you one. - Don't worry,
it's all written down.

579
01:18:38,613 --> 01:18:40,240
Are you ok?

580
01:18:45,053 --> 01:18:50,457
I heard about the massacre in the
depot. They killed the Norwegian.

581
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:58,758
They killed them all.
They went to my place too.

582
01:18:59,801 --> 01:19:03,567
I know,
I'm sorry about Lobo.

583
01:19:06,441 --> 01:19:09,933
- How did you find me?
- I know your habits.

584
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:17,649
Thank you, Sergio.

585
01:19:25,627 --> 01:19:29,927
Here. Tejedor 311. You can stay
for a few days. Safer than this...

586
01:19:29,998 --> 01:19:33,365
- Alcatraz.
- I don't want to get you involved.

587
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:37,738
Could you lend me the car?

588
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:41,140
The car's yours.

589
01:19:47,282 --> 01:19:50,149
I'll disappear for a while,
let things cool down.

590
01:19:53,188 --> 01:19:56,555
Call me in a few days,
I'll tell you how it's going.

591
01:19:56,792 --> 01:20:00,728
- Go on, don't waste time.
- Give me a cigarette.

592
01:20:03,064 --> 01:20:07,433
- I've only got one left.
- Thanks.

593
01:20:33,962 --> 01:20:35,896
It's our big chance.

594
01:20:38,767 --> 01:20:44,637
Tomorrow we could be far away
from here and forget all this.

595
01:20:51,613 --> 01:20:56,778
I have the key,
but not the combination.

596
01:24:55,857 --> 01:24:57,256
Don't even think about it.

597
01:25:00,095 --> 01:25:01,653
Turn around.

598
01:25:12,474 --> 01:25:16,376
Don't make any strange movements.
With your left hand, pull out

599
01:25:16,444 --> 01:25:18,708
your gun, and put it
on the floor.

600
01:25:21,316 --> 01:25:23,147
Easy, slowly.

601
01:25:25,019 --> 01:25:26,884
Put it down.

602
01:25:33,661 --> 01:25:35,561
Kick it over here.

603
01:25:40,468 --> 01:25:42,902
Put it all in the bag.

604
01:25:47,008 --> 01:25:51,502
It's incredible, she always gets
someone to do the dirty work.

605
01:25:53,348 --> 01:25:55,873
How much did she offer?
Half?

606
01:26:02,524 --> 01:26:06,187
When was it,
before or after?

607
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:13,931
She's good.
Got to give herthat.

608
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:19,807
- Did she tell you?
- She didn't have to.

609
01:26:21,442 --> 01:26:23,842
This is the end of the line.

610
01:26:26,614 --> 01:26:28,946
This is where we all get off.

611
01:26:38,593 --> 01:26:40,356
So this is it.

612
01:26:41,229 --> 01:26:44,790
You're not so dumb after all.

613
01:26:45,366 --> 01:26:47,266
Throw overthe bag.

614
01:26:52,807 --> 01:26:54,001
Bye Corvalán.

615
01:29:20,088 --> 01:29:27,153
<i>It's my duty to inform the people
