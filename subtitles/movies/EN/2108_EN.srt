1
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,200
<i>Excited and anxious I await my dream</i>

2
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,000
<i>To escape, applaud And embrace my team</i>

3
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,800
<i>Opening day I always can trust</i>

4
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,520
<i>It's just for this
high That I crazily lust</i>

5
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,800
<i>Return of our hero
Does brighten the days</i>

6
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,240
<i>Just briefly, my troubles
Get lost in the haze</i>

7
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,600
<i>The grace from the
field Arouses the crowd</i>

8
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,080
<i>Reflects on the days
When I was quite proud</i>

9
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,120
<i>I'm more entranced Than the average fan</i>

10
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,960
<i>I used to play, you see
And I know I still can</i>

11
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,960
<i>That time I drove the
ball With such loft</i>

12
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,640
<i>My exit atop shoulders
As they carried me off</i>

13
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,200
<i>This pastime and I Just fade into one</i>

14
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,040
<i>Expanded upon From father and son</i>

15
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,720
<i>My boy is young And awkward for now</i>

16
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,240
<i>I just need the time
And can show him how</i>

17
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,480
<i>I really am quite
close Just a break away</i>

18
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,040
<i>From straightening
things out And being okay</i>

19
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,400
<i>I can help my team To regain its glory</i>

20
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,600
<i>With just a little twist
To the same old story</i>

21
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,440
<i>Players say now They play for themselves</i>

22
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,680
<i>This causes a burning
Within me that dwells</i>

23
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,040
<i>The fan is the one Who pays for the game</i>

24
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,160
<i>Which bestows all the
riches And welcomed fame</i>

25
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,520
<i>The players will listen
But really don't hear</i>

26
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,680
<i>All the while just hiding
Behind an invisible tear</i>

27
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,000
<i>I grow tired now of all this greed</i>

28
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,840
<i>And chart a course to set things free</i>

29
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,280
<i>We got our first caller.
Is that Gil on the cellular?</i>

30
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,200
Yes, sir, it sure is.

31
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,320
- What's that I hear in the background?
- That's my Giants watch.

32
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,920
- I'm late for work.
- Giants watch, great.

33
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,480
- What do you got for us, Gil?
- It's just I'm really psyched.

34
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,960
Opening day's tomorrow.
We're all psyched.

35
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,320
This is different. I've been
waiting a long time for this one.

36
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,320
<i>- What are you waiting for?
- Bobby Rayburn. We got him.</i>

37
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,040
- We're going all the way this year.
- What would you bet on that?

38
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,640
- I'd bet everything I own, that's for sure.
- I like this guy. You think Rayburn's...

39
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,000
- ...worth the 40 mil, huh?
- .310 lifetime batting average.

40
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,320
He's worth twice that, three times that.

41
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,720
<i>I bet he'd love to hear you say that.
Let's see if we can get him on the line.</i>

42
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,360
- You're gonna get him on the line?
- "Yes. Hang on. Let's find Bobby."

43
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,520
When we come back, we will
be talking to Bobby Rayburn.

44
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,040
Great.

45
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,680
You got Bobby Rayburn on the line yet?

46
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,160
Who the fuck does this guy think he is?

47
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,800
- Three- time National League MVP?
- That allows him to fuck up my show?

48
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,480
- "Hello, I got Rayburn on the line."
- We got him!

49
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,400
<i>And go.</i>

50
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,160
Welcome back, we're here with the
hopes and dreams of all Giants fans.

51
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,320
Ex-Brave centre fielder
and league RBI champ...

52
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,320
<i>... four of the last five years,
local boy come home, Bobby Rayburn.</i>

53
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,520
<i>- How you doing, Bobby?
- Hey, Jewel, how you doing?</i>

54
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,960
Good to be talking to you. I want
to tell you, I love your show.

55
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,560
- Thanks a lot.
- Bobby, this is Bernie...

56
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,440
A lot of fans are on the
line dying to talk to you.

57
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,600
But first, how does it feel
to be back in the Bay Area?

58
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,920
I'm telling you, it's great. I grew
up here. The Giants are my homies.

59
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,600
That's good to hear.
But let me ask you this:

60
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,560
<i>You're famous for your
dedication to perfection.</i>

61
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,160
You're one of the
hardest-working players.

62
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,760
Don't forget "good-looking."

63
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,680
But come on, now. Bobby, baby...

64
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,160
...do you honestly think you
are worth 40 million simoleons?

65
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,840
He's one of the best
ballplayers in the league.

66
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,040
I'm glad you asked me. I don't like
to put a money value on a human being.

67
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,160
But I think I have given 100 percent
to every franchise I've played with.

68
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,920
Attaway, Bobby!

69
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,720
Thank you for not answering.

70
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,600
- Better retreat.
- She's a riot.

71
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,000
What about the fans? Won't all
this money raise their expectations?

72
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,000
I hope so. I consider myself a
baseball fan first and a player second.

73
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,080
<i>And in the game of baseball,
it's all about the fans.</i>

74
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,720
- You tell them, Bob.
- And the Juan Primo controversy?

75
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,840
Giants centre fielder since 1990.

76
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,000
<i>You come in, bump him to the
left. Some people resent that.</i>

77
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,760
- Bitch!
- I don't think Primo's one of them.

78
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,600
You know, he's a team player.

79
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,840
That makes him great. I look
forward to playing with him.

80
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,000
That's great, Bobby. Let's
get back to our callers. Gil?

81
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,560
- Yeah, am...? Am I on the air?
- Yes, you are, Gil.

82
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,720
Jewel, why do you
have to be so negative?

83
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,040
<i>Come on, I'm a sweetheart.</i>

84
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,040
The guy's making a lot of
money. Would you turn it down?

85
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,840
You'd be nuts to turn them down.

86
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,240
Why be down on Rayburn
because he's not nuts?

87
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,960
You got a point. I apologize.

88
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,760
- "Hey, Bobby, are you listening to me?"
- I sure am!

89
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,120
- Thanks for backing me up, man.
- No problem. It's a pleasure.

90
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,320
Just remember where you heard it first.

91
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,280
I played the game. I know
what I'm talking about.

92
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,920
Grew up on the Giants.

93
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,880
My dad moved the family here
when the Giants moved here.

94
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,760
I watched you ever since
you hit the grand slam...

95
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,560
...against South Bay in
the '82 city championship.

96
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,440
That's when I saw you were somebody
special, and you never let me down.

97
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,680
When the two of you come
together, Rayburn and the Giants...

98
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,520
...that's like a magical conjunction,
like the alignment of the planets.

99
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,600
You're gonna bring us all
the way. Who said it first?

100
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,120
You did, Gil! You did!

101
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,000
- Attaway, Bobby!
- We hope so.

102
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,000
- Bobby, let's talk about your divorce.
- Christ, look.

103
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,920
I just got to the ballpark. I'm
really sorry, but I gotta go.

104
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,960
- Really enjoyed talking to you.
- Anytime, Bobby. Good luckout there.

105
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,560
We will be right back.

106
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,160
- I am so surprised he hung up.
- Thank you.

107
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,760
Giants haven't had a one-two punch
like this since Mays and McCovey.

108
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,720
Joining the list of bullshit excuses...

109
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,800
...we've had a lot of whining...

110
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,640
...about product quality from
certain members of our sales force.

111
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,720
Example: The lwo Jima line.

112
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,120
Gil, do you see any
quality problems there?

113
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,640
Blade's too thin, pommel's too light,
and there's a half tang hidden in there.

114
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,240
Maybe that's why you're not selling.

115
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,960
Sweet.

116
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,080
Somebody made a mistake,
man. I wear number 11.

117
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,040
- I'm sorry. I didn't know.
- It's cool. Manny, just handle it.

118
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,320
Me? I think this knife's an asskicker.

119
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,400
This door, on the other
hand, comes off a foreign car.

120
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,440
Well, need I say more?

121
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,120
- Why are you guys still here?
- There's been a glitch, okay?

122
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,240
- I'm working on it.
- What's a "glitch"?

123
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,880
A detail that hasn't been worked
out. Permutation that happens in...

124
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,800
What? With my number?

125
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,200
- Yeah, with your number.
- No, no, no.

126
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,200
Manny, you know I wear number 11.

127
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,800
- Of course.
- So there shouldn't be any problem.

128
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,480
It is a problem. Primo wears 11.

129
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,080
Tickets in yet?

130
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,680
Tickets? What tickets?

131
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,640
- Opening day.
- You got other things to worry about.

132
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,520
I'll let you in on a little secret, Gil.
You came this close to kissing pavement.

133
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,640
- How about that close?
- Yeah.

134
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,000
Management had you on the
list. I talked them out of it.

135
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,920
Don't make me regret it.

136
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,160
- Thanks, master.
- Okay, fuck it.

137
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,840
I'm not playing with
number 33. You understand?

138
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,360
I know. Just be cool.
Let me take care of it.

139
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,320
Three times 11 is 33. You may play three
- times better.

140
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,440
Thanks. I'll talk to you in a minute.

141
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,520
Jesus was 33 when he died.
People still talk about him.

142
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,000
- Give me my number.
- Think about it, seriously.

143
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,800
Should I fire him?

144
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,280
I should fire him, huh?
I should fire his butt.

145
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,920
Good form.

146
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,600
Seriously. I promised
those tickets to my clients.

147
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,000
Don't make me look
like an asshole. Please.

148
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,880
- I do have a reputation to uphold.
- A reputa...

149
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,640
Jesus-fucking"..."

150
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,160
Nobody cares. You're stuck in a
time warp with your head up your ass.

151
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:11,160
- Why, because I don't wanna sell crap?
- We are not dedicated to perfection!

152
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,120
People don't want quality.
They want cheap product.

153
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,440
When that fucks up, they want to
replace it, so that's what we give them.

154
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,520
You got till the end of the month, Gil.

155
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,400
Look...

156
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,320
...McKinley and Everest is our biggest
account. You better close on it.

157
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,040
Bring in the fucking numbers.

158
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,400
Asshole.

159
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,240
Sid, what was the missing link
on your ball club last season?

160
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,640
We'd have made the playoffs if Rayburn
hadn't hit that three-run shot in Atlanta.

161
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,480
Everybody said, "Why don't we have
a slugger like that?" Now we do.

162
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,840
- Bobby, a picture?
- Why don't we take one with Primo.

163
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,400
- Sounds good.
- Keep smiling.

164
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,320
Keep fucking smiling.

165
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,400
- I hope you like it in centre field.
- Yeah, I hope you like it in left.

166
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,840
No more questions.

167
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,600
2.5 million signing bonus. Half
this year and half the next. Yeah.

168
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,720
Well, well, if it isn't Jewel, my
favourite token female sports reporter.

169
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,080
- Blow me, Manny.
- I would, but you haven't had your shots.

170
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,040
There were also bonuses
based on winning the MVP...

171
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,360
I want an interview with Rayburn, Manny.

172
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,800
Are we talking about "the
overpaid, overrated SOB...

173
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,920
...with the pending divorce Rayburn?

174
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,640
- I call them as I see them.
- Well, you've been crossed off the list.

175
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,840
- I knew you'd understand.
- Deferred payments starting 2007.

176
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:53,280
Cut the crap. Are you saying there's
no way to get your boy to talk to me?

177
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,080
Is that what you're saying?
He's gotta talk to me.

178
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,920
I'm saying he'd rather nail
his penis to a burning building.

179
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,920
- I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to her.
- Ouch.

180
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,840
Checkout this puppy.

181
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,960
The walk and the talk.

182
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,760
How's it walk? How's it
talk? This is the one.

183
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,400
Are you happy with
your current supplier?

184
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,080
Any more of these demonstrations,
I'll have to start shaving my legs.

185
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,200
Renard & Garrity hunting supplies.

186
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,120
The big motherfucker, the little
motherfucker. Which do you want?

187
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,360
Any more demos, I'll have to
start shaving the hairs on my ass.

188
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,480
As you can see, the performance
on this baby is really something.

189
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,560
"Knife doing business.

190
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,120
Come on, bring it, baby. Bring it.

191
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,960
- Jesus Christ.
- Poetry in motion, baby.

192
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,800
- Two behind home plate?
- I'm your man.

193
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,320
Two hundred dollars each.

194
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,440
- Two hundred apiece?
- Two hundred.

195
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:16,440
- That's a lot. How about 125?
- Fuck 125. This is opening day here.

196
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,360
- Two hundred, goddamn it. Jesus.
- Okay, okay, okay.

197
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,400
Now you want the tickets, huh?

198
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,680
Anytime I can do you more fucking
favours, you just let me know, all right?

199
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,200
You in a coma or what, buddy?
Get the fuckout of here.

200
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,560
- Know what bugs me about you guys?
- Like I care.

201
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,600
You don't even care about the game.

202
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,560
You ebony god, you prince of darkness,
you Othellian Moor, you black man!

203
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,120
You look good out there! You look
good. I bet we hit.400 this year.

204
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,960
- Come on, don't jinx me.
- I'm sorry, man. I get emotional, crazy.

205
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,040
All right, so tell me, what we got?

206
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,160
Spalding wants you to sign their balls.
We got that Wish Upon a Star routine:

207
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,480
Sick kid wants to shake hands with
great ballplayer. You'll have to do.

208
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,960
What do you think? Maybe I should
bring a ball for the sick kid.

209
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,840
No, I think a bat would be much nicer.

210
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,720
All right, here. Give him a bat.

211
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,040
You know it's not a good time for this.

212
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,120
- What's the gentleman's name again?
- His name's Stanley. Stanley Jackson.

213
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,200
Thank you, Michelle.

214
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,560
Stanley, Gil Renard. Renard
& Garrity hunting supplies.

215
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,760
- How do you do?
- How you doing?

216
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,680
Here's my card.

217
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,040
Are you happy with
your current supplier?

218
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,720
- I sure am.
- Well, then let me just...

219
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,440
If you could give me three minutes
of your time, I will prove to you...

220
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,040
- Can I demonstrate?
- Sure.

221
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,960
If I can just prove to you...

222
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:59,160
...we're superior in quality because of
our fit, hand-sharpening, polishing...

223
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,800
...and strength.

224
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,360
These features, combined with our
low prices, our superior terms...

225
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,600
...make us one of the most
sought-after competitors around.

226
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,960
- That's why I'd...
- We signed an exclusive with Gerber.

227
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,960
They got the whole chain sewed up.

228
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,240
We can't pass wind in a tent
without going through them.

229
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,960
Sorry to hear that.

230
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,840
- Do you have the Little Pecker?
- Yes, I do.

231
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,640
- You really are on the cutting edge.
- Yeah.

232
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,040
I'm sorry we can't do business.

233
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,320
Well, you're sure I can't
interest you in this?

234
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,920
You got any kayaks?

235
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,040
You gotta be out of your mind. Kayaks?

236
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,640
I could use kayaks.

237
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:51,040
Stanley, what the fuck do
kayaks have to do with knives?

238
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,840
Never mind.

239
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,400
You fucking asshole. Kayaks?
When I'm asking you about knives?

240
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,080
Yeah. I understand, sir.
Thank you for coming in.

241
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,200
How about you get some kayaks and
stick them up your fucking ass, moron.

242
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,240
Your stopwatch.

243
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,920
Hey, thanks a lot for
coming. Nice to meet you.

244
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,880
Look. We got the same hairdo.

245
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,240
You sick too?

246
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,400
Hey, slugger, come on, shake his hand.

247
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,680
How you doing, man? You hanging
in there? What's your name?

248
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,880
Sean.

249
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,920
Sean?

250
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,200
Sean.

251
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,240
Wow, what a coincidence.
That's my son's name too.

252
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,360
Look, I have a present for you.

253
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,480
There you go.

254
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,560
Maybe it'll make you feel better.

255
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,560
Bobby Rayburn.

256
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,320
Tomorrow...

257
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,160
...hit a home run for me.

258
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:06,040
- Please?
- I'll try.

259
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,640
They said "sick," not "dying in
front of our eyes." How'd I know?

260
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,960
As if I don't have enough to worry
about. I get a poor kid on his deathbed.

261
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,880
- Oh, please.
- The kid was dying!

262
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,240
He has my son's name. I mean,
what kind of shit is that?

263
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,120
Lucky tie, lucky guy.

264
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,120
McKinley
- Everest.

265
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,240
Okay, thank you.

266
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,920
Hi.

267
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,440
- Angie, you're looking as lovely as ever.
- He's gone.

268
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,560
- We had an appointment at 4.
- Yeah, it's 4:11.

269
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,400
My watch is slow, I guess.
When will he be back?

270
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,640
He's gone for the day. But you
can see him tomorrow at 2:30.

271
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,400
Oh, tomorrow, tomorrow"..."

272
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,400
Let's s"ee."

273
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,200
See if there's anything...

274
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,080
I would prefer the morning.

275
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,200
But how about late in the day?

276
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,480
I'm sorry.

277
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,360
Tomorrow at 3, he's off
to Chicago for three weeks.

278
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,160
Well, that's a problem.

279
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,120
It's my son. I want to
take him to opening day.

280
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,560
You know, myself as a
father, I'm a real cutup.

281
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,600
I'm gonna get to the point.

282
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,560
I'm trying to be a hero to my son...

283
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,880
...so if he could make it any other
time, it would really, really help me.

284
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,200
Just an hour later...

285
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,920
...so I could fit the game in.

286
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,920
- Excuse me. McKinley- Everest.
- Any other time at all? Anything?

287
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,720
- Okay, thank you.
- It would be a big help to me.

288
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,240
Like, an hour later.

289
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,880
I'm afraid I really can't help
you. He's got such a crazy schedule.

290
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,400
Okey
- dokey.

291
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,520
Drop your cock and grab your
socks. Big day today. You excited?

292
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,440
Yeah, I'm up.

293
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,880
Manny, Manny, talk to
me, man. Make me happy.

294
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,600
Wish I could. I just
talked to Primo's people.

295
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,160
- They want 500 grand.
- Five hundred? For what?

296
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,120
Exactly. Exactly.
That's 250 G's a digit.

297
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,600
Man, come on! What is this boy smoking?

298
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,520
I tried to haggle them down. The
kid says it's his lucky number.

299
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,560
Shit. Ain't that much luck in the
world. He's lucky to be in the country.

300
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,040
I hear you. Look, it's your call.

301
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,840
You want me to go back,
or are you happy with 33?

302
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,440
- Man, it's just a number, right?
- That's right.

303
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,280
I'll pick you up. While
you do her, thinkof me.

304
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,880
<i>- That's a real short thought.
- I love you too.</i>

305
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,200
<i>- No, you don't.
- I'll catch you later.</i>

306
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,200
Yeah.

307
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,120
Hey, Gil.

308
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,600
Hey, Ted.

309
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,280
Lose your job?

310
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,560
- It's my day off. And it's "Tim."
- Tim. Sorry.

311
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,120
- You remember Mike and Linda?
- Hey, Gil.

312
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,160
- Hi, Gil.
- Hi.

313
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,080
- You're late. What a surprise.
- Traffic. You know, traffic?

314
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,480
How original.

315
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,880
- Hi, Dad.
- How you doing?

316
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,560
- Good.
- Ready for the game?

317
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,320
- What time will he be home?
- Depends on the game. Right, slugger?

318
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,680
6:05. He's not home, I call the cops.

319
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,120
I'm against this. I wanna
make that real clear to you.

320
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,360
- He's my kid too.
- Yeah?

321
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,160
Give me kisses. I love you.

322
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,200
- Bye.
- For the record, so everybody knows...

323
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,760
...don't make him do
things he doesn't want to.

324
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,840
I don't. Do I make you do
things you don't want to do?

325
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,040
- No.
- Okay?

326
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,040
Six o'clock, Gil.

327
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,240
Hey, Ted.

328
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,880
See you.

329
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,440
I remember when Mick
recorded this, February '78.

330
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,760
What?

331
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,640
I remember when Mick recorded this in
'78. We had a wild party afterwards.

332
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,440
Jason Pelligrini's dad
says Mick Jagger's gay.

333
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,280
Yeah? Well, Jason Pelligrini's
dad takes it up the ass.

334
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,600
- Tryouts are next week.
- Tryouts are next week?

335
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,800
Your mother didn't tell me.

336
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,640
Jason Pelligrini said his dad's
gonna pick me if I'm still available.

337
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,000
You'll make it. Positive things
happen to positive thinkers.

338
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,520
Tell me, what do you gotta do? What
are the three whats you gotta be?

339
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,800
- I don't want to do this, Dad.
- At bat, come on.

340
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,760
- Keep the bat low.
- No, keep it high, high.

341
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,440
- When you move your feet?
- Step on the eggshell...

342
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,320
- ...and squash the bug.
- Attaboy. That's perfect.

343
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,280
That's what Coop used to say. I
told you about what Coop said, right?

344
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:25,400
- Your old catcher, right?
- One of the finest athletes I ever knew.

345
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,760
Where'd you get that glove?

346
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,080
Tim gave it to me.

347
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,080
Piece of shit.

348
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,600
<i>Opening day at Candlestick Park, 1996.</i>

349
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,800
What's not to love about opening day?

350
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,760
Fathers sneaking away from work,
and kids playing hooky from school.

351
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,920
<i>For at least one day,
everybody is in first place.</i>

352
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,280
Opening day is what baseball's
about. How exciting is it...

353
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,880
...for Giants fans with
Rayburn coming hom"e..."

354
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,560
<i>... after leading the
Braves to a championship?</i>

355
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,080
Did you see that? See
the way he moved his legs?

356
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,200
- Can I have a hot dog?
- A what?

357
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,000
Can I have a hot dog?

358
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,240
You're in my seat.

359
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,280
If it isn't the ubiquitous
queen of AM radio herself.

360
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,800
Good morning, my sweet
angel, darling, baby.

361
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,320
Oh, yeah, whatever.

362
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,880
Manny, come on, don't dick me
around. It's an important piece, okay?

363
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,800
There's somebody there behind
that killer smile. I promis"e..."

364
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,600
...I will not hurt your
boy. I want Bobby Rayburn.

365
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,680
Bernie, correct me if I'm wrong...

366
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,720
...but isn't she the ball-buster who
had the temerity to ask my client...

367
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,040
...if he was honestly worth 40 million?

368
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,920
- Am I a ball-buster?
- Yeah.

369
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,960
Thank you.

370
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,720
- Whose is this?
- It's mine. I spit in it.

371
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
I thought your mother confiscated that.

372
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,120
She did.

373
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,080
Play ball!

374
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,080
Yeah, attaway!

375
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,240
Strike.

376
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,200
What are you doing? You missed
it. Hawkins struck him out.

377
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,480
- Pay attention.
- I'm sorry, Dad.

378
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,640
<i>Blaze winds, and the pitch to Pryor...</i>

379
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,040
...swung on and driven
deep towards the gap.

380
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,760
<i>He crushed it!</i>

381
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,280
- Watch, watch, watch.
- What?

382
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,480
I got it!

383
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,160
I got it!

384
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,240
Primo and Rayburn giving
chase. They converge and"..."

385
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,360
<i>Lookout!</i>

386
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,440
Centre field makes the calls.

387
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,480
Fundamental of baseball,
centre field makes the calls.

388
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,000
Pay attention.

389
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,640
<i>Well, a scary moment on day one.</i>

390
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,760
I'll tell you, Rayburn's slow getting
up. And Primo's still slow getting up.

391
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,720
There's $40 million out
there in centre field, Steve.

392
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,960
Hope the Giants have collision coverage.

393
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,920
This will help relieve the pain.

394
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,320
- Doc, is the rib bruised or fractured?
- Neither.

395
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,960
Bobby, what are you doing? We
got 161 games to go out there.

396
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,080
Could you excuse me for a minute?

397
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,040
Thank you. You just signed
a $40 million contract.

398
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,920
Hurt yourself, you'll be
batting .100 by month's end.

399
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,520
The media'll turn on
you faster than the fans.

400
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,400
- Listen, you gotta come out.
- I can't.

401
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,320
I gotta be Babe-
fucking-Ruth.

402
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,800
It's William-fucking-Bendix.
Get it right.

403
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,520
- You having fun?
- Yeah.

404
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,640
I'm just gonna make some phone calls.
Okay? Just business calls. I'll be back.

405
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,840
- Go?
- Just downstairs for a minute.

406
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,720
Mom said we have to be home
by 6, or she'll be upset.

407
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,360
Forget about your mother.

408
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,360
I got it!

409
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,840
The wind took it. The wind
took it. Kid was lucky.

410
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,680
Kid was lucky.

411
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,680
Wind took it.

412
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,440
- You stepped on me.
- Don't worry. We'll get one next time.

413
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,240
Okay, I gotta go, all
right? I'll be back.

414
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,640
- You don't have to pee or anything?
- No.

415
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,800
What happened?

416
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,440
Lanz hit one to right. Bases
loaded. Come on, grand slam!

417
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,920
Don't get greedy, son. What
we need now is a sacrifice.

418
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,640
A winning team knows how to
manufacture runs. Coop taught me that.

419
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,080
Know why he said the most
beautiful play is a sacrifice fly?

420
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,760
- You sacrifice for the team?
- And doesn't bring down your average.

421
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,520
That's why baseball's
better than life. It's fair.

422
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,160
Tell me what happens.

423
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,840
<i>Now batting, number 33...</i>

424
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,240
<i>... Bobby Rayburn.</i>

425
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,200
Come on, Bobby!

426
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,480
Attaway, Bobby!

427
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,760
Rayburn look a little stiff to you?

428
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,760
I can't believe they left
him in after that collision.

429
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,280
Right. That's all we need,
our $40 million man on the DL.

430
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,560
He's playing hurt. That's
a man showing his mettle.

431
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:39,640
Putting the team first. Remember,
last year he hit.314 against lefties.

432
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,720
Yo, Bobby!

433
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,960
- Time!
- Oh, fuck.

434
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,760
Come on, let's play
some fucking baseball!

435
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,680
All right, Bobby, let's go!

436
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,680
Play!

437
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,000
All right, Bobby!

438
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,960
- Go for it, Bobby!
- Go, Bobby!

439
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,760
Bobby!

440
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,800
Hey!

441
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,720
Hey, buddy...

442
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,200
...you wanna sit down?
Trying to see here.

443
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,040
Go, Bobby!

444
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,560
Come on! Let's go with
the fucking game! Shit!

445
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,280
Strike!

446
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,400
Are you out of your mind, ump?
Are you out of your fucking mind?

447
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,880
- Hey, sit down.
- Take your hands off me.

448
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,600
- Stop pushing, man!
- Just ask.

449
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,840
- Why the fuck you pushing? I'm asking.
- Both of you, down in front!

450
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,640
- Fuck you!
- Down in front! Now!

451
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,800
Let's play some fucking
ball! You all right?

452
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,760
What's your fucking problem?

453
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,160
You old busybody!

454
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,720
I gotta go, okay? I'll be back.

455
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,840
Fuck you!

456
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,640
Oh, fuck.

457
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,520
Get out of here.

458
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,800
So could you just send
me over the stats? Yes.

459
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,880
Okay. Thank you very much.

460
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,680
I'm sorry I'm late.
Your hair looks nice.

461
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,320
- I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid he left.
- He left.

462
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,320
- For the ball game.
- What?

463
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,960
Yes, for the ball game.

464
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,920
- I thought he had a plane to catch.
- Plans changed.

465
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,120
But he did leave you this note.

466
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,840
- He didn't draw a smiley face, did he?
- What?

467
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,560
The previous assistant got him in the
habit of drawing a smiley fac"e..."

468
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,440
...instead of "sincerely," and I keep
telling him it's not always appropriate.

469
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,800
No, it's perfectly appropriate.

470
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,200
<i>Now batting, number 10, Brad Tjader.</i>

471
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,600
Hey, congratulations, fellas.

472
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,160
Hey, Babe-
fucking-Ruth.

473
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,560
- William-fucking-Bendix.
- That's right.

474
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,840
So did the kid see his home run?

475
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,760
The kid didn't even see it.

476
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,120
He slipped into a coma, and
he never pulled out. I'm sorry.

477
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,280
- How come you didn't tell me?
- Like you take bad news well.

478
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:35,680
What am I supposed to say? "Great
news, the kid didn't make it."

479
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,640
That's all right, man.
Enough of these hospital gigs.

480
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,600
They're off the list. You
know what the bright side is?

481
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,280
You knocked the cover
off the ball. You're back.

482
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,480
The hell I did. It was a fluke.

483
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,600
I never even saw the pitch.

484
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,760
Let go, Tim.

485
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,520
- What do you want?
- How is he? He okay?

486
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,600
He's not. He's crying his
eyes out. What do you think?

487
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,120
- Come on, don't start.
- Don't you start.

488
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,600
You violated your agreement.
I called my lawyer.

489
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,600
I'm getting a restraining order.

490
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,120
- Don't start.
- No, don't you start. Go away.

491
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,560
- I've had it. I don't care what you want.
- Let me see him.

492
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,720
You had to bring him home?
What is wrong with you?

493
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,640
- I want you out. Tim, call the cops.
- I'm gonna explain to him.

494
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,720
- Come on, everything's okay.
- You bastard.

495
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,480
You motherfucker! You cocksuck...!

496
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,760
- Hey.
- Tim!

497
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,280
Tim, call the cops. He fucking hit me!

498
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,720
Hey. Hey, slugger.

499
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,880
Slugger, I'm sorry. You forgive me?

500
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,200
- Hey.
- You left me.

501
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,600
I know, I screwed up. I'm sorry.

502
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,640
- You forgive Dad?
- Mom's got a terrible headache.

503
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,360
Well, that's called a
migraine. She'll live.

504
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,680
Look what I got for you.
I got your favourite pizza.

505
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,600
Gil, open the door!

506
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,920
- Gil, open the door.
- It's got pepperoni and mushroom.

507
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,080
- I don't like mushrooms.
- You can pick them off.

508
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:17,840
Is it true, if Mom marries Tim,
I'm not gonna be a Renard anymore?

509
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,000
- Gil, open the door.
- It's open!

510
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,240
- It's locked.
- It's open.

511
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,760
It's locked, Gil. Open the door
now. I'm calling the police.

512
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,240
You still worried about the tryouts?

513
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,080
I don't know. Think
I'll make the majors?

514
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,960
Of course you'll make
it. Remember what I said.

515
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,640
Positive things happen to
positive thinkers. Who said that?

516
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,600
- Coop.
- Damn straight.

517
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,760
He was the greatest
player I ever played with.

518
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,640
Gil, unlock the door.

519
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,080
Got you a Coke.

520
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,160
Call the cops.

521
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,920
Didn't you hear me? Call the cops!

522
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,600
Call the fucking police!

523
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,720
- I can't drink Coke.
- Who says?

524
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,800
Mom and Dad. I mean, Tim.

525
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,680
The door's locked. It's okay.

526
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,240
Gil, open the door.

527
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,880
Hey, Art.

528
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,240
I said, " Enough of this shit.
You sign the contract right now."

529
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,480
He signed it. I swear to God, on
my honour, he signed the contract.

530
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,480
Hey, Gil, got a second?

531
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,760
If you do. It's 8:00.

532
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,800
- Shall we?
- There you go.

533
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,680
Sit down, Gil.

534
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,120
That's okay, I'll stand.

535
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,800
Chuck from McKinley and
Everest called yesterday.

536
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,200
Said they wanted to drop
their account with us.

537
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,400
I sent Figgy over there
to sort things out.

538
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,120
You sent Figgy down?

539
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,480
- Sit down, Gil.
- Yeah, he sorted them out.

540
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,880
He did it with my opening-day tickets.
What are you gonna do about it?

541
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,120
- He didn't steal your account.
- He did. What will you do?

542
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,160
We gave him your account.

543
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,240
I gave him your account.

544
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,080
What do you mean?

545
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,920
You're not getting the numbers we need.

546
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,280
I know. It's been a little
slow last couple of months.

547
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,760
But that'll change. I've got a
new strategy. It's gonna work.

548
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,000
- Listen, your behaviour is unacceptable.
- What do you mean?

549
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,000
- People are scared of you.
- Why, because of the other day?

550
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,560
You cannot do things like
that in this day and...

551
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,280
I want your reorder book.

552
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,800
Outstanding commissions
will be forwarded.

553
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,680
My father started this business.

554
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:58,280
Look, perfection and principles don't
belong in business, not now or then.

555
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,440
- As a friend of your father's...
- Keep your mouth shut.

556
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,480
You know nothing about my father.

557
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,000
- He made this business.
- Your father made knives.

558
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,040
- San Francisco made this business.
- By ripping him off.

559
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,640
He wasn't a businessman, Gil...

560
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,120
...and neither are you.

561
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,120
That's the bottom line.

562
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,600
<i>And so, in a Freudian sense, Jewel...</i>

563
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,760
<i>... the catcher is the father,
and the son is the pitcher.</i>

564
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,160
<i>Wow, that's fascinating. Let me ask you.</i>

565
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:06,080
<i>- What does the bat and ball represent?
- Well, the bat speaks for itself...</i>

566
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,600
<i>... and, of course, the
ball is the ejaculate.</i>

567
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,640
<i>Thanks for calling, doc.
Who do we have on line two?</i>

568
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,920
<i>- Do we have anybody on line two?
- I believe everybody hung up.</i>

569
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:20,280
Hey, man. Hey, you got a van?
Kids are breaking into your van.

570
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,040
Somebody's breaking into your
van. Stop those kids. Cut that out.

571
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,440
- What?
- Kids breaking into a van out there.

572
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,280
- Yeah.
- Here, this is for you.

573
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,120
- What's that?
- Take it. Take it.

574
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,520
- Take it.
- What is it?

575
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,960
It's for you. It's a
temporary restraining order.

576
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,880
- What?
- You have been s"erve"d.

577
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,120
Hey, man, can I use your...?

578
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,400
Okay, last one.

579
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,360
Good swing. All right, who's next?

580
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,920
Eleven. Let's go,
buddy. Hustle up there.

581
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,760
- Okay, pal.
- Come on, Rich.

582
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,080
Okay, watch the ball.

583
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,160
Good swing.

584
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,160
Next one, Richie.

585
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,720
Attaway, Richie boy.

586
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,760
- That's okay.
- He's throwing too hard.

587
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,440
He almost took his head
off. Hey, coach. Coach.

588
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,360
- Yeah.
- Slow down.

589
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,240
- This is Little League. Little League.
- I know.

590
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,240
- Leave him alone, Gil.
- Mind your fucking business.

591
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,640
Hey, coach, mix in some
strikes. What are you doing?

592
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,240
- You're making it hard.
- I'll coach from here.

593
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,880
- Mix in some strikes.
- He's throwing strikes, Gil.

594
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,760
- Fuck it, I'm gonna go down.
- Easy, Gil.

595
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,640
Remember, Ellen's got that
restraining order on you.

596
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,600
- The bat is too fucking heavy.
- Come on.

597
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,800
You fuck with me, I'll send
your head into the outfield.

598
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,280
Go easy. You're letting
the bat swing him.

599
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,120
- Hey, hey, come on, you guy.
- Look how heavy this bat is.

600
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,840
Here.

601
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,560
Let go of my son.

602
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,360
- He's my son too.
- Don't remind me. Get off him.

603
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,440
- He's my son too.
- You are not gonna ruin our lives.

604
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,960
- Tim, call the cops now.
- I'm just trying to tell him something.

605
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,880
Get out of here. Tim!

606
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,120
You get out of here.
Can't you read, stupid?

607
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,360
The restraining order says you
have to stay 100 yards away.

608
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,160
- Tell him one thing.
- You can't come near him.

609
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,920
- I wanna tell him one thing.
- Get out of here.

610
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,800
- I just wanna tell him one thing.
- You better go.

611
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,440
Don't swing at anything.
Wait for a good one.

612
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:45,000
Step on the eggshell,
squash the bug. Okay?

613
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,480
You mind your fucking
business. You're lucky.

614
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,520
Just give him... Give
him something. He's a kid.

615
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,920
It's okay. Play ball.

616
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,960
<i>Bobby Rayburn again
failed to earn his keep.</i>

617
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,760
<i>Almost grounding into a
game-ending double play...</i>

618
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,760
<i>... just beating the throw to first.</i>

619
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,880
<i>When the Giants
needed a pick-me-up...</i>

620
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:19,320
<i>... number 11, Juan Primo,
provides San Francisco with a lift.</i>

621
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:23,160
<i>And it was a big one. His two-run
shot over the left-field fence...</i>

622
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,960
<i>... scored Rayburn, and
the Giants went home happy.</i>

623
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,560
<i>That is, except
possibly Bobby Rayburn...</i>

624
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,360
<i>... whose lackof hitting is giving
new meaning to the term "three hole."</i>

625
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,360
<i>The way Primo's carried
this team on his shoulders...</i>

626
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,440
<i>... makes you wonder who the
real $40 million player is.</i>

627
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,680
<i>Lanz came up with a big hit to drive
in a key run in the Giants' victory.</i>

628
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,480
<i>Jimmy has been a spark
plug during this home stand.</i>

629
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,200
Motherfuck.

630
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:02,800
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, now batting,
the centre fielder, number 33...</i>

631
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,880
<i>... Bobby Rayburn.</i>

632
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,840
All right, Bobby, let's go!

633
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,400
All right, Bobby.

634
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,640
Strike.

635
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,320
Strike.

636
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,440
- Strike thr"ee."
- Shit.

637
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,680
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, with
courtesy to the players...</i>

638
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:02,360
<i>... please refrain
from excessive noise...</i>

639
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,720
<i>... and throwing anything
onto the field. Thank you.</i>

640
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,200
Forty-million-dollar
man's paying off, huh?

641
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:14,560
<i>Now batting, number 33, Bobby Rayburn.</i>

642
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,400
Well, here it is, Memorial Day weekend.

643
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:22,400
You think back to the opening-day
grand slam, doesn't seem long ago.

644
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,600
<i>But lately, Bobby Rayburn
has really had difficulties...</i>

645
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,040
<i>... and can't seem to find his
stroke. He lacks aggressiveness.</i>

646
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,920
And you start to wonder
when you call it a slump.

647
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,600
<i>Most superstars aren't
gonna sit down for you.</i>

648
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,240
<i>But you gotta wonder...</i>

649
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:39,000
<i>... when he's gonna
breakout of this thing.</i>

650
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,480
Strike.

651
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,280
Come on, Bobby. Come on.

652
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,520
Out.

653
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,960
<i>Now batting, number 46, Jimmy Lanz.</i>

654
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,080
You'll be all right.

655
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,200
You still want that interview?

656
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:49,800
You'd let Bobby Rayburn do an
interview with a...? What was it?

657
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,640
- Castrating ball-buster.
- Castrating ball-buster, that's it.

658
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,480
- I thought I was off your list.
- Come on.

659
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,600
Schindler has a list, not me, okay?

660
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,760
When you're hitting.183,
you don't get to have a list.

661
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,920
<i>Locker room.</i>

662
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,480
- "Giants' locker room."
- Bobby Rayburn.

663
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,840
- "Yeah, who's calling?"
- A friend of his. I have to talk to him.

664
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,760
It's really important.

665
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,680
<i>Rayburn, phone.</i>

666
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,800
- Yeah, this is Bobby.
- "Bobby?"

667
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:24,520
- Yeah.
- Bobby Rayburn.

668
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,800
"Yes. Yes, who is this"?

669
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,880
<i>Hello. Look, say something.</i>

670
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,600
<i>Hello?</i>

671
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:36,200
<i>Yo, Stook, I thought you were
supposed to screen my calls here.</i>

672
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,880
- Burn, baby, burn.
- Come on, give me some.

673
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:08,040
- What's up, Dad? Gaining a little weight.
- Yeah, yeah, I am.

674
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,480
- Stopped by the doughnut spot.
- Cool. Is he for me?

675
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,400
Yeah, he's for you.

676
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,440
What's his name?

677
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:18,680
- He told me it's Bradley.
- What else did he say, Dr. Dolittle?

678
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,720
Dad, how come you haven't been hitting?

679
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,440
How's the rib cage, Bobby?

680
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:34,040
My rib cage is sick of
people asking about it.

681
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,800
They say you should've came
out that first gam"e..."

682
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,800
...but you were hot-dogging,
so you screwed yourself.

683
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,240
That supposed to be a dis or
something? I hit.314 last season.

684
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:46,320
- That's bullshit.
- I'm telling you what people say.

685
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,320
I can put a positive spin on this.

686
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,640
- How?
- How? I'll tell you how.

687
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,200
We set up an interview,
get a piece out of it.

688
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,680
You tell the people why you stayed
in. It's for the kid in chemo.

689
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,120
You get public sympathy. I smell
forgiveness in the Bay Area.

690
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,560
- Is that exploiting the kid's death?
- Not comfortable with it?

691
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:06,440
- Should I be?
- I think you should be.

692
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,920
Well, I don't think I am.

693
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,240
Excuse me. I'll have a vodka
and orange juice, please.

694
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,160
And whatever the lady wants.

695
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,760
Jackon the rocks, thanks.

696
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,240
What?

697
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,680
Oh, shit. I did it again, didn't I?

698
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,440
No, it's okay. I'm used to
all of this interview shit.

699
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:55,280
Look, no offence intended,
but it's no secret...

700
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,520
...that you're playing like
shit. It's gotta be affecting you.

701
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,360
Of course it's affecting me.

702
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,400
I'm paid to produce. I can't
even hit the side of a barn.

703
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:07,920
- How do you think it makes me feel?
- Do you know what I think, Mr. Rayburn?

704
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,880
No, but I'm quite sure
you're gonna tell me.

705
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,120
I think the slump is a good thing.

706
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,400
Now, what kind of twisted shit is that?

707
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,080
It's gonna teach you to
cut yourself a little slack.

708
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:24,400
- You can't keep up this act forever.
- Now it's an act.

709
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,920
Oh, yeah, Mr. Perfect. Mr. No-Error.
Nobody can live up to that shit.

710
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:32,360
You gotta give yourself a
break. It's just a lie anyhow.

711
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:36,880
Yeah. It doesn't seem like
a lie when I'm hitting.

712
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,920
<i>Now batting for the Giants, number 11...</i>

713
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,000
<i>... the right fielder, Juan Primo.</i>

714
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,240
Sit down, let Bobby bat!

715
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,880
He's a hot dog. He's lucky.

716
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:12,640
<i>Now batting, number 11, Juan Primo.</i>

717
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,040
<i>Now batting, number 33, Bobby Rayburn.</i>

718
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,720
Let's play some fucking ball!

719
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,320
Thanks, Primo.

720
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,160
Fuck you, Rayburn.

721
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:05,880
- You suck.
- Bobby, Bobby.

722
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,560
You suck!

723
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,560
Don't listen to them, Bobby!

724
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:57,760
Okay.

725
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,040
Line drive to the right.

726
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,640
Don't tell me where it's gonna go, Dad.

727
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,120
- Hey, Bobby.
- Hey, Nikki. The usual.

728
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:56,860
- Alrighty.
- Hey, Bob.

729
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:07,900
You guys wanna play pool?

730
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,700
- What a waste of space.
- What do you mean?

731
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:14,060
He hit a bad patch. We all
hit bad patches, don't we?

732
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:18,660
- You never hit a bad patch?
- No, this is my dream job.

733
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:27,260
- I'm gonna talk to him.
- Please, man.

734
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:31,500
These guys come to relax. You bug
them, they're gonna stop coming here.

735
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:34,380
I know him. I've talked
to him on the phone.

736
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,940
Hey, Bob.

737
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:43,860
Can I talk to you for a second?

738
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:47,500
- Sure. You wanna talk to me?
- Maybe we can go someplace.

739
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:50,020
- Let me finish the game.
- Okay.

740
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:59,220
Primo, it's late, man. All right?

741
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:02,780
- Tell me what it is you want.
- I want nothing.

742
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:05,620
You don't understand
how things work here.

743
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:08,340
Because it's different
from where you come from.

744
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:10,620
What's different?

745
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:14,060
Look, when a player like me
comes into a team like this...

746
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:16,300
...hey, man, shit gets worked out.

747
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:18,860
Right? You don't... What
is the problem with that?

748
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,900
What kind of uniforms
do you have down there?

749
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:28,380
- Just uniforms.
- Like these pussy pants you're wearing?

750
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:31,140
- What...? What colour?
- Blue.

751
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:35,260
- What number is on the backof yours?
- Eleven.

752
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:40,060
Primo, what is your price?

753
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:44,020
No price. You already
had a chance, baby. Okay?

754
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:47,260
- What's your fucking price?
- Go fuck yourself.

755
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:50,820
- Hey, don't walk away from me, man.
- Fuck you.

756
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:54,340
Motherfucker. What?

757
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:01,260
- Break it up!
- Get off of him.

758
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:07,500
- I want my fucking number, man.
- Chill out.

759
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:11,340
What are we talking
about Juan Primo for...

760
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:15,660
...when we've got Bobby Rayburn where
we want him, up close and exclusive.

761
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:17,940
Are you ready for your next caller?

762
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:19,780
- Let's get another caller.
- Bobby.

763
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:23,700
- You guys are getting a kickout of this.
- What are you talking about?

764
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:27,060
I'm talking about my season
is like a bad freeway accident.

765
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:29,740
And you guys, you're just
slowing down to watch.

766
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:33,100
I thought I'd enjoy this, but
the fact is, I feel for you.

767
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:35,020
I didn't know it'd be so rough.

768
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:39,540
Who we talking to? On the car
phone, we are talking to Gil.

769
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:43,060
Hey, is that our old buddy Gil?
Mr. Magical-Conjunction himself.

770
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:45,780
- Is this Jewel?
- You're on the air. Go ahead.

771
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:48,340
<i>You're getting break-up
on the line here.</i>

772
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:51,980
- I heard what you said about Primo.
- What's your question for Bobby?

773
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:54,860
Is Bobby listening? Bobby? Hey, Bob?

774
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:57,380
Yeah, Gil, I'm here, man. How you doing?

775
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:01,100
I wanna tell you that I know
exactly what you're going through...

776
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:05,980
...more than you'll ever understand.
This number 11 thing is a fucking joke.

777
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:08,980
You're the greatest player
this city's ever had...

778
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:12,220
...and you got some
hot-dogger like Primo...

779
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:14,540
...giving you a hard
time about your number.

780
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:16,540
There's a reason you're paid 40 million.

781
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:19,140
The owners aren't doing
what they should be.

782
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:21,820
They should be protecting
their investment.

783
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:24,020
<i>Pay him. Give him what he wants.</i>

784
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:26,340
If he wants a million, give it to him.

785
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:30,260
If he doesn't want it and doesn't
want to give up his number, fuck him.

786
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:33,700
Get him out. What's the difference?
Just get you hitting again.

787
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:37,340
- Lf that's what it's gonna take.
- They say fans don't know...

788
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:41,660
...what they're talking about. The public
and the owners should listen to you.

789
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:44,180
Bobby, why isn't this
guy on your payroll?

790
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:48,580
Thanks, Gil. Maybe I should have you
try and talk some sense into Primo.

791
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:51,060
<i>God knows I need all the help I can get.</i>

792
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:56,460
<i>They say fans don't know
what they're talking about.</i>

793
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:59,020
<i>The public and the owners
should listen to you.</i>

794
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:01,540
<i>Bobby, why isn't this
guy on your payroll?</i>

795
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:05,860
<i>Maybe I should have you try
and talk some sense into Primo.</i>

796
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:10,540
<i>The owners should listen to you. Bobby,
why isn't this guy on your payroll?</i>

797
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:14,180
<i>Maybe I should have you try
and talk some sense into Primo.</i>

798
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:17,940
<i>Maybe I should have you try
and talk some sense into Primo.</i>

799
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:20,820
<i>God knows I need all the help I can get.</i>

800
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:34,420
Primo. Primo, lots of luck.

801
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:36,060
Primo.

802
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:21,420
Mr. Primo?

803
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:26,220
- Yeah?
- Can I just say...?

804
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:30,900
Did you ever think how
one man who's doing well...

805
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:33,980
...might throw off the rest of the team?

806
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:39,540
I'm saying, you have to thinkof
what's best for the team, right?

807
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:43,300
You might have to lay down a sacrifice.

808
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:46,260
I'm talking about
Bobby Rayburn's number.

809
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:50,300
I don't know if you understand
how much he needs that number.

810
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:53,260
- Number 11.
- I am number 11.

811
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:56,620
I know, but he needs it more than you.

812
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:07,340
Are you with the press?

813
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:10,980
You with the hotel?

814
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:19,060
Then get out of here.

815
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:23,860
Go.

816
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:43,500
Get the fuckout of here.

817
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:19,300
<i>It's a sad night here at the Stick
as the Giants take the field...</i>

818
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:23,820
<i>... for the first time since the
murder of hitting sensation Juan Primo.</i>

819
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:27,100
Rayburn will take his place
in the lineup batting cleanup.

820
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:30,060
<i>There's bound to be
questions about that, Jewel.</i>

821
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:57,500
Now we all get to wear the number, man.

822
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:53,860
Come on, let's play ball!

823
01:04:55,900 --> 01:05:00,860
<i>Now batting fourth,
number 33, Bobby Rayburn.</i>

824
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:05,020
Bobby! Come on, Bobby!

825
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:07,780
Fuck you.

826
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:22,380
Come on, Bob!

827
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:44,700
That's it.

828
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:54,700
Come on, Bob!

829
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:57,180
Attaway. You're back to your old self.

830
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:07,260
Fuck you.

831
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:14,740
This is the last place
I'll look. Then I'll quit.

832
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:18,100
Yeah, no, I've had it. I'm
tired. I mean, he's not here.

833
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:21,900
There he is. I found my
man. I'll talk to you later.

834
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:31,220
Is this how you celebrate
going four for four, huh?

835
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:34,180
What happened to pouring
champagne over your head...

836
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:36,500
...and banging some groupies, huh?

837
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:40,340
Bobby. Bobby, talk to me.

838
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:43,420
If the cops worry you,
they're not interested in you.

839
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:46,580
It's just an ongoing
investigation. Let it go.

840
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:48,580
I didn't ask for this, man.

841
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:52,020
You talking about Primo?
Come on, I know that's shit.

842
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:55,860
I thought about it a lot,
but I didn't ask for this.

843
01:06:57,020 --> 01:06:59,620
You know, Bobsy...

844
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:02,500
...I wish five people
dead on my drive to work.

845
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:05,380
Five people. But wishing
it doesn't make it so.

846
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:08,060
You're not God, lifetime
average withstanding.

847
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:11,580
Yeah? Well...

848
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:14,100
...why do I feel so bad then, huh?

849
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:16,020
I don't know.

850
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:17,740
I don't...

851
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:20,980
This is gonna blow the hell
out of my shithead theory...

852
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:23,100
...but I think you feel guilty.

853
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:25,500
Jesus-hairy-Christ.

854
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:27,340
I've been wrong about you.

855
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:30,100
You're not a shithead at
all. I'm flabbergasted.

856
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:32,780
Come on, let's go, man.
I got a game tomorrow.

857
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:47,860
<i>Number 33, Bobby Rayburn.</i>

858
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:54,460
Go, Bobby! Bobby!

859
01:07:58,220 --> 01:07:59,660
Safe.

860
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:06,660
<i>Bobby Rayburn.</i>

861
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:14,140
<i>You're coming off the
worst slump in your career.</i>

862
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:18,820
<i>All of a sudden, you're hitting well over
.400, 11 home runs, 30 RBIs last month.</i>

863
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:20,460
<i>How do you explain this?</i>

864
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:22,660
<i>I wish I knew.</i>

865
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,640
That's it? You wish you knew?

866
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:30,160
A "thank you" would've been nice.

867
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,080
Sean!

868
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:50,280
Be careful!

869
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:55,560
Don't go too far!

870
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:02,560
Sean, don't go too far, darling.

871
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:06,520
Bradley!

872
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,400
Bradley, come here!

873
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:15,240
Bradley, come back.

874
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,240
Go back, Bradley. Go back.

875
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,960
Sean!

876
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:33,240
Sean!

877
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:36,440
Mr. Rayburn!

878
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:41,120
Shit.

879
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:47,840
Mr. Rayburn!

880
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:17,680
Sean!

881
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,320
- Thank God for Mark Spitz over here.
- Jeez.

882
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:53,640
Okay. Just relax. Go on.
That's right, blow it out.

883
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,240
It's gonna be all right.

884
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:56,800
Are you all right, man?

885
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:59,560
- Just relax.
- He swallowed some water.

886
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:02,360
Jesus. You scared me half to death.

887
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:04,480
Where did you come from?

888
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:08,600
I was just walking on the beach, I
saw him in the water, and I went in.

889
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:11,560
Thank God, man. You all right?

890
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:15,200
Sean, you gotta promise
me, no matter what...

891
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,600
...not a word to your
mother, understand?

892
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:21,240
Next time you're looking for
attention, be more dramatic.

893
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:25,000
- Let's get some dry clothes.
- Play in traffic like the other kids.

894
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,400
- That little bonehead.
- Oh, shit.

895
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:33,600
- What did you say your name was?
- My friends call me Curly.

896
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:38,040
Curly. Well, come on,
Curly, let's go inside.

897
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:41,960
Elvira will get you some
dry clothes, all right?

898
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:46,560
Thank you.

899
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:48,520
- What do I say?
- Well, you know, I was just there.

900
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,520
You would've done the same thing.

901
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:53,600
If I lose this guy, man, I
don't know what I would do.

902
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:56,000
Looks good on you.

903
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:58,200
I don't know about them pants, though.

904
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,040
They're yours.

905
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,240
- Can I get you anything?
- A beer.

906
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:06,640
Yeah, all right. I could
swear... Have I seen you before?

907
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:10,560
I get that all the time. I got
one of those faces, I guess.

908
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:15,760
You like baseball?

909
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:19,480
I'm not obsessed with it or
anything. Are you a player?

910
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:22,200
Yeah.

911
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:24,200
- You are?
- Yeah.

912
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,240
Barry Bonds?

913
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:33,600
No. No. I'm Bobby Rayburn.

914
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:35,520
- Right.
- Yeah.

915
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:39,640
- I was just kidding you.
- It's okay.

916
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:43,760
At least you're not one of them die
- hard baseball fans who...

917
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:45,200
Why is that?

918
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:47,120
Because those guys are losers.

919
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:51,440
Aren't the fans what it's all about?

920
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:54,520
Shit. Tell you something, man.

921
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:58,520
The fans are like women. When
you're hitting, they love you.

922
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:02,280
And when you're not, they'd as
soon spit on you as look at you.

923
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,360
Why is that?

924
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:09,760
Because they don't understand that
you're the same person hitting or not.

925
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,640
You know?

926
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,680
Only person you should
play for is yourself.

927
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:23,080
Hey, you wanna shoot some pool?

928
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:25,400
Yeah, sure.

929
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:27,960
- All right. Bring the beer.
- Sure.

930
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:37,280
Curly, Curly"..."

931
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:41,120
Curly Otis?

932
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:43,240
- Yeah, that's my old man.
- No shit.

933
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:47,040
I was in bigs for a cup of coffee
myself until my arm went south.

934
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:49,360
Man, tough break.

935
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:52,040
It's like my old
catcher Coop used to say:

936
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,520
"Enjoy it while you
got it, then move on."

937
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:56,360
Yeah.

938
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:01,640
That's a good philosophy,
brother. Good philosophy.

939
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:07,760
- Are all those hats yours?
- Yep, my pride and joy.

940
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:10,840
- Could I try one on?
- Yeah, sure. Sure.

941
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:21,760
Fits.

942
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:24,080
Looks good on you.

943
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:28,480
Hey, Bobby...

944
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:32,520
...did you mean it?
You'd do something for me?

945
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:35,600
Yeah, sure. I mean,
within reason, you know.

946
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,120
Don't be getting no ideas.

947
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:39,320
- Let me pitch to you.
- What?

948
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:43,360
Let me show you what I got. I
got a couple innings left in me.

949
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:46,240
Come on, Bobby, let
me show you what I got.

950
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:49,880
Bradley's gonna catch for us.

951
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:00,120
Must feel good to be hitting again, huh?

952
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:03,200
Brother, you have no idea.

953
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:06,960
- How did you get out of that slump?
- Say what?

954
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:10,600
Got any idea what got
you out of that slump?

955
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:13,480
You know, Curly...

956
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:16,360
...I just stopped caring, man.

957
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:20,360
- What?
- I just stopped caring.

958
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:22,400
You stopped caring?

959
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:24,120
What do you mean?

960
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:28,800
All my life I've been
working to be the best.

961
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,800
You know? Trying to be a perfectionist.

962
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:36,760
And I thought about it. That's
probably where I made my mistake.

963
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:42,640
And when Juan Primo died, man, that
completely changed the perspective.

964
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,440
I mean"..."

965
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:46,760
I mean, come on, let's be real here.

966
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:50,760
What are we doing? We're
not curing cancer, you know?

967
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:52,960
We're playing a game.

968
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:55,480
That's all it is. It's just a game.

969
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:59,120
So I stopped caring and relaxed...

970
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:01,800
...and I started hitting.

971
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,720
Stopped caring.

972
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:07,560
So that's your fucking
insight into life?

973
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:10,440
Just stop caring.

974
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:18,480
- You're pretty loose now, aren't you?
- Yeah.

975
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:22,720
All I'm saying is that there's
more to life than just baseball.

976
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:24,920
Like what? Like your house?

977
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:28,780
Like your bigass car? Like
your 40-fucking-million?

978
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:33,060
I mean, what the fuck do you care about?

979
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:36,140
I care about my son.
That's what I care about.

980
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:40,940
I'm sorry. I just hate that attitude,
you stopped caring. I'm sorry.

981
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:43,420
What, do you have a better theory?

982
01:17:43,820 --> 01:17:45,260
Yeah.

983
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:47,460
You got your number back.

984
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:52,540
Curly, my number didn't
have anything to do with it.

985
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:12,380
It looks good on you.

986
01:18:13,540 --> 01:18:14,900
Thanks.

987
01:18:19,980 --> 01:18:23,340
- That's great.
- I still haven't given you my best pitch.

988
01:18:23,620 --> 01:18:26,100
- Sure you have.
- No.

989
01:18:27,860 --> 01:18:29,180
Okay.

990
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:33,580
Look, Curly, I really want to thank
you for what you did for my son.

991
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:37,140
You know, what do you
say? Let's call it a night?

992
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:38,780
All right.

993
01:18:41,860 --> 01:18:45,580
Come on, admit it. We're alone.

994
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:49,340
Admit what?

995
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:52,180
Admit you're hitting
because Primo's not around.

996
01:18:53,620 --> 01:18:55,660
That's a bunch of bullshit. Come on.

997
01:18:55,860 --> 01:18:58,140
It doesn't hurt he's not around.

998
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:01,220
Come on, level with me.

999
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:05,140
Level with me.

1000
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:08,700
Come on, I saved your
kid. You wanna pay me back?

1001
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:12,420
Be honest with me and tell me
you're a little happy that he's dead.

1002
01:19:12,820 --> 01:19:16,540
- Hey.
- No, no. I'm not happy that he's dead.

1003
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:19,540
Come on.

1004
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:22,140
Curly. Curly, I already told you no.

1005
01:19:22,780 --> 01:19:26,140
No, I am not happy that he's dead. Okay?

1006
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:30,940
Okay? Can I have my hand back now?

1007
01:19:31,420 --> 01:19:32,860
Thanks.

1008
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:40,900
I'm really tired. Really.
I'm going to sleep. Take care.

1009
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:43,500
Simple "thank you"
would have been nic"e..."

1010
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:46,020
...for a teammate who
lays down a sacrifice.

1011
01:19:47,540 --> 01:19:49,820
Hey, look, you need a ride or anything?

1012
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:52,340
I got my own wheels. Thanks, Bob.

1013
01:19:52,620 --> 01:19:54,340
Good. Bradley, let's go.

1014
01:19:54,620 --> 01:19:56,820
If you need anything,
just call me, all right?

1015
01:19:57,220 --> 01:19:59,420
And I'll get back to you. Okay, bye.

1016
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:01,740
Take care. Come on, Bradley.

1017
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:04,500
Hey, Bob?

1018
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:07,500
Bobby. What about the glove, Bob?

1019
01:20:07,780 --> 01:20:09,020
Keep it!

1020
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:51,020
I remember when Mick
recorded this. December '77.

1021
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:53,620
We drove home at dawn.

1022
01:20:55,740 --> 01:20:57,460
Who's Mick?

1023
01:20:57,740 --> 01:20:59,740
A great friend of mine.

1024
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:02,740
- Where we going?
- We're going fishing.

1025
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:05,300
- Why can't my dad come?
- Your dad could come.

1026
01:21:05,620 --> 01:21:08,860
But he has a big game tomorrow,
and we gotta pick up Coop.

1027
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:14,620
Why are we fishing at night?

1028
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:17,700
Night fishing is best. No
boats to scare the fish away.

1029
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:21,700
We'll sucker them in with a
flashlight, cut them up with this.

1030
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:24,100
Go ahead, take it. It's yours.

1031
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:26,980
- You sure?
- Yeah, it's yours. Take it.

1032
01:21:27,580 --> 01:21:30,340
- Well, thanks.
- Just don't cut yourself.

1033
01:21:57,860 --> 01:21:59,980
- Hello.
- Hey, Curly.

1034
01:22:00,260 --> 01:22:02,100
Hey, Bobby. Hey.

1035
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:04,580
Say hello to your
father. He's on the phone.

1036
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:06,580
Hi, Dad. We're going fishing.

1037
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:08,500
That's great. That's great, Sean.

1038
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:12,340
Listen, Curly, could you pick
up the handset so we could talk?

1039
01:22:12,740 --> 01:22:14,380
Sure thing, slugger.

1040
01:22:14,540 --> 01:22:17,900
- Yeah.
- Curly, is it raining where you are?

1041
01:22:18,220 --> 01:22:21,260
- No, I'm far from the beach.
- Didn't know you'd take the car.

1042
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:25,380
<i>- I thought the kid, he'd like to get away.
- Listen, Curly...</i>

1043
01:22:26,060 --> 01:22:29,420
...before you do anything stupid,
I don't think this is a good idea.

1044
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:31,620
You don't think. You're a lucky idiot.

1045
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:33,260
I'm not fucking with you.

1046
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:35,860
- All right.
- Don't get angry at me, Bob.

1047
01:22:36,140 --> 01:22:37,180
- Curly?
- Bob?

1048
01:22:37,660 --> 01:22:39,380
I just want my son back.

1049
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:40,660
- Bob?
- What?

1050
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:41,900
- Bobby.
- What?!

1051
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:46,380
Listen to you. You're hanging on every
word I say. This is really something.

1052
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:49,380
Curly, what do you want?
What do you want from me?

1053
01:22:53,860 --> 01:22:56,100
Don't talk back. You
show me some respect.

1054
01:22:56,380 --> 01:22:58,580
Without people like me, you're nothing.

1055
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:01,740
We're the ones that
get you your 40 million.

1056
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:06,340
- Look, what do you want?
- What do I want?

1057
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:10,380
I want when they thinkof
you, they thinkof me.

1058
01:23:10,660 --> 01:23:14,220
Curly, I don't know what the fuck
I did to you to piss you off...

1059
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:17,180
...but my son has
nothing to do with this.

1060
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:23,340
Oh, Bobby, it's not what you did to
me, it's what I did for you, number 11.

1061
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:25,620
- You owe me.
- I owe you what?

1062
01:23:26,580 --> 01:23:28,100
Check your freezer.

1063
01:23:28,780 --> 01:23:30,540
I'll hang on.

1064
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,280
- There's a surprise.
- What the f...? Curly.

1065
01:23:33,580 --> 01:23:37,420
- Go ahead, check your freezer.
- All right, I'll check the freezer.

1066
01:23:37,820 --> 01:23:39,540
Curly, don't hang up this phone.

1067
01:23:39,740 --> 01:23:41,540
You hear me?

1068
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:43,180
Oh, my God!

1069
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:52,180
He finally figures it
out, ladies and gentlemen.

1070
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:54,780
It's really true what
they say about sluggers.

1071
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:57,100
They are really, really stupid.

1072
01:23:57,460 --> 01:24:02,180
Well, I'm a pitcher, Bobby.
Pitchers use their brains.

1073
01:24:17,620 --> 01:24:19,420
Come on, Bradley.

1074
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:26,820
We'll play a joke on him,
so you just play along.

1075
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:28,620
- All right.
- Okay?

1076
01:24:41,020 --> 01:24:42,180
Hey, Coop.

1077
01:24:43,980 --> 01:24:45,500
Gil.

1078
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:48,700
Gil.

1079
01:24:49,060 --> 01:24:51,260
- Gil Renard.
- Yeah.

1080
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:53,180
Gil Renard.

1081
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:55,700
Yeah, long time no see, Gil.

1082
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:59,140
- This is my son.
- Hi.

1083
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:06,820
Come on in, fellas.

1084
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:08,540
Go ahead.

1085
01:25:17,820 --> 01:25:21,300
Man, that is a kick-ass car.
You done good for yourself.

1086
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:24,540
You never see nothing
like that in the Bronx.

1087
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:27,140
I always thought you'd
be managing by now.

1088
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:29,260
- Managing?
- Yeah, in the majors.

1089
01:25:29,540 --> 01:25:32,620
Nobody calls me Coop anymore,
you sick son of a bitch.

1090
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:37,300
How'd you find me anyway?

1091
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:42,780
I looked you up.

1092
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:47,100
Whose kid is that, really?

1093
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:53,020
- You really want to know?
- Yeah.

1094
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:56,780
- Bobby Rayburn's.
- Jesus fuck.

1095
01:25:57,140 --> 01:26:00,220
Same old fucking Gil. Come on.

1096
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:04,060
Really?

1097
01:26:30,340 --> 01:26:31,980
He'll be on in a minute.

1098
01:26:36,580 --> 01:26:38,780
You'll recognize his voice.

1099
01:26:40,140 --> 01:26:44,740
All right, incoming call. Notify
incoming call. Turn off all radios.

1100
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:46,460
Okay, this is it.

1101
01:26:47,980 --> 01:26:49,820
Bob.

1102
01:26:58,540 --> 01:27:01,140
- Yeah.
- Hey, Bobby, you still up?

1103
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:04,500
- Bad time to be calling, huh?
- I'm up.

1104
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:10,060
Hey, I hope I'm not calling at a bad
time. Probably got some people over, huh?

1105
01:27:10,540 --> 01:27:13,420
I can't hear you. You'll
have to turn the music down.

1106
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:15,140
Oh, I'm sorry, slugger.

1107
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:17,540
Curly, I want to talk to Sean.

1108
01:27:18,860 --> 01:27:23,660
Sean, he's asleep now, but he's doing
fine. Don't worry about him. He's fine.

1109
01:27:24,420 --> 01:27:27,300
- Curly, what do you want?
- "I've been thinking it over."

1110
01:27:28,060 --> 01:27:31,260
You know, in life, life just...

1111
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:34,580
...comes down to one single action.

1112
01:27:36,820 --> 01:27:38,620
What do you want?

1113
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:41,500
I want you to hit a
home run for me, Bob.

1114
01:27:42,740 --> 01:27:44,380
Are you serious?

1115
01:27:44,580 --> 01:27:46,700
<i>Remember that kid in chemo...</i>

1116
01:27:47,260 --> 01:27:49,460
...whose life was unfair to him?

1117
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:53,380
That's how I'm feeling. My
life has been unfair to me.

1118
01:27:55,500 --> 01:28:00,100
<i>The only difference is, I'll be able
to see you hit that home run tomorrow.</i>

1119
01:28:00,380 --> 01:28:01,660
<i>And I got a photo here.</i>

1120
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:06,820
I'm gonna get it to you. And I want
you to put it on the Jumbotron, okay?

1121
01:28:10,380 --> 01:28:13,620
- Yeah.
- Then I want you to stand up and tell...

1122
01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:15,340
...the 50 million viewers...

1123
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:19,780
...that this home run is
dedicated to Gil, a true fan.

1124
01:28:22,820 --> 01:28:25,420
- What do you think?
- I can't believe you're serious.

1125
01:28:25,820 --> 01:28:28,220
I'm serious as a heart attack, Bobby.

1126
01:28:28,580 --> 01:28:30,500
That's pretty serious, isn't it?

1127
01:28:32,060 --> 01:28:36,060
There comes a time in everybody's life
when you have to stand for something.

1128
01:28:36,460 --> 01:28:39,220
Otherwise, you're just
passing on through.

1129
01:28:39,540 --> 01:28:41,540
So, Bobby, I'm watching you.

1130
01:28:42,020 --> 01:28:44,980
If that pitcher goes easy on
you, I'll kill your fucking kid.

1131
01:28:48,140 --> 01:28:49,900
Surprise, surprise.

1132
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:52,260
Hey, Bobby.

1133
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:55,140
I'm still here.

1134
01:28:56,900 --> 01:28:58,620
Now do you care?

1135
01:29:15,580 --> 01:29:17,980
You get in some serious shit for that.

1136
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:21,740
Cops are gonna be all over us.

1137
01:29:23,620 --> 01:29:26,340
Boy, all of a sudden, you
lost your sense of humour.

1138
01:29:26,900 --> 01:29:29,220
- Did you get it?
- Couldn't get him.

1139
01:29:30,660 --> 01:29:34,660
He's calling from Rayburn's car. We
should be able to nail him to the district.

1140
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:45,420
You're not gonna believe this kid.
Just like old times, huh, Coop?

1141
01:29:48,580 --> 01:29:51,820
- You know, that's not my real dad.
- It's okay, kid.

1142
01:29:58,060 --> 01:30:00,100
Come on, I'm waiting.

1143
01:30:00,740 --> 01:30:02,660
I'm waiting. The signals.

1144
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:05,940
What happened? Did you forget
everything? Come on, Coop.

1145
01:30:22,340 --> 01:30:23,980
Hang in there, kid.

1146
01:30:26,180 --> 01:30:28,180
Bring the bat up, slugger.

1147
01:30:28,460 --> 01:30:31,620
Come on, look like a
hitter. Bring it up.

1148
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:34,020
Bring it up. Come on.

1149
01:30:34,420 --> 01:30:38,140
Come on! Come on, slugger,
bring the fucking bat up.

1150
01:30:38,540 --> 01:30:40,260
Come on.

1151
01:30:41,220 --> 01:30:42,940
That's my boy.

1152
01:30:43,620 --> 01:30:46,900
It's all right, kid, hang
in there, now. Hang in there.

1153
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:58,700
Coop, you dickhead!

1154
01:30:58,780 --> 01:31:00,580
Come on, kid. Come on.

1155
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:04,900
Go. Go. Up the fence. Come on.

1156
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:06,660
Come on, push. Push. Go.

1157
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:10,380
Go. Go on. Go, kid, go.

1158
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:13,660
Coop, what are you doing?

1159
01:31:20,740 --> 01:31:23,220
Why did you do that? We
could've been teammates.

1160
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:26,860
We were teammates. We
could've made it to the bigs.

1161
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:29,260
It was Little League.
We were 12 years old.

1162
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:00,820
Come on.

1163
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:08,420
That's my boy.

1164
01:32:22,580 --> 01:32:25,580
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, leading
off the second inning...</i>

1165
01:32:25,860 --> 01:32:29,020
<i>... Giants centre fielder,
number 33, Bobby Rayburn.</i>

1166
01:32:30,660 --> 01:32:32,780
<i>Well, the forecast is for rain tonight.</i>

1167
01:32:33,060 --> 01:32:35,820
There's a mist falling as
Rayburn steps towards the box.

1168
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:39,180
He's been more aggressive
the last month of the season.

1169
01:32:39,580 --> 01:32:40,940
Who do we have on line two?

1170
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:44,460
- Just a fan.
- Hey, Mr. Fan, how you doing?

1171
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:47,740
Wanna say you're lucky to
be in the stadium tonight.

1172
01:32:48,020 --> 01:32:50,140
Really? Why's that?

1173
01:32:51,740 --> 01:32:54,620
- Is that a Giants watch I hear playing?
- Yes, it is.

1174
01:32:54,940 --> 01:32:57,700
- Is that my buddy Gil?
- Maybe.

1175
01:32:58,180 --> 01:33:01,340
This'll be one of the most amazing
nights in the game's history.

1176
01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:05,300
- "It'll be incredible."
- Really? Why's that, Gil?

1177
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:07,780
I'm telling you, the
Kirk Gibson homer...

1178
01:33:07,980 --> 01:33:11,220
...Ripken breaking Gehrig's
record, peanuts compared to tonight.

1179
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:14,380
<i>You're talking about classic
moments in baseball history.</i>

1180
01:33:14,700 --> 01:33:16,980
What's happening tonight
that could top those?

1181
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:18,900
Let's just say Bobby Rayburn's...

1182
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:21,220
- "... in for the night of his life."
- Why, Gil?

1183
01:33:21,580 --> 01:33:25,140
Well, some people are ungrateful.
They should be taught a lesson.

1184
01:33:26,860 --> 01:33:28,380
Strike!

1185
01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:35,300
Are you calling from inside the stadium?

1186
01:33:35,580 --> 01:33:38,740
- Wouldn't you like to know?
- "Well..."

1187
01:33:39,420 --> 01:33:43,260
You got good seats? Are you
behind first base? Can you see me?

1188
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:45,460
Can I see you?

1189
01:33:45,940 --> 01:33:49,220
<i>Yeah, you're waving right
at me. Have a nice night.</i>

1190
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:52,660
Gil, wait. Before you hang up,
I wanted to ask you a question.

1191
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:56,100
- Trying to trace the call, Jewel?
- What? What was that, Gil?

1192
01:33:56,380 --> 01:33:57,540
You'll never find me.

1193
01:34:00,060 --> 01:34:03,100
- Strike!
- Have a nice night.

1194
01:34:03,420 --> 01:34:05,700
Gil. Fuck!

1195
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:07,820
Come on, man, go get him!

1196
01:34:08,660 --> 01:34:10,300
Play!

1197
01:34:11,940 --> 01:34:13,740
Yes!

1198
01:34:26,340 --> 01:34:27,580
Shit.

1199
01:34:28,220 --> 01:34:31,100
<i>Now batting, number 10, Brad Tjader.</i>

1200
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:33,620
- Did you feel that raindrop?
- What?

1201
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:35,900
I felt rain.

1202
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:46,260
- The guy's not gonna be crazy enough...
- He's here! The guy's here.

1203
01:34:46,460 --> 01:34:49,620
- He could've been near a radio.
- He's in the stadium.

1204
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:55,100
Look at that. That is one
fine piece of craftsmanship.

1205
01:34:55,300 --> 01:34:56,900
- What?
- The knife.

1206
01:34:57,100 --> 01:34:59,700
It's a first edition. See
how it says "prototype?

1207
01:34:59,900 --> 01:35:02,860
That means it's a collector's piece.

1208
01:35:03,060 --> 01:35:07,180
"Renard & Garrity." It's a local
firm, isn't it? Gilbert Renard?

1209
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:20,620
What are you waiting
for, a clue, an invite?

1210
01:35:20,980 --> 01:35:24,820
This guy is gonna kill Bobby's kid
if you don't find him in nine innings.

1211
01:35:25,300 --> 01:35:28,740
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, leading
off the bottom of the eighth...</i>

1212
01:35:29,060 --> 01:35:31,340
<i>... number 33, Bobby Rayburn.</i>

1213
01:35:31,540 --> 01:35:35,580
Bobby's as safe as Kennedy was in
Dallas. What are you looking for?

1214
01:35:36,820 --> 01:35:38,620
Play!

1215
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:55,140
Ball one.

1216
01:35:55,420 --> 01:35:58,980
- What, are you walking me?
- Consider it a compliment, dickhead.

1217
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:02,220
Fuck! Do you know what
you're doing to me?!

1218
01:36:02,620 --> 01:36:05,100
- They're giving him first base.
- Throw the pitch!

1219
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:07,100
Fuck!

1220
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:16,700
<i>Fuck.</i>

1221
01:36:16,980 --> 01:36:19,660
Oh, man, the ump's gonna
call the game. Oh, my... Fuck.

1222
01:36:21,020 --> 01:36:23,500
Oh, God, please don't
do this. I'm begging you.

1223
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:25,340
Don't... Throw the pitch.

1224
01:36:25,540 --> 01:36:27,820
For God's sake, listen
to me! Throw the pitch!

1225
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:30,220
Throw the fucking pitch!

1226
01:36:31,300 --> 01:36:34,540
- Do you know what you're doing to me?
- "The umpire has decided..."

1227
01:36:34,740 --> 01:36:36,940
<i>... to send both teams into the dugouts.</i>

1228
01:36:37,220 --> 01:36:39,340
It looks like we've got a rain delay.

1229
01:36:42,140 --> 01:36:45,660
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the umpire
has called for a rain delay...</i>

1230
01:36:45,940 --> 01:36:50,180
<i>... with the Padres
leading the Giants 2 to 1.</i>

1231
01:36:56,500 --> 01:37:00,140
Do you and your dad have a special
place he and you like to go?

1232
01:37:01,100 --> 01:37:03,300
Stadium in the Sky's
our Little League park.

1233
01:37:03,780 --> 01:37:06,580
<i>My dad used to play
there when he was a kid.</i>

1234
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:10,140
Is my daddy in trouble?

1235
01:37:28,340 --> 01:37:29,580
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1236
01:37:29,780 --> 01:37:33,340
<i>... we resume play with the Giants
batting in the bottom of the eighth.</i>

1237
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:37,860
<i>Proceed to Little League park
Stadium in the Sky, 24th and Sanchez.</i>

1238
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:40,220
We pick it up in the eighth inning...

1239
01:37:40,540 --> 01:37:42,540
...on what might be
Rayburn's last at-bat.

1240
01:37:42,820 --> 01:37:44,460
They'll play on this wet field.

1241
01:37:44,740 --> 01:37:48,020
The cold night air is getting
to everybody. Look at Rayburn.

1242
01:37:48,300 --> 01:37:51,260
He's going to the mound to
have a chat with Martinez.

1243
01:37:52,980 --> 01:37:55,980
- Oh, shit.
- I don't give a fuck what he tells you.

1244
01:37:56,340 --> 01:37:59,340
Throw the ball over the plate,
or I'll break your head in.

1245
01:37:59,620 --> 01:38:01,340
- Fuck you.
- You hear me?

1246
01:38:03,260 --> 01:38:06,500
<i>This may go back to when
Martinez pitched for Pittsburgh.</i>

1247
01:38:07,100 --> 01:38:09,860
<i>He drilled Rayburn in
his back with a fastball.</i>

1248
01:38:10,060 --> 01:38:11,980
<i>We are seeing it all tonight, Rick.</i>

1249
01:38:14,460 --> 01:38:18,020
- Let's go, gentlemen.
- First pitch is at your head, buddy.

1250
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:20,020
Come on, man, do this! Do this!

1251
01:38:25,780 --> 01:38:29,620
<i>A critical at-bat for Rayburn, the
$40 million San Francisco Giant.</i>

1252
01:38:30,020 --> 01:38:32,420
<i>Probably his last chance
to get the Giants even.</i>

1253
01:38:32,780 --> 01:38:36,420
<i>Here in the bottom of the
eighth, the Giants trail 2 to 1.</i>

1254
01:38:40,740 --> 01:38:43,540
- "Swung on. Strike one."
- Strike!

1255
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:48,700
All right, come on! Come on, Bobby!

1256
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:08,660
<i>Swung on and missed. Strike
two. Rayburn in the hole.</i>

1257
01:39:08,940 --> 01:39:12,900
<i>One strike left for
Bobby Rayburn tonight.</i>

1258
01:39:13,260 --> 01:39:15,460
Jesus Christ, man.

1259
01:39:21,820 --> 01:39:25,340
<i>Air Seven copy. Proceeding
to Stadium in the Sky. Over.</i>

1260
01:39:27,180 --> 01:39:29,660
- Man.
- They're gonna call the game.

1261
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:32,140
They're gonna call this fucking game.

1262
01:39:57,940 --> 01:39:59,860
<i>Two and two. Two balls, two strikes.</i>

1263
01:40:00,180 --> 01:40:03,340
<i>And Rayburn down to his last strike.</i>

1264
01:40:04,300 --> 01:40:06,700
<i>Bobby knows he's had two
pitches to drive there.</i>

1265
01:40:06,980 --> 01:40:09,940
Now at 2-2, you're not gonna
get another good pitch to hit.

1266
01:40:10,220 --> 01:40:13,500
<i>Maybe, since it's damp, he's
having trouble holding the ball.</i>

1267
01:40:13,860 --> 01:40:15,900
This game could be called at any second.

1268
01:40:33,820 --> 01:40:36,220
Play ball!

1269
01:40:44,860 --> 01:40:47,460
<i>San Diego protecting its one-run lead.</i>

1270
01:40:47,620 --> 01:40:50,340
<i>Martinez readies,
steadies and delivers to...</i>

1271
01:40:50,620 --> 01:40:52,820
<i>Rayburn drives it deep
to right centre field!</i>

1272
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:55,020
- Yes!
- Yes! Go!

1273
01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:01,340
- Run!
- Home run!

1274
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:05,280
It's off the wall. Rayburn
could get three if he hustles.

1275
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:08,640
<i>Robinson having trouble
just getting to the ball.</i>

1276
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:11,720
<i>Rayburn, rounding
second, headed for third.</i>

1277
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:15,760
<i>He ran through the stop sign. It
could be an inside-the-park home run!</i>

1278
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:19,960
<i>The relay from Parker!
Rayburn slides, headfirst!</i>

1279
01:41:20,360 --> 01:41:21,680
<i>And he is...</i>

1280
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,120
<i>... in there!</i>

1281
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:24,960
Yes!

1282
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:26,480
You're out!

1283
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:29,080
What is that?

1284
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:30,800
Bad fucking call, man!

1285
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:33,760
- You're out! Sit down!
- No, no, no.

1286
01:41:34,160 --> 01:41:35,880
I beat it by a fucking mile!

1287
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:40,600
You're out. You're questioning my
call? Sit down! You're out! Sit down!

1288
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:48,160
You're the fucking guy!
He's the fucking guy!

1289
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:51,600
It's the umpire!

1290
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:15,000
What the fuck is that?

1291
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:17,800
This way! Break it open!

1292
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:23,440
- Shit.
- What the hell's going on?

1293
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:31,400
Okay, okay. I just want my kid back.

1294
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:34,760
Batter up, Bobby. I waited
a long time for this.

1295
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:38,880
No, no, no, wait. No. Okay, look.

1296
01:42:40,040 --> 01:42:42,920
- Where's Sean?
- Where do you think he is?

1297
01:42:43,320 --> 01:42:45,400
Come on, where is my son?

1298
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,880
Where's...? Bobby, where's my home run?

1299
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:52,800
What?! Curly. Curly. Where's my son?!

1300
01:42:54,160 --> 01:42:56,560
Where is he? I don't know.

1301
01:42:57,800 --> 01:42:59,880
I guess he's in that
big stadium in the sky.

1302
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:03,240
I'm telling you, Curly, if
you hurt my fucking kid...

1303
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:09,280
- ...I swear to God I'll kill you!
- Bobby. Bobby. Be nice, Bob.

1304
01:43:12,280 --> 01:43:14,280
What do you want from me?

1305
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:20,720
I don't want anything.
I just want you to...

1306
01:43:24,840 --> 01:43:28,080
- I never showed you my best pitch.
- Curly!

1307
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:47,000
Curly!

1308
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:52,640
Freeze!

1309
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:01,080
No, no, don't shoot! He's got my son.

1310
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:03,400
Now do you care?

1311
01:44:05,480 --> 01:44:07,520
Bobby, now do you care?

1312
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:11,840
Just a little bit?

1313
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:18,640
Curly, don't!

1314
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:44,040
Curly, where's my son?

1315
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:48,640
Where's Sean, Curly? Where's my son?

1316
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,600
A simple "thank you"
would have been nice.

1317
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:55,360
Where's my son?

1318
01:44:57,200 --> 01:44:59,600
Curly, where's my son?!

1319
01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:07,920
There she is, site of the old stadium.

1320
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:15,320
Sean!

1321
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:18,880
Sean!

1322
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:26,840
Sean!

1323
01:45:31,800 --> 01:45:33,720
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1324
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:36,240
- I love you, Sean.
- I love you, Dad.

1325
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:39,560
I got him!

1326
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:57,720
<i>What you are seeing here is
a sad turn of events indeed.</i>

1327
01:45:57,880 --> 01:46:00,120
<i>Gil Renard, an unemployed
knife salesman...</i>

1328
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:03,280
<i>... was shot to death by the
police during tonight's game.</i>

1329
01:46:03,640 --> 01:46:06,440
<i>Here's how it happened. Bobby Rayburn...</i>
