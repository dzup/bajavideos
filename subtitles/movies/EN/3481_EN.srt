48
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,100
Last night I had a dream about you

49
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:47,100
In this dream I'm dancing right beside you

50
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,700
And it looked like everyone was having fun

51
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:55,100
The kind of feeling I've waited so long

52
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,500
Don't stop come a little closer 

53
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,100
As we jam the rhythm gets stronger 

54
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,100
There's nothing wrong with just a little little fun 

55
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,800
We were dancing all night long 

56
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,800
The time is right to put my arms around you 

57
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,600
You're feeling right 
You wrap your arms around too 

58
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,700
But suddenly I feel the shining sun 

59
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,900
Before I knew it this dream was all gone 

60
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,200
Ooh...I don't know what to do...

61
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:37,700 
About this dream and you 
I wish this dream comes true 

62

We'll make this dream comes true 

65
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,000 
Why don't you play the game ?

66

What's going on 
Could this be my understanding

102
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,800 
It's not your fault 
I was being too demanding 

103
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,800 
I must admit it's my pride that made me distant

104
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:35,800  
All because I hoped that you'd be someone different 

105
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,800 
There's not much I know about you

106
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,200  
Fear will always make you blind

107
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,800 
But the answer is in clear view

108
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,800
It's amazing what you'll find face to face 

109
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,500
I turned away cause I thought you were the problem

110
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:32,500 
Tried to forget until I hit the bottom

111
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,500  
But when I faced you in my blank confusion 

112
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,000
I realized you weren't wrong, it was a mere illusion 

113
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,700
It really didn't make sense

114
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,800 
Just to leave this unresolved

115
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,700
It's not hard to go the distance

When you finally get involved face to face 

117
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:50,200 
It really didn't make sense
