00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:07,041
Huh, that's not after-school wear.

362

You forgot somebody else's keys.

Whose keys did you forget?

372

Oh, you're not old enough
to have an ex-husband.

Twenty-five.
How old are you?

Old enough to have an ex-husband.

So, you took his keys?

Uh, married too young
or grew separately as people?

What?

390
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:06,394
He fucks other women

811
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:55,934
[stuttering]
No, n-no--

812
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,597
But l haven't--

813
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,905
Because you haven't been
knocked up by an extra-large prick.

814
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:03,479
ls that his fault or yours?

815
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,013
l-l don't know.

816
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:07,606
He's so busy banging door
number two, how could you know?

817
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,243
Yeah, but they got--

818
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:13,255
Sh-She got--
[sighs] So fast.

819
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:14,949
And that means you can't.

820
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,355
No. No, l don't--

821
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,257
Have you had
yourself checked out?

822
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:19,329
No, no, but l'm going to--

823
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:21,056
Then how do you know?

824
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:25,698
lt's--
[panting]

825
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,136
What has this got
to do with construction?

826
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:34,506
Ah! That's good.
That's very good.

827
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:37,011
They-They really gonna ask
about this in the interview?

828
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:40,049
Mm, probably not.
What the--

829
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:41,310
Why are you doing this?

830
00:48:42,819 --> 00:48:44,753
Curious.

831
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:46,982
Why are you so curious about me?

832
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,955
Wh-What do you care?

833
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:54,558
Because l see you.
You're me.

834
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:57,498
Well, not as-as handsome, but--

835
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,796
l mean, look at yourself.

836
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:02,963
You're 25 years old, right?

837
00:49:03,073 --> 00:49:06,600
And you feel as old
as l did on my last birthday.

838
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:09,543
A busted marriage,
a shitty job,

839
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:12,547
convinced already that you're barren.
[sighs]

840
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:14,207
You lookin' back
from the warning track

841
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:16,445
thinkin' you've already
given away the good shit.

842
00:49:16,553 --> 00:49:19,044
And try as you may,
you cannot convince yourself

843
00:49:19,156 --> 00:49:20,589
that there's anything
left out there for you,

844
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:22,386
so why keep playing?

845
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:28,324
l know.

846
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,400
l know.

847
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,770
l sit here in this car,

848
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:39,808
with somebody l hardly know,

849
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:42,936
in a section of town l haven't
a fuckin' clue where l am.

850
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:44,809
Don't know my phone number,

851
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:46,746
don't know what day it is.

852
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:53,350
l don't think l even have
a real friend l could call.

853
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:58,962
And l reali<i>z</i>e that l could just...

854
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:03,433
disappear.

855
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:10,973
[chuckles]
Just...disappear.

856
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,570
[chuckles, sighs]

857
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:20,380
l don't have any friends.
l know you don't.

858
00:50:20,484 --> 00:50:22,179
l never had them.

859
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:26,218
Never, at no time.

860
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:29,486
And l know everybody.
[laughs]

861
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:34,360
l could be your friend.

862
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:37,900
No, you couldn't.
Nah.

863
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:40,094
No, you'd just want
to have sex with me.

864
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:43,070
[laughs]

865
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:45,898
Maybe you could.
[scoffs]

866
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:48,034
Do you play tennis?

867
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:50,545
You'd come over, hang out
at the house, meet the kids--

868
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:53,645
We could meet for
breakfast once a week.

869
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,911
You know we will never
see each other again.

870
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:58,214
Bullshit! Of course we will.

871
00:50:58,321 --> 00:51:02,314
Don't say that. Don't--
Let's not say what is not true.

872
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:04,917
Not-- Not here.

873
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:13,766
You know, maybe we should
just get you home.

874
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:14,802
Forget this whole stupid--

875
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,429
No, no. No.
Uh-uh-uh.

876
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:19,236
That's not you talking.
That's your blood sugar.

877
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:21,674
When did you eat last?
l don't-- What?

878
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:24,008
What do you eat in a day?

879
00:51:24,147 --> 00:51:27,014
l--
You do your protein in the morning?

880
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:29,415
See? That's it.
Everybody forgets that.

881
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:30,747
Everybody.

882
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:33,516
You know who told me that?
The Dalai Lama.

883
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:35,113
Protein fanatic.

884
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:36,522
Why do you think
he's smiling all the time?

885
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:38,287
Big pork chop under those robes.

886
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:41,990
You can't expect yourself
to deliver on an empty tank.

887
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:46,433
Right? You can't focus.
You like lentils?

888
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:50,699
Okay. Okay. Where can we score
some lentils around here?

889
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:53,940
Okay. Plan B.

890
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:59,639
Girl needs some protein.
Girl needs iron.

891
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:07,519
Hi. l was wondering
if you couldn't put together

892
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,387
a little veggie something for us--

893
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:12,587
l don't know, a little tomato,
a little cheese?

894
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:15,130
You know, something simple?

895
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:24,201
[burps, coughs]

896
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:27,505
[belches]
[both laughing]

897
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:39,780
[Scarlet]
Sorry. [laughs]

898
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:41,858
[Him]
You know what l like
to do sometimes?

899
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:42,890
Mm-mm.

900
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,756
When l'm feeling stale, you know?

901
00:52:44,861 --> 00:52:48,092
And l need to come
back to work fresh?

902
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:52,658
British. l do everything
with a British accent.

903
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:55,670
[British accent]
lt's quite pleasant, really.

904
00:52:55,772 --> 00:52:58,263
Clears the linguistic palate.

905
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:02,334
Breaks the monotony,
the needless anxiety.

906
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:03,810
Do try it.

907
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:06,878
Mm-hmm?
Yes, go on.

908
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:12,752
[imitating British accent]
Pleasant. Quite pleasant.

909
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:16,656
l say. Spot on, old girl.
Spot on.

910
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:23,193
You act all the time,
don't you?

911
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:26,235
[continues British accent]
l suppose when one's a pe<i>rf</i>ormer,

912
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:30,238
one does like doing
the acting thing, yes.

913
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,202
You love it.

914
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:36,370
With every ounce
of my magnificent body.

915
00:53:36,479 --> 00:53:40,040
Then, why don't you work?

916
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:43,679
Why-Why don't you commit?

917
00:53:46,923 --> 00:53:49,790
[sighs]
Well, that's--

918
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:53,226
That's the query, isn't it?

919
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:56,128
The Holy Grail.

920
00:53:58,602 --> 00:54:04,768
l suppose it has to do with agents,
lawyers, gardeners--

921
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:06,239
overhead.

922
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:10,970
Protecting one's quotes.

923
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:13,208
Dodging the creative bullet.

924
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:18,181
Judging, weighing, hiding.

925
00:54:18,288 --> 00:54:20,483
Teasing.

926
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:22,752
Seducing.

927
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:27,029
Being seduced.

928
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,960
[sighs]
Too soon you reali<i>z</i>e you've been

929
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:33,831
sitting quite sportily
on the sidelines for years.

930
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:43,208
Right, then.
10 items or less.

931
00:54:44,247 --> 00:54:47,910
Ten things you hate in your life,

932
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:50,111
things you loathe.

933
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,381
l believe l've named mine.
Oh.

934
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:55,822
Quickly now. Don't think.
Oh. Oh.

935
00:54:55,925 --> 00:55:00,624
Okay. Um, my feet.

936
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:01,822
Mm-hmm.

937
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:03,398
My marriage.

938
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,467
Mm-hmm.

939
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:08,135
My clothes.

940
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:10,832
Slow people.

941
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:12,908
Asking directions.

942
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:17,372
Paper and plastic.

943
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,607
[sighs deeply]

944
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:22,082
Lies.

945
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:26,788
Money. No. Needing money.

946
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:32,327
Needing.

947
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:37,792
Okay.

948
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:41,596
Ten items or less.

949
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:43,366
Ten things you fancy
most in your life.

950
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:44,440
Oh.

951
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:46,907
Ten things you would keep,
if you could only keep 10.

952
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:51,810
Okay, okay. Um.

953
00:55:51,915 --> 00:55:54,816
My car.
And it's a wonde<i>rf</i>ul car.

954
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:56,818
Thank you.

955
00:55:57,887 --> 00:56:00,287
My nephew.

956
00:56:01,324 --> 00:56:03,349
My toaster.

957
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:07,359
The tree behind my house.

958
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:11,596
[sighs]
Wind.

959
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:16,738
Music.
Any music.

960
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:20,999
My hair, when it's raining.

961
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:28,750
Mm.

962
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:34,784
That's only seven.

963
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:35,983
Yeah?

964
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:40,021
Your turn.
Ten item or less.

965
00:56:40,964 --> 00:56:43,159
Keepers.
Mm-hmm.

966
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:48,496
My wife.
My kids.

967
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:50,596
Their friends.

968
00:56:50,707 --> 00:56:53,938
Coffee at 5:30 in the morning.

969
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:56,011
A really good bowel movement.

970
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:00,447
No extra takes.

971
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:02,848
Uh, all 88 ivories.

972
00:57:02,952 --> 00:57:04,442

Right.

01:13:27,002 --> 01:13:29,197
But we're gonna go ahead,
and we're gonna give you--

1196
01:13:29,304 --> 01:13:32,398
We'll give you the second one
absolutely free.

1197
01:13:32,508 --> 01:13:34,408
Plus, the mop.
Plus!

1198
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:36,774
Right, for those of you
who let me know right now--

1199

You gotta cue 'em, okay? ''For those
of you who let me know right now.''

1200
01:13:40,449 --> 01:13:42,349
And always be nodding your head.

1201
01:13:42,451 --> 01:13:44,919
That's really, really important,
because it's almost like hypnosis.

Like, you nod your head,
they nod their head.

Okay! So--

1204
01:13:48,323 --> 01:13:51,622
They're convinced that it's a good price,
and they're gonna buy it.

1205
01:13:51,727 --> 01:13:52,694
Okay.

Never do anything negative.

1207
01:13:53,896 --> 01:13:56,126
And you always say, ''l know
you want one and you want one too.''

1208
01:13:56,231 --> 01:13:58,461
l assume before they even raise
their hand they want one.

1209
01:13:58,567 --> 01:13:59,499
They're already there.

''Here's what you're gonna take home.''

1211
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:03,000

give them the mop.

1218
01:14:16,485 --> 01:14:17,679
First, you need to nod your head.

1219
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:18,718
Nod your head.

1220
01:14:18,821 --> 01:14:20,254

1221
01:14:20,355 --> 01:14:24,052

01:14:26,495 --> 01:14:27,860
Yeah, you're buying this.

1225
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:30,830
Take home the first one, and we're
gonna throw in the second.

1226
