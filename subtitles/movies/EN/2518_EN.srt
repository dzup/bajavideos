00:01:25,363 --> 00:01:29,556
Hey! Come here! We have a man on the shore!
I'm on my way.

3
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,996
Are you here to kill me?

4
00:02:20,381 --> 00:02:23,476
I know what this is.

5
00:02:23,929 --> 00:02:28,730
I've seen one before.
Many, many years ago.

6
00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:36,218
It belonged to a man I met
in a half-remembered dream.

7
00:02:37,684 --> 00:02:42,818
A man possessed of some radical notions.

8
00:02:46,563 --> 00:02:52,999
What is the most resilient parasite?
Bacteria? A virus?

9
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:56,724
An intestinal worm?

10
00:02:56,732 --> 00:03:00,647
What Mr. Cobb is trying to say...
- An idea.

11
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:03,580
Resilient. Highly contagious.

12
00:03:03,702 --> 00:03:07,956
Once an idea has taken hold of the brain,
it's almost impossible to eradicate.

13
00:03:08,191 --> 00:03:12,187
An idea that is fully formed,
fully understood that sticks.

14
00:03:12,608 --> 00:03:15,893
- Right in there somewhere.
- For someone like you to steal?

15
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:18,861
Yes. In the dream state, your
conscious defense is lowered

16
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:22,986
and it makes your thoughts vulnerable to theft.
It's called extraction.

17
00:03:23,107 --> 00:03:26,706
Sir Saito, we can train your
subconscious to defend itself from even

18
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:30,382
- the most skilled extractor.
- How can I do that?

19
00:03:30,404 --> 00:03:33,747
Cause I am the most skilled extractor.

20
00:03:33,768 --> 00:03:36,152
I know how to search your
mind and find your secrets.

21
00:03:36,554 --> 00:03:40,359
I know the tricks. And I can teach them
to you so even when you're asleep

22
00:03:40,362 --> 00:03:43,567
your defense is never down.

23
00:03:43,803 --> 00:03:47,734
Look, if you want my help, you're gonna
have to be completely open with me.

24
00:03:47,737 --> 00:03:50,589
I need to know my way around
your thoughts better than your wife

25
00:03:50,793 --> 00:03:54,232
better than your therapist,
better than anyone.

26
00:03:54,355 --> 00:03:56,928
If this is a dream and you
have a safe full of secrets

27
00:03:56,981 --> 00:03:59,328
I need to know what's in that safe.

28
00:03:59,428 --> 00:04:03,948
In order for this all to work,
you need to completely let me in.

29
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:10,802
Enjoy your evening, gentlemen.
But I'll consider your proposal.

30
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:15,186
He knows.

31
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,957
What's going on up there?

32
00:05:12,976 --> 00:05:15,849
Saito knows.
He's playing with us.

33
00:05:15,852 --> 00:05:18,495
It doesn't matter.
I can get it here. Trust me.

34
00:05:18,497 --> 00:05:22,954
The information is in the safe.
He looked right at it when I mentioned "secrets".

35
00:05:23,716 --> 00:05:26,318
What's she doing here?

36
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,419
Just head back to the room, alright.
I'll take care of this.

37
00:05:30,422 --> 00:05:33,563
Okay, make sure you do.
We're here to work.

38
00:05:41,096 --> 00:05:45,765
If I jump, would I survive?

39
00:05:48,183 --> 00:05:52,221
A clean dive, perhaps.
Mal, what are you doing here?

40
00:05:52,223 --> 00:05:55,016
I thought you might be missing me.

41
00:05:55,019 --> 00:06:00,217
You know that I am.
But I can't trust you anymore.

42
00:06:00,859 --> 00:06:02,995
So what?

43
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,388
Looks like Arthur's taste.

44
00:06:05,795 --> 00:06:09,886
Actually, the subject is partial
disposal of British painters.

45
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:14,407
Please, have a seat.

46
00:06:21,001 --> 00:06:24,834
Tell me...
Did the two kids miss me?

47
00:06:28,342 --> 00:06:31,217
You can't imagine.

48
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:39,622
- What are you doing?
- Getting some fresh air. Stay where you are, Mal.

49
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:55,709
Goddamn it.

50
00:07:56,695 --> 00:08:01,829
- Turn around.
- Put the gun down.

51
00:08:08,894 --> 00:08:11,467
Please.

52
00:08:22,046 --> 00:08:24,921
Now, the envelope Mr. Cobb.

53
00:08:24,923 --> 00:08:28,661
Did she tell you?
Have you known all along?

54
00:08:28,784 --> 00:08:34,524
That you're here to steal from me
or that we are actually asleep?

55
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,626
I want to know the
name of your employer.

56
00:08:42,842 --> 00:08:46,017
There's no use in threatening
within a dream right, Mal?

57
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:52,449
That depends on what you're threatening.
Killing him will just wake him up.

58
00:08:52,571 --> 00:08:54,802
But pain...

59
00:08:57,811 --> 00:09:04,234
Pain is in the mind and judging by
the decor we're in your mind right, Arthur?

60
00:09:15,808 --> 00:09:19,204
- What are you doing? It's too soon!
- I know. But the dream has collapsed.

61
00:09:19,206 --> 00:09:23,398
Just try to keep Saito lie a little bit longer.
We're almost there.

62
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,434
This place.
The paintings.

63
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:57,022
Stop him!

64
00:10:22,267 --> 00:10:24,855
I think that's gonna work.
Wake him up!

65
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:47,570
You awake!

66
00:10:51,807 --> 00:10:53,731
- Give him the kick!
- What?

67
00:10:53,734 --> 00:10:55,567
Drop him.

68
00:11:39,305 --> 00:11:41,320
He's up.

69
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:48,251
You came prepared, hmm?

70
00:11:48,254 --> 00:11:50,680
Not even my head of security
knows this apartment.

71
00:11:50,682 --> 00:11:52,934
How did you find it?

72
00:11:52,936 --> 00:11:56,323
It's very difficult for a man of your position
to keep a love nest like this secret

73
00:11:56,325 --> 00:11:59,022
particularly when there's a
married woman involved.

74
00:11:59,024 --> 00:12:01,794
- She will never...
- Yet, here we are.

75
00:12:02,085 --> 00:12:04,780
- For the dilemma.
- They're getting closer.

76
00:12:04,783 --> 00:12:07,621
- You got what you need.
- Well, it's not true.

77
00:12:07,622 --> 00:12:10,280
You left out a key piece
of information, didn't you?

78
00:12:10,401 --> 00:12:13,658
You held something back because
you knew what we were up to.

79
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:15,899
Question is why do
you let us in at all?

80
00:12:15,953 --> 00:12:18,684
- An audition.
- An audition for what?

81
00:12:18,687 --> 00:12:21,001
Doesn't matter.
You failed.

82
00:12:21,123 --> 00:12:23,881
We extracted every bit of
information you had in there.

83
00:12:24,002 --> 00:12:26,438
But your dream approach is obvious.

84
00:13:07,013 --> 00:13:09,419
So leave me alone.

85
00:13:10,085 --> 00:13:13,727
You don't seem to understand, Mr. Saito.
The operation that hired us...

86
00:13:14,471 --> 00:13:18,428
they won't accept failure.
We won't last two days.

87
00:13:20,369 --> 00:13:21,641
Cobb?

88
00:13:21,643 --> 00:13:24,053
Looks like I'm gonna have to
do this a little more simply.

89
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,930
Tell us what you know!
Tell us what you know, now!

90
00:13:32,023 --> 00:13:35,307
I've always hated this carpet.

91
00:13:35,636 --> 00:13:45,107
It stain and fade in such distinctive ways.
That way you know it's made of wool.

92
00:13:45,156 --> 00:13:47,647
But now...

93
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:51,385
...a line of polyester.

94
00:13:54,127 --> 00:13:59,302
Which means I'm not lying on
my carpet in my apartment.

95
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:06,131
You have lived after your reputation, Mr. Cobb.
I'm still dreaming.

96
00:14:12,379 --> 00:14:15,500
- Where did he go?
- We're not getting paid.

97
00:14:19,508 --> 00:14:23,945
Dream within a dream, huh.
I'm impressed.

98
00:14:24,973 --> 00:14:28,702
But in my dream,
you play by my rules.

99
00:14:28,705 --> 00:14:32,284
- Yes, but you see Mr. Saito...
- We're not in your dream.

100
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:35,069
We're in mine.

101
00:14:44,124 --> 00:14:46,163
Asshole.
How did you mess up the carpet?

102
00:14:46,165 --> 00:14:48,682
- It wasn't my fault.
- You're the architect.

103
00:14:48,685 --> 00:14:52,233
- I don't know he's gonna rub his damn cheek on it!
- That's enough.

104
00:14:53,302 --> 00:14:56,693
- You, what the hell is all that?
- I have it under control.

105
00:14:56,816 --> 00:14:58,443
I didn't see it under control.

106
00:14:58,445 --> 00:15:02,282
We don't have time for this.
I'm getting off at Kyoto.

107
00:15:02,404 --> 00:15:04,560
Why?
We still have to check every compartment.

108
00:15:04,562 --> 00:15:07,003
I don't like trains.
Listen.

109
00:15:07,126 --> 00:15:09,990
Every man for himself.

110
00:16:23,246 --> 00:16:25,440
- Yes, hello.
- Hi, daddy.

111
00:16:25,562 --> 00:16:27,474
<i>Hi, dad..</i>

112
00:16:27,595 --> 00:16:31,086
Hey guys, hey.
How are you? How are you doing, huh?

113
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,339
<i>Good.
- Okay, I guess.</i>

114
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:41,793
- Okay? Who's just okay? Is that you, James?
- Yeah, when are you coming home, dad?

115
00:16:42,632 --> 00:16:45,330
Well, I can't sweetheart. I can't.

116
00:16:45,332 --> 00:16:48,876
- It's not for a while, remember?
- Why?

117
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:54,424
I told you, I'm away
because I'm working, right?

118
00:16:54,918 --> 00:16:58,216
Grandma says you're
never coming back.

119
00:16:58,478 --> 00:17:03,372
Phillipa, is that you?
Put grandma on the phone for me, will you?

120
00:17:03,493 --> 00:17:06,582
She's shaking her head.

121
00:17:07,336 --> 00:17:10,293
Let's just hope she's wrong about that.

122
00:17:10,965 --> 00:17:13,893
- Daddy?
- Yeah, James?

123
00:17:14,137 --> 00:17:16,542
<i>Is Mommy with you?</i>

124
00:17:18,414 --> 00:17:24,203
James, we've talked about this.
Mommy's not here anymore.

125
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,635
<i>Where?</i>

126
00:17:28,205 --> 00:17:30,856
<i>That's enough, kids.
Say bye bye..</i>

127
00:17:31,014 --> 00:17:34,386
Listen, I wanna send some
presents with grandpa, alright?

128
00:17:34,508 --> 00:17:37,446
And you be good... you be...

129
00:17:45,684 --> 00:17:48,037
- Our ride's on the roof.
- Alright.

130
00:17:55,447 --> 00:17:58,513
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

131
00:17:58,515 --> 00:18:01,800
- Why?
- Locked down in a dream, Mal showing up.

132
00:18:02,225 --> 00:18:04,619
Sorry about your leg,
it won't happen again.

133
00:18:04,622 --> 00:18:06,013
It's getting worse, isn't it?

134
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:08,375
One apology is all
you're getting huh, Arthur.

135
00:18:08,428 --> 00:18:11,172
- Where's Nash?
- He hasn't shown. You wanna wait?

136
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:14,511
No, we're supposed to go over Saito's
expansion plans in Cobol Engineering

137
00:18:14,514 --> 00:18:18,730
two hours ago. By now, they know we failed.
It's time we disappear.

138
00:18:19,104 --> 00:18:21,837
- Where would you even go?
- Buenos Aires.

139
00:18:21,886 --> 00:18:25,395
I'll cut my load, I may slip out a
job when things quiet down.

140
00:18:25,816 --> 00:18:27,768
- You?
- States, sir.

141
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:30,730
Send my regards.

142
00:18:35,701 --> 00:18:40,094
He sold the art. Fell off the company
and bargained for his life.

143
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,845
So I offer you the satisfaction.

144
00:18:47,113 --> 00:18:50,371
It's not the way I deal with things.

145
00:19:01,705 --> 00:19:04,731
- What will you do with him?
- Nothing.

146
00:19:05,335 --> 00:19:08,483
But I can't speak for Cobol Engineering.

147
00:19:22,345 --> 00:19:25,589
- What do you want from us?
- Inception.

148
00:19:27,212 --> 00:19:29,293
- Is it possible?
- Of course not.

149
00:19:29,295 --> 00:19:33,499
If you can steal an idea from someone's mind
why can't you plant one idea instead.

150
00:19:33,621 --> 00:19:36,826
Okay, here's me planting an idea in your head.
I say to you...

151
00:19:37,035 --> 00:19:38,579
"Don't think about elephants".

152
00:19:38,581 --> 00:19:40,452
- What are you thinking about?
- Elephants.

153
00:19:40,575 --> 00:19:43,922
Right. But it's not your idea
because you know I gave it to you.

154
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:47,294
The subject's mind can always
trace the genesis of the idea.

155
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:50,686
- True inspiration's impossible to fake.
- It's not true.

156
00:19:53,003 --> 00:19:55,989
- Can you do it?
- Are you offering me a choice?

157
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,913
Cause I can find my own
way to square things with Cobol.

158
00:19:59,034 --> 00:20:03,332
- You don't need to have a choice.
- And I choose to leave, sir.

159
00:20:08,129 --> 00:20:11,511
Tell the crew where you want to go.

160
00:20:15,022 --> 00:20:16,962
Hey, Mr. Cobb!

161
00:20:19,126 --> 00:20:23,546
How would you like to go home?
To America?

162
00:20:23,841 --> 00:20:27,357
- To your children?
- Can't fix that!

163
00:20:27,662 --> 00:20:30,750
- No one can!
- Just like inception.

164
00:20:30,871 --> 00:20:33,758
Cobb, come on.

165
00:20:36,249 --> 00:20:37,994
How complex is the idea?

166
00:20:37,995 --> 00:20:40,402
- Simple enough.
- No idea is simple...

167
00:20:40,523 --> 00:20:43,161
when you need to plant it
in somebody else's mind.

168
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:46,738
My main competitor is an
old man in poor health

169
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:51,191
His son will soon inherit
control of the corporation.

170
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:55,314
I need him to decide to
break up his father's empire.

171
00:20:55,869 --> 00:20:59,850
- Cobb, we should walk away from this.
- Hold on.

172
00:21:00,618 --> 00:21:05,817
If I were to do this... If I even could do it
I need a guarantee

173
00:21:05,994 --> 00:21:07,767
How do I know you can deliver?

174
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:09,683
You don't

175
00:21:10,022 --> 00:21:16,355
But I can.
So, do you want to take a leap of faith?

176
00:21:16,837 --> 00:21:23,654
Or become an old man filled
with regrets, waiting to die alone?

177
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:31,157
Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb.
And choose your people more wisely.

178
00:21:39,075 --> 00:21:42,373
Look, I know how much
you wanna go home.

179
00:21:43,745 --> 00:21:46,975
- But this can't be done.
- Yes, it can.

180
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:51,018
- You just have to go deep enough.
- You don't know that.

181
00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:54,277
I've done it before.

182
00:21:55,098 --> 00:21:57,897
Who'd you do it to?

183
00:22:01,504 --> 00:22:04,334
Are we going to Paris?

184
00:22:05,103 --> 00:22:08,208
We're gonna need a new architect.

185
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:26,601
You never did like your office, did you?

186
00:22:27,567 --> 00:22:30,845
No space to think in
that room covered.

187
00:22:32,265 --> 00:22:35,166
Is it safe for you to be here?

188
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:40,170
Extradition between France and the United States
is a bureaucratic nightmare, you know that.

189
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:43,295
I think they might find a way
to make it work in your case

190
00:22:43,534 --> 00:22:48,216
Look, I.. brought this for you to give
to the kids when you have a chance.

191
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,218
It will take more than the
occasional stuffed animal

192
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:54,071
to convince those children
they still have a father.

193
00:22:54,192 --> 00:22:55,410
I'm just doing what I know.

194
00:22:55,463 --> 00:22:59,106
- I'm doing what you taught me.
- I never taught you to be a thief.

195
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,705
No, you taught me to navigate people's
minds but after what happened

196
00:23:02,827 --> 00:23:06,941
They wanna hold our legitimate
ways for me to use that skill.

197
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,518
What are you doing here, Dom?

198
00:23:15,221 --> 00:23:17,404
I think I found a way home.

199
00:23:17,801 --> 00:23:21,436
It's a job for some very very
powerful people.

200
00:23:21,884 --> 00:23:25,046
People who I believe can
fix my charges permanently..

201
00:23:26,727 --> 00:23:31,286
- But I need your help.
- You're here to corrupt one of my brightest and best.

202
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,707
You know what I'm offering.
You have to let them decide for themselves.

203
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:39,010
- Money.
- Not just money. You remember. It's...

204
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:43,594
the chance to build cathedrals,
entire cities, things that never existed.

205
00:23:43,597 --> 00:23:46,492
Things that couldn't exist in the real world.

206
00:23:47,138 --> 00:23:51,962
So, you want me to let someone
else follow you into your fantasy.

207
00:23:52,213 --> 00:23:55,864
They don't actually come in to the dream.
They just design the levels...

208
00:23:55,994 --> 00:23:57,384
and teach them to the dreamers.
That's all.

209
00:23:57,704 --> 00:24:00,941
Design it yourself.

210
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:04,586
Mal won't let me.

211
00:24:09,499 --> 00:24:13,794
Come back to reality, Dom.
Please.

212
00:24:15,947 --> 00:24:20,543
Those kids, your grandchildren-
they're waiting for their father to come back home.

213
00:24:21,113 --> 00:24:26,465
That's their reality. And this job,
this last job that's how I get there.

214
00:24:26,586 --> 00:24:29,960
I would not be standing here
if I knew any other way.

215
00:24:33,163 --> 00:24:36,692
I need an architect
who's as good as I was.

216
00:24:40,507 --> 00:24:44,173
I got somebody better.
Ariadne?

217
00:24:46,172 --> 00:24:49,030
I'd like you to meet, Mr. Cobb.

218
00:24:49,033 --> 00:24:51,563
- Please to meet you.
- If you have a few moments...

219
00:24:51,566 --> 00:24:55,358
Mr. Cobb has a job offer
he'd like to discuss with you.

220
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:58,135
- Is the work pretty soon?
- Not exactly.

221
00:24:58,256 --> 00:25:02,484
- I have a test for you.
- You're not gonna tell me anything about this first?

222
00:25:02,606 --> 00:25:05,415
Before I describe the job,
I have to know you can do it.

223
00:25:05,442 --> 00:25:09,041
- Why?
- It's not, strictly speaking, legal.

224
00:25:12,542 --> 00:25:17,110
Two minutes, design a maze
that it takes one minute to solve.

225
00:25:18,204 --> 00:25:20,352
Stop.

226
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:23,636
Again.

227
00:25:25,238 --> 00:25:27,098
Stop.

228
00:25:29,567 --> 00:25:32,744
You have to do better than that.

229
00:25:44,999 --> 00:25:47,642
That's more like it.

230
00:26:06,187 --> 00:26:10,701
They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true
potential. Now, that's when we're awake.

231
00:26:11,302 --> 00:26:14,192
When we're asleep, the mind
can do almost anything.

232
00:26:14,661 --> 00:26:16,936
- Such as?
- Well, imagine you're designing a building, right?

233
00:26:17,057 --> 00:26:19,382
You consciously create each aspect.

234
00:26:19,624 --> 00:26:23,041
But sometimes, it feels like it's almost
creating itself. If you know what I mean.

235
00:26:23,094 --> 00:26:27,793
- Yeah, yeah. Like, uhmm, discovering.
- Genuine inspiration, right?

236
00:26:27,872 --> 00:26:32,111
Now in a dream, our mind
continuously does this. We...

237
00:26:32,232 --> 00:26:36,623
create and perceive our world simultaneously.

238
00:26:36,626 --> 00:26:38,124
And our mind does this so well

239
00:26:38,177 --> 00:26:40,139
that we don't even know it's happening.

240
00:26:40,142 --> 00:26:43,168
That allows us to get right
into the middle of that process.

241
00:26:43,221 --> 00:26:45,693
- How?
- By taking over the creating part.

242
00:26:45,747 --> 00:26:49,690
Now, this is where I need you.
You create the world of the dream.

243
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:52,165
We bring the subject into that dream.

244
00:26:52,167 --> 00:26:54,822
And they feel it's their subconscious.

245
00:26:54,944 --> 00:27:00,152
How can I ever acquire enough detail
to make them think that it's reality.

246
00:27:00,197 --> 00:27:03,650
Well, dreams they feel
real while we're in them, right?

247
00:27:03,947 --> 00:27:08,449
It's only when we wake up that we realize
something was actually strange.

248
00:27:08,916 --> 00:27:13,765
Let me ask you a question. You never really
remember the beginning of a dream, do you?

249
00:27:13,818 --> 00:27:17,026
You always wind up right in
the middle of what's going on.

250
00:27:17,147 --> 00:27:20,280
- I guess, yeah.
- So how did we end up here?

251
00:27:20,283 --> 00:27:24,253
- Well, we just came from the...
- Think about it, Ariadne.

252
00:27:24,701 --> 00:27:27,993
How did you get here?
Where are you right now?

253
00:27:32,137 --> 00:27:35,872
- We're dreaming?
- You're actually in the middle of the workshop right now, sleeping.

254
00:27:35,992 --> 00:27:39,258
And this is your first lesson in
shared dreaming, so there you go.

255
00:28:16,607 --> 00:28:19,215
If it's just a dream
then why are you...

256
00:28:19,461 --> 00:28:22,394
It's never just a dream, is it?
When your face is full of glass

257
00:28:22,448 --> 00:28:25,348
feels like hell.
When you're in it, it feels real.

258
00:28:25,684 --> 00:28:28,302
It's what the military developed.
During that time, it was a training program

259
00:28:28,896 --> 00:28:31,968
for soldiers to shoot and stab and
strangle each other and then wake up?

260
00:28:32,996 --> 00:28:34,811
How did architects think they belong?

261
00:28:35,367 --> 00:28:37,139
Well, someone had to
design the dreams, right?

262
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,834
- Why don't you give us another five minutes?
- Five minutes?

263
00:28:44,044 --> 00:28:46,262
We were talking for like at least an hour.

264
00:28:46,316 --> 00:28:48,885
In a dream, your mind functions
more quickly therefore...

265
00:28:48,918 --> 00:28:51,532
time seems to feel more slow.

266
00:28:52,071 --> 00:28:54,291
Five minutes in the world
gives you an hour in the dream.

267
00:28:55,981 --> 00:28:58,074
Why don't we see what you
can get up to in five minutes?

268
00:29:04,954 --> 00:29:07,852
We got the basic layout.
Bookstore, cafe.

269
00:29:07,883 --> 00:29:09,331
Almost everything else is here to.

270
00:29:09,484 --> 00:29:12,893
- Who are the people?
- Projections of my subconscious.

271
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:15,443
- Yours?
- Yes. Remember, you are the dreamer.

272
00:29:15,735 --> 00:29:19,401
You built this world. I am the
subject, my mind populates it.

273
00:29:19,522 --> 00:29:21,744
You can literally talk
to my subconscious.

274
00:29:21,748 --> 00:29:24,097
That's one of the ways we extract
information from a subject.

275
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:27,611
- How else do you do it?
- By creating something secure, like a...

276
00:29:28,385 --> 00:29:30,389
like a bank vault or a jail.

277
00:29:30,474 --> 00:29:33,086
The mind automatically fills it with
information it's trying to protect.

278
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,667
- Understand?
- Then you break in and steal it.

279
00:29:37,385 --> 00:29:38,565
Well...

280
00:29:38,585 --> 00:29:44,345
I guess I thought that the dream space should
be all about the visual but it's more about the feel of it.

281
00:29:44,869 --> 00:29:48,862
My question is, what happens when you
start messing with the physics of it all?

282
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:34,960
- Something, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

283
00:30:59,228 --> 00:31:01,272
Why are they all looking at me?

284
00:31:01,352 --> 00:31:04,902
Cause my subconscious feels that
someone else is creating this world.

285
00:31:05,024 --> 00:31:07,473
The more you change things,
the quicker the projections

286
00:31:07,526 --> 00:31:09,293
start to converge them.

287
00:31:09,295 --> 00:31:12,281
- Converge?
- It sense the foreign nature of the dreamer.

288
00:31:12,879 --> 00:31:15,497
They attack like white blood
cells fighting an infection.

289
00:31:15,551 --> 00:31:19,659
- Are they going to attack us?
- No. Just you.

290
00:31:25,142 --> 00:31:28,074
This is great but I'm telling you,
if you keep changing things like this...

291
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:35,175
Jesus. Mind telling your
subconscious to take it easy?

292
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:38,057
It's my subconscious.
Remember, I can't control it.

293
00:32:31,834 --> 00:32:33,273
Very impressive.

294
00:32:44,893 --> 00:32:48,486
I know this bridge.
This place is real, isn't it?

295
00:32:48,578 --> 00:32:50,677
Yeah, I cross it everyday
to get to the college.

296
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:52,692
Never recreate places from your memory.

297
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,646
Always imagine new places.

298
00:32:54,763 --> 00:32:56,366
Well, you gotta draft from
stuff you know, right?

299
00:32:56,499 --> 00:32:59,511
Only use details.
A street lamp or a phone booth.

300
00:32:59,724 --> 00:33:01,354
- Never entire areas.
- Why not?

301
00:33:01,655 --> 00:33:04,384
Because building a dream from
your memory is the easiest way

302
00:33:04,385 --> 00:33:06,719
to lose your grasp from what's
real and what is a dream.

303
00:33:06,721 --> 00:33:08,053
Is that what happened to you?

304
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,279
Listen to me.
This has nothing to do with me, understand?

305
00:33:10,554 --> 00:33:12,390
Is that why you need me
to build your dreams?

306
00:33:13,138 --> 00:33:15,477
Get off of her.
Back up.

307
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,861
- Back up!
- Cobb!

308
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:19,355
- Get off me!
- Let me go!

309
00:33:19,378 --> 00:33:20,839
- Don't! Mal!
- Cobb!

310
00:33:21,161 --> 00:33:22,117
- Mal!
- Wake me up!

311
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:23,508
- Mal!
- Wake me up!

312
00:33:23,561 --> 00:33:25,634
- Mal, No! No!
- Wake me up!

313
00:33:25,687 --> 00:33:26,287
Mal, no!

314
00:33:27,762 --> 00:33:30,313
Hey, hey, hey, look at me.
You're okay.

315
00:33:30,579 --> 00:33:34,449
- You're okay.
- Why... why wouldn't I wake up?

316
00:33:34,619 --> 00:33:38,464
Cause there were still some time on the
clock and you can't wake up within a dream

317
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:39,503
unless you die.

318
00:33:39,635 --> 00:33:40,838
- Show me the totem.
- What?

319
00:33:41,505 --> 00:33:45,196
- A totem, it's a small, personal...
- That's some subconscious you got on you, Cobb!

320
00:33:46,117 --> 00:33:49,214
- She's a real charmer.
- Oh I see, you met Mrs. Cobb.

321
00:33:49,667 --> 00:33:51,916
- She's his wife.
- Yeah. So, a totem.

322
00:33:52,378 --> 00:33:56,285
You need a small object to potentially have you...
something you have all the time.

323
00:33:56,339 --> 00:33:57,203
that no one else knows.

324
00:33:57,257 --> 00:33:59,747
- Like a coin?
- No. It must be more unique than that.

325
00:34:00,674 --> 00:34:02,842
This is a loaded die.

326
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:07,848
I can't let you touch it.
That would defeat the purpose.

327
00:34:07,918 --> 00:34:11,510
Only I, know the balance and the
weight of this particular loaded die.

328
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:13,941
That way, when you
look at your totem,

329
00:34:13,995 --> 00:34:16,301
You know beyond a doubt
that you're not in someone else's dream.

330
00:34:20,505 --> 00:34:24,789
I don't know if you can't see what's
going on or if you just don't want to

331
00:34:25,381 --> 00:34:28,284
but Cobb has some serious problems
that he's trying to bury down there.

332
00:34:28,522 --> 00:34:32,154
And I'm not about to just open
my mind to someone like that.

333
00:34:38,334 --> 00:34:42,412
She'll be back. I've never seen anyone
pick it up that quickly before.

334
00:34:42,804 --> 00:34:45,889
Reality is not gonna be enough for her now.
And when she comes back...

335
00:34:47,682 --> 00:34:50,064
If she comes back, you're gonna
have her building mazes.

336
00:34:50,118 --> 00:34:52,162
- Where are you gonna be?
- I gotta go visit Eames.

337
00:34:52,762 --> 00:34:55,997
Eames? No, he's in Mombasa.
It's Cobol's backyard.

338
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,933
- It's a necessary risk.
- There is plenty of good thieves.

339
00:34:59,383 --> 00:35:03,584
We don't just need a thief.
We need a forger.

340
00:35:11,789 --> 00:35:14,226
You can rub them together all you want,
but they're not gonna breed.

341
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:17,940
- You'll never know.
- Let me get you a drink.

342
00:35:21,363 --> 00:35:22,161
You might.

343
00:35:29,305 --> 00:35:31,265
- Your spelling hasn't improved.
- Test me.

344
00:35:31,318 --> 00:35:33,252
How's your handwriting?

345
00:35:33,655 --> 00:35:35,069
- The best in town.
- Good.

346
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:36,741
Thank you very much.

347
00:35:37,298 --> 00:35:38,233
Inception.

348
00:35:38,832 --> 00:35:42,402
Now, before you bother
telling me it's impossible...

349
00:35:42,799 --> 00:35:45,602
No, it's perfectly possible.
It's just bloody difficult.

350
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:49,432
- Interesting.
- So Arthur keeps telling me it can't be done.

351
00:35:50,096 --> 00:35:52,484
Arthur...
You still work with that stick and mind?

352
00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:56,554
- He's good at what he does, right?
- Oh, he's the best. He has no imagination.

353
00:35:56,609 --> 00:35:57,446
Not like you.

354
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:00,339
Listen, if you're gonna perform
inception you need imagination.

355
00:36:00,865 --> 00:36:04,231
Let me ask you something.
Have you done it before?

356
00:36:04,849 --> 00:36:08,382
We tried it. We got the idea in
place. But it didn't take.

357
00:36:08,483 --> 00:36:11,122
- You didn't plant it deep enough?
- No, it's not just about depth.

358
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:15,046
You need the simplest version
of the idea in order for it...

359
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:17,229
to grow naturally in your subjects.
Mind is a very subtle art.

360
00:36:17,567 --> 00:36:20,679
So what is this idea that you need to plant?

361
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:24,555
We need the heir of a major corporation
to dissolve his father's empire.

362
00:36:25,146 --> 00:36:29,011
Well. you see right there, you have various political
motivations and anti-manipulistic sentiments to set forth.

363
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:33,683
And with all that stuff, it's really
at the mercy of your subject's prejudice.

364
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:37,462
And what you have to do is
start with the absolute basic.

365
00:36:37,713 --> 00:36:41,249
- Which is what?
- The relationship with the father.

366
00:36:43,891 --> 00:36:45,860
- Do you have a chemist?
- No, not yet.

367
00:36:45,876 --> 00:36:52,617
Alright, well there is a man here. Yusuf.
He formulate his own versions of the compounds.

368
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,016
- When are you taking me there?
- Once you lost your tail.

369
00:36:55,788 --> 00:36:58,132
- Men at the bar.
- Cobol Engineering.

370
00:36:58,665 --> 00:37:01,106
That price on my head,
was that dead or alive?

371
00:37:01,389 --> 00:37:03,521
I don't remember.
Let's see if they start shooting.

372
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,827
Run interference. I'll meet you downstairs
in the bar in, say, in half an hour.

373
00:37:07,884 --> 00:37:09,835
- Be back here?
- It's the last place they'd suspect.

374
00:37:12,316 --> 00:37:12,915
Alright.

375
00:37:15,008 --> 00:37:18,542
Freddy! Freddy Simmons.
My God, it's you, isn't it?

376
00:37:19,903 --> 00:37:21,935
- Who?
- No, it isn't.

377
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,981
You're not dreaming now, are you?

378
00:37:43,186 --> 00:37:44,861
Stay out!

379
00:38:02,918 --> 00:38:06,266
No, cafe.
One cafe.

380
00:38:20,084 --> 00:38:21,120
Cafe.

381
00:39:16,839 --> 00:39:18,119
Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?

382
00:39:19,988 --> 00:39:23,238
- What are you doing in Mombasa?
- I need to protect my investments.

383
00:39:26,672 --> 00:39:28,840
Ah, so this is your idea
of losing your tail, huh.

384
00:39:28,894 --> 00:39:30,274
Different tail.

385
00:39:39,278 --> 00:39:40,389
Cobb said you'd be back.

386
00:39:42,167 --> 00:39:45,294
- I tried not to come, but...
- But there's nothing quite like it.

387
00:39:45,812 --> 00:39:49,657
It's just... pure creation.

388
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,624
Shall we take a look at some paradoxical architecture?
You're gonna have to master a few tricks

389
00:39:54,677 --> 00:39:56,775
if you're gonna build three
complete dream levels.

390
00:39:56,829 --> 00:39:59,884
- Excuse me.
- What kind of tricks?

391
00:40:00,261 --> 00:40:03,274
In a dream, you can cheat
architecture into impossible shapes.

392
00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:07,843
That lets you create closed loops.
Like the Penrose Steps.

393
00:40:08,261 --> 00:40:10,097
Infinite staircase.

394
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:16,261
See?

395
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:24,772
Paradox. So a closed loop like that will help you
disguise the boundaries of the dream you create.

396
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,570
How big do these levels have to be?

397
00:40:27,905 --> 00:40:30,733
It could be anything from the
floor of a building to an entire city.

398
00:40:30,758 --> 00:40:32,602
But they have to be complicated enough...

399
00:40:32,932 --> 00:40:34,289
that we can hide from the projection.

400
00:40:34,342 --> 00:40:35,899
- A maze.
- Right, a maze.

401
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,434
- And the better the maze...
- Then the longer we have...

402
00:40:38,487 --> 00:40:41,061
- ... before the projections catch us?
- Exactly.

403
00:40:42,446 --> 00:40:44,226
My subconscious
seems quiet enough.

404
00:40:44,372 --> 00:40:45,591
You wait till it turns ugly.

405
00:40:46,388 --> 00:40:48,731
No one likes to feel someone else
is messing around with their mind.

406
00:40:49,366 --> 00:40:51,208
Cobb can't build anymore, can he?

407
00:40:52,884 --> 00:40:54,999
I don't know if he can't,
but he won't.

408
00:40:55,401 --> 00:40:57,710
He thinks it's safer if
he doesn't know the layouts.

409
00:40:57,828 --> 00:40:59,755
- Why?
- He won't tell me.

410
00:40:59,772 --> 00:41:01,516
But I think it's Mal.

411
00:41:01,997 --> 00:41:04,066
- His ex-wife?
- No, not his ex.

412
00:41:04,142 --> 00:41:06,603
- They're still together?
- No, she's...

413
00:41:08,089 --> 00:41:09,611
She's dead.

414
00:41:11,514 --> 00:41:14,279
What you're seeing there
is just his projection of her.

415
00:41:18,482 --> 00:41:21,768
- What was she like in real life?
- She's lovely.

416
00:41:25,821 --> 00:41:28,112
- You are seeking a chemist?
- Yes.

417
00:41:28,308 --> 00:41:30,061
To formulate compounds for a job?

418
00:41:30,723 --> 00:41:35,163
- And to go into the field with us.
- No, I rarely go into the field, Mr. Cobb.

419
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:39,223
We'd need you there to tell the
compounds specific to our needs.

420
00:41:39,531 --> 00:41:41,621
- Which are?
- Great depth.

421
00:41:41,623 --> 00:41:44,245
A dream within a dream?
Two levels?

422
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:48,599
Three.

423
00:41:48,653 --> 00:41:52,508
Not possible. That many dreams
within dreams is too unstable.

424
00:41:52,558 --> 00:41:59,332
- It is possible you just had to have a sedative.
- Well, powerful sedative.

425
00:42:01,294 --> 00:42:03,046
- How many team members?
- Five

426
00:42:03,842 --> 00:42:04,442
Six.

427
00:42:05,674 --> 00:42:10,449
The only way to know you've
done the job is if I am with you.

428
00:42:10,655 --> 00:42:13,483
There's no room for tourists
on a job like this, Mr. Saito.

429
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:15,728
This time, it seems there is.

430
00:42:17,269 --> 00:42:20,623
This, I think, is a good place to start.
I use it everyday.

431
00:42:21,246 --> 00:42:23,338
- What for?
- Yeah, I'll show you.

432
00:42:27,505 --> 00:42:33,083
- Perhaps you will not want to see.
- After you.

433
00:42:42,157 --> 00:42:46,234
Six, ten, twelve.
All connected, bloody animal.

434
00:42:46,288 --> 00:42:47,839
They come everyday to share the dream.

435
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:52,848
You see?
Very stable.

436
00:42:59,407 --> 00:43:03,015
- How long do they dream for?
- Three, four hours, each day.

437
00:43:03,029 --> 00:43:06,136
- And the dream time?
- With this compound?

438
00:43:06,139 --> 00:43:09,757
- About forty hours, each and every day.
- Why do they do it?

439
00:43:09,846 --> 00:43:10,896
Tell him, Mr. Cobb.

440
00:43:12,846 --> 00:43:16,327
After a while it becomes the
only way you can dream.

441
00:43:16,378 --> 00:43:18,552
Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?

442
00:43:18,555 --> 00:43:21,436
- They come here everyday to sleep?
- No.

443
00:43:23,355 --> 00:43:29,681
They come to be woken up.
The dream has become their reality.

444
00:43:31,706 --> 00:43:34,294
Who are you to say otherwise, huh?

445
00:43:36,265 --> 00:43:37,581
Let's see what you can do.

446
00:43:49,362 --> 00:43:52,212
You know how to find me.

447
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,420
You know what you have to do.

448
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:01,642
Sharp enough?

449
00:44:16,916 --> 00:44:19,271
Are you alright, Mr. Cobb?

450
00:44:20,285 --> 00:44:23,377
Yeah, yeah.
I'm just fine.

451
00:44:32,481 --> 00:44:36,584
Robert Fischer, heir to the
Fischer-Morrow energy conglomerate.

452
00:44:36,634 --> 00:44:38,528
What's your problem
with this Mr. Fischer?

453
00:44:38,578 --> 00:44:40,650
That's not your concern.

454
00:44:40,704 --> 00:44:44,602
Mr. Saito, this isn't your typical
corporate espionage.

455
00:44:45,207 --> 00:44:50,148
You asked me for inception. I do hope you
understand the gravity of that request.

456
00:44:50,865 --> 00:44:54,638
The seed that we plant in this
man's mind will grow into an idea.

457
00:44:54,695 --> 00:44:57,864
This idea will define him.
It may come to change...

458
00:44:58,767 --> 00:45:00,842
It may come to change
everything about him.

459
00:45:00,863 --> 00:45:04,784
We're the last company standing between
them and total energy dominance.

460
00:45:05,257 --> 00:45:09,743
We can no longer compete.
Soon, they'll control the energy supply

461
00:45:09,796 --> 00:45:13,635
of half the world.
In effect, they become a new superpower.

462
00:45:15,096 --> 00:45:18,186
The world needs Robert Fischer
to change his mind.

463
00:45:18,626 --> 00:45:23,384
That's where we come in.
How is Robert Fischer's relationship with his father?

464
00:45:23,645 --> 00:45:26,665
Rumor is, the relationship
is quite complicated.

465
00:45:26,771 --> 00:45:29,347
But we can't work based
solely on rumor, can't we?

466
00:45:29,395 --> 00:45:34,468
Can you get me access to this man here?
Browning, Fischer Sr's right hand man.

467
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:36,673
Fischer Jr's godfather.

468
00:45:36,727 --> 00:45:40,193
It should be possible.
If you can get the right references.

469
00:45:40,376 --> 00:45:44,362
References are something
of a specialty for me, Mr. Saito.

470
00:45:45,416 --> 00:45:48,814
I'm not smelling settlement here.
Take them down.

471
00:45:48,868 --> 00:45:52,963
Mr. Browning, Maurice Fischer's
policy is always one of avoiding litigation.

472
00:45:57,462 --> 00:46:00,783
Shall we voice your
concerns with Maurice directly?

473
00:46:01,248 --> 00:46:04,569
- Not sure if that's necessary.
- No, no, no. I think we should.

474
00:46:26,675 --> 00:46:31,455
How is he?
I don't wanna bother him unnecessarily, but...

475
00:46:31,784 --> 00:46:37,173
Robert, did I tell you to keep out of town...
Wait, just do it.

476
00:46:37,262 --> 00:46:38,253
No, don't speak, Mr. Fischer.

477
00:46:38,707 --> 00:46:41,809
Follow through!

478
00:46:42,063 --> 00:46:45,846
Never.
Never gonna send what I asked.

479
00:46:45,899 --> 00:46:48,310
Leave town.

480
00:46:50,665 --> 00:46:52,507
Terrible.

481
00:46:54,966 --> 00:46:58,018
Must be a cherish memory of his.

482
00:46:58,613 --> 00:47:02,826
I put it beside his bed.
He hasn't even noticed.

483
00:47:03,485 --> 00:47:09,666
Robert... we need to talk about the power of attorney.

484
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,159
- I know this is hard right now.
- Not now, Uncle Peter.

485
00:47:11,213 --> 00:47:12,964
but it's imperative that we start to...

486
00:47:17,217 --> 00:47:19,263
The vultures are circling.

487
00:47:19,418 --> 00:47:22,564
The sicker Maurice Fischer becomes,
the more powerful Peter Browning becomes.

488
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,915
I've had ample opportunity
to observe Browning...

489
00:47:26,628 --> 00:47:31,035
adopt his physical presence,
study his mannerisms, and so on and so forth.

490
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:34,400
Now, in the first layer of the dream,
I can impersonate Browning.

491
00:47:35,015 --> 00:47:38,433
And suggest concepts to
Fischer's conscious mind.

492
00:47:38,514 --> 00:47:41,051
Then, when we take
him a level deeper his own

493
00:47:41,205 --> 00:47:44,503
projection of Browning should,
should feedback right back to him.

494
00:47:44,556 --> 00:47:47,133
- So he gives himself the idea.
- Precisely.

495
00:47:48,028 --> 00:47:50,563
That's the only way it will stick.
He has to see himself generate it.

496
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:53,618
Eames, I am impress.

497
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:57,849
Your confession, has always as
much appreciated, Arthur, thank you.

498
00:48:19,011 --> 00:48:21,232
Were you going out there on your own?

499
00:48:21,297 --> 00:48:24,230
No, no. I was just...
just running some experiments.

500
00:48:25,085 --> 00:48:27,379
I didn't realize anyone was here.
So...

501
00:48:27,457 --> 00:48:31,449
- Yeah, I was just, I was working on my totem actually.
- Here, let me take a look.

502
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,825
So you're learning, huh?

503
00:48:34,904 --> 00:48:38,052
An elegant solution for
keeping track of reality.

504
00:48:39,205 --> 00:48:42,865
- Was it your idea?
- No, it was... it's Mal's, actually.

505
00:48:42,902 --> 00:48:48,407
This. This one was hers.
You spin it in a dream and it would never topple.

506
00:48:48,418 --> 00:48:51,873
Just... spin and spin.

507
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:58,416
- Arthur told me she past away.
- How are the mazes coming on?

508
00:48:58,876 --> 00:49:02,133
Each level relates to the part of
the subject's subconscious that...

509
00:49:02,188 --> 00:49:03,629
we are trying to access.

510
00:49:03,683 --> 00:49:08,777
So, making the bottom level, hospitals.
So Fischer will bring his father.

511
00:49:09,024 --> 00:49:12,289
Actually I have a question
about this layout.

512
00:49:12,336 --> 00:49:16,517
No, no, no. Don't show me specifics.
Only the dreamer should know the layout.

513
00:49:17,525 --> 00:49:18,617
Why is that so important?

514
00:49:18,971 --> 00:49:20,745
In case one of us brings in our projections

515
00:49:20,799 --> 00:49:23,175
we don't want them knowing
the details of the maze.

516
00:49:24,158 --> 00:49:27,066
You mean, in case you bring Mal in.

517
00:49:27,283 --> 00:49:31,101
- Well, you can't keep her out, can you?
- Right.

518
00:49:31,517 --> 00:49:35,231
You can't build because if you
know the maze then she knows it.

519
00:49:35,824 --> 00:49:38,195
Which should sabotage the whole operation.

520
00:49:38,211 --> 00:49:40,505
- Cobb, did the others know?
- No. No, they don't.

521
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:42,984
You gotta warn them
if this is getting worse.

522
00:49:43,038 --> 00:49:45,698
No one said it's getting worse.

523
00:49:46,051 --> 00:49:49,441
I need to get home.
That's all I care about right now.

524
00:49:50,729 --> 00:49:58,107
- Why can't you go home?
- Because they think I killed her.

525
00:50:01,272 --> 00:50:03,551
- Thank you.
- For what?

526
00:50:03,784 --> 00:50:05,943
For not asking whether I did.

527
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:16,204
That's why we need to plant
it deep in the subconscious.

528
00:50:16,397 --> 00:50:20,053
Subconscious is motivated by emotion, right?
Not reason.

529
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:23,810
We need to find a way to translate
this into an emotional concept.

530
00:50:23,847 --> 00:50:25,815
How do you translate a
business strategy to an emotion?

531
00:50:26,407 --> 00:50:27,855
That's what we're here to figure out, right?

532
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:31,390
Now, Robert's relationship with his
father is stressed, to say the least.

533
00:50:31,668 --> 00:50:32,862
I can't remember that.

534
00:50:32,916 --> 00:50:36,601
Because suggesting him to break up his
father's company is a "screw you" to the old man.

535
00:50:36,789 --> 00:50:38,323
No, cause I think positive emotion...

536
00:50:38,477 --> 00:50:40,472
triumphs negative emotion everytime.

537
00:50:40,566 --> 00:50:43,555
We're all hearing for a reconciliation.
A catharsis.

538
00:50:44,584 --> 00:50:48,169
We need Robert Fischer to have a
positive emotional reaction to all this.

539
00:50:48,217 --> 00:50:50,208
Alright, well, try this.

540
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:55,089
"My father accepts that I want to create
for myself not follow in his footsteps. "

541
00:50:55,588 --> 00:50:57,968
That might work.
Might.

542
00:50:58,469 --> 00:51:00,418
We're gonna need to do a little
better than might.

543
00:51:00,463 --> 00:51:02,015
Thank you for your contribution, Arthur.

544
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:05,088
Forgive me for wanting a little specificity,
Eames.

545
00:51:05,268 --> 00:51:08,759
- Specificity?
- Inception is not about being specific.

546
00:51:08,812 --> 00:51:12,073
When we get inside his mind, we're gonna
have to work at what we find.

547
00:51:13,574 --> 00:51:17,251
On the top level, we open up
his relationship with his father.

548
00:51:17,346 --> 00:51:20,627
And seed...
"I will not follow in my father's footsteps".

549
00:51:20,697 --> 00:51:25,371
And the next level down, we feed him with:
"I will create something for myself".

550
00:51:26,046 --> 00:51:28,483
By the time we hit the bottom level,
we bring out the big guns.

551
00:51:28,488 --> 00:51:30,953
- "My father doesn't want me to be him".
- Exactly.

552
00:51:32,144 --> 00:51:36,348
With three layers down, the dreams are
gonna collapse with the slightest disturbance.

553
00:51:36,503 --> 00:51:37,952
Sedation.

554
00:51:37,989 --> 00:51:41,246
For a sleep stable enough to
create three layers of dreaming

555
00:51:41,272 --> 00:51:44,202
we have to combine with
an extremely powerful sedative.

556
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:57,554
Good night.

557
00:51:58,337 --> 00:52:00,106
The compound that'll be
used to share the dream

558
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,002
creates avery clear
connection between dreamers

559
00:52:02,055 --> 00:52:04,702
plus actually accelerating brain function.

560
00:52:04,711 --> 00:52:07,092
In other words, it gives us
more time on each level.

561
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:10,140
Brain function in the dream
will be about twenty times normal.

562
00:52:10,348 --> 00:52:13,733
When you enter a dream within that dream
the effect is compounded.

563
00:52:13,794 --> 00:52:17,636
- It's three dreams, that's 10 hours, that's twenty...
- I'm sorry, math is never my strong subject.

564
00:52:17,657 --> 00:52:21,771
- How much time is that?
- It's a week the first level down.

565
00:52:21,976 --> 00:52:25,512
Six months the second level
and the third level...

566
00:52:25,566 --> 00:52:27,647
Is ten years.

567
00:52:29,298 --> 00:52:32,219
Who would wanna be stuck
in a dream for ten years?

568
00:52:32,272 --> 00:52:33,856
Depends on the dream.

569
00:52:33,877 --> 00:52:36,545
So once we've made the plants
how do we get out?

570
00:52:36,547 --> 00:52:39,762
I'm hoping you have something more elegant
in mind than shooting me in the head.

571
00:52:39,778 --> 00:52:42,081
- A kick.
- What's a kick?

572
00:52:42,536 --> 00:52:46,369
This, Ariadne, would be a kick.

573
00:52:47,485 --> 00:52:49,920
It's that feeling of falling,
you get the jolts, you awaken

574
00:52:50,574 --> 00:52:51,825
snaps you out of the dream.

575
00:52:51,879 --> 00:52:53,621
Are we gonna feel a kick
with this kind of sedation?

576
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:55,225
Oh, that's the counterpart.

577
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,929
I've customized it to leave
any ear function unimpaired.

578
00:52:58,513 --> 00:53:02,378
That way, however deep the sleep,
the sleeper still feels falling.

579
00:53:03,655 --> 00:53:06,050
Or tipping.

580
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:08,432
The trick is to synchronize a kick

581
00:53:08,587 --> 00:53:11,283
that can penetrate all three levels.

582
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:14,154
We can use a musical content
to synchronize the different kicks.

583
00:53:22,653 --> 00:53:26,617
He doesn't have any surgery scheduled,
No dental, nothing.

584
00:53:26,694 --> 00:53:28,558
Wasn't he suppose to
have a knee operation?

585
00:53:28,572 --> 00:53:33,633
Nothing. Nothing that will put him under for any REM.
We need... We need at least a good ten hours.

586
00:53:33,693 --> 00:53:35,544
Sydney to Los Angeles.

587
00:53:36,094 --> 00:53:40,182
One of the longest flights in the world.
He makes it every two weeks.

588
00:53:40,556 --> 00:53:43,077
And he must be flying private.

589
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:46,693
Not if there were unexpected
maintenance with his plane.

590
00:53:47,043 --> 00:53:49,356
- But that should be a 747.
- Why is that?

591
00:53:49,383 --> 00:53:51,250
Cause in a 747 the pilot's up top

592
00:53:51,404 --> 00:53:54,637
and the first class cabin is in the nose.
So no one would walk through.

593
00:53:54,692 --> 00:53:57,841
But you'd have to buy out the entire cabin.
And the first class flight.

594
00:53:57,957 --> 00:54:03,198
I bought the airline.
It seemed little.

595
00:54:04,926 --> 00:54:07,544
Well, looks like we have our ten hours.

596
00:54:08,314 --> 00:54:11,415
Ariadne?
Terrific work, by the way.

597
00:54:58,996 --> 00:55:04,450
You know how to find me.
You know what you have to do.

598
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:11,327
Do you remember when
you ask me to marry you?

599
00:55:12,827 --> 00:55:17,392
- Of course I do.
- You said you had a dream.

600
00:55:21,409 --> 00:55:23,839
That will grow old together.

601
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:27,456
And we can.

602
00:55:33,615 --> 00:55:34,969
You shouldn't be here.

603
00:55:39,872 --> 00:55:43,066
I just want to see what kind of tests
you're doing here alone every night.

604
00:55:43,136 --> 00:55:46,295
- Whatever it was, it has nothing to do with you.
- It has everything to do with me.

605
00:55:46,349 --> 00:55:51,526
- You've asked me to share dreams with you.
- Not these. These are my dreams.

606
00:56:03,281 --> 00:56:07,480
- Why do you do this to yourself?
- It's the only way I can still dream.

607
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:15,499
- Why is it so important to dream?
- In my dreams, we're still together.

608
00:56:30,069 --> 00:56:33,359
These aren't just dreams.

609
00:56:33,772 --> 00:56:36,822
These are memories and you
said never to use memories.

610
00:56:37,088 --> 00:56:40,096
- I know I did.
- You're trying to keep her alive.

611
00:56:40,603 --> 00:56:44,914
- You can't let her go.
- You don't understand.

612
00:56:45,117 --> 00:56:48,618
These are moments that I regret
and memories that I have to change.

613
00:56:50,412 --> 00:56:52,699
Oh, what's down there that you regret?

614
00:56:52,703 --> 00:56:55,982
Listen, I do know one thing that you
need to understand about me.

615
00:57:04,832 --> 00:57:08,339
- Is this your house?
- Mine and Mal's, yes.

616
00:57:09,689 --> 00:57:13,809
- Where is she?
- She's already died.

617
00:57:18,395 --> 00:57:22,994
That's my son, James. He's digging
for something, maybe a worm.

618
00:57:24,844 --> 00:57:26,639
That's Phillipa.

619
00:57:26,781 --> 00:57:31,441
You see, I thought about calling out to them so
they'd turn and smile and I can those

620
00:57:31,938 --> 00:57:36,977
those beautiful faces of
theirs but... it's all too late.

621
00:57:37,494 --> 00:57:39,744
Right now, or never, Cobb.

622
00:57:44,821 --> 00:57:49,753
Then I start to panic. I realized I
don't want to regret this moment that...

623
00:57:50,096 --> 00:57:52,405
I need to see their faces one last time.

624
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:55,082
James! Phillipa!
Come on in!

625
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:58,834
But the moment's passed.

626
00:57:59,698 --> 00:58:03,117
And whatever I do,
I can't change this moment.

627
00:58:03,726 --> 00:58:08,591
So I'm about to call out
to them and run away.

628
00:58:11,175 --> 00:58:14,569
If I'm ever gonna see their faces again,
I've gotta get back home.

629
00:58:14,982 --> 00:58:16,874
The real world.

630
00:58:58,516 --> 00:59:02,020
- What are you doing here?
- My name is...

631
00:59:02,108 --> 00:59:05,200
I know who you are.
What are you doing here?

632
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:17,548
- I'm just trying to understand.
- How could you understand?

633
00:59:19,242 --> 00:59:22,722
Do you know what it is to be a lover?

634
00:59:23,829 --> 00:59:27,742
- To be half in a whole?
- No.

635
00:59:30,131 --> 00:59:31,752
I'll tell you a riddle.

636
00:59:33,306 --> 00:59:39,383
You're waiting for a train.
A train that will take you far away.

637
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:47,226
You know where you hope this train will take you.
But you don't know for sure.

638
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:54,493
But it doesn't matter. How can it not matter
to you where the train will take you?

639
00:59:54,592 --> 00:59:56,321
Cause we will be together.

640
00:59:56,742 --> 01:00:00,240
- How could you bring her here, Dom?
- What is this place?

641
01:00:00,531 --> 01:00:03,855
This is the hotel suite where
we should spend our anniversary.

642
01:00:03,897 --> 01:00:05,524
What happened here?

643
01:00:06,377 --> 01:00:10,579
You promised!
You promised we'll be together!

644
01:00:10,669 --> 01:00:12,583
Please, I need you stay here!
Just for now!

645
01:00:12,636 --> 01:00:16,198
You said we'll be together!
You said we'll grow old together!

646
01:00:16,206 --> 01:00:18,299
I'll come back for you.
Promise.

647
01:00:36,506 --> 01:00:41,458
Do you think you can just build a
prison of memories to lock her in?

648
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:46,084
Do you really think that
that's gonna contain her?

649
01:00:46,382 --> 01:00:50,686
It's time.
Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.

650
01:00:51,403 --> 01:00:53,923
- When is the funeral?
- Thursday, in Los Angeles.

651
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:57,121
Robert should accompany the body
no later than Tuesday. We should move.

652
01:00:57,265 --> 01:00:58,717
Right.

653
01:00:58,879 --> 01:01:02,327
- Cobb, I'm coming with you.
- I promised Miles, no.

654
01:01:02,405 --> 01:01:05,846
The team needs someone who
understands what you're struggling with.

655
01:01:07,533 --> 01:01:09,959
And it doesn't have to be me.

656
01:01:10,013 --> 01:01:13,887
But then you have to show
Arthur what I just saw.

657
01:01:19,771 --> 01:01:21,743
Get us another seat on the plane.

658
01:01:25,537 --> 01:01:28,796
If I get on this plane and you
don't honor our agreement.

659
01:01:28,938 --> 01:01:32,006
When we land, I go to jail
for the rest of my life.

660
01:01:32,579 --> 01:01:37,642
Complete the job on board.
I'll make one phone call from the plane.

661
01:01:37,715 --> 01:01:40,720
You will have no trouble
getting through Immigration.

662
01:01:45,595 --> 01:01:47,666
- Yes, it is.
- Thanks.

663
01:01:47,668 --> 01:01:48,247
Yes.

664
01:01:48,249 --> 01:01:50,554
- Third seat on the right.
- Thanks.

665
01:01:54,797 --> 01:01:57,376
- I'm sorry.
- Oh yeah, I'm sorry, my bad.

666
01:02:07,852 --> 01:02:09,867
- Welcome aboard, sir. May I take your coat?
- Thank you.

667
01:02:29,132 --> 01:02:30,220
FASTEN SEAT BELTS.
NO SMOKING.

668
01:02:32,313 --> 01:02:35,685
Excuse me, I think this is yours?
You must've dropped it.

669
01:02:35,913 --> 01:02:38,555
- Gentlemen, can I have your drink?
- Oh, water please.

670
01:02:38,876 --> 01:02:40,540
The same, please.

671
01:02:44,122 --> 01:02:45,677
Thank you.

672
01:02:45,831 --> 01:02:49,312
You know I couldn't help but notice
but you won't happen to be related to...

673
01:02:49,366 --> 01:02:51,071
"The Maurice Fischer", would you?

674
01:02:51,098 --> 01:02:58,621
- Yes, he... he was my father.
- Well he was a very inspiring figure.

675
01:02:58,633 --> 01:03:01,238
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Sir.

676
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:05,227
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

677
01:03:05,453 --> 01:03:11,214
Hey, to your father.
May he rest in peace, huh.

678
01:04:19,866 --> 01:04:21,305
You couldn't have peed
before you went on there.

679
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:22,105
Sorry.

680
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:24,364
Pitching much free champagne
before take off, right, Yusuf?

681
01:04:24,418 --> 01:04:25,314
Ha-ha. Bloody hard.

682
01:04:25,366 --> 01:04:28,008
Well now, he's gonna be
looking for a taxi in this weather.

683
01:04:40,697 --> 01:04:43,501
- Asshole! Hey man, why don't you try...
- Walk away.

684
01:05:00,235 --> 01:05:03,797
Look, I gotta go. Alright.
Taxi. Thank you.

685
01:05:07,048 --> 01:05:09,486
Alright. Third and Market. Snappy.

686
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:11,241
What are you doing?

687
01:05:11,623 --> 01:05:13,287
- Oh sorry, I thought it was free.
- Well, it's not.

688
01:05:13,479 --> 01:05:15,306
- Maybe we could share.
- Maybe not.

689
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:16,941
Can you pull over and get this...

690
01:05:20,035 --> 01:05:21,255
Great.

691
01:05:26,133 --> 01:05:27,727
Come on!

692
01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:41,867
There's $500 in there and
the wallet's worth more than that.

693
01:05:41,936 --> 01:05:43,880
So you might as well
drop me at my stop.

694
01:05:43,946 --> 01:05:45,084
I'm afraid that this...

695
01:05:54,361 --> 01:05:54,961
Cover him!

696
01:05:55,015 --> 01:05:58,267
No! No! No!
What was going on?

697
01:06:02,009 --> 01:06:03,784
This wasn't in my design.

698
01:06:04,216 --> 01:06:07,692
Cobb?
Cobb?

699
01:06:58,279 --> 01:06:59,649
Get him!

700
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:09,987
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

701
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:12,467
Fischer's okay.
Unless he gets carsick.

702
01:07:12,557 --> 01:07:13,710
Saito?

703
01:07:32,457 --> 01:07:33,782
Get Fischer in the back room now!

704
01:07:35,167 --> 01:07:38,053
- Get him the back room.!
- What the hell...

705
01:07:38,124 --> 01:07:39,990
- Has he been shot? Is he dying?
- I don't know.

706
01:07:40,042 --> 01:07:40,876
Jesus Christ.

707
01:07:41,335 --> 01:07:44,103
- Where were you? What happened to you?
- The girl played a freight train.

708
01:07:44,357 --> 01:07:46,351
Why did you put a train crossing
in the middle of a downtown interstate?

709
01:07:46,405 --> 01:07:47,901
- I didn't.
- Where did it come from?

710
01:07:47,953 --> 01:07:49,864
Let me ask you a question!
Why the hell were you ambushed?

711
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:52,875
Those were not normal projections!
They've been trained for God's sakes!

712
01:07:52,917 --> 01:07:54,479
- You're right.
- How can they be trained?

713
01:07:54,574 --> 01:07:58,709
Fischer had an extractor that
teaches subconscious to defend itself.

714
01:07:58,763 --> 01:08:00,783
So his subconscious is militarized.

715
01:08:00,836 --> 01:08:02,311
It should've shown in the research.
I'm sorry.

716
01:08:02,361 --> 01:08:04,859
- So why the hell didn't it?
- Calm down.

717
01:08:04,945 --> 01:08:07,344
Don't tell me to calm down.
This was your job, goddamn it!

718
01:08:07,429 --> 01:08:11,457
This was your responsibility! You were meant to
check Fischer's background thoroughly!

719
01:08:11,535 --> 01:08:13,081
We are not prepared for
this type of violence!

720
01:08:13,155 --> 01:08:14,945
We have dealt with
self-security before!

721
01:08:14,998 --> 01:08:16,797
We'll be a little more careful
and we're gonna be fine!

722
01:08:16,916 --> 01:08:19,176
This was not a part of the plan!
He's dying for God's sake!

723
01:08:19,229 --> 01:08:20,660
- Now, let's put him out of his misery.
- No, no!

724
01:08:20,714 --> 01:08:22,211
- Don't do that!
- What's the matter, Cobb?

725
01:08:22,222 --> 01:08:25,035
- Don't do that
- He's in agony, I'm waking him up.

726
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:28,868
- No, it won't wake him up.
- What do you mean, it won't wake him up?

727
01:08:28,922 --> 01:08:31,341
- It won't wake him up.
- When we die in a dream, we wake up.

728
01:08:31,381 --> 01:08:35,146
Not from this. We're too heavily
sedated to wake up that way.

729
01:08:35,241 --> 01:08:38,635
- Right, so what happens when we die?
- We drop in a limbo.

730
01:08:38,706 --> 01:08:40,703
- Are you serious?
- Limbo?

731
01:08:40,713 --> 01:08:43,831
- Unconstructed dream space.
- What the hell is down there?

732
01:08:43,885 --> 01:08:47,372
Just raw infinite subconscious.
Nothing is down there.

733
01:08:47,461 --> 01:08:50,010
Except for whatever might have been left
behind by anyone sharing the dream

734
01:08:50,064 --> 01:08:54,434
who has been trapped there before.
Which in our case, is just you.

735
01:08:54,502 --> 01:08:56,139
How long can we be stuck there?

736
01:08:56,373 --> 01:08:58,579
I can't even think about trying to
escape until the sedation is...

737
01:08:58,632 --> 01:09:01,738
- How long, Yusuf?
- Decades, It could be infinite. I don't know.

738
01:09:01,792 --> 01:09:03,182
Ask him he's the one who's been there.

739
01:09:03,224 --> 01:09:05,091
Just get him upstairs.

740
01:09:06,224 --> 01:09:09,177
Great.
Thank you.

741
01:09:10,772 --> 01:09:14,111
So, now we're trapped in Fischer's
mind battling his own private army...

742
01:09:14,147 --> 01:09:16,694
and if we get killed,
we'll be lost in limbo

743
01:09:16,747 --> 01:09:18,988
till our brains turn
to scrambled egg, hmm?

744
01:09:24,990 --> 01:09:27,993
You got first aid?

745
01:09:29,957 --> 01:09:32,808
So you knew about this
risk and you didn't tell us?

746
01:09:32,845 --> 01:09:35,880
There weren't meant to be any risk cause
I didn't know we'd be dealing with a load of gunfire.

747
01:09:35,923 --> 01:09:38,828
- You had no right
- It was the only way to go three layers deep.

748
01:09:38,832 --> 01:09:42,593
- And you, you knew about this and went along with it?
- I trusted him.

749
01:09:42,603 --> 01:09:44,545
You trusted him. What?
Did he promise you half his share?

750
01:09:44,563 --> 01:09:48,137
No. His whole share.
It's like he said, he'd done it before.

751
01:09:48,190 --> 01:09:51,228
He'd done it before, what, with Mal?
Cause that worked so good?

752
01:09:51,281 --> 01:09:53,715
It has nothing to do with it. I did what
I had to do to get back to my children.

753
01:09:53,801 --> 01:09:55,691
So you lead us into a
war zone with no way out.

754
01:09:55,744 --> 01:09:59,661
There is a way out. Alright, we continue on with
the job and we do this as fast as possible.

755
01:10:00,071 --> 01:10:02,840
and we get out using the kick.
Just like before.

756
01:10:02,894 --> 01:10:05,477
Forget it, If we go any deeper
we'll just raise the stakes.

757
01:10:05,548 --> 01:10:07,246
I am sitting this one
out on this level, boys.

758
01:10:07,299 --> 01:10:09,891
Fischer's security is surrounding
this place as we speak.

759
01:10:09,924 --> 01:10:12,125
Ten hours of flight time
is a week at this level.

760
01:10:12,178 --> 01:10:16,667
That means each and every one of
us will be killed. That I can guarantee.

761
01:10:16,709 --> 01:10:20,065
We have no other choice but to
continue on and do it as fast as possible.

762
01:10:21,533 --> 01:10:24,975
Downwards is the only way forward.

763
01:10:25,811 --> 01:10:29,728
Get ready.
You, come on let's go shake him up.

764
01:10:34,459 --> 01:10:38,175
I'm insured against kidnapping
for up to ten million.

765
01:10:38,228 --> 01:10:40,580
- This should be very simple.
- Shut up! It won't be.

766
01:10:40,583 --> 01:10:43,898
In your father's office, below the
bookshelf is his personal safe.

767
01:10:43,988 --> 01:10:47,519
- We need the combination.
- I don't know any safe.

768
01:10:47,527 --> 01:10:50,710
It doesn't mean you
don't know the combination.

769
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:55,720
- Tell us what it is.
- I don't know.

770
01:11:01,262 --> 01:11:03,480
We have an old good
authority you do know.

771
01:11:03,564 --> 01:11:06,352
Yeah? Who is this authority?

772
01:11:07,098 --> 01:11:09,331
$500, this cost?

773
01:11:09,335 --> 01:11:14,231
- What's inside?
- Cash cards, ID, and this.

774
01:11:19,333 --> 01:11:23,296
- Useful?
- Maybe.

775
01:11:23,361 --> 01:11:26,793
- You're on. We've got an hour.
- An hour?

776
01:11:27,949 --> 01:11:30,216
I was supposed to
have all night to practice.

777
01:11:30,271 --> 01:11:33,016
Saito wasn't supposed to
be shot in the chest.

778
01:11:33,063 --> 01:11:36,289
We got one hour, now get
use something useful, please.

779
01:11:38,594 --> 01:11:42,227
- What's that?
- Good authority.

780
01:11:45,312 --> 01:11:46,612
Uncle Peter...

781
01:11:46,664 --> 01:11:47,639
No, no.

782
01:11:47,693 --> 01:11:51,752
- Just make him stop.
- The combination.

783
01:11:51,786 --> 01:11:54,905
- I don't know it.
- Why does Browning say you do?

784
01:11:54,999 --> 01:11:59,055
I don't know.
Just let me talk to him and I'll find out.

785
01:12:00,538 --> 01:12:03,924
You have one hour.
Start talking.

786
01:12:05,142 --> 01:12:06,988
Are you alright?

787
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:10,416
Are you okay?

788
01:12:12,867 --> 01:12:16,923
Those bastards bad
at me for two days.

789
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:21,646
They have someone with access to your father's
office and they're trying to open his safe.

790
01:12:21,747 --> 01:12:25,644
- Yeah.
- They said I'd know the combination. But I don't know it.

791
01:12:25,698 --> 01:12:28,440
- Yeah, neither do I.
- What?

792
01:12:28,492 --> 01:12:33,029
Maurice told me that when he past,
you were the only to be able to open it.

793
01:12:33,090 --> 01:12:35,066
No, he never gave
me any combination.

794
01:12:35,142 --> 01:12:39,648
Maybe he did, I mean, maybe you just
didn't know it was a combination.

795
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:41,269
Well, what then?

796
01:12:41,304 --> 01:12:43,736
I don't know. Some meaningful
combination of numbers

797
01:12:43,790 --> 01:12:47,342
based on your experiences with Maurice.

798
01:12:48,867 --> 01:12:53,883
We didn't have very...
many meaningful experiences together.

799
01:12:53,964 --> 01:12:56,306
Perhaps after your mother died.

800
01:12:58,163 --> 01:13:02,159
After my mother died,
you know what he told me?

801
01:13:02,431 --> 01:13:10,511
- "Robert, there's really nothing to be said".
- Oh well, he was bad with emotion.

802
01:13:10,514 --> 01:13:13,400
I was eleven, Uncle Peter.

803
01:13:13,445 --> 01:13:17,523
- How is he doing?
- He's in a lot of pain.

804
01:13:17,545 --> 01:13:20,775
When we get down to the lower levels,
the pain will be less intense.

805
01:13:20,778 --> 01:13:24,986
- And if he dies?
- Worst case scenario?

806
01:13:25,048 --> 01:13:28,033
When he wakes up,
his mind is completely gone.

807
01:13:28,110 --> 01:13:34,212
- Cobb, I will still honor the arrangement.
- I appreciate that, Saito.

808
01:13:34,266 --> 01:13:38,333
But when you wake up you won't even
remember that we had an arrangement.

809
01:13:38,567 --> 01:13:40,889
Limbo is gonna become your reality.

810
01:13:40,918 --> 01:13:45,041
You're gonna be lost down there so long
that you're gonna become an old man.

811
01:13:45,064 --> 01:13:49,630
- Filled with regret?
- Waiting to die alone.

812
01:13:49,716 --> 01:13:56,108
No, I'll come back.
And we will be alive together again.

813
01:14:02,174 --> 01:14:03,190
Breath.

814
01:14:03,426 --> 01:14:06,512
These people are gonna kill us if
we don't give them the combination.

815
01:14:06,541 --> 01:14:08,998
- They just want a ransom.
- I heard them.

816
01:14:09,049 --> 01:14:12,906
They're gonna whack us in that van
and then drive it into the river.

817
01:14:12,992 --> 01:14:16,454
- Alright. What is in the safe?
- Something for you.

818
01:14:16,538 --> 01:14:21,348
Maurice always said it was
his most precious gift to you.

819
01:14:21,424 --> 01:14:23,092
A will.

820
01:14:23,145 --> 01:14:25,291
Maurice's Will is with Port and Dunn.

821
01:14:25,362 --> 01:14:29,211
That's an alternate. This would
supercede the other if you wanted to.

822
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:31,855
It splits off the component
business of Fischer-Morrow

823
01:14:31,913 --> 01:14:35,267
And it'd be the end of the
entire empire as we know it.

824
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:42,016
Destroy my whole inheritance.
Why would he suggest that, you think?

825
01:14:42,033 --> 01:14:47,499
I just don't know.
He loved you, Robert.

826
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:52,117
- In his own way.
- In his own way?

827
01:14:52,884 --> 01:14:58,259
At the end, he called
me into his deathbed

828
01:14:58,748 --> 01:15:01,062
And he could barely speak.

829
01:15:01,976 --> 01:15:07,344
But he took the trouble
to tell me one last thing.

830
01:15:08,088 --> 01:15:17,031
He pulled me closer.
And I could only make out... one word.

831
01:15:20,408 --> 01:15:22,999
"Disappointed".

832
01:15:27,923 --> 01:15:30,568
When were you in limbo?

833
01:15:30,982 --> 01:15:34,736
You might have the rest of the team
convinced to carry on with this job

834
01:15:34,790 --> 01:15:36,063
but they don't know the truth.

835
01:15:36,117 --> 01:15:37,564
Truth? What truth?

836
01:15:37,662 --> 01:15:42,126
The truth that at any minute, you might
bring a freight train through the wall.

837
01:15:42,269 --> 01:15:45,893
The truth that Mal is bursting
through your subconscious.

838
01:15:45,912 --> 01:15:48,419
And the truth that as we go
deeper into Fischer

839
01:15:48,474 --> 01:15:50,861
we're also going deeper into you.

840
01:15:51,059 --> 01:15:55,429
And I... I'm not sure we're
gonna like what we find.

841
01:15:57,829 --> 01:16:04,451
We were working together. We were exploring
the concept of a dream within a dream.

842
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:09,075
I kept pushing things. I wanted to go deeper
and deeper. I wanted to go further.

843
01:16:09,525 --> 01:16:14,586
I just didn't understand the concept that
hours could turn into years down there.

844
01:16:14,683 --> 01:16:18,545
That we could get trapped so deep.
That when we...

845
01:16:18,598 --> 01:16:21,467
when wind up on the
shore of our subconscious

846
01:16:21,476 --> 01:16:24,525
we lost side of what was real.

847
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:33,765
We created.
We built a world for ourselves.

848
01:16:34,835 --> 01:16:40,255
We did that for years.
We built our own world.

849
01:16:41,832 --> 01:16:46,362
- How long were you stuck there?
- Something like fifty years.

850
01:16:49,577 --> 01:16:55,172
Jesus.
How could you stand it?

851
01:16:55,231 --> 01:16:56,909
It wasn't so bad at first.
Feeling like gods.

852
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,400
The problem was that I knew
that none of that was real.

853
01:16:59,870 --> 01:17:04,396
Eventually, it just became impossible
for me to live like that.

854
01:17:04,452 --> 01:17:07,025
And what about for her?

855
01:17:09,754 --> 01:17:13,120
She has locked something away.
Something deep inside her.

856
01:17:14,342 --> 01:17:20,259
The truth that she once known.
She chose to forget.

857
01:17:22,653 --> 01:17:25,477
Limbo became her reality.

858
01:17:26,707 --> 01:17:28,941
What happened when you woke up?

859
01:17:29,118 --> 01:17:33,236
Well, to wake up from that after,
after years, after decades...

860
01:17:33,668 --> 01:17:38,580
to become old souls thrown
back into youth like that...

861
01:17:38,599 --> 01:17:43,429
I knew something was wrong with her.
She just wouldn't admit it.

862
01:17:44,475 --> 01:17:50,420
Eventually, she told me the truth.
She was possessed by an idea.

863
01:17:50,657 --> 01:17:55,784
This one, very simple idea
that changed everything.

864
01:17:56,763 --> 01:17:59,668
That our world wasn't real.

865
01:18:00,924 --> 01:18:04,475
That she needed to wake up
to come back to reality, that...

866
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:10,888
in order to get back home...
We had to kill ourselves.

867
01:18:17,701 --> 01:18:21,705
- What about your children?
- She thought they were projections.

868
01:18:21,757 --> 01:18:23,825
That our real children are waiting
for us out there somewhere.

869
01:18:23,878 --> 01:18:26,219
- Look, Cobb! I'm their mother.
- Calm down.

870
01:18:26,247 --> 01:18:28,467
Can't you even tell the difference?

871
01:18:28,549 --> 01:18:30,471
If this is my dream, why can't I control this?

872
01:18:30,526 --> 01:18:32,040
Because you don't know you're dreaming!

873
01:18:32,069 --> 01:18:35,884
She was certain there was nothing
I could do, no matter how much I begged...

874
01:18:35,938 --> 01:18:38,159
no matter how much I pleaded.

875
01:18:41,259 --> 01:18:44,608
She wanted to do it.
But she could not do it alone.

876
01:18:44,644 --> 01:18:50,691
She loved me too much so...
She came up with a plan on our anniversary.

877
01:19:17,191 --> 01:19:19,844
- Sweetheart, what are you doing?
- Join me.

878
01:19:20,267 --> 01:19:24,726
Just step back inside, alright?
Just step back inside now, come on.

879
01:19:24,819 --> 01:19:33,422
- No. I'm going to jump and you're coming with me.
- No, I'm not. But now, you listen to me.

880
01:19:33,806 --> 01:19:37,392
If you jump, you're
not gonna wake up, remember?

881
01:19:37,446 --> 01:19:43,344
You're gonna die. Now, just step back inside, come on.
Step back inside so we can talk about this.

882
01:19:43,399 --> 01:19:46,661
We've talked enough.

883
01:19:47,278 --> 01:19:50,650
- Mal.
- Come out unto the ledge or I'll jump right now.

884
01:19:50,703 --> 01:19:52,006
Okay.

885
01:19:56,230 --> 01:19:59,794
We're gonna talk about this.
Alright?

886
01:20:00,386 --> 01:20:05,400
- I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.
- No, honey.

887
01:20:06,118 --> 01:20:09,055
I can't. You know,
I can't do that.

888
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:11,542
Take a second and think
about our children.

889
01:20:11,583 --> 01:20:16,109
Think about James.
Think about Phillipa, now.

890
01:20:16,167 --> 01:20:19,087
If I go without you,
they'll take them away, anyway.

891
01:20:19,178 --> 01:20:21,107
What does that mean?

892
01:20:21,162 --> 01:20:23,447
I filed a letter with our attorney

893
01:20:23,501 --> 01:20:26,165
explaining how I'm fearful for my safety.

894
01:20:28,391 --> 01:20:31,716
How you threatened to kill me.

895
01:20:33,392 --> 01:20:36,897
- Why did you do that?
- I love you, Dom.

896
01:20:36,934 --> 01:20:39,129
Why did you.. why...
why would you do this to me?

897
01:20:39,183 --> 01:20:41,852
I've freed you from the guilt
of choosing to leave them.

898
01:20:41,931 --> 01:20:45,066
We're going home.
To our real children.

899
01:20:45,126 --> 01:20:49,001
No, no, no, no, Mal, You listen to me!
Alright? Mal, look at me, please.

900
01:20:49,022 --> 01:20:50,723
You're waiting for a train.

901
01:20:50,765 --> 01:20:54,701
- Mal,goddamn it! Don't do this!
- A train that will take you far away.

902
01:20:54,722 --> 01:20:58,471
- James and Phillipa are waiting for you!
- You know where you hope this train will take you.

903
01:20:58,525 --> 01:21:00,328
- They're waiting for us!
- But you can't know for sure.

904
01:21:00,381 --> 01:21:03,113
- Mal, look at me!
- But it doesn't matter.

905
01:21:03,152 --> 01:21:06,206
- Mal, goddamn it!
- Because you will be together.

906
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:12,439
Sweetheart, look at me!
Mal, no! Jesus Christ!

907
01:21:15,344 --> 01:21:19,110
She had herself declared sane
by three different psychiatrists.

908
01:21:19,238 --> 01:21:23,466
That made it impossible for me to try to
explain the nature of her madness.

909
01:21:23,482 --> 01:21:25,688
So, I ran...

910
01:21:25,855 --> 01:21:29,189
Right now, or never, Cobb.

911
01:21:39,258 --> 01:21:41,794
Alright, let's go.

912
01:21:41,815 --> 01:21:45,333
I left my children behind and I've been
trying to buy myself back ever since.

913
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:49,842
Your guilt defines her.
It's what powers her.

914
01:21:49,855 --> 01:21:53,872
But you are not responsible for
the idea that destroyed her.

915
01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:56,918
And if we are gonna succeed in this...

916
01:21:56,971 --> 01:22:02,347
you have to forgive yourself.
You're gonna have to confront her.

917
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:04,435
But you don't have to do that alone.

918
01:22:04,525 --> 01:22:06,967
- No, no, you don't...
- I'm doing it for the others.

919
01:22:07,044 --> 01:22:11,922
Because they have no idea of the risk
they've taken coming down here with you.

920
01:22:17,693 --> 01:22:19,125
We have to move.

921
01:22:19,451 --> 01:22:23,244
- Time's up.
- Alright. I don't know any combination.

922
01:22:23,326 --> 01:22:26,714
- Not consciously anyway.
- How about instinctively, huh?

923
01:22:26,914 --> 01:22:29,740
I got somebody standing in
front of his office right now

924
01:22:29,793 --> 01:22:31,083
ready to tap in the combination.

925
01:22:31,154 --> 01:22:34,218
I need the first six numbers that
come to your head right now.

926
01:22:34,255 --> 01:22:36,187
- I have no idea.
- Right now!

927
01:22:36,251 --> 01:22:43,284
- I said right now! Right now!
- 5, 2, 8, 4, 9, 1.

928
01:22:46,663 --> 01:22:48,576
You'd have to do better than that.

929
01:22:48,587 --> 01:22:52,992
Alright. Gag him.
We're going for a ride.

930
01:22:56,304 --> 01:23:01,030
What more do you like?
To kill me?

931
01:23:05,447 --> 01:23:07,802
What did you get?

932
01:23:07,808 --> 01:23:10,702
That boy's relationship with his father
is even worse than we imagined.

933
01:23:10,739 --> 01:23:11,578
This helps us how?

934
01:23:11,931 --> 01:23:14,431
The stronger the issues,
the more powerful the catharsis.

935
01:23:15,866 --> 01:23:18,631
How are you gonna reconcile
then pursue his strengths?

936
01:23:18,661 --> 01:23:20,586
- Well I'm working on that, don't I?
- Move fast.

937
01:23:20,637 --> 01:23:22,545
Projections are closing in quick.

938
01:23:23,221 --> 01:23:26,319
We gotta break out of here
before we're totally boxed in.

939
01:24:01,583 --> 01:24:02,850
Damn it.

940
01:24:02,903 --> 01:24:05,724
You mustn't be afraid to
dream a little bigger, darling.

941
01:24:22,518 --> 01:24:25,748
Now, we need to shift his animosity
from his father to his godfather.

942
01:24:25,805 --> 01:24:27,814
We're gonna destroy his
one positive relationship?

943
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:29,620
No, we'll repair his relationship with his father

944
01:24:29,674 --> 01:24:32,220
by exposing his godfather's true nature.

945
01:24:32,254 --> 01:24:35,939
We should thrice Fischer's
loot more than Saito's mission.

946
01:24:35,983 --> 01:24:38,376
What about his security?
It's gonna get worse as we go deeper.

947
01:24:38,429 --> 01:24:41,306
- No, I think we're going with Mr. Charles.
- No.

948
01:24:41,395 --> 01:24:43,135
- Who's Mr. Charles?
- A bad ides.

949
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:45,166
The second we get into that
hotel and approach Fischer

950
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:49,433
his security will be all over us.
We run with Mr. Charles like we did on this timed job.

951
01:24:49,487 --> 01:24:51,631
- So, you've done it before?
- Yeah, and it didn't worked.

952
01:24:51,677 --> 01:24:54,783
The subject realized that he was dreaming
and his subconscious tore us to pieces.

953
01:24:54,871 --> 01:24:56,389
Excellent.
But you've learned a lot, right?

954
01:24:56,442 --> 01:24:58,462
I need some kind of distraction.

955
01:24:58,516 --> 01:25:01,514
No problem. How about a
lovely lady that I've used before?

956
01:25:01,567 --> 01:25:03,685
- Listen to me. You drive carefully, alright?
- Yeah.

957
01:25:03,713 --> 01:25:06,506
getting down there is
gonna be unstable as hell.

958
01:25:10,611 --> 01:25:14,478
Don't jump too soon. We only have one
shot at that kick you're gonna make.

959
01:25:14,511 --> 01:25:16,990
I'll play the music and you'll know
it's coming, the rest is on you.

960
01:25:17,481 --> 01:25:19,571
- Are you ready?
- Ready!

961
01:25:20,746 --> 01:25:21,993
Sweet dreams.

962
01:25:22,279 --> 01:25:23,649
Am I boring you?

963
01:25:25,117 --> 01:25:29,206
I was telling you my story.
I guess it wasn't to your liking.

964
01:25:31,253 --> 01:25:32,770
I have a lot in my mind.

965
01:25:34,089 --> 01:25:36,453
There goes Mr. Charles.

966
01:25:40,906 --> 01:25:43,580
Mr. Fischer, right?

967
01:25:43,970 --> 01:25:47,037
Pleasure to see you again.
Rod Green from marketing.

968
01:25:47,873 --> 01:25:50,870
- And you must be?
- Leaving.

969
01:25:54,464 --> 01:25:56,216
In case you get bored.

970
01:26:01,289 --> 01:26:02,699
She must have blown you off.

971
01:26:02,753 --> 01:26:05,865
That is unless her phone
number really is only six digits.

972
01:26:05,890 --> 01:26:07,148
<i>528-491</i>

973
01:26:07,201 --> 01:26:11,548
Funny way to make friends,
someone stealing their wallet like that.

974
01:26:15,099 --> 01:26:17,527
Goddamn it.
The wallet alone is worth at least...

975
01:26:18,081 --> 01:26:19,524
$500, right?

976
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:22,642
Listen, don't worry about it.
My people are already on it as we speak.

977
01:26:22,655 --> 01:26:24,655
Who or what is Mr. Charles?

978
01:26:24,683 --> 01:26:28,390
It's a gambit designed to turn Fischer
against his own subconscious.

979
01:26:28,674 --> 01:26:30,246
And why don't you approve?

980
01:26:30,259 --> 01:26:32,323
Cause it involves telling
the mark that he's dreaming

981
01:26:32,376 --> 01:26:34,793
which involves attracting
a lot of attention to us.

982
01:26:34,835 --> 01:26:36,948
So Cobb said he couldn't do that?

983
01:26:36,985 --> 01:26:40,009
So now you've noticed
how much time Cobb spends

984
01:26:40,063 --> 01:26:42,664
doing things he says never to do.

985
01:26:44,192 --> 01:26:46,114
Mr. Saito, may I have a moment?

986
01:26:46,167 --> 01:26:48,564
- I'm sorry, but...
- Wait!

987
01:26:49,350 --> 01:26:53,452
- You looked to be "livelier".
- Very amusing, Mr. Eames.

988
01:26:59,814 --> 01:27:01,524
Turbulence on the plane?

989
01:27:01,562 --> 01:27:05,225
No, I mean, it's must closer.
It's Yusuf's driving.

990
01:27:13,153 --> 01:27:17,700
- I'm sorry, who did you say you were?
- Rod Green from marketing.

991
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:20,504
That's not true at all, is it?

992
01:27:21,972 --> 01:27:25,480
My name is Mr. Charles.
You remember me, don't you?

993
01:27:25,620 --> 01:27:28,248
I'm the head of your security down here.

994
01:27:28,269 --> 01:27:31,024
Get out on a different floor and keep moving.

995
01:27:31,030 --> 01:27:33,553
Dump the wallet.
The security will look for that.

996
01:27:33,932 --> 01:27:37,228
- Okay.
- We need to buy Cobb a lot more time.

997
01:27:40,642 --> 01:27:42,381
Security, huh?

998
01:27:43,947 --> 01:27:46,816
- You work for the hotel?
- No, no.

999
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:53,571
I specialize in a very specific type of security.
Subconscious security.

1000
01:27:53,612 --> 01:27:59,183
Are you talking about dreams?
Are you talking about extraction?

1001
01:27:59,264 --> 01:28:04,262
I am here to protect you.
Look...

1002
01:28:08,675 --> 01:28:10,873
<i>Excellent work.
Now, what is your plan?...</i>

1003
01:28:14,921 --> 01:28:16,962
Mr. Fischer, I am here to
protect you in the event

1004
01:28:17,016 --> 01:28:20,968
that someone tries to access
your mind through your dreams.

1005
01:28:21,049 --> 01:28:26,295
You're not safe here.
They're coming for you.

1006
01:28:44,643 --> 01:28:46,874
Strange weather, isn't it?

1007
01:28:51,088 --> 01:28:54,195
You feel that?

1008
01:28:54,287 --> 01:28:55,839
What's happening?

1009
01:28:56,081 --> 01:28:59,045
Cobb is drawing Fischer's attention
to the strangeness of the dream

1010
01:28:59,099 --> 01:29:01,883
which is making his subconscious
look for the dreamer.

1011
01:29:02,226 --> 01:29:05,469
For me.
Quick, give me a kiss.

1012
01:29:10,369 --> 01:29:13,946
- They're still looking at us.
- Yeah, it's worth a shot.

1013
01:29:14,055 --> 01:29:16,560
We should probably get out of here.

1014
01:29:32,362 --> 01:29:36,019
Feel that? You've actually been
trained for this, Mr. Fischer.

1015
01:29:36,077 --> 01:29:39,848
Pay attention to the strangeness
of the weather, the shifting gravity.

1016
01:29:39,884 --> 01:29:43,640
None of this is real.
You're in a dream.

1017
01:29:47,828 --> 01:29:50,329
Now, the easiest for you to test yourself...

1018
01:29:50,382 --> 01:29:54,196
is to try to remember how you arrived at this hotel.
Can you do that?

1019
01:29:54,636 --> 01:29:56,791
See, I don't, I...

1020
01:29:57,024 --> 01:29:59,450
Breath, breath.
Remember your training.

1021
01:29:59,476 --> 01:30:03,016
Accept the fact that you're in a dream
and I'm here to protect you.

1022
01:30:03,068 --> 01:30:04,361
Go on.

1023
01:30:10,692 --> 01:30:13,657
- You're not real?
- No, no.

1024
01:30:13,810 --> 01:30:16,418
I'm a projection of your subconscious.

1025
01:30:16,506 --> 01:30:21,249
I was sent here to protect you in the event
that extractors try to pull you into a dream.

1026
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:25,013
And I believe that's what's
going on right now, Mr. Fischer.

1027
01:30:25,677 --> 01:30:29,975
Yeah. Okay. Okay.

1028
01:30:32,939 --> 01:30:38,937
- Can you get me out of here?
- Right away, follow me.

1029
01:30:52,339 --> 01:30:53,927
Stay there.

1030
01:30:58,593 --> 01:31:00,627
Jesus Christ! What are you doing?

1031
01:31:00,672 --> 01:31:03,012
These men were sent
here to abduct you, alright.

1032
01:31:03,034 --> 01:31:06,524
If you want my help,
you have to remain calm.

1033
01:31:07,545 --> 01:31:10,994
I need you to work with me, Mr. Fischer.

1034
01:31:21,487 --> 01:31:25,610
If this is a dream, I should just
kill myself to wake up, right?

1035
01:31:25,674 --> 01:31:27,755
I wouldn't do that if I were you, Mr. Fischer.

1036
01:31:27,758 --> 01:31:33,543
I believe they have you sedated and if you
pull that trigger, you may not wake up.

1037
01:31:33,624 --> 01:31:38,811
You may go into a further dream state.
Now, you know what I'm talking about.

1038
01:31:40,169 --> 01:31:42,963
You remember the training.

1039
01:31:43,085 --> 01:31:46,748
Remember what I said to you.
Give me the gun.

1040
01:31:58,002 --> 01:32:00,255
This room should be directly below 528?

1041
01:32:00,258 --> 01:32:02,077
Yeah.

1042
01:32:10,341 --> 01:32:15,783
Think, Mr. Fischer, think
what do you remember from before this dream?

1043
01:32:16,037 --> 01:32:21,258
There was... there was a lot of gunfires.
And there's... rain.

1044
01:32:21,756 --> 01:32:25,652
Uncle Peter.
Oh my God, we've been kidnapped.

1045
01:32:25,713 --> 01:32:28,214
Where were they holding you?

1046
01:32:30,695 --> 01:32:33,982
- They had us in the back of a van.
- That explains the gravity shifts.

1047
01:32:34,104 --> 01:32:36,328
You're in the back of a van right now.
Keep going.

1048
01:32:36,329 --> 01:32:41,915
It had something to do with...
something to do with a safe?

1049
01:32:42,729 --> 01:32:44,491
God, why is it so hard to remember?

1050
01:32:44,569 --> 01:32:47,061
It's like trying to remember a
dream after you've woken up.

1051
01:32:47,112 --> 01:32:49,686
Listen, it takes years of practice.

1052
01:32:49,750 --> 01:32:52,167
You and Browning has
been pulled into this dream...

1053
01:32:52,220 --> 01:32:54,682
because they're trying to
steal something from your mind.

1054
01:32:54,735 --> 01:32:58,302
I need you to focus and try
and remember what that is.

1055
01:32:58,615 --> 01:33:00,175
What is it, Mr. Fischer?
Think!

1056
01:33:00,228 --> 01:33:01,917
A combination.

1057
01:33:01,971 --> 01:33:04,759
They demanded the first
numbers to pop into my head.

1058
01:33:04,812 --> 01:33:07,307
They're trying to extract the
number from your subconscious.

1059
01:33:07,361 --> 01:33:10,574
It can represent anything.
We're in a hotel right now.

1060
01:33:11,831 --> 01:33:15,069
We should try hotel rooms.
What was the number, Mr. Fischer?

1061
01:33:15,123 --> 01:33:17,934
Try and remember for me.
This is very important.

1062
01:33:17,937 --> 01:33:20,315
Five.

1063
01:33:20,369 --> 01:33:23,114
Five, two...
It was something.. it was a long number.

1064
01:33:23,168 --> 01:33:24,325
That's good enough.
We could start there.

1065
01:33:24,528 --> 01:33:26,445
- Fifth floor.
- Yup.

1066
01:33:26,498 --> 01:33:30,575
- So do you use a timer?
- No, I have to judge it for myself.

1067
01:33:30,629 --> 01:33:34,327
While you're all asleep in 528,
I'll wait for Yusuf's kick.

1068
01:33:34,381 --> 01:33:36,396
- Well, how will you know?
- His music warns me.

1069
01:33:36,450 --> 01:33:40,072
And then when the van hits the barrier
of the bridge, that should be unmistakable.

1070
01:33:40,327 --> 01:33:43,829
So we get a nice, synchronized kick.

1071
01:33:43,883 --> 01:33:46,240
If it's too soon, we won't get pulled out.

1072
01:33:46,294 --> 01:33:49,538
If it's too late...
I won't be able to drop us.

1073
01:33:49,592 --> 01:33:50,955
Why not?

1074
01:33:51,011 --> 01:33:56,014
Cause of the van, that will be in free fall.
Can't drop you without gravity.

1075
01:33:56,215 --> 01:33:57,954
Right.

1076
01:34:02,518 --> 01:34:05,959
You're with me.
Go on.

1077
01:34:29,482 --> 01:34:32,058
- Mr. Charles
- Do you know what that is, Mr. Fischer?

1078
01:34:32,112 --> 01:34:35,956
- Yeah, I think so, yeah.
- They were trying to put you under.

1079
01:34:36,130 --> 01:34:38,301
- I'm already under.
- Under again.

1080
01:34:38,355 --> 01:34:41,563
What do you mean?
A dream within a dream?

1081
01:34:41,566 --> 01:34:44,436
Hey. I see you've changed.

1082
01:34:44,439 --> 01:34:46,426
I'm sorry.

1083
01:34:46,580 --> 01:34:50,522
Oh, I'm sorry.
I've mistaken you for a friend.

1084
01:34:51,821 --> 01:34:54,492
Good looking fella, I'm sure.

1085
01:34:55,698 --> 01:34:59,776
That's Fischer's projection of Browning.
Let's follow him and see how he behaves.

1086
01:34:59,779 --> 01:35:02,315
- Why?
- Because how he acts would tell us...

1087
01:35:02,317 --> 01:35:05,494
if Fischer is going to suspect his motives,
the way we wanted to.

1088
01:35:10,861 --> 01:35:14,130
- Uncle Peter.
- You said you were kidnapped together?

1089
01:35:14,132 --> 01:35:17,280
Well, not exactly. They already had him.
They were torturing him.

1090
01:35:17,282 --> 01:35:20,192
And you saw them torture him?

1091
01:35:26,353 --> 01:35:30,759
- The kidnappers are working for you?
- Robert.

1092
01:35:30,762 --> 01:35:34,984
You're trying to get that safe open?
So you get the alternate will?

1093
01:35:34,986 --> 01:35:39,214
Fischer-Morrow has been my entire life.
I can't let you destroy it.

1094
01:35:39,217 --> 01:35:41,762
I'm not gonna throw away my inheritance.
Why would I?

1095
01:35:41,764 --> 01:35:46,533
I couldn't let you rise to
your father's last taunt.

1096
01:35:46,946 --> 01:35:49,987
- What taunt?
- The will, Robert, that will.

1097
01:35:49,990 --> 01:35:52,177
That's his last insult.

1098
01:35:52,180 --> 01:35:56,064
A challenge for you to
build something for yourself...

1099
01:35:56,066 --> 01:36:00,429
by telling you you're not
worthy of his accomplishments.

1100
01:36:05,144 --> 01:36:08,787
What, that he was disappointed, hmm?

1101
01:36:09,090 --> 01:36:11,757
I'm sorry.

1102
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:15,392
But... he's wrong.

1103
01:36:16,154 --> 01:36:18,777
You can build a better
company than he ever did.

1104
01:36:18,831 --> 01:36:21,292
Mr. Fischer?
He's lying!

1105
01:36:21,345 --> 01:36:23,506
- How do you know?
- Trust me, it's what I do.

1106
01:36:23,561 --> 01:36:26,616
He's hiding something and
we need to find out what that is.

1107
01:36:27,925 --> 01:36:31,541
I need you to do the same thing to
him that he was going to do to you.

1108
01:36:33,668 --> 01:36:37,412
We'll enter his subconscious and find
out what he doesn't want you to know.

1109
01:36:39,229 --> 01:36:41,473
Alright.

1110
01:36:46,641 --> 01:36:47,512
He's out.

1111
01:36:47,514 --> 01:36:50,307
Wait, whose subconscious
are we going into exactly?

1112
01:36:50,362 --> 01:36:51,781
We're going into Fischer's.

1113
01:36:51,836 --> 01:36:54,620
But I told him it was Browning's
so he can be a part of our team.

1114
01:36:54,673 --> 01:36:56,934
He's gonna help us break
into his own subconscious.

1115
01:36:56,989 --> 01:36:58,011
That's right.

1116
01:36:58,366 --> 01:37:01,090
Security's gonna run you down, huh.

1117
01:37:01,145 --> 01:37:03,706
And I will lead them on a merry chase.

1118
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:05,453
Just be back here for the kick.

1119
01:37:05,458 --> 01:37:07,329
Go to sleep, Mr. Eames.

1120
01:37:11,667 --> 01:37:13,651
Are you good?

1121
01:37:16,474 --> 01:37:20,754
- Are you alright?
- Yes, yes. I'm.. I'm fine. I'm ready.

1122
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:38,594
Cobb? Cobb?
What's down there?

1123
01:37:41,582 --> 01:37:44,073
Hopefully the truth we
want Fischer to learn.

1124
01:37:44,128 --> 01:37:46,750
I mean, what's down there for you?

1125
01:40:22,951 --> 01:40:24,404
Did you see that?

1126
01:40:43,226 --> 01:40:45,178
Eames, this is your dream.

1127
01:40:45,270 --> 01:40:48,207
I need you to draw the security away
from the complex, you understand?

1128
01:40:48,264 --> 01:40:50,448
- Who will guide Fischer in?
- Not me.

1129
01:40:50,502 --> 01:40:52,960
Find all the route,
everything could be compromised.

1130
01:40:53,015 --> 01:40:55,836
- I designed the place.
- No, you're with me.

1131
01:40:55,893 --> 01:40:57,671
I could do it.

1132
01:40:57,725 --> 01:41:00,371
Alright, you'll reach on the
route into the complex.

1133
01:41:00,460 --> 01:41:03,138
- Fischer, you'll be going with him.
- Alright.

1134
01:41:03,228 --> 01:41:07,852
- What about you?
- Keep this alive. I'll be listening in the whole time.

1135
01:41:07,906 --> 01:41:09,921
The windows on that upper
floor are big enough for me...

1136
01:41:09,975 --> 01:41:11,792
to cover you from that south tower.
You see it?

1137
01:41:11,848 --> 01:41:14,789
- Yeah. You're not coming in?
- In order to find out the truth...

1138
01:41:14,842 --> 01:41:18,252
about your father, you're gonna need to
break into Browning's mind on your own.

1139
01:41:19,695 --> 01:41:21,431
Come, Fischer!

1140
01:42:16,857 --> 01:42:20,747
Sound the alarm!
Sound the alarm!

1141
01:42:20,802 --> 01:42:21,829
Move!

1142
01:42:24,018 --> 01:42:25,637
Go!

1143
01:42:39,954 --> 01:42:42,186
So they're shooting me!

1144
01:42:52,302 --> 01:42:53,940
I hope they're ready.

1145
01:43:03,222 --> 01:43:05,387
It's too soon.

1146
01:43:10,952 --> 01:43:12,605
Cobb, do you hear that?

1147
01:43:12,697 --> 01:43:16,069
First heard it about twenty minutes ago.
I thought it was the wind up here.

1148
01:43:16,259 --> 01:43:18,727
Yeah, I hear it.
It's music.

1149
01:43:18,882 --> 01:43:22,043
- So what do we do?
- Move fast.

1150
01:43:27,302 --> 01:43:29,516
Yusuf's ten seconds for the jump.

1151
01:43:31,446 --> 01:43:33,515
Which gives Arthur three minutes.

1152
01:43:34,878 --> 01:43:37,472
Hey!

1153
01:43:37,528 --> 01:43:39,280
- Which gives us what?
- Sixty minutes.

1154
01:43:39,334 --> 01:43:40,951
Can they make that
route in under an hour?

1155
01:43:41,025 --> 01:43:42,954
They still have to climb
down to the middle terrace.

1156
01:43:43,008 --> 01:43:45,274
Well then, they need a new route.
A more direct route.

1157
01:43:57,191 --> 01:43:58,846
It's designed as a labyrinth.

1158
01:43:58,901 --> 01:44:01,587
There must be access where
we can cut through the maze, right?

1159
01:44:01,642 --> 01:44:03,378
Eames?

1160
01:44:26,479 --> 01:44:27,410
Did Eames add any features?

1161
01:44:27,465 --> 01:44:29,465
I don't think I should tell you.
If Mal finds out...

1162
01:44:29,519 --> 01:44:32,218
We don't have time for this.
Did he add any?

1163
01:44:32,273 --> 01:44:34,774
He added an air duct system
that can cut through the maze.

1164
01:44:34,829 --> 01:44:36,105
Good. Explain it to them.

1165
01:44:36,159 --> 01:44:37,732
- Saito?
- Go ahead.

1166
01:45:10,782 --> 01:45:12,986
Paradoxical.

1167
01:46:22,513 --> 01:46:25,493
- What was that?
- The kick.

1168
01:46:26,137 --> 01:46:29,141
- Cobb, did we miss it?
- Yeah, we missed it.

1169
01:46:29,153 --> 01:46:34,249
Couldn't you instead just have
dreamt of a goddamn beach?

1170
01:46:37,026 --> 01:46:39,209
What the hell do we do now?

1171
01:46:39,364 --> 01:46:41,512
We finish the job before the next kick.

1172
01:46:41,566 --> 01:46:44,370
- What next kick?
- When the van hits the water.

1173
01:47:07,355 --> 01:47:09,754
<i>If wanna make a call,
please hang up and try again.</i>

1174
01:47:09,809 --> 01:47:11,673
<i>If you need assistance...</i>

1175
01:47:11,728 --> 01:47:15,502
How do I drop you without gravity?

1176
01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:20,752
Arthur has a couple of minutes,
we have about twenty.

1177
01:47:44,149 --> 01:47:45,771
Are you okay?

1178
01:47:50,682 --> 01:47:53,680
Move out!
To the base!

1179
01:47:58,127 --> 01:48:01,083
There's something wrong. They're heading
your way like they know something.

1180
01:48:03,031 --> 01:48:06,084
Just buy us some more time, alright?
Come on!

1181
01:48:06,540 --> 01:48:08,637
On my way.

1182
01:49:47,729 --> 01:49:50,145
That's the antechamber,
it's just stronger.

1183
01:49:50,200 --> 01:49:51,679
Was it stronger if it have any windows?

1184
01:49:51,734 --> 01:49:53,225
No, I mean it wouldn't
be very strong if it did.

1185
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:55,785
Let's hope Fischer likes
what he finds in there.

1186
01:49:57,524 --> 01:49:59,444
Are those projections part
of his subconscious?

1187
01:49:59,699 --> 01:50:01,205
Yes.

1188
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:02,808
Are you destroying
those parts of his mind?

1189
01:50:02,863 --> 01:50:05,045
No, no.
They're just projections.

1190
01:50:30,215 --> 01:50:31,696
We're here.

1191
01:50:31,751 --> 01:50:34,993
You're clear but hurry.
There's an entire army headed your way.

1192
01:51:01,144 --> 01:51:02,927
We're in.

1193
01:51:51,946 --> 01:51:55,046
- There's someone else in there.
- Fischer, it's a trap, get out!

1194
01:51:56,981 --> 01:51:59,066
Come on. A little lower.

1195
01:52:03,902 --> 01:52:10,265
- Cobb. No, she is not real!
- How do you know that?

1196
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:14,234
She is just a projection.
Fischer... Fischer is real!

1197
01:52:18,258 --> 01:52:19,904
Hello.

1198
01:52:24,761 --> 01:52:27,999
Eames! Eames!
Get to the antechamber now!

1199
01:53:11,527 --> 01:53:14,078
- What happened?
- Mal killed Fischer.

1200
01:53:16,827 --> 01:53:19,088
I couldn't shoot her.

1201
01:53:19,245 --> 01:53:20,998
But there's no use in reviving him...

1202
01:53:21,051 --> 01:53:25,283
his mind's already trapped down there.
It's all over.

1203
01:53:25,740 --> 01:53:27,925
So that's it?
Then we failed?

1204
01:53:27,980 --> 01:53:30,706
We're done.
I'm sorry.

1205
01:53:33,926 --> 01:53:37,404
Well, it's not me who's gonna
get back to my family, is it?

1206
01:53:37,660 --> 01:53:39,722
It's a shame, I really want to know
what's gonna happen in there.

1207
01:53:39,776 --> 01:53:43,207
- I swear we have this one..
- Let's set the charges.

1208
01:53:45,371 --> 01:53:47,492
No, there's still another way.

1209
01:53:47,949 --> 01:53:50,328
We just have to follow
Fischer down there.

1210
01:53:50,383 --> 01:53:51,539
We don't have time.

1211
01:53:51,693 --> 01:53:55,329
No, but there will be enough
time down there.

1212
01:53:55,685 --> 01:53:56,877
And we will find him.

1213
01:53:56,932 --> 01:54:01,304
Okay, as soon as Arthur's music kicks in
just use the defibrillator to revive him.

1214
01:54:01,358 --> 01:54:05,088
We can give him his
own kick down below.

1215
01:54:03,652 --> 01:54:05,190
Look you get him in there.

1216
01:54:05,345 --> 01:54:08,208
As soon as the music ends,
you blow up the hospital.

1217
01:54:08,262 --> 01:54:11,543
And we all ride the kick
back up the layers.

1218
01:54:12,609 --> 01:54:14,200
That's worth a shot.

1219
01:54:14,254 --> 01:54:17,448
And Saito can hold the guards
out while I set the charges.

1220
01:54:17,503 --> 01:54:19,921
Saito, will never make it, will he?

1221
01:54:20,766 --> 01:54:23,251
Cobb, come on!
We've got to try.

1222
01:54:23,406 --> 01:54:24,334
Let's go!

1223
01:54:24,691 --> 01:54:27,263
Look if we're not that fully kicked,
I am gonna leave in vain.

1224
01:54:27,318 --> 01:54:29,922
She's right.
She's right.

1225
01:54:35,145 --> 01:54:36,813
Can I trust you to do what's
gonna happen here?

1226
01:54:36,869 --> 01:54:38,523
I mean, Mal's gonna
be down there.

1227
01:54:38,577 --> 01:54:40,942
I know where to find her.
She'll have Fischer.

1228
01:54:40,997 --> 01:54:42,741
How do you know?

1229
01:54:42,796 --> 01:54:47,659
She wants me to come after her,
she wants me back down there with her.

1230
01:55:14,639 --> 01:55:16,281
Are you alright?

1231
01:55:22,677 --> 01:55:25,481
- This is your world?
- Was.

1232
01:55:26,394 --> 01:55:28,343
This is where she'll be.

1233
01:55:29,136 --> 01:55:30,908
Come on.

1234
01:56:17,690 --> 01:56:19,993
Saito...

1235
01:56:20,048 --> 01:56:23,974
I need you... I need you to take care of
Fischer while I go set some charges, okay?

1236
01:56:24,029 --> 01:56:27,680
No room for tourists on this jobs.

1237
01:56:29,341 --> 01:56:32,047
Don't be silly.

1238
01:57:04,163 --> 01:57:06,534
You built all these?
This is incredible.

1239
01:57:06,588 --> 01:57:08,601
We built for years.

1240
01:57:09,657 --> 01:57:12,357
We started in on the memories.

1241
01:57:18,679 --> 01:57:20,349
This way.

1242
01:58:01,682 --> 01:58:05,953
This is our neighbourhood.
The place is from my past.

1243
01:58:06,210 --> 01:58:10,729
That was our first apartment and we
moved to that building right there.

1244
01:58:10,984 --> 01:58:13,570
After Mal became pregnant,
that became our home.

1245
01:58:13,624 --> 01:58:16,530
You reconstructed all
of these from memory?

1246
01:58:16,683 --> 01:58:19,050
Like I told you, we have lots of time.

1247
01:58:19,104 --> 01:58:20,808
What is that?

1248
01:58:21,565 --> 01:58:24,161
It's the house Mal grew up with.

1249
01:58:24,215 --> 01:58:26,361
- Will she be in there?
- No.

1250
01:58:26,717 --> 01:58:28,302
Come on.

1251
01:58:28,357 --> 01:58:31,619
We both wanted to live in a house
but we love this type of building.

1252
01:58:31,675 --> 01:58:34,675
In the real world, we'd have
to choose, but not here.

1253
01:59:15,331 --> 01:59:17,748
How are you gonna bring Fischer back?

1254
01:59:17,804 --> 01:59:20,310
I'm gonna have to come up
with some kind of a kick.

1255
01:59:20,364 --> 01:59:22,156
What?

1256
01:59:22,614 --> 01:59:23,866
The improvised.

1257
01:59:24,022 --> 01:59:28,426
Listen, there's something you should know about me.
About inception.

1258
01:59:41,690 --> 01:59:45,604
An idea is like a virus.
Resilient.

1259
01:59:46,609 --> 01:59:47,963
Highly contagious.

1260
01:59:48,131 --> 01:59:51,775
The smallest seed of an idea can grow.

1261
01:59:52,032 --> 01:59:57,762
It can grown to define or destroy you.

1262
02:00:00,379 --> 02:00:06,418
The smallest idea such as:
"Your world is not real".

1263
02:00:06,471 --> 02:00:10,477
Simple. little thought
that changes everything.

1264
02:00:11,254 --> 02:00:15,949
So certain of your world.
Of what's real?

1265
02:00:16,004 --> 02:00:18,756
Do you think he is?

1266
02:00:19,695 --> 02:00:23,548
Why do you think
he's as lost as I was?

1267
02:00:23,672 --> 02:00:26,685
I know it's real, Mal.

1268
02:00:27,494 --> 02:00:30,195
No creeping doubts?

1269
02:00:30,351 --> 02:00:33,337
Not feeling persecuted, Dom?

1270
02:00:33,392 --> 02:00:37,370
Chased around the globe by anonymous
corporations and police forces?

1271
02:00:37,526 --> 02:00:41,149
The way the projections
persecute the dreamer?

1272
02:00:41,811 --> 02:00:42,992
Admit it.

1273
02:00:44,817 --> 02:00:47,006
You don't believe in one reality anymore.

1274
02:00:47,711 --> 02:00:51,178
So choose.
Choose to be here.

1275
02:00:52,079 --> 02:00:53,358
Choose me.

1276
02:01:19,572 --> 02:01:22,807
You know what I have to do,
I have to get back to our children...

1277
02:01:22,844 --> 02:01:23,977
because you left them.

1278
02:01:24,701 --> 02:01:27,456
- Because you left us.
- You're wrong.

1279
02:01:27,590 --> 02:01:30,164
- Not at all.
- You're confused.

1280
02:01:30,201 --> 02:01:31,609
Our children are here.

1281
02:01:32,609 --> 02:01:35,618
And you'd like to see their
faces again, wouldn't you?

1282
02:01:36,430 --> 02:01:39,309
Yes, but I want to see
them up above, Mal.

1283
02:01:53,127 --> 02:01:54,419
Up above?

1284
02:01:56,155 --> 02:02:00,881
Listen to yourself.
These are our children. Watch.

1285
02:02:02,236 --> 02:02:04,018
James?
Phillipa?

1286
02:02:04,107 --> 02:02:06,824
Don't do this, Mal, please.
Those aren't my children.

1287
02:02:06,914 --> 02:02:09,231
You keep telling yourself
that but you don't believe it.

1288
02:02:09,325 --> 02:02:11,253
- No, I know it.
- What if you're wrong?

1289
02:02:12,174 --> 02:02:13,025
What if I'm what's real?

1290
02:02:15,772 --> 02:02:23,467
You keep telling yourself what you know.
But what do you believe? What do you feel?

1291
02:02:25,053 --> 02:02:26,501
Guilt.

1292
02:02:28,131 --> 02:02:29,753
I feel guilt, Mal.

1293
02:02:31,357 --> 02:02:35,369
And no matter what I do,
no matter how hopeless I am...

1294
02:02:35,422 --> 02:02:39,764
no matter how confused...
that guilt is always there.

1295
02:02:39,818 --> 02:02:42,385
reminding me of the truth.

1296
02:02:42,427 --> 02:02:45,843
What truth?

1297
02:02:46,725 --> 02:02:52,003
The idea that caused you to question
your reality came from me.

1298
02:02:55,141 --> 02:02:58,249
You planted the idea in my mind?

1299
02:02:59,242 --> 02:03:01,181
What is she talking about?

1300
02:03:01,915 --> 02:03:07,173
The reason I knew inception was
possible was because I did it to her first.

1301
02:03:08,040 --> 02:03:11,261
- I did it to my own wife.
- Why?

1302
02:03:11,809 --> 02:03:13,928
We were lost in here.

1303
02:03:14,082 --> 02:03:18,687
I knew we needed to escape
but she wouldn't accept it.

1304
02:03:21,884 --> 02:03:28,327
She had locked something away,
something... something deep inside.

1305
02:03:28,381 --> 02:03:32,908
The truth that she had once
known but she chose to forget.

1306
02:03:33,533 --> 02:03:35,606
She couldn't break free.

1307
02:03:38,548 --> 02:03:41,119
So I decided to search for it.

1308
02:03:41,889 --> 02:03:46,835
Going deep into the recess of her mind
and found that secret place.

1309
02:03:46,895 --> 02:03:52,163
I broke in and I planted an idea.

1310
02:03:52,218 --> 02:03:56,812
A simple idea that I knew
would change everything.

1311
02:04:01,488 --> 02:04:03,969
That her world wasn't real.

1312
02:04:16,379 --> 02:04:19,514
That death was the only escape.

1313
02:04:27,077 --> 02:04:29,207
You're waiting for a train..

1314
02:04:30,662 --> 02:04:33,513
A train that will take you far away...

1315
02:04:35,375 --> 02:04:38,081
You know where you hope
this train will take you.

1316
02:04:39,131 --> 02:04:41,365
But you can't know for sure!

1317
02:04:42,467 --> 02:04:44,476
And it doesn't matter!

1318
02:04:45,137 --> 02:04:49,047
- Now tell me why!
- Because we'll be together.

1319
02:04:52,831 --> 02:04:57,580
And I never knew that... that idea
would grow in her mind like a cancer...

1320
02:04:57,635 --> 02:05:01,557
that even after she woke.

1321
02:05:02,214 --> 02:05:06,822
...that even after yo
came back to reality

1322
02:05:07,543 --> 02:05:11,344
that you keep to believe
your world wasn't real.

1323
02:05:13,699 --> 02:05:16,623
That death was the only escape.

1324
02:05:16,779 --> 02:05:19,019
Mal, no!
Jesus!

1325
02:05:19,274 --> 02:05:22,994
- You're infecting my mind.
- I was trying to save you.

1326
02:05:23,050 --> 02:05:27,062
You betrayed me but you
can make amends.

1327
02:05:27,116 --> 02:05:29,096
You can still keep your promise.

1328
02:05:29,150 --> 02:05:35,181
We can still be together right here.
In the world we built together.

1329
02:06:55,645 --> 02:06:58,706
Cobb, we need to get Fischer.

1330
02:06:58,962 --> 02:07:01,258
You can't have him.

1331
02:07:01,412 --> 02:07:03,693
If I stay here, will you let him go?

1332
02:07:03,747 --> 02:07:06,217
What are you talking about?

1333
02:07:09,262 --> 02:07:11,843
Fischer's on the porch.

1334
02:07:11,897 --> 02:07:14,298
- Go check if he's alive, Ariadne.
- Cobb, you can't do this.

1335
02:07:14,353 --> 02:07:17,465
Go check if he's alive, right now!
Do it.

1336
02:07:32,830 --> 02:07:36,053
He's here and it's time
but you have to come now!

1337
02:07:36,197 --> 02:07:40,463
- Take Fischer with you, alright?
- You can't stay here to be with her!

1338
02:07:42,454 --> 02:07:45,398
I'm not. Saito's dead
by now that means...

1339
02:07:45,553 --> 02:07:49,479
he's down here somewhere.
That means I have to find him.

1340
02:07:50,760 --> 02:07:54,051
I can't stay with her anymore
because she doesn't exist.

1341
02:07:54,106 --> 02:07:58,080
I'm the only thing you
do believe in anymore.

1342
02:07:59,878 --> 02:08:02,264
I wish...

1343
02:08:03,221 --> 02:08:06,434
I wish more than anything, but...

1344
02:08:06,689 --> 02:08:09,337
...I can't imagine you
with all your complexity.

1345
02:08:09,390 --> 02:08:11,533
All your perfection.
All your imperfection.

1346
02:08:13,358 --> 02:08:14,560
Are you alright?

1347
02:08:14,615 --> 02:08:17,299
Look at you.

1348
02:08:17,654 --> 02:08:22,919
You're just a shade.
You're just a shade of my real wife.

1349
02:08:22,974 --> 02:08:26,404
And you are the best
that I could do, but...

1350
02:08:26,457 --> 02:08:29,007
...I'm sorry, you're just
not good enough.

1351
02:08:29,639 --> 02:08:31,254
This will feel real?

1352
02:08:32,985 --> 02:08:36,211
- What are you doing?
- Improvise.

1353
02:08:44,031 --> 02:08:45,766
No, no, no!

1354
02:08:46,761 --> 02:08:48,824
Get in there, now!
Go, go, go!

1355
02:09:35,268 --> 02:09:38,350
Disappointed...

1356
02:09:39,480 --> 02:09:40,672
Disappointed...

1357
02:09:40,726 --> 02:09:43,532
I know, Dad.

1358
02:09:49,111 --> 02:09:53,902
I know you were disappointed.
I couldn't be you.

1359
02:09:54,358 --> 02:09:58,008
No, no, no!...

1360
02:09:58,142 --> 02:10:05,779
I was disappointed that you tried.

1361
02:10:38,330 --> 02:10:40,298
Come on, come on, come on!

1362
02:11:04,045 --> 02:11:06,150
Dad?

1363
02:11:49,357 --> 02:11:52,699
That's the kick, Ariadne!
You have to go now!

1364
02:12:05,421 --> 02:12:08,964
Don't lose yourself!
Find Saito and bring him back!

1365
02:12:09,119 --> 02:12:11,721
I will!

1366
02:12:50,371 --> 02:12:53,898
Do you remember when
you asked me to marry you?

1367
02:12:54,252 --> 02:12:55,203
Yes.

1368
02:12:55,258 --> 02:13:00,230
You said you dreamt that
we'll grow old together.

1369
02:13:00,802 --> 02:13:03,393
But we did.

1370
02:13:04,173 --> 02:13:07,508
We did, you don't remember?

1371
02:13:11,277 --> 02:13:14,888
I'd miss you, more
than I can bear, but...

1372
02:13:16,613 --> 02:13:19,867
...we had our time together.

1373
02:13:19,932 --> 02:13:23,910
And I have to let you go.

1374
02:13:23,963 --> 02:13:27,394
I have to let you go.

1375
02:14:16,989 --> 02:14:18,873
I'm sorry, Robert.

1376
02:14:45,969 --> 02:14:49,710
You know, the Will means that
dad wanted me to be my own man.

1377
02:14:50,665 --> 02:14:53,549
Not just to live for him.

1378
02:14:54,459 --> 02:14:57,281
That's what I'm gonna do, Uncle Peter.

1379
02:15:06,583 --> 02:15:08,412
What happened?

1380
02:15:08,465 --> 02:15:10,332
- Cobb stayed.
- With Mal?

1381
02:15:10,389 --> 02:15:13,566
No, to find Saito.

1382
02:15:14,021 --> 02:15:16,787
He'll be lost.

1383
02:15:18,067 --> 02:15:21,042
No, he'll be alright.

1384
02:15:36,171 --> 02:15:39,187
Are you going to kill me?

1385
02:15:42,115 --> 02:15:45,355
I'm waiting for someone.

1386
02:15:49,162 --> 02:15:53,465
Someone from a half-remembered dream.

1387
02:15:54,504 --> 02:16:00,009
Cobb?
Impossible.

1388
02:16:00,430 --> 02:16:03,927
We were young men together.

1389
02:16:04,625 --> 02:16:07,789
I'm an old man...

1390
02:16:07,943 --> 02:16:11,867
Filled with regret.

1391
02:16:13,271 --> 02:16:17,095
Waiting to die alone, huh.

1392
02:16:19,285 --> 02:16:29,441
I've come back for you...
To remind you of something.

1393
02:16:31,743 --> 02:16:35,181
Something you once knew.

1394
02:16:37,127 --> 02:16:40,291
That this world is not real.

1395
02:16:44,205 --> 02:16:49,736
To convince me to
honor our arrangement?

1396
02:16:49,891 --> 02:16:53,669
To take a leap of faith, yes.

1397
02:16:58,435 --> 02:17:06,593
Come back, so we can be
young man together again.

1398
02:17:09,462 --> 02:17:15,817
Come back with me.
Come back.

1399
02:17:25,906 --> 02:17:27,967
Hot towel, sir?

1400
02:17:28,021 --> 02:17:31,150
We'll landing in Los Angeles
in about twenty minutes.

1401
02:17:31,205 --> 02:17:34,288
Do you need immigration forms?

1402
02:17:35,552 --> 02:17:37,352
Thank you.

1403
02:17:37,406 --> 02:17:40,479
- Hot towel, sir?
- Oh no.

1404
02:17:40,533 --> 02:17:42,508
Do you need immigration forms?

1405
02:18:54,366 --> 02:18:57,951
- Welcome home, Mr. Cobb.
- Thank you, sir.

1406
02:19:41,985 --> 02:19:45,376
Welcome home.
This way.

1407
02:20:06,204 --> 02:20:11,096
James?
Phillipa?

1408
02:20:13,899 --> 02:20:16,379
Look who's here!

1409
02:20:23,021 --> 02:20:26,217
Hey kids, how are you?

1410
02:20:26,272 --> 02:20:29,276
- Daddy!
- How are you?

1411
02:20:29,430 --> 02:20:31,250
Look what I built, Daddy!

1412
02:20:31,305 --> 02:20:35,204
- What are you doing there?
- I built a house made of rocks!

1413
02:20:35,358 --> 02:20:37,674
- Out of rocks?
- Come, I want you to see it.

1414
02:20:37,930 --> 02:20:40,219
Can you make me one?

1415
02:20:40,274 --> 02:20:43,288
Come on, Daddy!

1416
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:50,000
