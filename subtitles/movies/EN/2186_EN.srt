<i>Claudia...</i>

4
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:21,140
<i>Why don't you wait a bit longer?</i>

5
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:25,484
<i>I've already been waiting for a week...</i>

6
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:27,743
<i>and it doesn't seem
I'm late for my period.</i>

8
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:37,154
<i>No.</i>

I'll have to register you.

15

and I'll pick them tomorrow.

31
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:12,986
Thanks a lot.

32
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,364
You're welcome.

33
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,809
I have to go on.

34
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:04,897
Hello...

35
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:21,215
<i>- Please, eat something.
- No, no.</i>

36
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,724
Eat some, come on.

37
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:36,262
Hello.

38
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,293
Hello.

39
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:41,531
- How are you, Lidia?
- Just fine.

40
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,504
Hi, dad.

41
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:47,211
- How are you feeling?
- Fine.

42
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,752
- What happened?
- Nothing.

43
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:59,619
- Nothing? You fell down, right?
- Yes...

44
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,954
Why?

45
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:05,430
You have to ask Lidia
when you want to move around the house.

46
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:07,899
- Not Lidia, please...
- Yes, Lidia.

47
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,333
When you go to the bathroom,
you go with Lidia.

48
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:13,969
When you need to have your diapers
changed, you ask her. That's her job.

49
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,371
<i>Okay.</i>

50
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,079
Here it goes...

51
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,086
Keep your eyes closed.

52
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:36,459
I can't come tomorrow...
I have to leave town.

53
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,990
I'll manage.

54
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,362
<i>- Not that way!
- Okay, hold it.</i>

55
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,767
I wash and you rinse, okay?

56
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,302
- Will you let herbathe you?
- Yes.

57
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,540
Will you really let Lidia bathe you?

58
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:59,139
No, I've already had a bathtoday.

59
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:03,248
- But that's what Lidia is here for...
- Give me.

60
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,153
Here I come, wait...

61
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:08,420
or it will get in youreyes.

62
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,427
Don't open your eyes,
here you have this.

63
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,259
Come on, rinse.

64
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:23,898
<i>Okay.</i>

65
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:26,806
Move back, dad.

66
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:31,006
Be careful.
Easy does it... there you go.

67
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,447
A bit more. That's it.

68
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,455
Rinse a bit more.

69
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,221
Enough.

70
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,207
You have such nice hair.

71
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,054
Should I bring your pajamas?

72
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,993
The blue ones.

73
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:20,390
The blue ones are too small.

74
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:23,460
I want the blue ones.

75
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,333
<i>Okay.</i>

76
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:56,951
Hello...

77
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,531
Mister...

78
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,317
But that's none of my business.

79
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:31,863
Yeah. But you call her...

80
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:34,056
She'll listen to you.

81
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,533
Yes, dear...

82
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,603
Yes, I'm busy right now...

83
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:41,063
Thanks.

84
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:45,343
I'll call you back. I'm busy now.
I can't talk.

85
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,038
Yes.

86
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,841
Yes... later on.

87
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,881
Excuse me, it was my wife.

88
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,910
...and the property
was foreclosed, right?

89
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,887
Yes, there was this huge debt.

90
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,891
But it has been paid. All of it.

91
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,893
Here you have the papers.

92
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,791
And I've included...

93
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,764
myfees and expenses as well.

94
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:11,330
- Do I discuss it with you?
- No, with my boss.

95
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:15,229
So, it's a farm...

96
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:20,233
- with a house.
- Yes, Emilio's house.

97
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:24,145
The poor man could no longerwork.
But we let him stay anyway.

98
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:25,716
Poorman...

99
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,615
- Are there people in the house?
- No.

100
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,883
Let me explain.
An elderly couple owned the house.

101
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:34,824
Really nice people
but with no children.

102
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,892
And one day she died...

103
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,155
in March, April.

104
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:41,893
And he just fell to pieces.

105
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,729
He died two orthree months later.

106
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:48,000
They found him in his bed
afterten days.

107
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,472
Imagine that...

108
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:52,540
Anyway,
the house isn't worth much.

109
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:54,942
The important thing is the land.

110
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,916
It's 35 soy quintals, outside of town.

111
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:56,815
<i>Emilio, happy birthday!
Yours forever, Mabel.</i>

112
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,506
Here you have
the plans ofthe house.

113
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,874
Take them with you.

114
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,679
Great.

115
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,516
When you're done,
I'll treat youto lunch.

116
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:01,983
<i>Okay, Desouza?</i>

117
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:05,220
Unfortunately, I have to go.

118
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:09,494
- Can't even stay forlunch?
- I really have to go.

119
