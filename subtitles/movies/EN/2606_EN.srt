1
00:02:03,578 --> 00:02:06,412
I think I'll make this
the boys' room.

2
00:02:06,454 --> 00:02:08,497
The master bedroom?

3
00:02:08,622 --> 00:02:12,581
- Boys need, you know, space.
- How old are they?

4
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,750
- Steven's ten, Danny's seven.
- Lucky kids.

5
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:18,250
Lucky dad.

6
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:02,063
Is everything-

7
00:03:02,147 --> 00:03:04,688
- It's my first house, and-
- Doyle, you're getting the loan.

8
00:03:04,772 --> 00:03:06,689
I'm not sure I filled
everything out correctly.

9
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:09,899
You're approved. We'll have
it done for you tomorrow.

10
00:03:09,983 --> 00:03:14,150
Come by, say, 12:30,
and we can sign off on this.

11
00:03:17,527 --> 00:03:19,820
What about you?

12
00:03:19,904 --> 00:03:22,822
- He bought all these instruments.
- Right.

13
00:03:22,905 --> 00:03:24,990
Did you know that
he built this hall?

14
00:03:25,073 --> 00:03:27,824
And a gallery...

15
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:29,700
a shelter and a hospital
in Mexico...

16
00:03:29,783 --> 00:03:32,701
and a lot of other
really great things.

17
00:03:34,327 --> 00:03:36,912
I met Simon Dunne
when I was in college.

18
00:03:36,995 --> 00:03:39,204
I was tutoring kids
from the local school-

19
00:03:39,287 --> 00:03:42,247
kids who didn't have
a lot of resources.

20
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:44,582
And one of the people
I was working with...

21
00:03:44,665 --> 00:03:48,418
said that her grandfather
liked to help children in nee.

22
00:03:48,501 --> 00:03:51,210
Her name was Mina Dunne.

23
00:03:51,251 --> 00:03:53,253
In fact, she's sitting
right over here.

24
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:58,672
So my friend and I went to
her grandfather and we said...

25
00:03:58,755 --> 00:04:02,465
we have some kids
who need a playground.

26
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:05,634
We needed a thousand dollars.
He said, "I'll tell you what.

27
00:04:05,717 --> 00:04:09,051
You can't have
a thousand dollars...

28
00:04:09,135 --> 00:04:10,886
to build one playground.

29
00:04:10,927 --> 00:04:14,263
You can have 10,000 to build ten."

30
00:04:14,347 --> 00:04:16,431
So we did.

31
00:04:16,515 --> 00:04:18,723
- How long have you played violin?
- Six years.

32
00:04:18,807 --> 00:04:22,934
- How about you?
- I feel llke champagne.

33
00:04:23,017 --> 00:04:26,977
I understand the idea
of celebration.

34
00:04:27,061 --> 00:04:31,187
I see the bubbles in champagne...

35
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:36,021
as something good and beautiful.

36
00:04:36,105 --> 00:04:38,606
Not part of my soul evaporating...

37
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,858
but- but rising...

38
00:04:41,942 --> 00:04:44,443
with-

39
00:04:44,527 --> 00:04:45,984
with joy.

40
00:04:47,652 --> 00:04:50,154
What I'm trying to say is...

41
00:04:50,237 --> 00:04:53,196
I don't want champagne.

42
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,240
I am champagne.

43
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:02,491
It's great to be alive.
Thanks for lettin' me share.

44
00:05:02,575 --> 00:05:03,951
Thanks for sharing.

45
00:05:07,078 --> 00:05:11,122
- I'm Mike, and I'm an alcoholic.
- Hi, Mike!

46
00:05:11,206 --> 00:05:14,081
I've been so ber for 15 days.

47
00:05:19,334 --> 00:05:20,501
Mina, wait a second!

48
00:05:20,584 --> 00:05:24,544
My grandfather liked you for some
mysterious reasons of his own.

49
00:05:24,627 --> 00:05:27,421
Excuse me. That's the only reason
we allowed you to speak today.

50
00:05:27,504 --> 00:05:29,213
Wait a minute.
Mina, we're friends.

51
00:05:29,297 --> 00:05:32,215
We were friends a long time ago.

52
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:34,424
Mina, I owe you so much.

53
00:05:35,758 --> 00:05:37,300
What happened to you?

54
00:05:37,384 --> 00:05:39,302
What do you mean?

55
00:05:40,428 --> 00:05:42,344
- I'll see you in court.
- Mina! Wait a second.

56
00:05:42,428 --> 00:05:44,721
It's okay, it's okay.
Let her go.

57
00:05:44,804 --> 00:05:48,180
Let her go.
George, Melissa. How are you?

58
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,181
- Hi.
- Good to see you.

59
00:05:50,265 --> 00:05:52,181
...grant me the serenity...

60
00:05:52,265 --> 00:05:55,267
to accept the things
I cannot change...

61
00:05:55,351 --> 00:05:57,601
and the wisdom
to know the difference...

62
00:05:57,684 --> 00:05:59,226
to keep coming back.

63
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:03,271
It works if you work it,
so work it. You're worth it.

64
00:06:08,772 --> 00:06:10,898
- Good morning, Julia.
- Hey, Gavin.

65
00:06:10,982 --> 00:06:12,232
Good morning, guys.

66
00:06:12,316 --> 00:06:16,067
...use of the premises by lessee,
then lessor and lessee shall-

67
00:06:16,151 --> 00:06:18,819
I don't deserve this.
I did absolutely nothing wrong...

68
00:06:18,902 --> 00:06:20,986
and now she just decides
she's gonna hate me.

69
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,321
- Just a second, Tom.
- No, nothing.

70
00:06:23,405 --> 00:06:25,655
Do your thing.
I just wanna tell you the news.

71
00:06:25,738 --> 00:06:27,990
You know, I did
a bsolutely nothing wrong.

72
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:32,409
So what is it with
all this champagne stuff?

73
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,744
- Oh, that was- That's just-
- It's a metaphor.

74
00:06:37,827 --> 00:06:40,788
Yeah. But I'm not drinking...

75
00:06:40,872 --> 00:06:43,080
and that's what's important, right?

76
00:06:43,164 --> 00:06:47,582
Be careful with your metaphors.
Just one drink, right?

77
00:06:47,665 --> 00:06:50,374
She's only mad at you because
she can't be mad at him.

78
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:55,377
He was your client. She's not.
Simon Dunne was your client.

79
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,545
She's still just incredibly
angry about this.

80
00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:00,547
Those are her feelings, not yours.

81
00:07:00,631 --> 00:07:03,423
- I know that, Steven.
- You got the documents all signed.

82
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:05,715
Get in and get out, Gavin.

83
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:08,342
- We didn't do anything wrong.
- Of course we didn't.

84
00:07:09,592 --> 00:07:11,343
File the papers and get out.

85
00:07:11,426 --> 00:07:14,720
- Okay?
- Right.

86
00:07:14,803 --> 00:07:16,470
Okay, Mr. Warren.

87
00:07:16,554 --> 00:07:19,472
What you want is term insurance,
but you're not sure about the cost.

88
00:07:19,555 --> 00:07:23,599
What's important is that you be
realistic about what you need.

89
00:07:23,682 --> 00:07:28,435
This policy is never gonna cost you
more than $15 a month.

90
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:30,061
That's right.

91
00:07:48,775 --> 00:07:51,486
Ellen, call the courthouse
and tell them I'm gonna be late.

92
00:07:51,527 --> 00:07:53,528
You know what?
Just call Kaufman's offllce...

93
00:07:53,612 --> 00:07:56,489
and tell him that I called
to say that I'm gonna be late, okay?

94
00:07:56,572 --> 00:07:59,782
"Your Honor,
I'm representing myself today...

95
00:07:59,865 --> 00:08:03,950
because I want you to hear
the sincerity of my words.

96
00:08:04,034 --> 00:08:08,202
Boys need their fathers.
Boys need their fathers."

97
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:36,424
- You all right?
- Yeah. Are you?

98
00:08:36,507 --> 00:08:38,966
Yeah. You got an insurance card?

99
00:08:40,217 --> 00:08:42,301
Yeah, sure.

100
00:08:51,056 --> 00:08:54,266
- We just got a call from the court.
- I had an accident.

101
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,642
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

102
00:08:56,725 --> 00:08:58,684
- I'm fine. It's nothing.
- Nothing?

103
00:08:58,726 --> 00:09:00,227
- Who's that?
- It's no one.

104
00:09:00,311 --> 00:09:03,353
- This may be nothing to you-
- No, don't do that! Don't do that!

105
00:09:03,395 --> 00:09:05,021
- I'll do what I have to.
- I'm sorry. Not you.

106
00:09:05,104 --> 00:09:07,396
- I have to do this right, you know?
- I think so.

107
00:09:07,438 --> 00:09:09,564
I do.
Yes, hold on a second!

108
00:09:09,648 --> 00:09:13,273
- Clean in all my actions.
- Hold on for one second, okay?

109
00:09:13,355 --> 00:09:17,025
- What do you want me to do?
- Tell the court I'm on my way.

110
00:09:17,066 --> 00:09:19,485
Okay, tell them I'm on the steps.
Okay, thank you.

111
00:09:19,568 --> 00:09:22,528
- It's only gonna take five minutes.
- I gotta be somewhere.

112
00:09:22,569 --> 00:09:25,946
You really should keep your card
in your glove compartment...

113
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,197
- and not your briefcase.
- That's not what I'm looking for.

114
00:09:28,238 --> 00:09:31,073
Come on! Shit.

115
00:09:31,115 --> 00:09:33,699
Thank you.
Thank you.

116
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,284
Thank you. Very nice of you.
Listen. Tell you what.

117
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:42,036
I'm gonna write you a blank check,
and you just get your car fixed-

118
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:44,496
- I don't want your check, man.
- You have an honest face.

119
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,664
- Don't worry about it.
- I wanna do this right.

120
00:09:46,748 --> 00:09:49,457
- Come on! Please! I gotta go!
- I gotta be someplace else too!

121
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,458
It's important to me we do it right.
It should be important to you too.

122
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:54,877
That's it.
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

123
00:09:54,918 --> 00:09:57,127
- You're sorry what?
- I gotta go, man. I'm late.

124
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,336
I've gotta be somewhere too!
Well, can I get a lift?

125
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,879
- I'm sorry.
- Where are you going, man?

126
00:10:00,963 --> 00:10:03,546
- Don't leave me out here like this!
- Better luck next time.

127
00:10:03,588 --> 00:10:05,797
Better luck-

128
00:10:05,881 --> 00:10:08,882
Hey, you're leaving
the scene of an accident!

129
00:10:47,607 --> 00:10:50,276
Your Honor, I'm sorry I'm late.

130
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,402
- I was in a traffllc accident.
- Are you all right?

131
00:10:53,443 --> 00:10:56,529
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Was anyone hurt?

132
00:10:56,613 --> 00:10:58,571
Then will Mr. Kaufman begin?

133
00:11:02,115 --> 00:11:05,699
Your Honor, since its inception,
the Simon Dunne Foundation...

134
00:11:05,783 --> 00:11:09,410
was managed by Mr. Dunne
and a board of trustees...

135
00:11:09,494 --> 00:11:12,579
which included his granddaughter,
my client Mina Dunne.

136
00:11:12,662 --> 00:11:16,414
Upon his death,
that board was disbanded.

137
00:11:18,581 --> 00:11:20,498
We wanna know why.

138
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:24,874
Well, it was on instructions
from my client, Your Honor.

139
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,585
Why would he do that?
These people were his friends.

140
00:11:28,669 --> 00:11:31,628
They were wonderful people
who loved kids and music...

141
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:35,213
but they weren't qualiflled to manage
a 100-million-dollar foundation.

142
00:11:35,296 --> 00:11:37,215
- That's why he signed-
- Your Honor, please.

143
00:11:37,298 --> 00:11:39,174
Address the court, Counselor.

144
00:11:39,257 --> 00:11:41,967
Simon Dunne signed
a power of appointment appointing...

145
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:45,885
Walter Arnell and Steven Delano
sole trustees of the foundation.

146
00:11:45,969 --> 00:11:48,428
He was old
and he was taken advantage of.

147
00:11:48,469 --> 00:11:50,929
You took advantage of him, Gavin!

148
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:53,054
Now you're charging a crime,
Miss Dunne...

149
00:11:53,138 --> 00:11:55,347
and this is probate court,
not criminal court.

150
00:11:55,431 --> 00:11:59,349
- Does your client understand?
- She does, Your Honor.

151
00:11:59,433 --> 00:12:03,435
Your Honor, I'm not here
to debate everyone's opinion...

152
00:12:03,476 --> 00:12:05,519
about Simon Dunne's intention.

153
00:12:05,603 --> 00:12:07,521
I'm here to present
some papers to the court...

154
00:12:07,605 --> 00:12:10,188
which are signed by Mr. Dunne.

155
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,023
They've all been notarized.
And furthermore...

156
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,399
they direct the foundation
to be administered...

157
00:12:14,482 --> 00:12:17,899
in precisely the way
in which Mr. Dunne...

158
00:12:17,983 --> 00:12:20,608
not his granddaughter, intended.

159
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:23,276
- Please the court?
- What do you got?

160
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,652
Trust agreement...

161
00:12:26,027 --> 00:12:27,861
tax exemption...

162
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:30,989
power of appointment.

163
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,785
- Mr. Banek?
- Sorry.

164
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:46,329
Mr. Banek?

165
00:12:55,124 --> 00:12:57,042
I made a mistake.

166
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,752
What mistake?

167
00:12:58,835 --> 00:13:02,545
This morning, after the accident
by the side of the road...

168
00:13:02,628 --> 00:13:06,797
we were exchanging
insurance information...

169
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:09,965
and I used the file folder...

170
00:13:10,006 --> 00:13:12,508
to, you know, to-
you know, to-

171
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,467
No, I don't know.

172
00:13:14,509 --> 00:13:16,592
To write my name on,
and address.

173
00:13:16,676 --> 00:13:19,803
And I gave it to him.

174
00:13:19,844 --> 00:13:23,429
I just wasn't thinking clearly,
I guess. Must've been the accident.

175
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:25,722
Did you get his name?

176
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,975
Did I get his-
Yes, of course I got his name.

177
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,850
Let's call him.

178
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:35,268
As I- If memory serves,
Your Honor...

179
00:13:35,352 --> 00:13:37,811
- I believe he's not in.
- How do you know?

180
00:13:37,894 --> 00:13:41,396
He made some reference
to the fact that he was...

181
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,939
feeling hurried because...

182
00:13:44,022 --> 00:13:45,982
he had to be at an appointment
of some sort.

183
00:13:46,023 --> 00:13:49,649
- Call him and leave a message.
- Yes, of course. I will.

184
00:13:53,026 --> 00:13:55,819
Your Honor,
may I make a suggestion?

185
00:13:57,904 --> 00:13:59,613
I'm in no hurry,
and I know how bad...

186
00:13:59,696 --> 00:14:02,614
a person feels after a-
a car crash, right?

187
00:14:02,697 --> 00:14:04,573
Yeah.
Thanks, Terry.

188
00:14:04,657 --> 00:14:07,615
No. Don't mention it.

189
00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:11,617
So, Gavin, when the man,
whose name you don't know...

190
00:14:11,701 --> 00:14:15,036
gets out of the meeting
that you say he's in...

191
00:14:15,078 --> 00:14:19,038
would you call him at the number
that you think is in your car...

192
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,997
so that we can have the document
you assure us gives us the proof...

193
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:24,416
that the senior partners
of your law firm...

194
00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:27,750
do control the money Simon Dunne
left to the children of New York?

195
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,043
Doesn't matter. He'll have a copy.
He'll bring the copy in.

196
00:14:30,126 --> 00:14:33,086
A piece of paper with
an original signature on it...

197
00:14:33,169 --> 00:14:36,088
still has great magical power.

198
00:14:36,171 --> 00:14:38,172
Without that piece of paper
with the signature...

199
00:14:38,255 --> 00:14:40,840
Miss Dunne can sue
that law firm for fraud...

200
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:46,175
and possibly send you and the other
members of your law firm to jail.

201
00:14:46,216 --> 00:14:49,760
Mr. Banek, find your man...

202
00:14:49,844 --> 00:14:51,845
and bring me back that file
by the end of the day.

203
00:14:53,346 --> 00:14:55,222
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- Thank you.

204
00:14:56,722 --> 00:14:58,640
- Hold on, sir.
- Put your hands up, please.

205
00:15:01,265 --> 00:15:03,226
Wait. Hold on a second.

206
00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:07,352
- Okay.
- Thank you, sir.

207
00:15:22,984 --> 00:15:25,235
- Dad!
- Hey, guys.

208
00:15:25,318 --> 00:15:28,236
- You're late. Mom went in already.
- What's in the bag?

209
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,445
- What bag?
- Daddy!

210
00:15:30,528 --> 00:15:33,239
Oh, this bag.
It's a present for the judge.

211
00:15:33,322 --> 00:15:35,405
I want a present!
I want a present!

212
00:15:35,489 --> 00:15:37,699
- You shouldn't lie to him, Dad.
- Okay, okay.

213
00:15:39,158 --> 00:15:42,868
I would never give a judge
such a cool present.

214
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,203
Happy birthday yesterday.
Listen to me, guys.

215
00:15:46,286 --> 00:15:48,745
Everything's gonna be better.
I bought a house.

216
00:15:48,829 --> 00:15:52,122
- In Oregon?
- No, in Queens.

217
00:15:52,205 --> 00:15:55,124
- Mommy says we're movin' to Oregon.
- Now you don't have to.

218
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,374
That's why I bought the house-
so you don't have to move to Oregon.

219
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,043
Are you gonna live there with us?

220
00:16:03,043 --> 00:16:05,294
See what the judge says, okay?

221
00:16:05,336 --> 00:16:08,087
The court denies the motion
for joint custody...

222
00:16:08,171 --> 00:16:11,297
and awards sole custody of
the children to their mother.

223
00:16:11,381 --> 00:16:12,339
Wait!

224
00:16:12,381 --> 00:16:14,591
Miss Gipson is moving to Oregon
to start a new job.

225
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:17,718
- Weekly visitations are impossi ble.
- So noted.

226
00:16:17,801 --> 00:16:20,302
- File with the court clerk.
- Hold it! Your Honor-

227
00:16:20,343 --> 00:16:23,554
Your Honor, I know I'm late,
but someone hit my car.

228
00:16:23,637 --> 00:16:28,639
Now- See, look here.
This is evidence- new evidence.

229
00:16:28,723 --> 00:16:31,307
I have a new plan for joint custody.
It's all right here.

230
00:16:31,348 --> 00:16:33,725
Mr. Gipson, you are late,
and the hearing has been conducted.

231
00:16:33,808 --> 00:16:36,100
- But I had an accident.
- Your Honor, are we free to go?

232
00:16:36,184 --> 00:16:38,227
- I'm not done yet!
- The court ruled, Mr. Gipson.

233
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,977
- But I wasn't here.
- The court ruled.

234
00:16:41,353 --> 00:16:43,980
Valerie, I-
I bought you a house.

235
00:16:44,064 --> 00:16:45,814
- It's too late, Your Honor.
- No, it's not too late!

236
00:16:45,898 --> 00:16:48,231
It's 20 minutes.
It's just 20 minutes.

237
00:16:48,315 --> 00:16:50,775
Twenty minutes can't be too late.
Valerie, please.

238
00:16:50,858 --> 00:16:53,942
Don't let 20 minutes stand in
the way of what I'm trying to do.

239
00:16:54,025 --> 00:16:56,317
- Please don't start.
- Don't talk to him.

240
00:16:56,401 --> 00:16:58,484
Mr. Gipson, would you please
approach the bench?

241
00:16:58,568 --> 00:17:00,653
- Your Honor, can we leave now?
- Yes.

242
00:17:00,695 --> 00:17:02,445
- Mr. Gipson-
- Valerie, can't we talk?

243
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:04,445
- Valerie, can we-
- Mr. Gipson.

244
00:17:04,529 --> 00:17:07,448
Mr. Gipson, come here for a moment.
Please?

245
00:17:09,365 --> 00:17:12,368
Emotions run high in here.
If this weren't a divorce court...

246
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,117
the way you just yelled
in my courtroom-

247
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:16,118
- I'm sorry.
- Of course you are.

248
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:19,494
You have children, Mr. Gipson.
Keep them in front of you.

249
00:17:19,578 --> 00:17:23,080
I just wanted to tell my wife
I got her a house for the children.

250
00:17:23,163 --> 00:17:25,831
- When?
- Well, I have it all right here.

251
00:17:25,914 --> 00:17:29,583
That's my plan. I found a house
for Valerie and for the boys...

252
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:31,750
and they don't have to move.

253
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:36,795
This is what I wanted to say.
"Boys need their fathers.

254
00:17:36,878 --> 00:17:41,340
The streets of this world are lonely
for boys without their fathers.

255
00:17:41,423 --> 00:17:44,006
I have made mistakes,
and I have grown...

256
00:17:44,048 --> 00:17:47,841
and I have recognized
those mistakes."

257
00:17:47,925 --> 00:17:50,801
What kind of a house?

258
00:17:50,884 --> 00:17:53,427
It's not a big house,
and it's not in great shape.

259
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,429
But I can fix it.
I can make it work.

260
00:17:55,511 --> 00:17:58,971
And there's a space for-

261
00:17:59,054 --> 00:18:02,515
Well, if she'll have me back,
there's a place for me too.

262
00:18:02,598 --> 00:18:05,392
But I'm not asking for that
right now. I'm just asking that...

263
00:18:05,475 --> 00:18:08,144
she not take the boys and move
halfway across the world.

264
00:18:08,227 --> 00:18:12,270
You can arrange visitations. Oregon
is not the other side of the world.

265
00:18:12,353 --> 00:18:15,813
It is to me!
I want my family. I want my boys.

266
00:18:15,896 --> 00:18:19,398
I had an accident.
This guy hit me on the FDR.

267
00:18:19,482 --> 00:18:22,691
He cut me off!
I wanted to be here!

268
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:25,776
If this was my marriage,
I would've been here on time.

269
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:29,359
Everyone was here on time,
except you. Next case.

270
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:30,694
Thank you.

271
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,530
- Docket 718.
- Thanks.

272
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:37,447
Counselor, step up, please.

273
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,948
- How is everybody today?
- Good morning, Your Honor.

274
00:18:40,032 --> 00:18:41,491
Nice to see you again.

275
00:18:59,582 --> 00:19:03,418
It's not gonna help me pay
my phone bill, my electric bill.

276
00:19:03,502 --> 00:19:05,752
I'm not making any money sittin'
in court. I'm goin' to court.

277
00:19:05,835 --> 00:19:09,504
I've been sittin' in court every
day. I'm not making any money.

278
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:08,071
If you and I had gotten caught
before we stopped...

279
00:20:10,324 --> 00:20:14,241
and my wife found out,
and I left the law...

280
00:20:15,283 --> 00:20:18,285
and you died in
a horrible accident at sea...

281
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:23,370
I would be better off
than I am right now.

282
00:20:23,454 --> 00:20:24,872
What happened?

283
00:20:27,248 --> 00:20:28,707
He wouldn't take a check.

284
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:32,667
He said he wanted to be clean
in all his actions.

285
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,793
- The judge wouldn't take a check?
- The guy.

286
00:20:35,877 --> 00:20:36,877
What guy?

287
00:20:36,961 --> 00:20:38,586
- What day is today?
- Friday.

288
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,754
- Actually, it's Good Friday.
- Good Friday.

289
00:20:41,795 --> 00:20:44,339
- What's good about it?
- Gavin, what's going on?

290
00:20:44,422 --> 00:20:47,006
I know what's good about it.

291
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:48,924
My file's walking down the street.

292
00:20:56,511 --> 00:20:58,971
Hey! Excuse me.

293
00:20:59,055 --> 00:21:01,139
Listen, man, you don't know me.
I know.

294
00:21:01,222 --> 00:21:05,348
And you don't have to believe me,
but that was not like me today.

295
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:09,100
And I'm just so grateful,
you know, to God...

296
00:21:09,183 --> 00:21:12,351
and right here in front
of the Lord's house.

297
00:21:12,434 --> 00:21:14,978
Come on. Hop in. Get in the car.
Get out of the rain.

298
00:21:17,312 --> 00:21:19,230
My name's Gavin Banek.

299
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:25,733
- Doyle Gipson.
- Hey, listen, Doyle.

300
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,985
That is not what I'm like-
this morning.

301
00:21:28,068 --> 00:21:30,485
That's not who I am.
I mean it. I'm a lawyer.

302
00:21:30,569 --> 00:21:32,110
I should have never left
the scene of an accident.

303
00:21:32,193 --> 00:21:35,028
I should know better.

304
00:21:37,779 --> 00:21:39,697
My file- did you fllnd it?

305
00:21:40,947 --> 00:21:45,366
I had an orange file.
It was in my briefcase.

306
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:49,410
I thought may be it fell out
and you picked it up.

307
00:21:50,828 --> 00:21:52,244
Do you have it?
Did you get it?

308
00:21:54,162 --> 00:21:56,913
You said,
"Better luck next time."

309
00:21:56,996 --> 00:21:58,956
I said, "Give me a lift."
You said...

310
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,124
"Better luck next time,"
and just-

311
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:06,751
"Better luck next time"?
I said that?

312
00:22:06,834 --> 00:22:09,085
Listen, sir, please.

313
00:22:09,168 --> 00:22:12,587
I have no excuse for my behavior,
and I am sorry.

314
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,796
I don't know what I can do
to make it up to you, except-

315
00:22:14,838 --> 00:22:16,757
I will buy you a new car.

316
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:24,052
Money. You think I want money?

317
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:27,677
What I want is my morning back.

318
00:22:27,761 --> 00:22:30,971
I need you to give
my time back to me.

319
00:22:31,054 --> 00:22:33,139
Can you give me back my time?

320
00:22:33,222 --> 00:22:37,223
Can you give my time back to me?
Huh? Can you?

321
00:22:37,306 --> 00:22:40,433
Whoa! Wait a minute!
Whoa! All right!

322
00:22:40,516 --> 00:22:43,227
So she won't move to Oregon!
So she won't take the boys!

323
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:46,520
So they'll move into the house
so I can be a father!

324
00:22:46,603 --> 00:22:49,063
Just 20 minutes!
Can you give me that?

325
00:22:49,146 --> 00:22:51,564
I wish I could, man.
I wish I could.

326
00:22:53,856 --> 00:22:55,774
I wish I could.

327
00:22:58,608 --> 00:23:00,985
Wait a minute!
Wait. Do you have the file?

328
00:23:01,027 --> 00:23:03,527
Doyle, you got the file?

329
00:23:03,611 --> 00:23:05,527
Wait a minute! Doyle!
Wait a minute!

330
00:23:05,611 --> 00:23:07,528
Doyle, do you have the file?

331
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,571
- I'm sorry!
- I don't have your file!

332
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:11,740
- I threw it away!
- What do you mean?

333
00:23:11,822 --> 00:23:13,741
I threw it away!

334
00:24:01,721 --> 00:24:03,638
- Hey, guys.
- How did it go?

335
00:24:08,933 --> 00:24:12,684
Well, Kaufman did some tap dancing.

336
00:24:14,561 --> 00:24:18,186
But once I filed the papers,
what was he gonna do?

337
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:20,437
The guy squeaked like a mouse.

338
00:24:20,521 --> 00:24:22,480
I love it when they squeak.

339
00:24:23,648 --> 00:24:26,857
We have the power of appointment,
so God's on our side.

340
00:24:30,234 --> 00:24:33,193
Hey, I'm going over
to Southeast Harbor tomorrow...

341
00:24:33,235 --> 00:24:35,528
to look at a boat.

342
00:24:35,611 --> 00:24:36,736
Hinckley 51.

343
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:40,071
Wow. Fifty-one footer, huh?
It's a tough life.

344
00:24:40,155 --> 00:24:42,530
You are not quite ready
for a 51-footer yet.

345
00:24:42,572 --> 00:24:44,364
Oh, right.

346
00:24:44,448 --> 00:24:46,908
But as soon as
I take delivery on her...

347
00:24:46,949 --> 00:24:50,617
I want you and Cynthia
to have China Bird.

348
00:24:57,745 --> 00:25:01,081
- Steven, I don't know what to say.
- You don't have to say anything.

349
00:25:01,164 --> 00:25:04,458
I'm saying thank you to my partner
and my son-in-law...

350
00:25:07,792 --> 00:25:09,376
and my friend.

351
00:25:12,336 --> 00:25:15,546
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

352
00:25:15,588 --> 00:25:17,880
Thank you.

353
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,131
Thank you.

354
00:25:23,091 --> 00:25:26,301
So I have a couple more interviews
I gotta bang out...

355
00:25:26,384 --> 00:25:28,552
down the hall, so I'm gonna...

356
00:25:28,635 --> 00:25:30,762
go back down there
and do some work.

357
00:25:30,845 --> 00:25:32,637
Great.

358
00:25:36,514 --> 00:25:38,639
All right, well, so long.

359
00:25:38,723 --> 00:25:41,183
- See you.
- All right.

360
00:25:49,437 --> 00:25:51,395
- How are you doing, Kate?
- Hey, Gavin.

361
00:25:56,064 --> 00:25:58,900
- So, how'd it go?
- In and out. Easy-peasy.

362
00:25:58,942 --> 00:26:03,318
- What kind of people have we here?
- This is Sarah Windsor.

363
00:26:03,402 --> 00:26:04,778
Hello. It's a pleasure.

364
00:26:04,861 --> 00:26:08,570
- Tyler Cohen.
- How are you? Who's up first?

365
00:26:08,653 --> 00:26:11,613
- Miss Windsor.
- Sarah Windsor, come on down!

366
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:13,947
Have a seat, please.

367
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:17,490
- And who are you?
- Sarah Windsor.

368
00:26:17,573 --> 00:26:20,992
Not the name tag. Who are you,
as in what have you been doing?

369
00:26:21,075 --> 00:26:23,118
Why do you wanna be a lawyer?
Why do you wanna work here?

370
00:26:23,201 --> 00:26:26,161
Well, I went to St. Paul's.

371
00:26:26,244 --> 00:26:28,578
I did my undergraduate work at Yale.

372
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,122
And now, I'm finishing at Yale Law.

373
00:26:31,205 --> 00:26:35,665
I clerked last summer for
the California State Supreme Court.

374
00:26:35,748 --> 00:26:39,500
I chose law because my father was
district attorney of San Francisco.

375
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:40,500
Really?

376
00:26:40,584 --> 00:26:42,668
I've always been interested
in the law and politics...

377
00:26:42,752 --> 00:26:46,378
and I was an economics major.

378
00:26:46,462 --> 00:26:48,337
This firm is particularly strong...

379
00:26:48,421 --> 00:26:51,256
in municipal finance law
and public policy...

380
00:26:51,298 --> 00:26:56,842
which is the area
I'm hoping to explore.

381
00:26:56,925 --> 00:26:59,093
Although, I gotta tell you...

382
00:26:59,135 --> 00:27:01,511
I do have an eye on public service.

383
00:27:02,344 --> 00:27:04,929
I know how much this firm
supports pro bono work...

384
00:27:05,013 --> 00:27:08,889
and I'd love to help on a
death penalty defense for the poor.

385
00:27:15,434 --> 00:27:17,643
Why didn't I just
give him my insurance card?

386
00:27:17,727 --> 00:27:19,353
I'm sorry?

387
00:27:19,436 --> 00:27:23,271
I'm sorry. It's not your fault.
It's my fault.

388
00:27:24,313 --> 00:27:25,939
Excuse me. Gavin?

389
00:27:25,981 --> 00:27:28,065
This really weird fax
Just came in.

390
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:30,774
- I think you should look at it.
- Okay. Thank you.

391
00:27:32,483 --> 00:27:34,818
Do you know what it means?

392
00:27:43,154 --> 00:27:46,614
Michelle, I gotta talk to you.

393
00:27:46,656 --> 00:27:48,449
Just a second.
What the hell-

394
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:50,283
Read this!

395
00:27:50,367 --> 00:27:53,367
It's from the file.
He's got the file.

396
00:27:59,328 --> 00:28:01,371
Help me.

397
00:28:16,337 --> 00:28:18,255
Can I have a...

398
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,090
- bourbon, straight up?
- Sure.

399
00:28:44,683 --> 00:28:46,602
Can I have a twist, please?

400
00:29:00,232 --> 00:29:01,649
I'm not a partner here.

401
00:29:01,691 --> 00:29:04,316
That actually doesn't bother me.

402
00:29:04,358 --> 00:29:07,485
Partners have to bring in business.
I just gotta do my job.

403
00:29:07,527 --> 00:29:09,486
If I don't like it here,
I can leave.

404
00:29:10,904 --> 00:29:14,238
- What's not to like?
- Watching you become one of them.

405
00:29:17,614 --> 00:29:20,489
I always thought you were cutting
a pretty big corner...

406
00:29:20,573 --> 00:29:23,617
by convincing a dying old man
to sign a power of appointment.

407
00:29:23,701 --> 00:29:26,243
- It wasn't like that.
- Are you sure it wasn't like that?

408
00:29:26,325 --> 00:29:28,411
Of course I'm sure.

409
00:29:34,872 --> 00:29:36,498
What?

410
00:29:39,541 --> 00:29:41,834
He was in pretty bad shape
when I went to see him.

411
00:29:41,918 --> 00:29:44,335
I mean, it was-
May be he didn't-

412
00:29:44,377 --> 00:29:46,252
May be?

413
00:29:46,336 --> 00:29:50,588
- May be he didn't understand exactly.
- Didn't understand exactly?

414
00:29:50,671 --> 00:29:53,172
He didn't know exactly
what he was signing.

415
00:29:53,256 --> 00:29:56,632
Walter and Steven said that...

416
00:29:56,715 --> 00:30:00,592
Simon put too much faith
in his friends, and...

417
00:30:00,675 --> 00:30:04,261
the board was in his pocket, and
it was better for the foundation...

418
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,512
if we could just help
control and manage the money.

419
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,638
Delano said that?

420
00:30:08,722 --> 00:30:10,972
- Doesn't that sound reasonable?
- What's that supposed to mean?

421
00:30:11,056 --> 00:30:13,474
That means that
without this file...

422
00:30:13,557 --> 00:30:16,975
you'll be in more trouble than
your father-in-law and his partner.

423
00:30:17,058 --> 00:30:19,727
You're the attorney of record.

424
00:30:19,809 --> 00:30:22,227
You could actually
go to jail for this.

425
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,062
You need that file.

426
00:30:24,937 --> 00:30:26,895
What am I gonna do?

427
00:30:33,983 --> 00:30:35,526
There's this guy.

428
00:30:37,485 --> 00:30:42,404
He helps out
with things that need...

429
00:30:42,446 --> 00:30:43,654
helping out.

430
00:30:44,571 --> 00:30:45,780
Like what?

431
00:30:47,155 --> 00:30:50,573
Like things. Like...

432
00:30:50,614 --> 00:30:52,699
getting people to do things
you want them to do...

433
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:56,492
when they don't necessarily
want to do them.

434
00:30:58,743 --> 00:31:01,078
Where is he?

435
00:31:08,582 --> 00:31:10,458
I need help.

436
00:31:10,541 --> 00:31:12,291
Did you really believe
that it served Simon Dunne...

437
00:31:12,374 --> 00:31:14,542
to sign those papers when
he was too weak to read them?

438
00:31:14,584 --> 00:31:16,918
I wouldn't have done it otherwise.
Yes.

439
00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:22,379
- Yes, I did.
- Do you want what's right?

440
00:31:22,421 --> 00:31:24,547
Of course I do.

441
00:31:24,589 --> 00:31:29,050
And what's right is your job,
your wife...

442
00:31:29,133 --> 00:31:30,426
your life?

443
00:31:41,597 --> 00:31:43,765
Where is he?

444
00:31:53,352 --> 00:31:55,311
Don't go anywhere.

445
00:31:55,395 --> 00:31:58,230
- Hey, where are you going?
- I'm going out.

446
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:02,690
I'm in a bar.

447
00:32:03,857 --> 00:32:05,442
You want company?

448
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:10,944
That champagne feeling
gave you a hangover.

449
00:32:12,236 --> 00:32:14,654
Are you drinking?

450
00:32:24,407 --> 00:32:26,909
What happened in court today?

451
00:32:26,992 --> 00:32:29,201
I'm in a bar.
What's that tell you?

452
00:32:29,284 --> 00:32:33,578
It tells me that you're really
angry, and that anger...

453
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,496
has gotten you into the one place
in the world you shouldn't be.

454
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:42,541
Come on.
Leave that bar.

455
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:48,293
Come on.
Leave the bar.

456
00:32:51,963 --> 00:32:53,379
I'm sorry.

457
00:33:29,605 --> 00:33:31,606
Can I have a Coke, please?

458
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:42,610
Come on in.

459
00:33:42,693 --> 00:33:44,820
Look, you tell Roberta...

460
00:33:44,903 --> 00:33:48,948
that I said one cookie
before lunch is okay.

461
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:51,990
Get better.

462
00:33:52,032 --> 00:33:54,365
- Mr. Banek.
- Are you Mr. Finch?

463
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,366
- How are you?
- How are you doing?

464
00:33:58,367 --> 00:34:02,286
- You look nervous.
- Yeah, a little bit.

465
00:34:02,369 --> 00:34:04,494
Don't be.
Have a seat.

466
00:34:06,829 --> 00:34:09,830
Who's your God?

467
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:13,249
- Now, or hall of fame?
- Whenever.

468
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:16,918
Well, I'd say it's the guy
who did the Volkswagen ad.

469
00:34:17,001 --> 00:34:19,170
The one where the cop is giving the
speeding ticket to a guy in a Bug.

470
00:34:19,253 --> 00:34:21,169
Classic.

471
00:34:21,253 --> 00:34:23,755
Doyle Gipson.

472
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:25,754
Shouldn't have told you
he was in insurance.

473
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:27,797
Makes it too easy.
I tell my clients...

474
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:31,090
"Never tell anyone anything
a bout yourself."

475
00:34:32,674 --> 00:34:36,093
Yeah. Here's his
state insurance license.

476
00:34:36,176 --> 00:34:38,719
And that gives me
his social security number...

477
00:34:38,802 --> 00:34:43,013
which gives me everything.

478
00:34:43,096 --> 00:34:45,014
- You don't fucking know.
- I do know.

479
00:34:45,097 --> 00:34:46,724
- It's the one with the little kids.
- The little kids, yeah.

480
00:34:46,807 --> 00:34:49,433
He's sittin' around, you know.

481
00:34:49,516 --> 00:34:52,184
I don't know what he is.
Like, an Indian kid?

482
00:34:52,268 --> 00:34:55,393
Cute little black kid.
Like, "I'm Tiger Woods."

483
00:34:55,477 --> 00:34:57,061
"I'm Tiger Woods."

484
00:34:59,228 --> 00:35:01,938
You had a fender bender,
and the other guy's going postal.

485
00:35:02,022 --> 00:35:05,398
- That's not the way to do things.
- I don't wanna kill any body, you know?

486
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:10,193
I've just...

487
00:35:10,276 --> 00:35:13,403
never done this kind
of thing before.

488
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,695
What kind of thing is that?

489
00:35:15,778 --> 00:35:17,696
I just want my file back, you know.

490
00:35:20,406 --> 00:35:22,573
You'll get your file back.

491
00:35:22,656 --> 00:35:26,615
How, exactly?

492
00:35:26,699 --> 00:35:29,492
It's like the dog collar that
gives a little electric shock...

493
00:35:29,533 --> 00:35:32,034
when the dog barks.

494
00:35:32,076 --> 00:35:36,119
You don't kill the dog. You just
want the dog to settle down.

495
00:35:37,537 --> 00:35:40,373
Now we're torturing an animal?
I mean-

496
00:35:41,206 --> 00:35:43,498
We're all set.
May I?

497
00:35:48,667 --> 00:35:51,127
Is there any other way to-

498
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:52,878
Well, sure.

499
00:35:52,961 --> 00:35:55,212
Call him up
and just be nice to him.

500
00:36:00,089 --> 00:36:01,298
All right, do it.

501
00:36:03,549 --> 00:36:06,384
- Are you guys in advertising?
- Yeah. You too?

502
00:36:06,467 --> 00:36:10,011
No. But-

503
00:36:10,095 --> 00:36:13,679
I hope you don't mind, but I was
intrigued by your conversation.

504
00:36:13,763 --> 00:36:16,472
I just thought
you were in advertising.

505
00:36:16,555 --> 00:36:21,392
I wanna give you my dream version
of a Tiger Woods commercial, okay?

506
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:26,101
- By all means.
- Go ahead.

507
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:29,686
There's this black guy
on a golf course.

508
00:36:29,727 --> 00:36:31,895
And all these people are trying
to get him to caddy for them...

509
00:36:31,979 --> 00:36:34,898
but he's not a caddy.

510
00:36:34,981 --> 00:36:37,107
He's just a guy trying
to play a round of golf.

511
00:36:38,733 --> 00:36:41,484
Then these guys give him
a five-dollar bill...

512
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:45,402
and tell him to go to the clubhouse
and get 'em cigarettes and beer.

513
00:36:47,153 --> 00:36:50,071
So off he goes, home...

514
00:36:50,904 --> 00:36:53,531
to his wife and little son...

515
00:36:53,615 --> 00:36:56,405
who he teaches to play golf.

516
00:36:56,489 --> 00:36:58,407
We see all the other little boys
playing hopscotch...

517
00:36:58,491 --> 00:37:01,200
while little Tiger practices
on the putting green.

518
00:37:01,242 --> 00:37:03,577
We see all the other kids
eating ice cream...

519
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,703
while Tiger practices hitting
long balls in the rain...

520
00:37:06,745 --> 00:37:09,287
while his father shows him how.

521
00:37:09,413 --> 00:37:11,539
And we fade up...

522
00:37:11,622 --> 00:37:16,499
to Tiger winning
four grand slams in a row...

523
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:20,334
and becoming the greatest golfer
to ever to pick up a nine iron.

524
00:37:22,168 --> 00:37:25,211
And we end on his father...

525
00:37:25,253 --> 00:37:27,754
in the crowd on the sidelines...

526
00:37:27,837 --> 00:37:30,339
and Tiger giving him the trophies.

527
00:37:32,632 --> 00:37:36,258
All because of
a father's determination...

528
00:37:36,342 --> 00:37:41,386
that no fat white man-
like your fathers, probably-

529
00:37:42,428 --> 00:37:45,971
would ever send his son
to the clubhouse...

530
00:37:46,054 --> 00:37:49,181
for cigarettes and beer.

531
00:37:55,976 --> 00:37:58,561
I'm sorry.
What did you say about our fathers?

532
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:06,606
- You better go.
- Mr. Doyle Gipson.

533
00:38:06,648 --> 00:38:09,399
You is now bankrupt.

534
00:38:09,441 --> 00:38:12,108
And you owe me $5,000.

535
00:38:26,908 --> 00:38:29,907
- Come on.
- Where'd he go?

536
00:38:29,949 --> 00:38:32,576
Where is he?

537
00:38:32,659 --> 00:38:34,619
- Hello?
- It's me.

538
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:37,244
- So you really bought a house?
- Yeah.

539
00:38:37,286 --> 00:38:39,788
- Wanna play a round of golf?
- Really? You actually own it?

540
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:43,080
It's not a mansion on the hill.

541
00:38:43,122 --> 00:38:46,581
It needs a lot of work,
but it'd be yours.

542
00:38:46,623 --> 00:38:48,624
- It'd be your house.
- Here we go!

543
00:38:48,666 --> 00:38:51,918
- Gonna hit the ball!
- Oh, God.

544
00:38:51,959 --> 00:38:55,044
What? This line's going dead.
I can't hear you. I can't hear you.

545
00:38:55,128 --> 00:38:57,461
Obviously, it would be better for
the boys to be near their father.

546
00:38:57,503 --> 00:39:00,964
- What?
- To have you nearby.

547
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,798
- What?
- No, we didn't like it.

548
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:05,383
- I'll call you back.
- Talkin' to your daddy?

549
00:39:08,801 --> 00:39:12,219
- Oh, God! You hit me!
- I'll hit you again! You like it?

550
00:39:18,139 --> 00:39:19,264
Mister, please!

551
00:39:19,348 --> 00:39:21,474
- I got kids, man!
- Yeah? Well, so do I!

552
00:39:27,976 --> 00:39:32,103
Doyle Gipson.
This is Gavin Banek calling.

553
00:39:32,144 --> 00:39:34,479
I have something that
I wanna tell you.

554
00:39:34,521 --> 00:39:36,605
First of all,
I wanted to shake hands, all right?

555
00:39:36,647 --> 00:39:39,273
I wanted to start over.
I gave you a chance.

556
00:39:39,314 --> 00:39:41,773
And you did this. Fine.

557
00:39:41,815 --> 00:39:44,442
I have just turned off your credit.

558
00:39:44,484 --> 00:39:49,153
You are now a spirit
without a body, all right?

559
00:39:49,237 --> 00:39:50,862
Now, I can go on and on...

560
00:39:50,946 --> 00:39:54,572
pulling your llfe down
around your ears.

561
00:39:54,655 --> 00:39:57,949
You can turn it off. You can
go back to the way things were.

562
00:39:57,991 --> 00:40:00,991
Just give me my file back!
Just- Today.

563
00:40:02,449 --> 00:40:05,159
I mean,just-
I mean- Thank you.

564
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,161
Give me my file back, get the credit
turned back on. Okay? Today.

565
00:40:09,244 --> 00:40:10,661
Thank you.

566
00:40:21,834 --> 00:40:24,127
- Has he phoned yet?
- Not yet.

567
00:40:30,546 --> 00:40:32,629
- Look at this.
- What?

568
00:40:32,713 --> 00:40:34,673
- What is it?
- It's the life of Doyle Gipson.

569
00:40:34,715 --> 00:40:37,298
His whole life.

570
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,592
We have his bank...

571
00:40:39,674 --> 00:40:43,135
his wife, kids-
two boys, Danny and Steve-

572
00:40:43,177 --> 00:40:47,347
their birth dates, the school
they go to, credit card balances...

573
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:49,054
health records.

574
00:40:49,138 --> 00:40:52,015
His cholesterol is high,
but his blood pressure is normal.

575
00:40:52,057 --> 00:40:54,474
I'm 29 years old.

576
00:40:54,516 --> 00:40:58,143
That foundation has
107 million dollars in it.

577
00:40:58,225 --> 00:41:00,185
My bosses are the trustees.

578
00:41:01,935 --> 00:41:05,186
So why didn't they
come to court with me?

579
00:41:06,353 --> 00:41:08,939
I don't know.
Mina Dunne hates me.

580
00:41:09,022 --> 00:41:12,024
I assume there's a reason. Why
am I always the last guy to know?

581
00:41:14,942 --> 00:41:17,360
What's in those files
that I haven't seen?

582
00:41:34,449 --> 00:41:37,702
- Can you get me a messenger?
- What for?

583
00:41:41,704 --> 00:41:44,622
I found something. I wanna give it
back to the person it belongs to.

584
00:41:44,705 --> 00:41:47,289
Is there a reward or something?

585
00:41:48,457 --> 00:41:51,542
- Yeah.
- What is it?

586
00:41:51,625 --> 00:41:53,543
Doing the right thing-
giving it back.

587
00:41:53,626 --> 00:41:55,375
- That's it?
- That's it.

588
00:41:55,459 --> 00:41:58,711
- That's the reward.
- How about that?

589
00:41:59,878 --> 00:42:01,712
Yeah, how a bout that?

590
00:42:13,385 --> 00:42:16,803
Mr. Gipson, it's Ron Cabot
at Queen's Royal Federal.

591
00:42:16,886 --> 00:42:20,846
There's something I need
to talk to you about.

592
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:22,889
If you can give me
a call today...

593
00:42:22,931 --> 00:42:26,891
or if it's convenient to stop by
the bank, I'd appreciate it.

594
00:42:26,933 --> 00:42:29,976
- Thank you.
- Doyle Gipson.

595
00:42:30,059 --> 00:42:32,727
This is Gavin Banek calling.

596
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:35,187
I have something that
I wanna tell you.

597
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:39,688
I lied to you this morning.

598
00:42:41,815 --> 00:42:43,900
On my way to the court,
I stopped off at a diner.

599
00:42:43,983 --> 00:42:46,150
I took the files out,
I looked them over.

600
00:42:46,234 --> 00:42:48,568
When I was leaving,
I put them back.

601
00:42:48,652 --> 00:42:50,568
At least, I could've sworn
I put them back.

602
00:42:50,652 --> 00:42:53,195
When I got to the court, the
power of appointment was missing.

603
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:56,363
And the court has given me
until the end of the day...

604
00:42:56,446 --> 00:42:58,405
- to produce the original.
- Did you call the diner?

605
00:42:58,447 --> 00:43:01,907
I did. All the trash has been
picked up, but we're tracking it.

606
00:43:01,991 --> 00:43:04,868
I think we'll probably get it back.
I just wanted you to know.

607
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:08,160
Why did you lie to us?

608
00:43:09,743 --> 00:43:11,370
I'm really sorry.

609
00:43:12,536 --> 00:43:14,453
You're sorry?

610
00:43:14,537 --> 00:43:17,080
Who the fuck gives a shit about
the struggles of your character?

611
00:43:17,164 --> 00:43:18,789
Get out of here,
you son of a bitch!

612
00:43:18,873 --> 00:43:21,082
If you have to go through every
fuckin' gar bage bag in this city...

613
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:24,083
you fllnd that file, or you're gonna
be the disaster of my life!

614
00:43:24,124 --> 00:43:26,167
Wait a minute.
We might get the file back.

615
00:43:26,251 --> 00:43:28,460
But if we don't, we have
to adopt a strong position.

616
00:43:28,544 --> 00:43:30,753
- I need to see those files.
- You're not gonna see the files!

617
00:43:30,837 --> 00:43:33,171
- Why do you wanna see the files?
- Who not? He's my goddamn client!

618
00:43:33,255 --> 00:43:35,589
Hey, what are you gonna do?
Give me a lecture on law?

619
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:38,341
Why did you send me to the court
by myself? I'm your son-in-law!

620
00:43:38,424 --> 00:43:40,299
- I hired you, you little shit!
- Steven, calm down!

621
00:43:40,382 --> 00:43:42,383
- Quiet, please.
- What are you doing?

622
00:43:42,425 --> 00:43:44,385
- There's a way out of this.
- What are you doing?

623
00:43:46,135 --> 00:43:48,595
A way out? By letting him
bring the files into court?

624
00:43:48,636 --> 00:43:52,388
Calm down and stay with me here.
Okay.

625
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:55,181
We had a signed document,
right? Didn't we?

626
00:43:55,264 --> 00:43:57,224
- Yes.
- Okay. Now.

627
00:43:57,307 --> 00:43:59,601
The power of appointment...

628
00:43:59,683 --> 00:44:01,894
is eight pages.

629
00:44:01,936 --> 00:44:06,854
The living will, which also has
his signature, is ten.

630
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,106
So we can reformat
the power of appointment...

631
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:15,524
and using the signature page
from the living will...

632
00:44:15,607 --> 00:44:18,651
attach it to the new printout
of the power of appointment.

633
00:44:18,733 --> 00:44:22,444
And code the header
to match the document.

634
00:44:22,486 --> 00:44:25,196
- What do you think? Will it pass?
- Yeah, this could work.

635
00:44:25,278 --> 00:44:29,781
I didn't ask you, all right?
Gavin, will it pass?

636
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:31,448
We forge it?

637
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:33,491
We just forge a document?

638
00:44:33,533 --> 00:44:35,492
You screwed this up.
You lost the fuckin' file.

639
00:44:35,575 --> 00:44:37,534
No body's asking you
to get yourself out of it alone.

640
00:44:37,618 --> 00:44:39,993
We're willing to put ourselves
on the line for you with this.

641
00:44:40,035 --> 00:44:42,118
Making a file is fraud.

642
00:44:42,202 --> 00:44:44,954
A new file is fraud.
Do you understand that?

643
00:44:46,162 --> 00:44:49,038
And we're saying we're gonna put
our own careers on the line for you.

644
00:44:49,122 --> 00:44:51,039
That's what it means
to be a partner.

645
00:44:51,123 --> 00:44:53,291
We're not inventing. We're not.
We're not inventing.

646
00:44:53,374 --> 00:44:55,458
We're just reproducing something
that already exists.

647
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,585
Look, Gavin, you take this
into the court...

648
00:44:58,668 --> 00:45:02,004
and, buddy,
we can go on with our lives...

649
00:45:02,045 --> 00:45:05,004
like this never happened, huh?

650
00:45:07,172 --> 00:45:09,798
- Let me think about it.
- What are you gonna think about?

651
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,425
Your high school ethics class?

652
00:45:12,508 --> 00:45:14,425
What choice have you got?

653
00:45:15,342 --> 00:45:17,260
You wanna go to jail?

654
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,974
No, I don't wanna go to jail.

655
00:46:34,545 --> 00:46:36,213
Get out of here!
Leave it!

656
00:46:36,296 --> 00:46:39,339
Leave it! Go!
Leave!

657
00:47:46,995 --> 00:47:48,621
What does it say?

658
00:47:48,705 --> 00:47:51,205
It says they pay themselves
a million and a half dollars...

659
00:47:51,288 --> 00:47:53,207
each, out of the trust.

660
00:47:53,248 --> 00:47:56,040
Out of the income of the trust.
Jesus Christ!

661
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:58,959
Which is why they got rid of Mina
Dunne and the rest of the board.

662
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:02,502
- It's probably not even illegal.
- It's probably just disgusting.

663
00:48:03,919 --> 00:48:05,462
I did this.

664
00:48:05,545 --> 00:48:08,546
- I did this.
- No, you didn't.

665
00:48:08,588 --> 00:48:11,048
- I did this.
- No, you did not.

666
00:48:20,385 --> 00:48:22,095
What do I do?

667
00:48:22,179 --> 00:48:24,387
You give me the file,
and I'll take it back.

668
00:48:24,471 --> 00:48:26,096
- Take it back?
- What?

669
00:48:26,179 --> 00:48:28,597
You didn't know
who these people were?

670
00:48:28,638 --> 00:48:30,598
You married into it.

671
00:48:37,269 --> 00:48:41,103
Since breakfast, I've left
the scene of an accident...

672
00:48:41,145 --> 00:48:43,730
I just bankrupted a guy
I don't even know...

673
00:48:43,772 --> 00:48:45,730
lied to my bosses...

674
00:48:47,022 --> 00:48:49,150
pulled a false alarm at work...

675
00:48:50,857 --> 00:48:53,900
discovered I'm a party
to defrauding a charity.

676
00:48:57,027 --> 00:48:59,445
And now I'm sitting here...

677
00:48:59,529 --> 00:49:02,989
seriously contemplating forging
a power of appointment.

678
00:49:45,633 --> 00:49:49,259
Hey, mister!
Mister, hold out your hand.

679
00:49:49,301 --> 00:49:52,802
- What?
- Hold out your hand.

680
00:49:52,886 --> 00:49:54,761
How many hands you got?

681
00:49:54,803 --> 00:49:56,513
Two.

682
00:49:59,139 --> 00:50:01,599
Thanks.

683
00:50:02,392 --> 00:50:04,350
- Oh, God.
- It's the file.

684
00:50:06,434 --> 00:50:07,852
Shit!

685
00:50:09,977 --> 00:50:12,854
- Wait. No, look, it's-
- It's not the power of appointment.

686
00:50:12,937 --> 00:50:16,063
- It's a notice to appear in court.
- Where's the kid?

687
00:50:18,773 --> 00:50:20,356
Look at this.

688
00:50:21,941 --> 00:50:23,858
It's a phone number.

689
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:29,278
- Who's that you're with?
- Is that your business?

690
00:50:29,362 --> 00:50:32,154
- Is she your secretary?
- No, she's a lawyer.

691
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:34,197
- Not your wife?
- No.

692
00:50:35,989 --> 00:50:37,907
Guy leaves the scene
of an accident.

693
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:40,867
- Guy cheats on his wife.
- Can I have my file back, please?

694
00:50:40,908 --> 00:50:42,867
It'll take me half an hour
to get to my bank.

695
00:50:42,909 --> 00:50:47,035
If my credit's not on by the time
I get there, I destroy the flle.

696
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:48,619
- That's the deal.
- Okay.

697
00:50:48,702 --> 00:50:50,787
Understood. Okay.

698
00:50:56,206 --> 00:50:58,331
- That was pretty fast, huh?
- It was great.

699
00:50:58,373 --> 00:51:02,001
Listen, I need you to turn it back
on as fast as you turned it off.

700
00:51:02,042 --> 00:51:04,334
Amazing, wasn't it?
Two hours!

701
00:51:04,418 --> 00:51:06,002
- Two hours!
- Yes, it was great.

702
00:51:06,086 --> 00:51:08,045
It was terrifllc. I need you
to turn it back on right now.

703
00:51:08,087 --> 00:51:10,546
Thirty minutes, okay?
Can you do that?

704
00:51:10,588 --> 00:51:12,547
That's a llttle harder.

705
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:14,549
Please, man.
Don't tell me that.

706
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:17,549
Please, do something.
Do something for me here.

707
00:51:17,591 --> 00:51:19,717
You gotta do something, man.

708
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,260
I'll do my best.

709
00:51:28,763 --> 00:51:30,306
- Hey, ba be, how's it going?
- I need to see you.

710
00:51:30,389 --> 00:51:32,723
Well, it's not a-
a great time right now.

711
00:51:32,807 --> 00:51:34,808
- I need to see you right now.
- Is something wrong?

712
00:51:34,891 --> 00:51:37,725
I just need to see you.
Meet me at Refugio's in ten minutes.

713
00:51:37,809 --> 00:51:39,476
- I'll be right there.
- Don't be late.

714
00:51:39,559 --> 00:51:41,352
- Okay, fllne.
- Okay, honey, thanks.

715
00:51:41,435 --> 00:51:42,894
All right.

716
00:51:48,231 --> 00:51:50,148
I gotta- I gotta go.

717
00:51:53,691 --> 00:51:56,110
Okay? I'll see you in a bit.

718
00:52:41,795 --> 00:52:46,257
You're gonna tell me my credit's off
and I can't get the loan approved.

719
00:52:47,007 --> 00:52:49,842
- Right.
- Check it.

720
00:52:49,925 --> 00:52:52,426
Well, right here.

721
00:52:56,094 --> 00:52:59,013
Well, that was strange.
You're right. Your credit's back on.

722
00:52:59,097 --> 00:53:00,512
So?

723
00:53:02,764 --> 00:53:05,140
Oh, this is so weird.

724
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:09,351
There you go. That's what I thought.
I knew I saw that.

725
00:53:09,434 --> 00:53:11,018
I knew it.

726
00:53:12,561 --> 00:53:15,729
- I can't help you.
- What do you mean?

727
00:53:15,812 --> 00:53:17,646
- You just saw.
- There's still a problem.

728
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:20,523
No, no, no.
It's all taken care of.

729
00:53:20,606 --> 00:53:23,566
It's all been solved.
Look in the computer.

730
00:53:23,649 --> 00:53:25,609
It says you're bankrupt.

731
00:53:29,985 --> 00:53:32,986
This is a mistake.

732
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:34,445
If it is a mistake...

733
00:53:34,528 --> 00:53:36,988
then clearing it up shouldn't
take more than three months.

734
00:53:45,075 --> 00:53:48,828
Ron, I've been having a bit
of a tussle today with someone.

735
00:53:48,911 --> 00:53:52,121
It doesn't matter who.
But what does matter...

736
00:53:52,204 --> 00:53:54,120
is that he got into my records.

737
00:53:54,204 --> 00:53:56,412
I don't know how,
and that doesn't matter either.

738
00:53:56,496 --> 00:53:59,331
- It's true, but-
- You've seen what he did.

739
00:53:59,415 --> 00:54:02,332
He's got some kind
of a computer voodoo.

740
00:54:02,415 --> 00:54:06,335
I don't know,
but he's got it, doesn't he?

741
00:54:07,752 --> 00:54:09,253
Someone sure
caused you some trou ble.

742
00:54:14,422 --> 00:54:16,590
I need this loan, Ron.

743
00:54:16,673 --> 00:54:18,882
I need it for my life.

744
00:54:18,965 --> 00:54:23,300
Now, nothing has changed
between yesterday and today.

745
00:54:23,383 --> 00:54:26,094
I'm still the same guy.
I wasn't bankrupt yesterday...

746
00:54:26,136 --> 00:54:28,637
and I'm not bankrupt today!

747
00:54:30,804 --> 00:54:32,930
I'm sorry, Mr. Gipson.

748
00:54:33,014 --> 00:54:35,182
The computer says you are.

749
00:54:46,478 --> 00:54:48,355
Now it doesn't!

750
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,863
Are you okay?

751
00:55:10,615 --> 00:55:11,990
What's wrong?

752
00:55:16,534 --> 00:55:19,619
Did you know that my father
had a mistress for 20 years?

753
00:55:22,703 --> 00:55:24,662
Don't lie.

754
00:55:28,956 --> 00:55:30,873
I didn't know it was 20 years.

755
00:55:32,957 --> 00:55:34,918
My mother knew about it.

756
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:38,294
Why didn't she leave him?

757
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:40,336
Because she loved him so much.

758
00:55:42,211 --> 00:55:45,255
She decided it'd be hypocritical to
leave a man for cheating at home...

759
00:55:45,339 --> 00:55:48,256
when the expensive life
she enjoyed so much...

760
00:55:48,339 --> 00:55:52,882
was paid for by a man whose job
was based on finding ways to cheat.

761
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:56,009
Is that your opinion of the law?

762
00:55:57,469 --> 00:55:59,928
What do you think
the law is, Gav...

763
00:56:00,012 --> 00:56:02,430
at this level of the game,
at my father's level of the game...

764
00:56:02,514 --> 00:56:05,389
at your level of the game?

765
00:56:05,472 --> 00:56:08,682
It is a big, vicious rumble, Gavin.

766
00:56:10,224 --> 00:56:12,185
The people who founded
this law firm...

767
00:56:12,226 --> 00:56:15,686
and the people who sustain it...

768
00:56:15,769 --> 00:56:18,020
understand the way the world works.

769
00:56:19,895 --> 00:56:23,397
If you wanna continue to live
the way we've been living-

770
00:56:23,481 --> 00:56:25,398
You have to steal.

771
00:56:27,983 --> 00:56:29,901
I could've married an honest man.

772
00:56:33,194 --> 00:56:36,278
I could've lived
with a professor of...

773
00:56:36,362 --> 00:56:39,822
Middle English, for example...

774
00:56:39,906 --> 00:56:42,614
if he was a moral man
and had tenure at Princeton.

775
00:56:43,948 --> 00:56:46,200
But I didn't.

776
00:56:46,283 --> 00:56:49,034
I married a Wall Street lawyer.

777
00:56:49,118 --> 00:56:51,327
Which means I married someone
who lives in a world...

778
00:56:51,369 --> 00:56:55,121
where when a man comes to the edge
of things, he has to commit...

779
00:56:55,205 --> 00:56:58,538
to staying there and living there.

780
00:56:58,621 --> 00:57:00,497
Can you live there, Gavin?

781
00:57:01,915 --> 00:57:04,583
Can you live there with me?

782
00:57:09,293 --> 00:57:12,294
You're not gonna do
anything stupid like leaving me.

783
00:57:12,378 --> 00:57:15,837
You've had fantasies, I'm sure.
So have I.

784
00:57:15,921 --> 00:57:17,504
But we're married.

785
00:57:19,715 --> 00:57:21,340
I knew about Michelle.

786
00:57:21,424 --> 00:57:25,218
I knew when it was happening,
and I knew when it was finished.

787
00:57:28,677 --> 00:57:30,637
And I know you love me.

788
00:57:32,429 --> 00:57:34,847
You do love me,
and I love you too.

789
00:57:36,848 --> 00:57:39,974
I'm your wife,
and I wanna stand beside you.

790
00:57:48,562 --> 00:57:51,897
Just let me help you, Gavin.

791
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:53,897
Let me help you with this.

792
00:57:59,858 --> 00:58:02,527
What do you want me to do?

793
00:58:04,611 --> 00:58:07,987
Take the signature page from
the living will and attach it...

794
00:58:08,029 --> 00:58:11,112
to the newly formatted copy
of the power of appointment.

795
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:16,324
Bring it to the courthouse,
and then meet me for dinner tonight.

796
00:58:17,617 --> 00:58:19,660
We're going out
with Karen and Carl.

797
00:58:27,788 --> 00:58:29,954
I forgot about Karen and Carl.

798
00:58:30,038 --> 00:58:32,456
And I remembered.

799
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:36,499
We're a team, Gav.

800
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:38,000
We're partners.

801
00:59:11,474 --> 00:59:14,017
- Deal's a deal.
- The credit's back on?

802
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:16,560
- I used my MasterCard just now.
- Sir, we don't allow cell phones.

803
00:59:16,602 --> 00:59:19,228
That was fast.
Okay, one second.

804
00:59:19,311 --> 00:59:21,312
They turned my credit back on.
Now I owe you something.

805
00:59:21,396 --> 00:59:23,855
Thank God you did not
throw that away this morning.

806
00:59:23,938 --> 00:59:26,648
- So how you wanna do this?
- One second.

807
00:59:26,731 --> 00:59:29,357
- You wanna come to my offllce?
- No.

808
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,400
- Why not?
- You got your car?

809
00:59:31,483 --> 00:59:34,025
- It's at the office, yeah.
- How about the courthouse?

810
00:59:34,067 --> 00:59:35,985
You do have to turn this thing in,
don't you?

811
00:59:36,068 --> 00:59:39,237
- Right.
- See, I'm thinking about you.

812
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,531
Okay, listen, Doyle-

813
00:59:41,613 --> 00:59:45,364
Look, please. You aren't gonna
get all soft on me, are you?

814
00:59:45,448 --> 00:59:49,534
I just want you to know
that I'm sorry, and I just-

815
00:59:49,618 --> 00:59:52,368
I'm just glad this thing is over.

816
01:00:26,925 --> 01:00:28,843
Don't get too close.

817
01:00:36,471 --> 01:00:38,597
Hey, my hero.

818
01:00:38,681 --> 01:00:40,723
My champion.
It's all over.

819
01:00:40,765 --> 01:00:42,432
He called me.
He's giving me back the file.

820
01:00:42,515 --> 01:00:44,558
Really?

821
01:00:44,642 --> 01:00:47,226
- What do you mean?
- Because there's-

822
01:00:47,267 --> 01:00:49,561
- There's one thing I couldn't do.
- What couldn't you do?

823
01:00:54,104 --> 01:00:57,563
This damn bankruptcy
has a llfe of its own.

824
01:00:59,773 --> 01:01:01,691
What couldn't you do?

825
01:01:01,775 --> 01:01:04,901
I couldn't undo the bankruptcy.

826
01:01:04,985 --> 01:01:06,444
Sorry.

827
01:01:10,278 --> 01:01:12,363
Shit.

828
01:02:57,328 --> 01:02:59,745
Are you drunk?

829
01:03:02,664 --> 01:03:04,122
Are you sure?

830
01:03:06,373 --> 01:03:07,956
Yes, I'm sure.

831
01:03:30,468 --> 01:03:31,884
It's nice.

832
01:03:43,764 --> 01:03:46,307
Show me the house.

833
01:03:59,773 --> 01:04:04,524
On which was hung
the Savior of the world

834
01:04:06,024 --> 01:04:07,526
Come

835
01:04:07,609 --> 01:04:12,194
Let us worship

836
01:04:14,028 --> 01:04:18,240
This is the wood of the cross

837
01:04:18,282 --> 01:04:24,367
On which was hung
the Savior of the world

838
01:04:24,450 --> 01:04:26,660
Come

839
01:04:26,743 --> 01:04:30,411
Let us worship

840
01:04:48,794 --> 01:04:50,879
Do you know why
I took the job in Oregon?

841
01:04:55,131 --> 01:04:56,548
To...

842
01:05:00,299 --> 01:05:03,676
get as far away from me
as possible.

843
01:05:06,969 --> 01:05:09,720
I looked at a lot of cities, and...

844
01:05:10,804 --> 01:05:12,263
Portland...

845
01:05:13,598 --> 01:05:17,599
has thousands of nice, dull,
bearded guys.

846
01:05:17,683 --> 01:05:22,186
And I thought, you know,
guys like this just-

847
01:05:23,643 --> 01:05:25,853
Guys.

848
01:05:25,936 --> 01:05:28,187
I could find one.

849
01:05:28,271 --> 01:05:31,439
A better version of you, Doyle.

850
01:05:31,481 --> 01:05:34,565
A version of you,
but a better version of you.

851
01:05:34,648 --> 01:05:36,233
What I always...

852
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:42,444
wanted you to be,
and what you were for a little...

853
01:05:42,528 --> 01:05:44,487
when I met you.

854
01:05:50,781 --> 01:05:53,491
In the name of the Father and
the Son and the Holy Spirit, amen.

855
01:05:53,575 --> 01:05:55,784
I don't- It's all right.
I don't want confession.

856
01:05:55,826 --> 01:05:58,826
I just- All the seats
were full out there...

857
01:05:58,868 --> 01:06:02,745
so I came in here
Just to listen to the song.

858
01:06:02,828 --> 01:06:04,746
There's some seats up front.
I'll show you.

859
01:06:04,829 --> 01:06:06,955
I don't want that.
Thank you.

860
01:06:11,416 --> 01:06:12,957
Are you a Catholic?

861
01:06:19,961 --> 01:06:22,212
It's beautiful.

862
01:06:22,295 --> 01:06:24,796
No, it's not.

863
01:06:24,838 --> 01:06:26,463
But it could've been.

864
01:06:28,298 --> 01:06:30,381
I don't know
what's gonna happen, but...

865
01:06:32,050 --> 01:06:34,259
I don't blame you
for wanting to leave.

866
01:06:37,344 --> 01:06:38,470
Oregon.

867
01:06:40,346 --> 01:06:43,222
The boys...

868
01:06:43,305 --> 01:06:45,223
it'll be good for them.

869
01:06:47,515 --> 01:06:50,267
I know how hard it must be
for you to say that.

870
01:06:56,437 --> 01:06:59,395
I'm sorry I was late today.

871
01:07:00,855 --> 01:07:02,480
We should've waited.

872
01:07:04,232 --> 01:07:06,400
I came here for some meaning.
I'm trying-

873
01:07:06,483 --> 01:07:09,483
I want you to give the world
meaning to me.

874
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:12,152
Why does the world need meaning?

875
01:07:12,235 --> 01:07:13,820
Why does the-

876
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:17,529
Because the world's a sewer.

877
01:07:17,612 --> 01:07:20,864
Because the world's a shithole
and a gar bage dump.

878
01:07:20,906 --> 01:07:24,866
Because my father-in-law
got me to screw a good man...

879
01:07:24,908 --> 01:07:27,742
a decent man,
out of his money.

880
01:07:27,826 --> 01:07:30,160
And my wife cheers me on.

881
01:07:30,202 --> 01:07:33,037
Because I got into a fender bender
with this guy on the FDR.

882
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:36,287
I had a flight with him. I tried
to do everything to settle it.

883
01:07:36,371 --> 01:07:40,290
- But this guy just won't let it go.
- Why?

884
01:07:40,374 --> 01:07:42,541
- Why wouldn't he let it go?
- I don't know why!

885
01:07:42,624 --> 01:07:43,833
I don't know why.

886
01:07:43,917 --> 01:07:49,209
Sometimes, God likes to put two guys
in a paper bag and just let 'em rip.

887
01:07:58,131 --> 01:07:59,548
Thank you.

888
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:04,717
Thank you for letting us go.

889
01:08:25,977 --> 01:08:28,020
Are you saying
he's a threat to his chlldren?

890
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:31,230
He's told friends that
if his ex-wife got custody...

891
01:08:31,313 --> 01:08:34,106
he would kidnap his sons
and take them out of this country.

892
01:08:34,190 --> 01:08:36,024
- And she got custody?
- We were in court this morning.

893
01:08:36,065 --> 01:08:38,024
I don't know for a fact
that he's coming here, but-

894
01:08:38,065 --> 01:08:42,277
- Doyle Gipson? Really?
- Really. What does that mean?

895
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:45,110
He comes to every play they're in,
all the teacher conferences.

896
01:08:45,194 --> 01:08:48,445
So a guy comes to a school play,
you trust him?

897
01:08:48,528 --> 01:08:53,365
Doyle Gipson is a man
of no honor at all!

898
01:08:54,323 --> 01:08:55,908
A low man.

899
01:08:55,991 --> 01:08:59,618
But that's okay, because
no body else has any honor either.

900
01:08:59,701 --> 01:09:02,078
That's what makes life
so hard for people-

901
01:09:02,119 --> 01:09:04,079
is that we're taught
this fairy tale.

902
01:09:04,162 --> 01:09:07,162
The good and well,
and the bad and poorly.

903
01:09:07,246 --> 01:09:10,207
- Do you believe that?
- I'd like to.

904
01:09:10,248 --> 01:09:13,957
He's coming here.
Be ready for him.

905
01:09:23,962 --> 01:09:25,754
Is he in?

906
01:09:26,796 --> 01:09:28,756
Hello. Is he there?

907
01:09:30,464 --> 01:09:34,007
Well, I just need
to leave a message for him.

908
01:09:34,091 --> 01:09:37,050
I'm calling from
his children's school.

909
01:09:38,759 --> 01:09:41,261
Yeah. I'm afraid
there's been an accident.

910
01:10:18,278 --> 01:10:21,197
- How are my sons?
- Who are your sons?

911
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:24,156
Danny and Steven Gipson. I received
a call that said they were hurt.

912
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:26,741
- Danny and Steven Gipson?
- I haven't heard anything.

913
01:10:26,783 --> 01:10:28,741
I wanna see my sons!

914
01:10:28,783 --> 01:10:31,618
- Mr. Gipson-
- Miss Miller, how are the boys?

915
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:34,661
I think you should leave
before we call the police.

916
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:39,329
Mr. Gipson,
don't make me call the police.

917
01:10:41,664 --> 01:10:45,249
- So, they're fine?
- Yes, your boys are fine.

918
01:10:45,333 --> 01:10:48,084
- And all of this is just a mistake?
- Yes.

919
01:10:52,877 --> 01:10:54,294
I'm sorry.

920
01:11:09,551 --> 01:11:10,927
Call the police.

921
01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:13,594
Daniel Gipson! Stevie Gipson!
Can you hear me?

922
01:11:15,722 --> 01:11:17,472
- Can you hear me?
- Call their mother.

923
01:11:17,514 --> 01:11:20,307
- Gipson boys, where are you?
- Daddy!

924
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:22,767
- Come back here.
- Daddy!

925
01:11:28,852 --> 01:11:32,937
Get off me!
Get off- Danny! Stevie!

926
01:11:35,605 --> 01:11:37,981
- Daddy! No!
- Calm down!

927
01:11:45,444 --> 01:11:49,153
They said you were hurt!
You haven't been hurt or sick today?

928
01:11:50,696 --> 01:11:53,363
We're gonna pick you up
nice and slowly.

929
01:11:53,446 --> 01:11:55,156
- All right? Got it?
- Okay.

930
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:59,032
- Don't hurt my dad! Please!
- Okay, let's go. Up.

931
01:12:00,199 --> 01:12:01,367
Nice and easy.

932
01:12:04,368 --> 01:12:05,828
Come on.

933
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:14,832
See that?
I tried to make peace with you.

934
01:12:22,209 --> 01:12:26,670
You know what I can do to you
for trying to kill me?

935
01:12:26,711 --> 01:12:29,212
You know who I am?
You know who I am?

936
01:12:29,295 --> 01:12:32,506
You see what I can do to you?
You try to kill me?

937
01:12:32,547 --> 01:12:35,131
Motherfucker.
What's up now?

938
01:12:48,889 --> 01:12:50,347
Shit.

939
01:13:17,318 --> 01:13:19,236
Empty your pockets, sir.

940
01:13:22,904 --> 01:13:24,321
Keys.

941
01:13:26,447 --> 01:13:27,906
Change.

942
01:13:27,948 --> 01:13:30,408
Wallet. Pager.

943
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:37,494
File.

944
01:13:43,247 --> 01:13:46,165
Hey, how you doing?
I'm looking for a Ron Ca bot.

945
01:13:46,248 --> 01:13:48,707
- Count your money, sir.
- What?

946
01:13:48,749 --> 01:13:50,375
Count your money.

947
01:13:53,668 --> 01:13:56,043
Mr. Cabot,
I am Doyle Gipson's attorney.

948
01:13:56,085 --> 01:13:59,128
I don't wanna talk about him. Since
we're closing, I don't have to.

949
01:13:59,212 --> 01:14:01,672
I understand that. Mr. Ca bot,
I just need you to help me-

950
01:14:05,423 --> 01:14:06,716
Seventy-seven dollars.

951
01:14:06,758 --> 01:14:08,884
I'm asking you to try
to help me help Doyle here.

952
01:14:08,967 --> 01:14:10,092
He needs it.

953
01:14:10,175 --> 01:14:12,385
He has had about
the worst day of his life.

954
01:14:12,468 --> 01:14:16,219
He had this credit problem that was
not his fault. It was caused by-

955
01:14:16,302 --> 01:14:19,096
Someone who hacked away
into his records. I know.

956
01:14:19,179 --> 01:14:22,013
How can we get this whole thing
straightened out? What can I do?

957
01:14:22,096 --> 01:14:23,222
Nothing.

958
01:14:31,602 --> 01:14:34,562
Okay. Mr. Ca bot.

959
01:14:36,855 --> 01:14:40,273
Ron, let's try this
another way, okay?

960
01:14:40,356 --> 01:14:43,565
Let's say there's a different man.
You don't know this guy.

961
01:14:43,607 --> 01:14:46,400
And he has some credit problems
that are his fault.

962
01:14:46,483 --> 01:14:48,569
And then another man-
you don't know him-

963
01:14:48,610 --> 01:14:51,028
he wants to help
the fllrst guy, okay?

964
01:14:51,110 --> 01:14:55,238
Now, what does he have to do to help
the second guy take out a loan?

965
01:14:55,322 --> 01:14:58,907
Come on. What do I do? Just cosign?
What's the thing? What's the deal?

966
01:14:58,949 --> 01:15:00,907
Can you please tell me
what I gotta do.

967
01:15:00,949 --> 01:15:03,284
I'm asking you what I have to do
to make this thing work.

968
01:15:05,201 --> 01:15:08,535
You know this has nothing
to do with you. It's this guy.

969
01:15:08,619 --> 01:15:11,912
- He's been at me all day.
- Some body you're fighting with?

970
01:15:11,995 --> 01:15:14,080
You had a fight with some body
who hit your car...

971
01:15:14,164 --> 01:15:16,206
and then you spent the day
in some kind of battle with him.

972
01:15:16,290 --> 01:15:18,956
Then he went to the school
to hurt you as hard as he could.

973
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:21,959
You believe me?
Thank God. Thank God.

974
01:15:22,042 --> 01:15:24,294
This guy, this lawyer,
Gavin Banek-

975
01:15:24,377 --> 01:15:27,127
Doyle, stop! Stop, Doyle!
I don't care.

976
01:15:27,211 --> 01:15:29,544
Whatever this little drama
you've gotten yourself into...

977
01:15:29,628 --> 01:15:32,672
it's just the kind of thing
that always happens to you.

978
01:15:32,755 --> 01:15:35,923
And it never happens to me unless
I am in your field of gravity.

979
01:15:35,964 --> 01:15:39,257
You went crazy like you always do,
like you always will go crazy.

980
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:41,884
Drunk or sober, it doesn't matter,
'cause that's you.

981
01:15:42,926 --> 01:15:45,134
A person can be loving...

982
01:15:45,218 --> 01:15:47,135
and a person can be crazy
all at once.

983
01:15:47,219 --> 01:15:50,805
That's life. But this is not
Just my life now or yours.

984
01:15:50,888 --> 01:15:53,431
It is the life
of two children...

985
01:15:53,473 --> 01:15:55,473
and I have to protect
those two children.

986
01:15:55,557 --> 01:15:58,600
Is that a misunderstanding?
Is it?

987
01:15:58,683 --> 01:16:01,267
Is it, Doyle? I mean,
is that this guy's fault?

988
01:16:03,894 --> 01:16:05,812
At least let me say
good- bye to them.

989
01:16:07,978 --> 01:16:10,271
I'm takin' those boys away,
and you will never see them again.

990
01:16:10,313 --> 01:16:14,232
You will never find us. Do not try
to come after us. Do you hear me?

991
01:16:14,315 --> 01:16:16,107
It is over!

992
01:17:02,253 --> 01:17:05,463
- Where's Ellen?
- She went home.

993
01:17:05,547 --> 01:17:07,797
Why are you still here?

994
01:17:09,006 --> 01:17:11,091
You told me to wait.

995
01:17:15,969 --> 01:17:18,345
Well, come on in.

996
01:17:24,264 --> 01:17:25,847
Have a seat.

997
01:17:33,477 --> 01:17:37,477
- So why do you wanna be a lawyer?
- I believe in the law.

998
01:17:37,561 --> 01:17:40,229
I believe in order and justice.

999
01:17:40,313 --> 01:17:43,398
I believe that people are,
by nature, good.

1000
01:17:43,481 --> 01:17:47,233
I believe that historical forces
push us into conflict...

1001
01:17:47,316 --> 01:17:50,860
and without the law
as a buffer between people...

1002
01:17:50,944 --> 01:17:54,027
we would have
a world of vendetta...

1003
01:17:54,111 --> 01:17:56,279
a world of violence,
a world of chaos.

1004
01:17:58,863 --> 01:18:01,657
The law-
The law keeps us civilized.

1005
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:04,657
- I'm sorry.
- I don't think it's-

1006
01:18:05,658 --> 01:18:09,035
- I'm sorry.
- I don't think it's funny.

1007
01:18:09,118 --> 01:18:11,912
That's why I am gonna
give you this job.

1008
01:18:14,412 --> 01:18:18,373
Because I wanna hear what
you have to say about the law...

1009
01:18:18,456 --> 01:18:20,915
after you've worked here
for five years...

1010
01:18:20,998 --> 01:18:23,958
or three years, or a month...

1011
01:18:24,042 --> 01:18:26,043
a week, a day, an hour.

1012
01:18:29,503 --> 01:18:31,127
I'm hired?

1013
01:18:31,211 --> 01:18:33,252
Don't I have to see...

1014
01:18:33,336 --> 01:18:35,921
a committee or something?

1015
01:18:38,256 --> 01:18:41,175
- You made bail.
- Who?

1016
01:18:41,258 --> 01:18:42,841
A friend.

1017
01:18:46,093 --> 01:18:48,885
"To the Honorable
Judge Frances Abarbanel.

1018
01:18:48,969 --> 01:18:51,345
I have been unable to recover
the power of appointment...

1019
01:18:51,429 --> 01:18:53,053
signed by Simon Dunne.

1020
01:18:53,095 --> 01:18:55,555
But even if I had been able to
produce the power of appointment...

1021
01:18:55,597 --> 01:18:59,515
I want the court to know that
the document was a fraud.

1022
01:18:59,599 --> 01:19:01,474
I induced Mr. Dunne
to sign a document...

1023
01:19:01,558 --> 01:19:04,101
when his mental status was
diminished and he was incapable...

1024
01:19:04,185 --> 01:19:06,728
of making an informed decision."

1025
01:19:10,604 --> 01:19:13,648
They set you up! They made
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

1026
01:19:13,731 --> 01:19:15,898
- And they're gonna make more.
- And I made partner...

1027
01:19:15,982 --> 01:19:18,024
and a bonus that could've paid
for 200 pianos.

1028
01:19:18,108 --> 01:19:19,651
You don't say anything about them.

1029
01:19:19,733 --> 01:19:23,360
You're taking everything
on your shoulder in this letter.

1030
01:19:23,443 --> 01:19:25,527
Why? You could send 'em to jail.

1031
01:19:26,944 --> 01:19:29,029
They gotta write their own letters.

1032
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,375
Let me go.

1033
01:20:18,384 --> 01:20:20,678
Should've left me inside.

1034
01:20:20,761 --> 01:20:24,554
You're too important to me.
Come on. Let's go to a meeting.

1035
01:20:24,638 --> 01:20:26,639
No, no, no.
I went to one yesterday.

1036
01:20:28,723 --> 01:20:32,516
- Well, that was yesterday.
- Yeah, one day at a time, right?

1037
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:35,268
Yeah, one day at a time,
and do the next right thing.

1038
01:20:35,351 --> 01:20:38,227
Let's go.
There's a meeting at 6:00.

1039
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:40,353
"God, grant me the strength...

1040
01:20:40,437 --> 01:20:43,189
to accept the things
I cannot change."

1041
01:20:54,986 --> 01:20:57,570
It's an admirable gesture,
but it's unnecessary.

1042
01:20:57,653 --> 01:21:01,071
It's unnecessary because
you've already filed...

1043
01:21:01,154 --> 01:21:03,073
the power of appointment
with the court.

1044
01:21:06,990 --> 01:21:10,451
A bonded courier delivered it
to the judge just before 5:00...

1045
01:21:10,492 --> 01:21:12,452
and her bailiff signed for it.

1046
01:21:13,743 --> 01:21:17,745
Your note of apology was contrite,
but it was absolutely professional.

1047
01:21:17,829 --> 01:21:19,746
Everything's taken care of.

1048
01:21:22,623 --> 01:21:24,541
- You filed a forgery.
- Bullshit.

1049
01:21:24,624 --> 01:21:26,709
I filed what I had to file.
What happened to-

1050
01:21:26,792 --> 01:21:29,293
You just disappeared.
Time was up.

1051
01:21:29,376 --> 01:21:31,794
Come on.
You scared the hell out of us.

1052
01:21:31,836 --> 01:21:33,794
I didn't know what to do.

1053
01:21:39,504 --> 01:21:41,423
So you finally hit rock bottom?

1054
01:21:44,924 --> 01:21:47,800
Today you almost killed a guy.
Tomorrow you might go all the way.

1055
01:21:47,842 --> 01:21:49,926
Keep doing the next wrong thing,
you could start a religion.

1056
01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:52,052
Convince the so ber to drink.
Don't tell them...

1057
01:21:52,136 --> 01:21:54,096
to keep each other alive with hope.

1058
01:21:54,179 --> 01:21:58,973
You saw today that everything decent
is held together by a covenant.

1059
01:21:59,056 --> 01:22:01,183
An agreement not to go bat shit!

1060
01:22:03,016 --> 01:22:05,893
- You broke the contract!
- I didn't have a drink!

1061
01:22:05,976 --> 01:22:07,768
Well, wow!
Thank you for sharing!

1062
01:22:07,851 --> 01:22:10,061
You didn't have a drink today!
What an inspiration!

1063
01:22:10,144 --> 01:22:12,270
That's the point, isn't it?

1064
01:22:13,854 --> 01:22:15,312
God!

1065
01:22:21,692 --> 01:22:26,152
You know, booze isn't really
your drug of choice anyway.

1066
01:22:29,028 --> 01:22:30,737
You're addicted to chaos.

1067
01:22:33,489 --> 01:22:36,281
For some of us, it's coke.
For some of us, it's bourbon.

1068
01:22:36,364 --> 01:22:38,908
But you,
you got hooked on disaster.

1069
01:22:48,371 --> 01:22:49,747
Fuck!

1070
01:22:53,748 --> 01:22:55,624
Here's what you should do.

1071
01:22:55,708 --> 01:22:58,042
You get up Monday morning...

1072
01:22:58,125 --> 01:23:00,460
and you get yourself
on a plane to Texas.

1073
01:23:00,543 --> 01:23:02,835
Take that letter with you.

1074
01:23:02,919 --> 01:23:05,378
When you get to Texas...

1075
01:23:05,461 --> 01:23:08,588
you get on the defense team
of somebody on death row.

1076
01:23:10,421 --> 01:23:14,840
And then put all your energy
into saving a man from execution.

1077
01:23:16,216 --> 01:23:19,801
And then come on back here
in a few months.

1078
01:23:19,884 --> 01:23:23,928
You still wanna confess, go ahead.

1079
01:23:25,929 --> 01:23:27,930
Come on.

1080
01:23:28,013 --> 01:23:30,389
How the hell do you think
Simon Dunne got his money?

1081
01:23:34,099 --> 01:23:36,891
You think those factories
in Malaysia...

1082
01:23:36,975 --> 01:23:38,768
have day-care centers in them?

1083
01:23:38,851 --> 01:23:42,395
Wanna check the pollution levels
of his chemical plants in Mexico...

1084
01:23:42,479 --> 01:23:46,939
or look at the tax benefllts
he got from this foundation?

1085
01:23:50,399 --> 01:23:54,525
This is all a tightrope.

1086
01:23:54,567 --> 01:23:57,444
You gotta learn to balance.

1087
01:23:57,528 --> 01:23:59,527
How can you live like that?

1088
01:23:59,611 --> 01:24:04,112
I can live with myself
because at the end of the day...

1089
01:24:04,196 --> 01:24:08,532
I think I do more good than harm.

1090
01:24:11,909 --> 01:24:15,076
What other standard
have I got to judge by?

1091
01:25:07,142 --> 01:25:09,143
I have to thank you.

1092
01:25:15,812 --> 01:25:18,272
For the house?

1093
01:25:18,355 --> 01:25:22,023
I understand what
you were trying to do, but...

1094
01:25:22,107 --> 01:25:25,734
my wife's moving,
she's taking the boys.

1095
01:25:25,776 --> 01:25:28,318
The house is a little bit
too much for me right now.

1096
01:25:29,485 --> 01:25:30,944
I'm sorry.

1097
01:25:34,113 --> 01:25:36,406
I was a horribly unstable father.

1098
01:25:39,532 --> 01:25:42,492
And Valerie says
I'll never see them again.

1099
01:25:44,867 --> 01:25:46,786
But you know what?

1100
01:25:48,119 --> 01:25:49,536
I will.

1101
01:25:55,246 --> 01:25:59,166
I'll see 'em in a year or two...

1102
01:25:59,249 --> 01:26:00,667
may be three.

1103
01:26:03,293 --> 01:26:06,545
I'll go to Portland,
I'll call her...

1104
01:26:08,253 --> 01:26:11,046
and I'll find a way
to be their father again.

1105
01:26:16,214 --> 01:26:17,756
How about you?

1106
01:26:21,801 --> 01:26:23,884
Well...

1107
01:26:23,968 --> 01:26:26,594
I have the file...

1108
01:26:26,677 --> 01:26:28,763
but I don't need it anymore.

1109
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:36,099
It's been taken care of.

1110
01:26:36,140 --> 01:26:38,850
You know.
It never happened.

1111
01:26:43,770 --> 01:26:47,437
But it did happen. Right?

1112
01:26:48,980 --> 01:26:50,396
Right.

1113
01:26:54,983 --> 01:26:56,942
So, now what?

1114
01:27:16,993 --> 01:27:21,037
I'm going to dinner with my wife...

1115
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:22,537
her parents.

1116
01:27:25,205 --> 01:27:30,958
And this weekend,
I'm gonna go look at a boat.

1117
01:27:37,919 --> 01:27:43,421
And then on Monday, I'm gonna
come back in here and go to work.

1118
01:27:44,339 --> 01:27:45,755
And then...

1119
01:27:47,756 --> 01:27:49,757
magically this whole...

1120
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:55,010
incredible day just somehow...

1121
01:27:55,052 --> 01:27:56,635
becomes a memory.

1122
01:27:59,512 --> 01:28:02,930
It's like you go to the beach.
You go down to the water.

1123
01:28:03,013 --> 01:28:06,474
It's a little cold.
You're not sure if you wanna go in.

1124
01:28:07,931 --> 01:28:09,975
There's a pretty girl
standing next to you.

1125
01:28:10,058 --> 01:28:13,809
She doesn't wanna go in either.
She sees you.

1126
01:28:13,851 --> 01:28:15,810
And you know...

1127
01:28:15,852 --> 01:28:19,188
if you just asked her
her name...

1128
01:28:21,856 --> 01:28:24,356
you would leave with her.

1129
01:28:24,398 --> 01:28:28,067
Forget your life,
whoever you came with...

1130
01:28:30,693 --> 01:28:32,652
and leave the beach with her.

1131
01:28:36,028 --> 01:28:37,946
And after that day...

1132
01:28:39,363 --> 01:28:41,989
you remember her.

1133
01:28:42,031 --> 01:28:46,909
Not every day, every week.

1134
01:28:48,701 --> 01:28:50,662
She comes back to you.

1135
01:28:52,411 --> 01:28:55,621
It's the memory...

1136
01:28:55,705 --> 01:28:57,622
of another life...

1137
01:28:57,705 --> 01:28:59,289
you could've had.

1138
01:29:02,707 --> 01:29:04,626
Today is that girl.

1139
01:29:29,553 --> 01:29:33,012
I'm sorry about what I did.

1140
01:29:37,472 --> 01:29:39,598
Me too.

1141
01:29:41,767 --> 01:29:43,726
You brought the file back.

1142
01:29:59,775 --> 01:30:04,276
When you're done, there's a lovely
little place on the hill where-

1143
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:06,278
where you can get a-

1144
01:30:07,445 --> 01:30:09,196
- Cappuccino.
- Yes, that's right, dear.

1145
01:30:09,238 --> 01:30:12,698
They're lovely cappuccinos,
and it's clean and it's cool.

1146
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:17,033
They have these prints on the wall.
They're really quite lovely.

1147
01:30:17,075 --> 01:30:21,327
I don't know who they're by.
They're by that artist-

1148
01:30:21,409 --> 01:30:24,287
- Chagall.
- Right. They're Chagalls.

1149
01:30:24,370 --> 01:30:26,120
There's three of them.
They're early Chagalls.

1150
01:30:26,203 --> 01:30:28,372
I think he painted them
when he was visiting there.

1151
01:30:35,792 --> 01:30:38,001
Am I missing something this evening?

1152
01:30:38,085 --> 01:30:40,545
- What is this?
- This, my dear-

1153
01:30:40,628 --> 01:30:43,879
This is Simon Dunne's...

1154
01:30:43,921 --> 01:30:46,881
power of appointment.

1155
01:30:46,923 --> 01:30:48,464
- I got it back.
- No, you didn't.

1156
01:30:48,547 --> 01:30:52,799
- Yes, I did. This is it.
- Please.

1157
01:30:52,882 --> 01:30:58,135
This is behind us, isn't it?
Haven't we put this behind us?

1158
01:30:58,218 --> 01:30:59,760
I was thinking about
what you said to me.

1159
01:30:59,843 --> 01:31:03,595
About the end of the day-
about doing more good than harm.

1160
01:31:03,679 --> 01:31:04,971
That is what you said, isn't it?

1161
01:31:05,055 --> 01:31:08,724
- Don't you fuck with me.
- I am not fucking with you, sir.

1162
01:31:10,016 --> 01:31:11,391
Can you imagine how unpleasant
it would be...

1163
01:31:11,474 --> 01:31:13,601
if the judge
got ahold of this file?

1164
01:31:13,643 --> 01:31:16,267
That's not gonna happen.
That's not gonna happen, Gavin.

1165
01:31:19,145 --> 01:31:22,771
I think I might order the snapper.

1166
01:31:25,981 --> 01:31:28,148
I'm gonna hold onto this file. I'm
gonna keep it in a very safe place.

1167
01:31:28,231 --> 01:31:30,942
But I'm not going to Texas.

1168
01:31:31,025 --> 01:31:33,277
I'm gonna come back
into work on Monday.

1169
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:37,445
I'm gonna start doing that pro bono
work that you recommended that I do.

1170
01:31:37,529 --> 01:31:40,196
But I'm gonna do it
from our office.

1171
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:44,281
The first thing we're gonna do
is help a man buy a house.

1172
01:31:44,322 --> 01:31:46,323
- Gavin, can we please not do this?
- And I think...

1173
01:31:46,365 --> 01:31:49,617
I would like to be the one
to call Mina Dunne.

1174
01:31:49,700 --> 01:31:51,660
I'm gonna tell her
that you and Walter...

1175
01:31:51,701 --> 01:31:54,785
are gonna give back the three
million dollars you stole...

1176
01:31:54,827 --> 01:31:56,786
from her grandfather's foundation.

1177
01:32:05,875 --> 01:32:09,626
You were right.
I can do this.

1178
01:32:09,668 --> 01:32:11,627
I found the edge.

1179
01:32:12,795 --> 01:32:14,420
Can you live there with me?

1180
01:32:17,213 --> 01:32:18,798
Can you?

1181
01:32:25,758 --> 01:32:28,217
I haven't had a fucking thing
to eat all day, and I'm starving.

1182
01:32:32,762 --> 01:32:34,971
So what are we gonna eat?

1183
01:32:53,770 --> 01:32:56,355
- Mrs. Gipson?
- Yes?

1184
01:32:56,439 --> 01:32:58,941
My name is Gavin Banek.

1185
01:32:59,024 --> 01:33:00,942
What do you want?

1186
01:33:02,066 --> 01:33:04,776
Five minutes, ma'am.

1187
01:33:04,860 --> 01:33:07,068
I owe your husband twenty.

1188
01:33:07,152 --> 01:33:09,362
Hell...

1189
01:33:09,445 --> 01:33:11,947
I'm only asking for five with you.
