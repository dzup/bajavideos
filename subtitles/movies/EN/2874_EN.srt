1
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:30,072
"What makes a man to wander"

2
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,703
"What makes a man to roam"

3
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:43,335
"What makes a man leave bed and board"

4
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,842
"And turn his back on home"

5
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:57,891
"Ride away"

6
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,147
"Ride away"

7
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,863
"Ride away"

8
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:10,881
Ethan?

9
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,788
That's your Uncle Ethan!

10
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,928
Welcome home, Ethan.

11
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,195
Lucy...

12
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,614
You ain't much bigger
than when I last saw you!

13
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:18,949
I'm Deborah.

14
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,909
There's Lucy over there.

15
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,203
Deborah? Debbie...

16
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,331
And you're Lucy?

17
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:29,918
Yeah, I'm Lucy. I'm mighty glad
to see you, Uncle Ethan.

18
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:32,796
She's got a fella. Kisses him, too!

19
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,675
Go on with Lucy and help with supper.

20
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,468
Deborah, you too!

21
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:41,471
Ben...

22
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:45,058
I was just gonna ask Uncle Ethan
what he's gonna do with his saber.

23
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,811
Well, I kind of figured to give it to you.

24
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,397
Thanks. Thanks, Uncle Ethan.

25
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,905
How was California?
California? How should I know?

26
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,365
Mose Harper told us...
Mose Harper?

27
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,868
Is that old goat still creekin' around?

28
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,537
Why doesn't somebody bury him?

29
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:08,499
No, I ain't been to California.

30
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,918
I don't intend to go either.

31
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,545
Supper will be ready
as soon as you wash up.

32
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,380
Let me take your coat.

33
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,185
Welcome home, Ethan.

34
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:31,480
Thanks, Aaron.

35
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:47,329
Marty, it's Uncle Ethan!

36
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:48,914
Debbie, sit down.

37
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,169
Good evening, Uncle Ethan.

38
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:55,838
Welcome home, sir.

39
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,466
It's Martin. Martin Pawley.

40
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,971
I'm sorry for bein' late, Aunt Martha.

41
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,060
Uncle Aaron.

42
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:17,609
A fella could mistake you for a half-breed.

43
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:21,905
Not quite, I'm an eighth Cherokee
and the rest Welsh and English.

44
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:24,366
Least that's what they tell me.

45
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,534
Go on, son.

46
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:28,537
It was Ethan who found you
squallin' under a sage clump...

47
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,581
...after your folks had been massacred.

48
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:34,168
It just happened to be me.
No need to make more of it.

49
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,009
Thank you, Lucy.

50
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,284
Good night, Aunt Martha.

51
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,245
Good night, Martin.

52
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:13,081
Uncle Aaron.
Good night, Martin.

53
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:15,334
Good night, Uncle Ethan.

54
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:16,627
Good night.

55
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,963
Good night, Ma. 'Night, Pa.

56
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:22,382
Uncle Ethan, will you tell us
about the war?

57
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:24,510
The war ended
three years ago, boy.

58
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:27,387
It did? So why didn't you come home
before now?

59
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,932
Ben, go on with Martin. March!

60
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:40,275
Lucy's wearing the gold locket
you gave her when she was a little girl.

61
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:43,779
She doesn't wear it much
on account of it makes her neck green.

62
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,155
Deborah!

63
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,573
Well, it does!

64
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:50,035
But, I wouldn't care
if you gave me a gold locket...

65
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,412
...if it made my neck green or not.

66
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:56,041
A gold locket!
Lucy, where are my saddlebags?

67
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:18,355
Look at my gold locket!

68
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,482
Oh, it is pretty.

69
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:25,529
Ethan, I think she's too young...
Oh, let her have it.

70
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:27,656
It doesn't amount to much.

71
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,033
To bed, young lady!
Yes, Daddy.

72
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,878
I passed the Todd place comin' in.
What happened?

73
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,631
He gave up, quit,
went back to chopping cotton.

74
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,592
So did the Jamisons.

75
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,511
Without Martha...

76
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:53,765
She just wouldn't let a man quit.

77
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:57,019
Ethan, I saw it in you before the war.

78
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,396
You wanted to clear out.

79
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,107
You stayed beyond any real reason. Why?

80
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,194
Are you asking me
to clear out now?

81
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:06,987
You're my brother, Ethan.

82
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,740
You're welcome to stay here
as long as you have a mind to.

83
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,033
Ain't that right, Martha?

84
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:14,328
Of course, it is.
I expect to pay my way.

85
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:16,997
There are 60 double eagles in there.

86
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:20,417
And twice that much here. Yankee dollars.

87
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:25,589
That's fresh minted.

88
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,508
There ain't a mark on it.

89
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:28,675
So?

90
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:24,898
Open up! It's Sam Clayton.

91
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:27,234
Aaron!

92
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:36,869
Reverend, come on in!

93
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:41,081
Good morning, Sister Edwards.
Good morning!

94
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,500
What is it, Reverend?

95
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:46,336
Lars just said somebody
busted into his corral last night...

96
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,213
...and ran off with his best cows.

97
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:50,883
Yeah, next time I'll raise pigs, by golly!

98
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:53,927
You never hear of anyone runnin' off pigs,
I bet you!

99
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:57,306
Bumblebees, by golly!
Coffee'll be just fine, Sister.

100
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:58,849
Good morning, Lucy.

101
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,601
Debbie, you been baptized yet?

102
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:02,978
No, I haven't.
Aaron, get Martin.

103
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,022
Martin!

104
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:09,610
I can sure use that coffee.
Pass the sugar, son.

105
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,531
Wait a minute, Sister.
I didn't get any coffee yet.

106
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:18,535
Just hold on a second, Sister.
I'm sure fond of them doughnuts.

107
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:22,164
Aaron! Martin! Come on up here.

108
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:24,041
Come on.

109
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,543
Raise your right hand. Martin?
Yes, sir.

110
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:28,170
Raise your right hand.

111
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:32,174
You're hereby voluntary privates
in Company A of the Texas Rangers...

112
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:36,011
...and you will faithfully discharge...
Can I go with you?

113
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:39,223
Quiet! Where was I?
Faithfully fulfill.

114
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:41,308
You will faithfully discharge your...

115
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,601
Mrs. Edwards?

116
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,144
Shut up!

117
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,981
You will faithfully discharge your duties,
as such...

118
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:51,068
...without a recompense
or monetary consideration.

119
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:54,154
Amen. That means no pay.
Better get a shirt on, Aaron.

120
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:57,241
I ain't goin' volunteering
till I've had my coffee. Drink your own.

121
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,825
Just call me "Captain."

122
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:01,995
Captain.
The Reverend Samuel Johnson Clayton!

123
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:03,956
Mighty impressive.

124
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,544
Well...the "Prodigal Brother"!

125
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:12,339
When did you get back?
I ain't seen you since the surrender.

126
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,342
Come to think of it,
I didn't see you at the surrender.

127
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,761
I don't believe in surrenders.

128
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,264
I still got my saber, Reverend.

129
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,850
Didn't turn it into no plowshare neither.

130
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,269
The Indians did it, Mrs. Edwards.

131
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:28,397
Caddos or Kiowas.
Old Mose knows. Yes, sir.

132
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:31,233
-Oh, shut up, Mose.
-Thank you.

133
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:35,362
I'm countin' on you
to look after things while I'm gone.

134
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:39,032
-You're not goin'.
-He is going. I already swore him in.

135
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:42,244
Swear him out! I'll go.
I don't think I should...

136
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:43,745
Stay close, Aaron.

137
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:46,498
It might be, this is rustlers.

138
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:49,585
Might be this dodderin' ol' idiot
ain't so far wrong.

139
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:51,086
Could be Comanches.

140
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,881
Kind words, Ethan. Thank you kindly.

141
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,592
Children, go with Lucy.

142
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,427
Oh, Mom...
Ben!

143
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:02,556
All right. I'll swear you in.

144
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:05,058
No need to. It wouldn't be legal anyway.

145
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:08,020
Why not? You wanted for a crime, Ethan?

146
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,315
Coffee, Ethan.

147
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:13,066
Thank you, Martha.

148
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:16,945
Are you asking me as a captain
or a preacher, Sam?

149
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,241
I'm asking you as a ranger
of the sovereign state of Texas.

150
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:22,618
You got a warrant?

151
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,912
You fit a lot of descriptions.

152
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:28,499
I figure a man's only good
for one oath at a time.

153
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:32,252
I took mine
to the Confederate States of America.

154
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,880
So did you, Sam.

155
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,424
Stay close, Aaron.

156
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,136
Thank you, Mrs. Edwards.
We have to be going.

157
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,930
Thank you, Mrs. Edwards.

158
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:46,600
Grateful to the hospitality
of your rocking chair, ma'am.

159
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,112
"Brad and Lucy,
Lucy and Brad

160
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:00,906
"Brad and Lucy, Lucy and Brad"

161
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:03,867
Debbie and Ben Edwards,
I'm gonna tell Ma on you!

162
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:52,059
Uncle Ethan!

163
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:56,355
Somethin' mighty fishy
about this trail, Uncle Ethan.

164
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,441
Don't call me "Uncle." I ain't your uncle.

165
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:01,109
Yes, sir.

166
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:03,904
No need to call me "sir" either.

167
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:08,450
Nor "grandpa," nor "Methuselah."
I can whip you to a frazzle.

168
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:11,578
What do you want me to call you?

169
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:15,749
My name is Ethan. Now what's
so mighty fishy about this trail?

170
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:19,336
Well, first...
Look! Look! Brad!

171
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:36,603
Pa!

172
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:39,273
Reverend!

173
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:42,526
Look!

174
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,209
Caddos or Kiowas, huh?

175
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:05,007
Ain't but one tribe
uses a lance like that.

176
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:08,552
Hey, Pa, your prize bull.
Killed every one of them!

177
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:13,807
And not for food either.
Why'd they do a thing like that?

178
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:16,518
Stealing the cattle was just to pull us out.

179
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,562
This is a murder raid.

180
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:22,608
Shapes up to burn down either your place,
or my brother's.

181
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:25,068
Mama! Laurie!

182
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:28,447
Oh, please, God! Please, no!

183
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:31,241
Brad! Brad! Son!

184
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:36,788
Jorgensen's place is the closest, Ethan.

185
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:39,917
If they're not there,
we'll come straight on to you.

186
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,961
You do that.

187
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:45,756
Well, are you coming,
or ain't you?

188
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,385
That farm's 40 miles from here,
boy. And these horses need rest and grain.

189
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:04,107
Ain't Caddos. Ain't Kiowas.

190
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,788
Break out the grain.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

191
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:47,609
Quiet, boy.

192
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:20,434
I'll see if I can shoot a couple of sage hens
before supper.

193
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:22,811
Yes, you do that, Aaron.

194
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:31,195
Ma, the days are getting shorter.

195
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:33,363
Lucy, we don't need a lamp yet.

196
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:36,700
Let's just enjoy the dusk.

197
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:50,172
It's all right, Ma,
I've been watching. Only...

198
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,133
-What, Ben?
-I wish Uncle Ethan was here.

199
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,551
Don't you, Ma?

200
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:10,734
Close that shutter, Ben, like a good boy.

201
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:26,667
Ma...I can't...
Lucy!

202
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:50,482
We're gonna play
the "sleep-out" game. Remember?

203
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:51,775
Where you hide out with Grandma?

204
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:53,527
Where she is buried?

205
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,572
And you creep along the ditch
very quietly, like...

206
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:58,407
Like a little mouse.

207
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,409
Hurry up!
The moon's fixin' to rise!

208
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:04,121
You won't make a sound or come back,
no matter what you hear!

209
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:06,456
-Promise?
-I promise.

210
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:12,045
Wait. Can't I have my doll?
There's no time. There's no time.

211
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:14,256
Here she is, baby.

212
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:20,637
Now, down low. Run!

213
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:23,265
Baby!

214
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:37,529
Chris, go back. Go back, Chris! Go back!

215
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:16,318
Uncle Ethan!

216
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,448
Wait a minute, Uncle Ethan.

217
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:24,326
Next time you'll mind your Uncle Ethan.

218
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:26,453
Thank you kindly...

219
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:29,206
Wait, Mose!
We can ride double, Mose!

220
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:10,164
Martha! Martha!

221
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:52,831
Aunt Martha!

222
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:55,459
Aunt Martha!

223
00:22:57,711 --> 00:22:58,879
Let me in.

224
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:02,007
Don't go in there, boy.
I know she's in there!

225
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,300
Don't go in!

226
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,764
Don't let him look in there, Mose.

227
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:11,099
It won't do him any good.

228
00:23:15,646 --> 00:23:17,564
Lucy! Debbie!

229
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:58,564
Put an "Amen" to it!
I'm not finished yet.

230
00:23:58,647 --> 00:24:01,066
There's no more time for praying.
Amen!

231
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:03,026
Brad! Martin!

232
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:05,153
Amen.

233
00:24:27,593 --> 00:24:30,804
Those girls mean as much to me
as though they were my own.

234
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:34,349
Maybe you don't know that my Brad
has been keeping company with Lucy.

235
00:24:34,433 --> 00:24:37,561
I'd be obliged
if you'd come to the point, ma'am.

236
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:39,646
It's just that I know
Martha would want you...

237
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:42,065
...to take care of her boys,
as well as her girls.

238
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:46,737
If the girls are dead, don't let
the boys waste their lives in vengeance.

239
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:49,990
Promise me, Ethan!

240
00:24:50,574 --> 00:24:52,743
Come on, if you're going with us!

241
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:20,229
Captain!

242
00:25:20,312 --> 00:25:22,147
Captain Clayton!

243
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:48,340
Another one, huh?
Give me a hand, Charlie.

244
00:25:58,892 --> 00:26:01,603
This one came a long way
before he died, Captain.

245
00:26:01,687 --> 00:26:05,774
Well, Ethan, there's another one
you can score up for your brother.

246
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:10,028
I don't like it!
What don't you like?

247
00:26:10,112 --> 00:26:12,739
Indians on a raid generally hide their dead.

248
00:26:12,865 --> 00:26:15,325
If they don't care anything
about us knowin'...

249
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:17,369
...it only spells one thing

250
00:26:17,578 --> 00:26:21,498
They ain't afraid of us following,
or of us catchin' up with them either.

251
00:26:21,582 --> 00:26:24,501
You can back out
any time you want, Nesby.

252
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:29,214
Ethan, I didn't say that!
I didn't say such!

253
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:31,633
Easy, Nesby, easy.

254
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:37,472
Jorgensen!

255
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:40,601
Why don't you finish the job?

256
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:51,403
What good did that do you?

257
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:55,157
By what you preach, none.
But what that Comanche believes...

258
00:26:55,741 --> 00:26:58,076
...ain't got no eyes,
he can't enter the Spirit Land.

259
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,662
Has to wander forever between the winds.

260
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:03,832
You get it, Reverend.
Come on, Blankethead!

261
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:13,217
All right, boys. Let's mount up.

262
00:27:24,436 --> 00:27:27,981
They're camped by the river,
about 20 miles from here.

263
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:34,530
We'll wait till dark, then circle out
so we can jump 'em before daylight.

264
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:38,534
You're sure you want to jump 'em, Ethan?

265
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:43,038
That's what we came for, ain't it?

266
00:27:43,121 --> 00:27:46,625
I thought we were tryin'
to get them girls out...alive.

267
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:51,004
If we jump them Comanches,
they'll kill 'em. You know that.

268
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:53,507
What are we doing then, Reverend?

269
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:55,467
What are we supposed to do, Ethan?

270
00:27:55,551 --> 00:27:59,513
Well, what I had in mind was
maybe runnin' off their pony herd.

271
00:28:00,514 --> 00:28:03,350
A Comanche on foot
is more apt to be willin' to listen.

272
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:05,519
I think the Reverend's right.
Don't you?

273
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:07,855
You think the Reverend's...

274
00:28:08,272 --> 00:28:12,609
What does a quarter-breed Cherokee
know about the old Comanche trick...

275
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:16,822
...of sleepin' with his best pony
tied right by his side?

276
00:28:17,322 --> 00:28:20,576
You've got about as much chance
of stampeding that herd as...

277
00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:24,371
As you have of finding them girls alive
by raidin' into 'em!

278
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:28,000
I say we do it my way.
And that's an order!

279
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,835
Yes, sir.

280
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:32,296
But if you're wrong...

281
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,382
...don't ever give me another!

282
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:19,051
Well, they were here.

283
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:21,053
Sure. They were here.

284
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,681
And now they're out there,
waiting to jump us.

285
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:27,643
Any more orders, "Captain"?

286
00:29:28,227 --> 00:29:30,270
Yes. We'll keep on going.

287
00:29:41,657 --> 00:29:42,699
Well?

288
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,160
You want to quit, Ethan?

289
00:29:45,786 --> 00:29:47,538
That'll be the day!

290
00:29:48,914 --> 00:29:50,582
-Horses!
-Horses!

291
00:30:03,053 --> 00:30:04,555
Keep on going.

292
00:30:49,141 --> 00:30:51,268
Keep moving! Keep moving!

293
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:29,890
Well, Reverend, it looks like
you got yourself surrounded.

294
00:31:30,557 --> 00:31:33,435
Yeah, and I figure
I can get myself un-surrounded.

295
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,896
Mose, how far is the river?

296
00:31:37,272 --> 00:31:40,567
I've been baptized, Reverend.
I've been baptized.

297
00:31:41,652 --> 00:31:44,863
-Shut up, you fool.
-Thank you, kindly. Thank you.

298
00:31:45,572 --> 00:31:48,116
You'd better get yourself set
for another one...

299
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,120
...because when I holler,
I want you to move out in a hurry!

300
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,878
Let's go!

301
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:44,631
I'm gonna tell 'em, Ethan.
Let's tell 'em!

302
00:32:45,924 --> 00:32:49,011
Take it easy, Nesby.
You'll be all right, Nesby.

303
00:32:49,094 --> 00:32:50,679
Come on!

304
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:22,920
Here is my Bible. Hold it.
It'll make you feel good.

305
00:33:25,339 --> 00:33:27,549
Thank you, Reverend.
Thank you very kindly.

306
00:33:32,346 --> 00:33:34,389
Do you think they'll charge us?

307
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:37,809
-Are you asking me?
-I am.

308
00:33:38,268 --> 00:33:39,895
Well, thank you.

309
00:33:40,354 --> 00:33:42,272
Yep. The Death Song.

310
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,776
The War Chief. He's got to, to save face.

311
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:50,405
Yes, sir. He'll be right in your lap
in a minute, sonny.

312
00:33:52,741 --> 00:33:56,578
For that which we're about to receive,
we thank Thee, O Lord.

313
00:34:36,577 --> 00:34:38,203
You got him, Marty!

314
00:34:54,303 --> 00:34:55,721
Hallelujah!

315
00:34:57,931 --> 00:34:59,308
Dang! Blast it!

316
00:35:00,058 --> 00:35:01,685
Watch it, it's loaded!

317
00:35:34,092 --> 00:35:36,512
Leave them to carry off their hurt
and dead.

318
00:35:36,595 --> 00:35:38,889
Well, Reverend, that does it!

319
00:35:39,264 --> 00:35:43,310
From now on, you stay out of this,
all of you! I don't want you with me.

320
00:35:44,102 --> 00:35:46,897
I don't need you
for what I've gotta do!

321
00:35:57,658 --> 00:36:00,285
Well, Edwards, I guess you're right.

322
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,871
We gotta get Nesby back.

323
00:36:03,372 --> 00:36:05,415
This is a job for a whole company
of rangers...

324
00:36:05,499 --> 00:36:07,751
...or it's a job for one or two men.

325
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,963
Right now, we're too many
and not enough.

326
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,841
Me, I'm going on alone.

327
00:36:15,676 --> 00:36:17,010
Any objections?

328
00:36:17,177 --> 00:36:18,345
Good luck.

329
00:36:21,014 --> 00:36:24,810
There's only one way you can stop me
from looking for Lucy, mister...

330
00:36:24,893 --> 00:36:26,520
...and that's kill me!

331
00:36:27,187 --> 00:36:29,439
That's the way I feel, Uncle Ethan.

332
00:36:30,357 --> 00:36:31,817
Ethan. Sir.

333
00:36:32,943 --> 00:36:36,113
All right.
But I'm giving the orders, you hear?

334
00:36:36,238 --> 00:36:38,157
I'm givin' the orders...

335
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,243
...and you'll follow 'em
or we're splittin' up right here and now.

336
00:36:41,326 --> 00:36:42,786
Sure, Ethan.

337
00:36:43,579 --> 00:36:47,833
There's just one reason we're here, ain't it?
It's to find Debbie and Lucy.

338
00:36:52,504 --> 00:36:54,214
If they're still alive.

339
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,054
Mount up.

340
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:29,082
They gotta stop sometime.

341
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:32,753
If they're human men at all,
they gotta stop!

342
00:37:33,253 --> 00:37:36,798
No, a human rides a horse until it dies,
then he goes on afoot.

343
00:37:38,675 --> 00:37:43,055
A Comanche comes along, gets that
horse up, rides him 20 more miles...

344
00:37:44,181 --> 00:37:46,016
...and then he eats him.

345
00:37:46,725 --> 00:37:48,227
Easy on that!

346
00:37:49,144 --> 00:37:50,187
Sorry.

347
00:37:51,104 --> 00:37:53,815
We don't even know if Debbie
and Lucy are in this bunch.

348
00:37:53,899 --> 00:37:55,025
Maybe they split up.

349
00:37:55,108 --> 00:37:57,486
They're with 'em, all right.
If they're still alive.

350
00:37:57,569 --> 00:37:59,488
You've said that enough!

351
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,574
Maybe Lucy's dead.
Maybe they're both dead.

352
00:38:03,158 --> 00:38:06,495
But, if I hear that from you again,
I'll fight you, Mr. Edwards!

353
00:38:06,578 --> 00:38:08,372
That'll be the day!

354
00:38:14,711 --> 00:38:15,879
Spread out!

355
00:38:25,681 --> 00:38:27,432
Found a main trail, but...

356
00:38:28,183 --> 00:38:31,728
...four of them cut out here
and rode on up through that pass.

357
00:38:32,688 --> 00:38:35,148
How come they'd do that, Ethan?

358
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,318
I'll take a look. Keep after the others.

359
00:38:38,652 --> 00:38:40,237
If you want us to fire...

360
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,115
No, nor build bonfires, nor beat drums.

361
00:38:43,782 --> 00:38:45,826
I'll meet you on the far side.

362
00:38:47,035 --> 00:38:48,954
Move!

363
00:39:25,032 --> 00:39:27,409
Do you want some water, Ethan?

364
00:39:40,172 --> 00:39:42,007
The trail leads over there.

365
00:39:42,382 --> 00:39:43,967
Why'd they break off?

366
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:48,472
Was there water in that canyon?

367
00:39:48,764 --> 00:39:49,640
Huh?

368
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:52,935
No water.

369
00:39:54,436 --> 00:39:56,188
Are you all right, Ethan?

370
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,190
I'm all right.

371
00:40:03,737 --> 00:40:06,740
What happened to your coat?
Did you lose it?

372
00:40:07,908 --> 00:40:09,368
I must have.

373
00:40:10,244 --> 00:40:12,246
But I'm not going back for it!

374
00:40:31,682 --> 00:40:33,851
I found 'em! I found Lucy!

375
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:40,524
They're camped a half-mile over. I was
swinging back and I saw their smoke.

376
00:40:40,816 --> 00:40:44,361
Bellied up a ridge,
and there they were, right below me.

377
00:40:44,945 --> 00:40:46,446
Did you see Debbie?

378
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:51,493
No, but I saw Lucy all right.
She was wearing that blue dress...

379
00:40:51,743 --> 00:40:53,829
What you saw wasn't Lucy.

380
00:40:53,912 --> 00:40:55,164
Oh, but it was...

381
00:40:55,247 --> 00:40:57,082
What you saw was a buck...

382
00:40:57,166 --> 00:40:59,042
...wearin' Lucy's dress.

383
00:41:00,294 --> 00:41:02,713
I found Lucy back in the canyon.

384
00:41:04,548 --> 00:41:06,633
I wrapped her in my coat.

385
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,846
Buried her with my own hands.

386
00:41:11,847 --> 00:41:14,600
I thought it best
to keep it from you.

387
00:41:17,477 --> 00:41:18,854
Did they...

388
00:41:19,563 --> 00:41:20,731
Was she...?

389
00:41:20,814 --> 00:41:24,485
What do you want me to do?
Draw you a picture? Spell it out?

390
00:41:25,444 --> 00:41:29,323
Don't ever ask me! As long as you live,
don't ever ask me more!

391
00:41:54,389 --> 00:41:56,391
I'm awful sorry, Brad.

392
00:41:58,602 --> 00:42:00,229
Wait a minute!

393
00:42:02,689 --> 00:42:05,317
Get back here, Brad! Get back here!

394
00:42:57,286 --> 00:42:59,246
Why don't you say it?

395
00:43:00,289 --> 00:43:02,291
We're beaten, and you know it.

396
00:43:03,292 --> 00:43:04,376
No.

397
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:07,838
Our turnin' back don't mean nothin'.

398
00:43:08,755 --> 00:43:10,340
Not in the long run.

399
00:43:11,383 --> 00:43:14,803
If she's alive, she's safe.
For a while, they'll...

400
00:43:15,888 --> 00:43:19,433
...keep her and they'll raise her
as one of their own until...

401
00:43:20,225 --> 00:43:22,311
...she's of an age to...

402
00:43:24,438 --> 00:43:27,941
Do you think maybe there's a chance
we still might find her?

403
00:43:28,275 --> 00:43:32,029
An Indian will chase a thing
till he thinks he's chased it enough.

404
00:43:33,447 --> 00:43:34,823
Then he quits.

405
00:43:35,282 --> 00:43:36,992
Same way when he runs.

406
00:43:37,784 --> 00:43:40,954
Seems like he never learns
there's such a thing as...

407
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:44,082
...a critter who'll just keep coming on.

408
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:47,836
So we'll find 'em in the end. I promise you.

409
00:43:48,545 --> 00:43:50,005
We'll find 'em...

410
00:43:50,672 --> 00:43:53,675
...just as sure as the turnin' of the earth!

411
00:44:45,269 --> 00:44:47,396
Hi, Ethan.
Hello, sir.

412
00:44:48,939 --> 00:44:51,525
Hi, Marty.
How are you, sir?

413
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,738
Marty!

414
00:45:01,618 --> 00:45:04,371
You got my letter about your son, Brad?

415
00:45:04,913 --> 00:45:06,081
Yeah.

416
00:45:06,331 --> 00:45:08,625
Just about this time a year ago.

417
00:45:12,504 --> 00:45:14,673
Oh, Ethan, this country...

418
00:45:22,264 --> 00:45:23,182
Marty?

419
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:27,561
Martin Pawley!

420
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,696
Him? Probably forgotten all about you,
can't even call your name to mind!

421
00:45:38,447 --> 00:45:40,032
Her name is Laurie.

422
00:45:42,701 --> 00:45:45,329
But I fairly forgot just how pretty she was.

423
00:45:58,550 --> 00:45:59,676
Ethan.

424
00:46:00,886 --> 00:46:02,638
What about Debbie?

425
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:16,693
Hey, what are you doin' anyway?

426
00:46:18,946 --> 00:46:20,781
Don't go taking that stuff!

427
00:46:21,657 --> 00:46:23,700
Well, it ain't worth the mending.

428
00:46:23,784 --> 00:46:26,787
What are you gettin' so red in the face
about? I got brothers, ain't I?

429
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:28,956
Yeah, well, I ain't one of them.

430
00:46:29,331 --> 00:46:31,667
Look here, Martin Pawley, I'm a woman.

431
00:46:31,834 --> 00:46:34,920
We women wash and mend
your dirty clothes all your lives.

432
00:46:35,003 --> 00:46:36,922
When you're little, we even wash you!

433
00:46:37,005 --> 00:46:40,217
How you can ever make out to be bashful
in front of a woman, I'll never know.

434
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:43,136
You talk like a fella just
might as well run around naked.

435
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:45,430
It wouldn't bother me none.

436
00:46:47,724 --> 00:46:51,645
Sure wouldn't try it in front of Pa,
though, if I was you!

437
00:46:56,942 --> 00:47:00,362
"Oh, I got a gal prettier than you"

438
00:47:06,618 --> 00:47:10,998
We kept trackin' 'em till
the blizzards hit. Then we lost their trail.

439
00:47:12,291 --> 00:47:16,545
Don't need to tell you where we went
Fort Richardson, Wingate, Cobb...

440
00:47:19,715 --> 00:47:22,801
Trouble is, we don't know which band
the war party belonged to.

441
00:47:22,885 --> 00:47:25,137
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.

442
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:26,805
I got your boy killed.

443
00:47:27,181 --> 00:47:28,807
Don't go blamin' yourself for that.

444
00:47:28,891 --> 00:47:32,895
It's this country that killed my boy.
Yes, by golly, I tell you Ethan...

445
00:47:33,228 --> 00:47:36,440
Now, Lars, it just so happens
we'd be Texicans.

446
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:41,111
A Texican is nothing but a human man
way out on a limb.

447
00:47:41,195 --> 00:47:42,821
This year and next...

448
00:47:43,614 --> 00:47:47,284
Maybe for a hundred more.
But I don't think it will be forever.

449
00:47:48,202 --> 00:47:52,164
Some day this
country's gonna be a fine good place to be.

450
00:47:52,247 --> 00:47:56,001
Maybe it needs our bones in the ground
before that time can come.

451
00:47:56,502 --> 00:47:57,544
Bedtime.

452
00:47:58,462 --> 00:48:00,464
She was a schoolteacher.

453
00:48:01,465 --> 00:48:03,383
Ma, Marty's drawers is a sight.

454
00:48:03,467 --> 00:48:05,385
Would it be all right
if we give him some of Brad's things?

455
00:48:05,469 --> 00:48:07,221
Of course. They're in Grandma's chest.

456
00:48:07,304 --> 00:48:09,765
Ethan, you're going to sleep
in the bunkhouse.

457
00:48:09,848 --> 00:48:13,560
The letter! In the chest!
It came for you, Ethan, last winter.

458
00:48:13,769 --> 00:48:15,687
Charlie McCorry brought it.

459
00:48:18,232 --> 00:48:21,610
I'm looking for that letter,
Charlie MacCorry...

460
00:48:30,118 --> 00:48:32,538
Here it is. By golly, I forgot.

461
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,336
Excuse me.

462
00:48:51,473 --> 00:48:52,766
Mrs. Jorgensen.

463
00:48:54,017 --> 00:48:55,727
Take a look at this.

464
00:48:56,186 --> 00:48:57,229
Just a snip of calico.

465
00:48:57,312 --> 00:49:00,649
Ever see it before?
Maybe on a dress Debbie wore?

466
00:49:04,153 --> 00:49:06,029
Yes, it was an apron.

467
00:49:07,114 --> 00:49:08,866
Have they found her yet?

468
00:49:10,492 --> 00:49:11,618
Not yet.

469
00:49:15,622 --> 00:49:16,790
Not yet.

470
00:49:20,502 --> 00:49:22,504
You might at least have
left me my britches!

471
00:49:22,588 --> 00:49:25,048
It's time for bed anyway.
Here, try these on.

472
00:49:25,132 --> 00:49:26,341
I ain't gonna.

473
00:49:27,634 --> 00:49:30,095
Well, likely they'll need some takin' in.

474
00:49:30,179 --> 00:49:31,889
Marty, you're that gaunt.

475
00:49:32,472 --> 00:49:34,683
Ma's having turkey for dinner tomorrow.

476
00:49:34,766 --> 00:49:37,311
Laurie, come. Let the boys get to bed.

477
00:49:38,228 --> 00:49:39,897
All right, Pa.

478
00:49:45,152 --> 00:49:47,529
-Good night, Marty.
-Good night, Laurie.

479
00:49:48,071 --> 00:49:50,741
-'Night, Mr. Edwards.
-'Night, Ms. Jorgensen.

480
00:49:57,539 --> 00:50:00,375
Jorgensen's been runnin'
my cattle with his own.

481
00:50:01,668 --> 00:50:03,003
Your cattle?

482
00:50:03,837 --> 00:50:05,547
You mean Debbie's cattle.

483
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:10,511
He's agreed to take you on and split
the increase in my herd while I'm gone.

484
00:50:11,303 --> 00:50:13,013
I'm pushin' on tomorrow.

485
00:50:13,388 --> 00:50:15,724
Well, I sure ain't gonna stay here!

486
00:50:15,807 --> 00:50:18,185
I started out lookin' for Debbie,
I intend to keep on.

487
00:50:18,268 --> 00:50:19,019
Why?

488
00:50:19,102 --> 00:50:21,480
Why? Well, because she is my...

489
00:50:22,105 --> 00:50:25,317
She's your nothing!
She's no kin to you at all!

490
00:50:26,902 --> 00:50:29,029
I always kind of thought she was.

491
00:50:29,738 --> 00:50:31,907
The way her folks took me in
and raised me...

492
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:33,700
That don't make you no kin.

493
00:50:33,784 --> 00:50:36,995
All right, maybe it don't.
But I intend to keep on lookin' anyway.

494
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:38,205
How?

495
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:40,749
You got any horses, or money to buy 'em?

496
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:43,335
You ain't even got money for cartridges.

497
00:50:43,502 --> 00:50:46,505
Jorgensen's offerin' you
a good livin' here.

498
00:50:50,676 --> 00:50:52,594
Martin, I want you to know...

499
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:54,805
I know what you want me to know!

500
00:50:55,013 --> 00:50:57,516
I've got no kin, no money, no horses!

501
00:50:58,016 --> 00:51:01,186
All I got here is a bunch
of dead-man's clothes to wear!

502
00:51:01,895 --> 00:51:04,606
You told me that already,
so, shut your mouth!

503
00:51:17,411 --> 00:51:18,996
Mornin', Laurie.

504
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:21,331
Mornin', Marty. Did you sleep well?

505
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:23,500
Well, no.

506
00:51:24,626 --> 00:51:26,628
I kind of tossed and...

507
00:51:27,087 --> 00:51:29,006
...turned and dreamed.

508
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:45,397
I'll get your coffee.

509
00:51:47,774 --> 00:51:49,693
You know, Laurie, I...

510
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:53,864
...I was thinking maybe it's time
you and me started goin' steady, huh?

511
00:51:56,033 --> 00:51:59,620
You and me have been goin' steady
since we was three years old.

512
00:52:00,037 --> 00:52:02,956
-We have?
-About time you found out about it!

513
00:52:05,292 --> 00:52:08,086
Gosh, Laurie, I've always been fond
of you, but...

514
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:11,048
...with all this trouble
with Debbie and Ethan, I...

515
00:52:11,131 --> 00:52:12,883
Ethan rode on an hour ago.

516
00:52:14,176 --> 00:52:17,638
I don't know what you can do
about findin' Debbie that he can't.

517
00:52:17,721 --> 00:52:20,432
He'll find her now, Martin. Honest he will!

518
00:52:20,641 --> 00:52:24,061
That's what I'm afraid of, Laurie,
him finding her!

519
00:52:25,395 --> 00:52:28,273
I've seen his eyes
at the very word "Comanche."

520
00:52:29,525 --> 00:52:31,693
I've seen him take his knife and...

521
00:52:33,445 --> 00:52:35,155
Never mind. He's a man
that can go crazy wild!

522
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:38,325
And I intend to be there to stop him,
in case he does.

523
00:52:38,951 --> 00:52:42,496
I was hopin' I could hold you here,
but I guess I knew better.

524
00:52:45,749 --> 00:52:47,334
I stole that for you.

525
00:52:56,885 --> 00:52:58,554
"I...bought..."

526
00:52:59,471 --> 00:53:01,390
Here, let me read it for you.

527
00:53:03,183 --> 00:53:05,686
"I bought a small-sized dress
off of an Indian.

528
00:53:05,769 --> 00:53:09,398
"If this here's a piece of your child's dress,
bring the reward.

529
00:53:09,481 --> 00:53:12,151
"I know where they've gone.
Jerem Futterman."

530
00:53:12,442 --> 00:53:13,902
Jerem Futterman!

531
00:53:14,653 --> 00:53:18,157
He's got a small trading post
on the south fork of the Brazos.

532
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,868
Listen, I just gotta get me a horse!
Do you think your Pa...

533
00:53:20,951 --> 00:53:21,660
Finish your breakfast!

534
00:53:21,743 --> 00:53:23,328
I've got to find him!

535
00:53:24,413 --> 00:53:28,333
-All right, go on and find him!
-Oh, Laurie, don't you understand?

536
00:53:39,636 --> 00:53:41,680
But that's your own good horse!

537
00:53:41,972 --> 00:53:43,682
You take him and welcome!

538
00:53:43,974 --> 00:53:47,186
But don't you count on findin' me here
when you get back.

539
00:53:47,269 --> 00:53:49,938
I've been hanging around
this Godforsaken place...

540
00:53:50,022 --> 00:53:52,441
...for two long years waiting for you.

541
00:53:52,691 --> 00:53:54,860
I ain't cut out to be no old maid!

542
00:53:55,444 --> 00:53:59,072
I'm sorry, Laurie,
but I just gotta catch up with Ethan.

543
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:02,075
Well, go ahead and catch up with him!

544
00:54:19,551 --> 00:54:21,512
Futterman?
Yeah.

545
00:54:21,595 --> 00:54:23,055
Let's talk.

546
00:54:28,435 --> 00:54:30,312
You sent me a letter.

547
00:54:30,813 --> 00:54:31,897
Yeah?

548
00:54:32,314 --> 00:54:33,899
About a dress.

549
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:48,747
How'd you come by it?

550
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:52,042
-You said there was a $1,000 reward.
-That's what I said.

551
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:53,794
Got it with you?

552
00:54:54,169 --> 00:54:57,256
You'll get the reward when I find her,
and if she's still alive.

553
00:54:57,339 --> 00:54:59,508
A man's got a right to expect
some kind of payment.

554
00:54:59,591 --> 00:55:02,553
I laid out for that dress
and sendin' you that writing.

555
00:55:05,347 --> 00:55:06,515
Twenty Yankee dollars.

556
00:55:06,598 --> 00:55:08,684
A man's time is worth something.

557
00:55:09,518 --> 00:55:10,811
Talk.

558
00:55:13,856 --> 00:55:15,858
A young buck fetched it in
late last summer.

559
00:55:15,941 --> 00:55:18,569
Said it belonged to a captive child
of Chief Scar.

560
00:55:18,652 --> 00:55:19,695
Scar?

561
00:55:20,362 --> 00:55:22,030
We ain't never heard of him, have we?

562
00:55:22,114 --> 00:55:25,117
Me neither. But this buck claimed
he was a big war chief...

563
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,494
...with the Nawyecky Comanches.
Keep talkin'.

564
00:55:27,578 --> 00:55:31,456
Scar's band was headed north to winter
at Fort Wingate, eatin' agency beef.

565
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:34,084
That's what this buck said. Maybe he lied.

566
00:55:35,043 --> 00:55:36,295
Maybe you lie.

567
00:55:36,753 --> 00:55:39,339
In that case, my friend,
you won't find her...

568
00:55:39,423 --> 00:55:41,758
...and I won't get my $1,000 dollars.

569
00:55:43,218 --> 00:55:45,804
You can spend the night. Cards, a jug...

570
00:55:46,054 --> 00:55:47,347
No thanks.

571
00:55:49,349 --> 00:55:51,351
Don't forget to come back with my $1,000!

572
00:55:51,435 --> 00:55:53,228
It ain't yours yet!

573
00:55:55,481 --> 00:55:56,815
Hey, Ethan.

574
00:55:58,734 --> 00:56:02,196
Do you have a feeling
that maybe we're being followed?

575
00:56:02,279 --> 00:56:04,490
That's the Indian in you.
Go to sleep.

576
00:56:04,573 --> 00:56:07,701
Them horses there...
they're sure actin' mighty nervous.

577
00:56:07,784 --> 00:56:10,329
They smell a change
in the weather.

578
00:56:18,587 --> 00:56:21,757
Don't put any more wood
on the fire. I'm burning up.

579
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,343
We might get a frost
before mornin'.

580
00:56:24,426 --> 00:56:26,845
I'm getting to be like old Mose Harper.

581
00:56:27,596 --> 00:56:29,806
My bones are cold tonight.

582
00:56:32,684 --> 00:56:34,102
You know...

583
00:56:35,187 --> 00:56:39,316
...it's funny, but last winter when
we passed through Fort Wingate...

584
00:56:40,442 --> 00:56:44,363
...I didn't have any recollection of
a mention of Nawyecky Comanches.

585
00:56:44,905 --> 00:56:48,200
Not so funny when you recollect
what "Nawyecky" means.

586
00:56:48,283 --> 00:56:51,370
What's that?
Sort of like "roundabout."

587
00:56:51,453 --> 00:56:54,790
A man says he's goin' one place,
means to go to the other.

588
00:57:07,344 --> 00:57:11,265
Come on, Ethan. Don't put any more wood
on the fire! I'm burning up.

589
00:57:20,065 --> 00:57:21,191
Comfortable?

590
00:57:21,275 --> 00:57:23,110
Ethan, are you all right?

591
00:57:23,193 --> 00:57:26,989
I'm just saying good night to you.
Well, good night!

592
00:57:50,345 --> 00:57:51,763
Good night!

593
00:57:52,306 --> 00:57:53,807
Good night!

594
00:58:23,837 --> 00:58:25,255
Futterman!

595
00:58:40,521 --> 00:58:42,481
Thanks, you did fine.

596
00:58:45,984 --> 00:58:48,153
Why, that's Mr. Futterman!

597
00:58:48,654 --> 00:58:50,614
Ethan, what are you doin' anyway?

598
00:58:50,697 --> 00:58:54,034
I'm getting my money back, you idiot!
What do you suppose!

599
00:58:55,077 --> 00:58:56,495
We did all right.

600
00:59:00,833 --> 00:59:04,503
We? Why you just staked me out there,
like a piece of bait!

601
00:59:05,045 --> 00:59:09,049
You built up the fire. You fixed it
so I could get my brains blown out!

602
00:59:09,842 --> 00:59:11,552
What if you had missed?

603
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:14,221
It never occurred to me.

604
00:59:17,558 --> 00:59:19,518
Let's get out of here.

605
00:59:28,652 --> 00:59:30,529
Howdy, Mr. Jorgensen.

606
00:59:31,446 --> 00:59:33,824
-Charlie!
-Got me a letter here.

607
00:59:35,075 --> 00:59:36,869
By golly, a letter?

608
00:59:38,078 --> 00:59:39,705
It's for Ms. Laurie.

609
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:42,666
Two letters in one year! By golly!

610
00:59:43,625 --> 00:59:46,211
Mama! Mama! It's Charlie McCorry.

611
00:59:46,962 --> 00:59:50,549
He's come with a letter.
He's come a courtin' too, by golly!

612
00:59:54,636 --> 00:59:56,263
Good morning, Charlie.

613
00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:00,017
Laurie, here's a letter for you.
Charlie brought it.

614
01:00:00,392 --> 01:00:04,146
I figured it might be the news
you've been waiting for, so l...

615
01:00:04,229 --> 01:00:05,856
-Thank you, Charlie.
-You're welcome.

616
01:00:05,939 --> 01:00:08,609
Say, I brought you
some boiled sweets.

617
01:00:08,692 --> 01:00:09,985
Why, thank you, Charlie!

618
01:00:10,068 --> 01:00:13,238
Let's sit down
while Laurie reads the letter.

619
01:00:13,322 --> 01:00:16,074
I reckon,
I really ought to be going...

620
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,076
No. You'll stay, Charlie.

621
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:22,623
After all, Charlie brought the letter.
He's got a right to listen too.

622
01:00:24,166 --> 01:00:26,668
MRS. JORGENSEN:
Come on, read the letter.

623
01:00:27,669 --> 01:00:29,171
But, Ma, it's my letter!

624
01:00:29,254 --> 01:00:31,882
Why, sure, but...
Go ahead. Read it.

625
01:00:41,558 --> 01:00:43,268
Please.

626
01:00:44,478 --> 01:00:46,188
"Dear Ms. Laury..."

627
01:00:46,396 --> 01:00:49,274
He spelled it with a "y" instead of an "ie."
You'd think he'd know better.

628
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:53,445
Oh, spelling...please!
What's the difference? Read the letter!

629
01:00:55,739 --> 01:00:59,535
"Dear Ms. Laury: I take pencil in hand
to let you know...

630
01:01:00,786 --> 01:01:04,832
"...Ethan and me are still trying
to catch up with them Comanches...

631
01:01:04,957 --> 01:01:07,584
"...the late Mr. Futterman told us about."

632
01:01:08,919 --> 01:01:10,337
The "late" Mr. Futterman?

633
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:13,006
That means Mr. Futterman is dead,
by golly.

634
01:01:13,382 --> 01:01:15,634
Oh, the poor man! Go ahead, Laurie.

635
01:01:17,761 --> 01:01:20,556
"We cut north through Indian territory..."

636
01:01:21,306 --> 01:01:23,475
"...and did not have no trouble..."

637
01:01:24,309 --> 01:01:26,812
"...finding Kiowas and Wichitas..."

638
01:01:27,437 --> 01:01:29,523
"...and even some Comanches..."

639
01:01:30,065 --> 01:01:32,359
"...camped by one of the agencies."

640
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,696
"But none of them was Nawyeckies..."

641
01:01:35,988 --> 01:01:39,241
"...nor claimed to know
a war chief called Scar."

642
01:01:40,868 --> 01:01:41,910
Scar?

643
01:01:44,872 --> 01:01:48,375
"He's the one the late Mr. Futterman said
had Debbie.

644
01:01:51,712 --> 01:01:53,839
"At one of the agencies..."

645
01:01:54,381 --> 01:01:57,676
"...we outfitted with all kinds of
trade goods...

646
01:01:58,552 --> 01:02:02,472
"...figuring that'd make it easier
for us to come and go...

647
01:02:06,435 --> 01:02:08,729
"You'd laugh if I told you..."

648
01:02:09,229 --> 01:02:11,773
"...what was our biggest seller. "

649
01:03:02,115 --> 01:03:04,827
Let's go. I think I stumbled
onto something.

650
01:03:04,910 --> 01:03:05,911
Scar...you found him?

651
01:03:05,994 --> 01:03:08,455
When are you gonna learn
to keep your big mouth shut?

652
01:03:08,539 --> 01:03:10,249
Get your horse, and let's get out of here!

653
01:03:10,332 --> 01:03:13,377
-I just bought me a good blanket.
-Forget it. Move!

654
01:03:19,132 --> 01:03:21,760
I heard that a band of hostile Comanches...

655
01:03:23,011 --> 01:03:25,222
...came through less than a week ago.

656
01:03:25,305 --> 01:03:27,808
I asked if a white girl was with them.

657
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,727
They got sullen and suspicious.

658
01:03:31,436 --> 01:03:34,189
-You think it might have been...
-I don't know!

659
01:03:39,361 --> 01:03:41,613
What's she following us for?

660
01:03:43,198 --> 01:03:45,826
Hey, you! You go on back now!

661
01:03:45,993 --> 01:03:47,077
Go on!

662
01:03:47,494 --> 01:03:50,497
Look, I changed my mind.
You can keep your blanket.

663
01:03:55,085 --> 01:03:57,921
Look, you don't understand.
I don't want it!

664
01:03:58,338 --> 01:04:00,966
You don't understand, you chunkhead!

665
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:04,511
You didn't buy any blanket,
you bought her!

666
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:08,140
You got yourself a wife, sonny!

667
01:04:08,432 --> 01:04:11,059
Oh, no! Ethan, tell her to go back!

668
01:04:11,477 --> 01:04:14,688
What? And have her whole family
after our scalps...

669
01:04:14,855 --> 01:04:18,192
...for flauntin' one of their womenfolk?
No, sir!

670
01:04:18,901 --> 01:04:21,111
Come on, Mrs. Pawley.

671
01:04:21,195 --> 01:04:22,779
Come on, Mrs. Pawley.

672
01:04:22,946 --> 01:04:24,823
Join our merry group.

673
01:04:25,032 --> 01:04:26,575
Mrs. Pawley?

674
01:04:31,121 --> 01:04:34,291
"There is one other thing I got to tell you..."

675
01:04:35,042 --> 01:04:37,586
"...before you hear it from Ethan."

676
01:04:39,546 --> 01:04:41,381
"How I got myself..."

677
01:04:43,008 --> 01:04:44,343
"...a wife..."

678
01:04:45,594 --> 01:04:46,803
He did?

679
01:04:47,012 --> 01:04:48,180
Good!

680
01:04:48,722 --> 01:04:52,100
A young man should get married
early in life. Right, Mama?

681
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,857
Go ahead and read the letter, Laurie.

682
01:05:02,236 --> 01:05:04,404
"A little Comanche squaw..."

683
01:05:07,991 --> 01:05:09,201
Squaw!

684
01:05:13,413 --> 01:05:17,125
Laurie, you come back
and read the letter, please!

685
01:05:17,209 --> 01:05:19,211
Come back and read it, please!

686
01:05:21,213 --> 01:05:23,632
Mama, here, you read the letter.

687
01:05:25,717 --> 01:05:28,720
My wife was a schoolteacher.
She reads good.

688
01:05:31,765 --> 01:05:33,016
I'll read it.

689
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:35,727
So he married a Comanche squaw.

690
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:46,864
"She wasn't near..."

691
01:05:48,407 --> 01:05:50,242
"...as old as you..."

692
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:53,829
How old does he think I am?

693
01:05:56,165 --> 01:05:58,667
Hey, look! Coffee. Me. Coffee.

694
01:06:05,924 --> 01:06:08,510
Could I have a little, Mrs. Pawley?

695
01:06:13,515 --> 01:06:17,394
Looks like Mrs. Pawley's
gonna make you a fine, dutiful wife.

696
01:06:17,603 --> 01:06:19,771
Oh, cut it out, will you?

697
01:06:22,774 --> 01:06:24,193
Oh, look...

698
01:06:24,818 --> 01:06:27,613
...I sure wish I could make you understand.

699
01:06:30,115 --> 01:06:31,074
Look?

700
01:06:37,706 --> 01:06:41,376
She says her name is
Wild Goose Flying in The Night Sky.

701
01:06:42,836 --> 01:06:46,131
But she'll answer to "Look,"
if that pleases you.

702
01:07:19,581 --> 01:07:22,209
That's grounds for divorce in Texas!

703
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:26,964
You're really rough!

704
01:07:27,089 --> 01:07:29,675
Well, I don't think it's a dead-bird funny!

705
01:07:30,759 --> 01:07:35,013
Look, if you really wanna do some good,
why don't you ask her where Scar is?

706
01:07:40,602 --> 01:07:42,312
She heard you.

707
01:07:47,568 --> 01:07:49,570
Scar.
Scar?

708
01:07:50,028 --> 01:07:52,447
You ask her!
Scar?

709
01:07:53,282 --> 01:07:57,327
Do you know where he went?
Did he have a girl with him? A white girl?

710
01:08:03,834 --> 01:08:05,627
No, not a woman. It's...

711
01:08:08,338 --> 01:08:09,339
Sister!

712
01:08:24,771 --> 01:08:25,939
Martin!

713
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:37,493
Look's gone!

714
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:40,329
Pulled out in the night.

715
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:46,668
She ain't goin' back to her family.
That's for certain.

716
01:08:46,752 --> 01:08:49,379
She took off the way
that arrow is pointing.

717
01:08:51,215 --> 01:08:52,591
Think maybe we ought to follow her?

718
01:08:52,674 --> 01:08:55,302
How should I know? She's your wife.

719
01:08:59,848 --> 01:09:02,184
"Maybe she left other signs
for us to follow but...

720
01:09:02,267 --> 01:09:03,977
"...we'll never know..."

721
01:09:04,102 --> 01:09:07,231
"...because it snowed
that day and all the next week."

722
01:09:11,485 --> 01:09:14,238
We were headin' north
through buff alo country...

723
01:09:14,321 --> 01:09:18,075
...when somethin' happened that
I ain't got straight in my own mind yet.

724
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:20,661
On this day we sighted a small herd.

725
01:09:20,994 --> 01:09:23,372
We needed meat, so we circled around...

726
01:09:23,664 --> 01:09:25,332
...and came up on them on foot.

727
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,246
That don't make no sense!

728
01:10:04,329 --> 01:10:07,249
Hunger! Empty bellies! That's the sense!

729
01:10:08,125 --> 01:10:09,418
Ethan, stop it!

730
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:22,097
At least they won't feed
any Comanches this winter!

731
01:10:24,099 --> 01:10:25,476
Listen! Listen!

732
01:11:33,085 --> 01:11:35,712
It was the Nawyecky
Comanches, all right.

733
01:11:35,796 --> 01:11:38,549
The ones we'd been looking for
all this time.

734
01:11:50,602 --> 01:11:51,812
Marty!

735
01:12:11,582 --> 01:12:12,958
It's Look.

736
01:12:14,543 --> 01:12:16,211
Look?

737
01:12:17,921 --> 01:12:19,923
What did them soldiers have
to go and kill her for?

738
01:12:20,007 --> 01:12:21,550
She never done nobody any harm.

739
01:12:21,633 --> 01:12:24,469
We've got to catch up with them,
maybe they've got Debbie with them!

740
01:12:24,553 --> 01:12:27,639
Maybe they've got that chief they call Scar.

741
01:12:28,557 --> 01:12:31,310
So, we figured Debbie'd been
in the village.

742
01:12:31,393 --> 01:12:33,854
What Look was doin' there...
whether she'd come to warn 'em...

743
01:12:33,937 --> 01:12:36,231
...or maybe to find Debbie for me...

744
01:12:36,523 --> 01:12:38,484
...there's no way of knowing.

745
01:13:22,653 --> 01:13:25,072
Come on, move along! Come on!

746
01:13:41,129 --> 01:13:43,298
Come on, hurry up.

747
01:13:48,178 --> 01:13:49,179
Yes?

748
01:13:49,263 --> 01:13:51,807
We're looking for a girl.
A white girl. A captive.

749
01:13:51,890 --> 01:13:53,851
Should be about 14 now.

750
01:13:54,101 --> 01:13:56,478
Fourteen? We have two about that age.

751
01:13:57,479 --> 01:14:00,440
-All the white women are in the chapel.
-What's this girl to you?

752
01:14:00,524 --> 01:14:03,026
She's my...
She's my niece.

753
01:14:04,403 --> 01:14:05,571
One moment.

754
01:14:08,574 --> 01:14:10,659
White women?
Yes, sir.

755
01:14:37,019 --> 01:14:38,604
Will you stand up?

756
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:40,939
Stand up, please.

757
01:14:46,528 --> 01:14:47,863
Debbie?

758
01:15:04,213 --> 01:15:06,840
It's hard to believe they're white.

759
01:15:07,049 --> 01:15:08,759
They ain't white!

760
01:15:09,092 --> 01:15:11,637
Not any more. They are Comanches!

761
01:15:12,805 --> 01:15:14,598
Where are your casualties?

762
01:15:34,201 --> 01:15:37,955
Maybe you can help us
identify them. All white. All captives.

763
01:15:38,038 --> 01:15:39,998
There's the white girl there.

764
01:15:50,425 --> 01:15:51,677
No.

765
01:15:55,305 --> 01:15:59,309
"So we're setting out for New Mexico
territory in the morning.

766
01:16:01,728 --> 01:16:05,566
"I am sorry I won't be back
for Christmas again this year.

767
01:16:11,113 --> 01:16:14,783
"I set pencil aside and hope
you are enjoying good health.

768
01:16:14,908 --> 01:16:16,660
"And your folks the same."

769
01:16:17,369 --> 01:16:19,496
"I remain, respectfully..."

770
01:16:20,998 --> 01:16:23,125
"...yours truly, Martin Pawley."

771
01:16:24,710 --> 01:16:27,004
They'll never find that girl.

772
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:31,300
Never!

773
01:16:39,683 --> 01:16:41,185
"Yours truly."

774
01:16:45,063 --> 01:16:47,649
He had to sign his whole name,
"Martin Pawley."

775
01:16:47,733 --> 01:16:49,776
He couldn't write just "Marty"!

776
01:16:51,862 --> 01:16:55,032
-I don't care if he never comes back!
-Laurie! Laurie!

777
01:16:55,616 --> 01:16:59,161
Charlie, you stay for supper.
I won't take "no" for an answer.

778
01:16:59,411 --> 01:17:03,332
The thought of saying "no"
never entered my head, Mrs. Jorgensen.

779
01:17:04,625 --> 01:17:07,628
Ain't no place I'd rather be
than right here...

780
01:17:08,378 --> 01:17:09,630
...right now.

781
01:17:12,007 --> 01:17:14,176
"Gone again, skip to my Lou"

782
01:17:17,012 --> 01:17:19,181
"Gone again, skip to my Lou"

783
01:17:22,184 --> 01:17:24,353
"Gone again, skip to my Lou"

784
01:17:27,064 --> 01:17:29,358
"Skip to my Lou, my darling"

785
01:17:53,882 --> 01:17:55,425
-Recognize it?
-That?

786
01:17:56,635 --> 01:17:59,304
Couldn't be two like that
in the whole world!

787
01:18:00,889 --> 01:18:02,141
Mose Harper!

788
01:18:08,856 --> 01:18:11,024
Mose, you look shabbier than ever!

789
01:18:11,108 --> 01:18:12,860
How about a drink?

790
01:18:15,154 --> 01:18:18,157
Ain't been too good.
No, sir. Not too good.

791
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:21,160
-Getting old.
-You were born old.

792
01:18:21,743 --> 01:18:25,038
Been helpin' you, Ethan.
Been lookin' all the time.

793
01:18:25,164 --> 01:18:27,166
The reward still stands.

794
01:18:29,418 --> 01:18:32,421
Don't want no money, Ethan.
No money, Marty.

795
01:18:33,505 --> 01:18:36,008
Just a roof over old Mose's head.

796
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:40,679
And a rocking chair by the fire.

797
01:18:40,971 --> 01:18:43,640
My own rocking chair by the fire, Marty.

798
01:18:44,850 --> 01:18:48,061
You help us find the girl
and you've got your rocking chair.

799
01:18:48,145 --> 01:18:50,105
Swear it, Ethan? Given word?

800
01:18:50,314 --> 01:18:52,065
I told you, didn't I?

801
01:18:53,233 --> 01:18:55,861
Ethan, I found a man who's seen her.

802
01:18:56,737 --> 01:18:58,947
He knows where little Debbie is!

803
01:18:59,281 --> 01:19:01,408
Where is he? Who is this man?

804
01:19:01,825 --> 01:19:03,535
-Promise?
-Who is the man?

805
01:19:04,953 --> 01:19:06,788
I am this man, Seor.

806
01:19:07,664 --> 01:19:09,958
Emilio G. Fernandez Figueroa.

807
01:19:11,126 --> 01:19:14,505
At your service. For a price.
Always for a price.

808
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:20,803
Carmen!

809
01:19:28,393 --> 01:19:29,853
Sir, I'd like to...

810
01:19:29,937 --> 01:19:31,855
Wait till you grow up.

811
01:19:59,091 --> 01:20:01,051
Let's talk a little business.

812
01:20:03,178 --> 01:20:04,179
Why not?

813
01:20:36,879 --> 01:20:37,963
Let's go.

814
01:20:38,338 --> 01:20:39,631
But I'm hungry!

815
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,300
While you're fillin' your belly...

816
01:20:41,383 --> 01:20:44,386
...I'm goin' out to meet a Comanche
named Cicatriz.

817
01:20:44,553 --> 01:20:46,054
Never heard of him.

818
01:20:46,513 --> 01:20:49,016
"Cicatriz" is Mexican for "scar."

819
01:22:12,182 --> 01:22:13,809
Medicine country, huh?

820
01:22:14,518 --> 01:22:16,145
Bad medicine, I think.

821
01:22:40,169 --> 01:22:43,505
-This is the great Cicatriz, War Chief.
-Scar, huh?

822
01:22:49,678 --> 01:22:51,847
Plain to see how you got your name.

823
01:22:53,765 --> 01:22:55,517
You, Big Shoulders.

824
01:22:56,518 --> 01:22:58,854
The young one, He Who Follows.

825
01:23:00,856 --> 01:23:04,026
You speak pretty good American
for a Comanche.

826
01:23:05,569 --> 01:23:07,196
Did someone teach you?

827
01:23:15,329 --> 01:23:18,916
That's right. We've come to trade.
Only not out here.

828
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,002
I don't stand talkin' in the wind.

829
01:23:48,195 --> 01:23:51,281
You speak good Comanche.
Did someone teach you?

830
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:55,911
You, stay out here.
Not likely.

831
01:24:02,209 --> 01:24:06,338
His sons are dead. So his wives sit
on the honor side of his lodge.

832
01:24:12,845 --> 01:24:14,555
Are all those his wives?

833
01:24:15,222 --> 01:24:17,516
Two sons killed by white men.

834
01:24:18,725 --> 01:24:20,978
For each son, I take many...

835
01:24:23,522 --> 01:24:24,690
Scalps.

836
01:24:59,391 --> 01:25:01,143
We've seen scalps before.

837
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:04,938
Seen this before?

838
01:25:12,446 --> 01:25:14,948
I came to trade,
not to admire his collection.

839
01:25:15,032 --> 01:25:19,369
Tell him we'll pitch camp on the other
side of the creek and talk tomorrow.

840
01:25:19,453 --> 01:25:21,163
Tomorrow?

841
01:25:35,719 --> 01:25:37,346
It is not that I am afraid.

842
01:25:37,429 --> 01:25:39,973
Don't apologize.
You got well paid.

843
01:25:40,098 --> 01:25:44,520
But he knows who you are,
and why you're here. This, I did not know.

844
01:25:48,106 --> 01:25:50,734
Take it. I do not want blood money.

845
01:25:51,735 --> 01:25:53,278
Vaya con dios.

846
01:26:09,628 --> 01:26:12,381
Do you think
old Scar means to kill us?

847
01:26:12,965 --> 01:26:14,424
He's got to.

848
01:26:15,134 --> 01:26:17,886
We've been asking for it
for five years.

849
01:26:19,763 --> 01:26:22,516
Why didn't he make
his move back there?

850
01:26:23,642 --> 01:26:26,728
Hospitality, I guess.
Comanche hospitality.

851
01:26:30,649 --> 01:26:33,152
Why?
Do you want to pull out too?

852
01:26:37,948 --> 01:26:39,575
Big Shoulders!

853
01:26:51,795 --> 01:26:53,172
Debbie?

854
01:26:55,549 --> 01:26:56,675
Debbie...

855
01:26:57,634 --> 01:27:00,762
Debbie, don't you remember?
I'm Martin, your brother.

856
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:02,764
Remember?

857
01:27:04,224 --> 01:27:05,976
Debbie, remember back...

858
01:27:07,394 --> 01:27:10,397
Do you remember how I used
to let you ride my horse?

859
01:27:12,107 --> 01:27:13,692
And tell you stories?

860
01:27:15,736 --> 01:27:17,738
Don't you remember me, Debbie?

861
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:19,448
I remember.

862
01:27:20,741 --> 01:27:21,992
For always.

863
01:27:23,744 --> 01:27:26,788
First I prayed to you, to come and get me...

864
01:27:28,373 --> 01:27:30,918
...to take me home. You didn't come.

865
01:27:33,462 --> 01:27:35,130
I've come now, Debbie.

866
01:27:36,089 --> 01:27:37,591
These are my people.

867
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:41,845
Go! Go, Martin! Please!

868
01:27:44,014 --> 01:27:45,557
Stand aside, Martin!

869
01:27:49,770 --> 01:27:51,355
No, you don't, Ethan!

870
01:27:52,272 --> 01:27:53,941
Ethan! No, you don't!

871
01:27:56,193 --> 01:27:57,402
Stand aside!

872
01:28:16,588 --> 01:28:17,923
Debbie!

873
01:30:24,967 --> 01:30:28,762
Looks as though I'm gonna have
to open that shoulder again.

874
01:30:29,346 --> 01:30:31,098
To get the poison out.

875
01:30:31,974 --> 01:30:35,602
Sure beats me, Ethan...
how you could've stayed alive this long.

876
01:30:36,353 --> 01:30:37,729
Read this.

877
01:30:50,242 --> 01:30:51,285
"I..."

878
01:30:52,578 --> 01:30:54,413
"...Ethan Edwards..."

879
01:30:55,914 --> 01:30:58,167
"...being of a sound mind..."

880
01:31:00,752 --> 01:31:01,920
"...and..."

881
01:31:02,421 --> 01:31:04,673
"...without any blood kin..."

882
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:13,390
"...do hereby..."

883
01:31:17,019 --> 01:31:19,271
Bequeath. It means "leave."

884
01:31:20,856 --> 01:31:22,357
"...bequeath..."

885
01:31:23,984 --> 01:31:25,903
"...all my property..."

886
01:31:28,322 --> 01:31:30,073
"...of any kind..."

887
01:31:33,494 --> 01:31:35,162
"...to Martin Pawley."

888
01:31:38,373 --> 01:31:41,251
What do you mean,
you don't have any "blood kin"?

889
01:31:41,793 --> 01:31:43,504
Debbie is your blood kin!

890
01:31:43,587 --> 01:31:45,297
Not no more, she ain't!

891
01:31:45,798 --> 01:31:47,758
Well, you can keep your will!

892
01:31:48,258 --> 01:31:50,427
I don't want any of your property!

893
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:54,139
Besides, I ain't forgettin' you was gettin'
all set to shoot her yourself.

894
01:31:54,223 --> 01:31:55,682
What kind of man
are you anyway?

895
01:31:55,766 --> 01:31:59,144
-She's been livin' with a buck!
-Shut your dirty mouth!

896
01:32:06,026 --> 01:32:07,486
I hope you die!

897
01:32:08,695 --> 01:32:10,489
That'll be the day!

898
01:32:19,623 --> 01:32:21,375
One, two, three, four!

899
01:33:10,257 --> 01:33:12,301
Good evening, everybody!

900
01:33:14,845 --> 01:33:18,765
Here he is! All curried,
combed and washed behind the ears.

901
01:33:19,349 --> 01:33:22,311
Charlie, you look right handsome!
I'd hardly know you.

902
01:33:22,394 --> 01:33:25,397
Yes, ma'am.
I can't hardly recognize myself.

903
01:33:26,356 --> 01:33:27,483
Get it on, Luther!

904
01:33:44,583 --> 01:33:46,335
Why don't you have a drink?

905
01:33:46,418 --> 01:33:49,338
Oh, no, Nesby.
Not till I'm finished my clergyin'.

906
01:33:49,505 --> 01:33:51,840
-Bar's closed. Right, Sister Jorgensen?
-Right!

907
01:33:51,924 --> 01:33:54,676
All right, let's go! Let's get it goin'!

908
01:34:06,271 --> 01:34:07,606
Go ahead.

909
01:34:10,609 --> 01:34:11,568
Bible.

910
01:34:14,988 --> 01:34:16,990
-Get them spurs off!
-Yes, sir.

911
01:34:21,370 --> 01:34:23,705
All right, line up inside, boys.

912
01:34:34,258 --> 01:34:35,676
Music!

913
01:34:35,843 --> 01:34:38,971
"Yes, we will gather at the river"

914
01:34:43,350 --> 01:34:45,936
"The beautiful, the beautiful river"

915
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:54,027
"Gather with the saints at the river"

916
01:34:58,740 --> 01:35:01,243
"That flows by the throne of God"

917
01:35:15,632 --> 01:35:18,177
Hey, you don't suppose
they're throwin' a party for us, do you?

918
01:35:18,260 --> 01:35:19,970
That'll be the day!

919
01:35:26,059 --> 01:35:27,311
I'm all right.

920
01:35:33,275 --> 01:35:37,196
Ethan, Martin! You can't come in!
The rangers are in there.

921
01:35:37,613 --> 01:35:38,906
What's that got to do with us?

922
01:35:38,989 --> 01:35:41,366
You're both posted for murder.
The both of you!

923
01:35:41,450 --> 01:35:43,827
That trader, the late Futterman...

924
01:35:44,244 --> 01:35:46,955
The Reverend and the rangers
are in there now...

925
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:49,041
Well, what's goin' on anyway?

926
01:35:58,342 --> 01:36:00,427
Looks like you two will have
a lot to talk about.

927
01:36:00,511 --> 01:36:02,971
Come on, Lars.
Ethan...hide in the barn!

928
01:36:03,055 --> 01:36:04,431
What for?

929
01:36:05,599 --> 01:36:07,351
Martin...

930
01:36:10,270 --> 01:36:12,356
Please! Look, everybody!

931
01:36:13,106 --> 01:36:14,274
Look, Mama!

932
01:36:15,108 --> 01:36:16,777
Look who's here!

933
01:36:18,904 --> 01:36:19,947
Evenin'.

934
01:36:23,283 --> 01:36:24,743
Is the bar open?

935
01:36:25,744 --> 01:36:28,372
Any news
of our little girl?

936
01:36:28,664 --> 01:36:30,833
She's not a little girl anymore.

937
01:36:31,083 --> 01:36:32,960
You've seen her? She's alive?

938
01:36:33,043 --> 01:36:35,379
I've seen her and she's alive.

939
01:36:36,964 --> 01:36:40,592
Good evening, Reverend.
Or should I call you "Captain"?

940
01:36:41,426 --> 01:36:43,554
I came here for a wedding, Ethan.

941
01:36:43,637 --> 01:36:47,558
Till that's over, "Reverend" will do.
Afterwards we'll talk.

942
01:36:47,641 --> 01:36:49,643
-Is Marty with you?
-Yep.

943
01:36:52,354 --> 01:36:55,566
Charlie, please!
Charlie!

944
01:36:55,816 --> 01:36:58,694
It's good to see you back, Ethan.
We'll join you.

945
01:36:59,903 --> 01:37:01,989
But I wrote you one letter.

946
01:37:02,614 --> 01:37:04,700
One letter in five years!

947
01:37:05,826 --> 01:37:09,496
I read it till the paper dried up
and the writin' faded out.

948
01:37:12,332 --> 01:37:14,293
It wasn't much of a letter, was it?

949
01:37:14,376 --> 01:37:15,627
No, it wasn't.

950
01:37:17,296 --> 01:37:19,548
Might've at least said you loved me.

951
01:37:20,090 --> 01:37:24,303
You might've asked me to wait for you.
At least that'd have been somethin'.

952
01:37:26,263 --> 01:37:28,056
But I always loved you!

953
01:37:29,266 --> 01:37:32,311
I thought you knew that
without me havin' to say it.

954
01:37:33,270 --> 01:37:35,564
It isn't fair, Martin Pawley!

955
01:37:36,857 --> 01:37:38,525
It isn't fair and you know it!

956
01:37:38,609 --> 01:37:41,445
-I wish you wouldn't cry, Laurie.
-Who's cryin'?

957
01:37:50,662 --> 01:37:54,082
I reckon the best thing
for me to do is to go away.

958
01:37:56,335 --> 01:37:59,046
You do, Martin Pawley, and I'll just die!

959
01:38:11,725 --> 01:38:14,353
I'll thank you to unhand my fiance.

960
01:38:19,107 --> 01:38:21,902
You don't mean
you're gonna be marryin' him?

961
01:38:22,820 --> 01:38:24,321
Charlie MacCorry?

962
01:38:24,404 --> 01:38:25,864
She sure is!

963
01:38:26,532 --> 01:38:29,993
And don't think your comin' back
is gonna change it either!

964
01:38:30,369 --> 01:38:33,121
Well, now, as to that,
I just don't know, Charlie.

965
01:38:33,205 --> 01:38:35,457
We hadn't gotten around
to talkin' about marriage.

966
01:38:35,541 --> 01:38:38,961
What right have you to talk marriage
to any decent woman?

967
01:38:39,378 --> 01:38:41,547
If you're referrin' to
that crazy murder charge...

968
01:38:41,630 --> 01:38:43,048
And other things.

969
01:38:44,049 --> 01:38:48,971
You think you're gettin' away with
bein' smart about the Indian wife you took.

970
01:38:52,057 --> 01:38:54,643
I'll bet she ain't the first squaw you ever...

971
01:38:54,726 --> 01:38:56,478
Why, you are a no good...

972
01:38:58,897 --> 01:39:01,108
Oh, Marty, you've done it again!

973
01:39:04,444 --> 01:39:05,904
Get out of my way!

974
01:39:06,488 --> 01:39:09,074
Marty! Charlie! I ain't gonna have
no fightin' in my house.

975
01:39:09,158 --> 01:39:12,244
Well, then we're just gonna fight outside,
doggone it!

976
01:39:12,327 --> 01:39:13,996
I ain't totin' no firearms.

977
01:39:14,079 --> 01:39:16,623
Well, that sure ain't gonna be no problem.

978
01:39:18,792 --> 01:39:21,170
-After you, Marty.
-After you, Charlie.

979
01:39:21,336 --> 01:39:23,464
Ma! Reverend! Pa!

980
01:39:28,260 --> 01:39:29,761
Look, here.

981
01:39:33,015 --> 01:39:34,516
Thank you.

982
01:39:42,691 --> 01:39:45,027
Spit over that piece of firewood.

983
01:40:02,753 --> 01:40:05,422
Quit that, Marty! That ain't fair!

984
01:40:09,885 --> 01:40:12,012
Martin! Martin! Charlie!

985
01:40:14,681 --> 01:40:16,475
Marty, now you stop that!

986
01:40:16,558 --> 01:40:18,435
Marty! Charlie!

987
01:40:21,396 --> 01:40:22,940
Sergeant MacCorry!

988
01:40:26,318 --> 01:40:29,238
Is this here altercation in the line of duty?

989
01:40:29,321 --> 01:40:32,783
No, sir. It's more
in the nature of a private fight.

990
01:40:32,866 --> 01:40:37,037
All right, then, go ahead.
But fight fair. No biting or gouging!

991
01:40:37,955 --> 01:40:39,748
And no kicking either!

992
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:43,710
Get them up! Make them fight fair!

993
01:40:43,794 --> 01:40:45,337
Now you fight fair, Martin!

994
01:40:45,420 --> 01:40:47,131
Wait a minute!

995
01:40:47,631 --> 01:40:49,091
Somebody's fiddle.

996
01:40:49,716 --> 01:40:51,176
Hey, Seth!

997
01:40:52,970 --> 01:40:55,013
No choking! No gouging!

998
01:40:57,432 --> 01:40:59,101
Mr. Edwards, make 'em stop!

999
01:40:59,184 --> 01:41:00,769
Why? You started it.

1000
01:41:01,478 --> 01:41:03,397
Marty, watch his feet!

1001
01:41:04,857 --> 01:41:06,441
Oh, Ethan! No!

1002
01:41:06,942 --> 01:41:09,069
Don't forget, you're a lady.

1003
01:41:09,153 --> 01:41:11,446
Come on now, fight fair!

1004
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:18,203
Come on, Charlie! That's it, Charlie!

1005
01:41:26,211 --> 01:41:27,796
Come on, Charlie. Get up!

1006
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:29,631
Are you all right?

1007
01:41:29,923 --> 01:41:31,508
I reckon so.

1008
01:41:32,885 --> 01:41:36,472
Now, come on. I want you boys
to shake hands and make friends.

1009
01:41:37,764 --> 01:41:40,017
Sorry I bit your ear, Marty.

1010
01:41:42,060 --> 01:41:44,021
It don't hurt none, Charlie.

1011
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:48,108
Now you boys get cleaned up
and we'll proceed with the wedding.

1012
01:41:48,734 --> 01:41:49,359
Where's my Bible?

1013
01:41:49,443 --> 01:41:51,987
There ain't gonna be no wedding.

1014
01:41:59,786 --> 01:42:03,165
Not till we get a few things
cleared up around here.

1015
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:13,550
It was a nice wedding party,
considering nobody got married.

1016
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:19,765
Ethan, I gotta ask you and Martin
to take a ride with me...

1017
01:42:19,848 --> 01:42:21,809
...down to the state capital.

1018
01:42:22,559 --> 01:42:25,687
Is this an invite
to a necktie party, Reverend?

1019
01:42:26,063 --> 01:42:28,065
No, I wouldn't say that.

1020
01:42:28,857 --> 01:42:31,777
Likely you had your reasons
for killin' Futterman.

1021
01:42:32,694 --> 01:42:34,404
Probably needed killin'.

1022
01:42:35,072 --> 01:42:38,534
I'm talking to you now as a ranger,
not as a preacher.

1023
01:42:39,701 --> 01:42:42,663
The fact that all three of 'em
was shot in the back was...

1024
01:42:42,746 --> 01:42:45,374
...the only thing
that raised some questions.

1025
01:42:45,958 --> 01:42:47,417
That, and...

1026
01:42:48,043 --> 01:42:51,547
...a missin' gold piece that was
known to have been on him...

1027
01:42:52,464 --> 01:42:54,550
...just prior to his demise.

1028
01:42:56,510 --> 01:42:59,221
Ethan, I'll have to ask you for your gun.

1029
01:43:12,442 --> 01:43:15,571
Well, if it's all the same to you,
Reverend...

1030
01:43:15,821 --> 01:43:17,281
...I ain't goin' to Austin!

1031
01:43:17,364 --> 01:43:20,033
You're goin'
if the captain says so.

1032
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:21,535
Stop it! Stop it!

1033
01:43:21,618 --> 01:43:25,122
I'll put both of you boys
in the smokehouse to cool off.

1034
01:43:27,749 --> 01:43:30,127
Good evening, ma'am. Captain Clayton?

1035
01:43:31,670 --> 01:43:33,088
Excuse me, ma'am.

1036
01:43:34,339 --> 01:43:36,467
-Captain Clayton, sir?
-No.

1037
01:43:38,260 --> 01:43:40,012
I'm Captain Clayton.

1038
01:43:40,137 --> 01:43:43,056
-You're Captain Clayton?
-Yes, I'm Captain Clayton.

1039
01:43:43,140 --> 01:43:45,767
Col. Greenhill's compliments, sir.
The colonel wants to know...

1040
01:43:45,851 --> 01:43:47,936
-Is your head cold?
-No, sir.

1041
01:43:49,229 --> 01:43:50,647
I'm sorry, sir.

1042
01:43:51,315 --> 01:43:55,360
-All right, start at the beginning.
-Col. Greenhill's compliments, sir.

1043
01:43:55,486 --> 01:43:58,280
Hold on, son. Who is this Col. Greenhill
you're talking about?

1044
01:43:58,363 --> 01:44:00,324
Why, Col. Greenhill is Col. Greenhill, sir.

1045
01:44:00,407 --> 01:44:02,284
-Commanding officer of the 15th...
-And who are you?

1046
01:44:02,367 --> 01:44:04,077
I'm Lt. Greenhill, sir.

1047
01:44:04,119 --> 01:44:06,330
What is it your pa wants to know?

1048
01:44:07,122 --> 01:44:08,457
Well, go ahead.

1049
01:44:08,791 --> 01:44:10,793
My pa wants to know...
Col. Greenhill wants to know...

1050
01:44:10,876 --> 01:44:12,294
...how soon you can put a company...

1051
01:44:12,461 --> 01:44:14,171
Turn around, sonny.

1052
01:44:15,714 --> 01:44:18,091
Yeah, he's a Yankee cavalryman.

1053
01:44:18,842 --> 01:44:22,846
Col. Greenhill wants to know how soon
you could... I resent that, sir!

1054
01:44:22,930 --> 01:44:25,432
Just funnin', son, just funnin'.

1055
01:44:25,766 --> 01:44:28,352
How soon you could put a company
of your men in the field...

1056
01:44:28,435 --> 01:44:30,521
...fully armed for joint-punitive action
against the Comanches?

1057
01:44:30,604 --> 01:44:32,940
-Joint what?
-Joint-punitive action.

1058
01:44:33,482 --> 01:44:37,361
We received information about a band
of Comanches under a chief named Scar.

1059
01:44:37,444 --> 01:44:38,862
What information?

1060
01:44:39,238 --> 01:44:41,114
That maybe he's not far from here,
holed up somewhere.

1061
01:44:41,198 --> 01:44:43,033
What makes you think
he's not far from here?

1062
01:44:43,116 --> 01:44:44,952
One of our patrollers picked up a man...

1063
01:44:45,035 --> 01:44:47,371
...claims he was a prisoner with Scar
till two days ago.

1064
01:44:47,454 --> 01:44:49,748
Talks kind of crazy,
but we brought him along.

1065
01:44:49,832 --> 01:44:52,334
Says he lives here.
Keeps mentioning a rocking chair.

1066
01:44:52,417 --> 01:44:53,877
Mose. Mose!

1067
01:44:58,966 --> 01:45:00,551
Take his arms.

1068
01:45:03,637 --> 01:45:05,389
It's Mose!

1069
01:45:05,472 --> 01:45:08,684
Good evening, ma'am.
I came for my rocking chair.

1070
01:45:08,767 --> 01:45:11,436
Bring him to the fire.
Watch him!

1071
01:45:13,522 --> 01:45:14,940
Get him up!

1072
01:45:15,816 --> 01:45:17,734
Here, get him a chair.

1073
01:45:18,610 --> 01:45:20,779
Charlie, bring him a drink!

1074
01:45:21,572 --> 01:45:23,198
Watch his head!

1075
01:45:24,825 --> 01:45:28,078
Take a drink, Mose.
Drink that down, Mose.

1076
01:45:31,707 --> 01:45:33,834
Mose. Scar...where is he?

1077
01:45:34,877 --> 01:45:37,880
My rocking chair.
You promised me my rocking chair.

1078
01:45:37,963 --> 01:45:39,423
Where is Scar?

1079
01:45:39,506 --> 01:45:42,342
Ask him about Debbie.
Is Debbie all right, Mose?

1080
01:45:44,261 --> 01:45:46,430
Made out I was crazy.

1081
01:45:49,933 --> 01:45:52,352
You don't think I'm crazy,
do you, ma'am?

1082
01:45:52,436 --> 01:45:54,688
No, Mose, you're just sick and hurt.

1083
01:45:54,771 --> 01:45:56,148
Thank you, ma'am.

1084
01:45:56,231 --> 01:45:59,318
Mose, try and remember.
You were at Scar's camp.

1085
01:45:59,818 --> 01:46:02,905
I ate dirt and chewed grass. I fooled them.

1086
01:46:03,030 --> 01:46:05,032
Where is Scar holed up?

1087
01:46:05,282 --> 01:46:06,658
I won't tell you.

1088
01:46:08,660 --> 01:46:10,329
I'll tell Marty.

1089
01:46:10,746 --> 01:46:13,081
Seven Fingers, Marty. Seven fingers.

1090
01:46:14,124 --> 01:46:17,044
That's enough, Ethan.
Let's get him to bed.

1091
01:46:17,127 --> 01:46:20,047
Seven Fingers?
Beg to report, sir...

1092
01:46:20,130 --> 01:46:23,801
...that's what he told us,
but there's no such place on the maps.

1093
01:46:25,844 --> 01:46:30,015
Isn't it the Caddo name for where
all them canyons join under the Malapai?

1094
01:46:30,516 --> 01:46:32,518
Seven Fingers of Brazos!

1095
01:46:32,601 --> 01:46:35,437
Come on, Mama.
Let's get him to his room.

1096
01:46:35,521 --> 01:46:36,647
My rocking chair?

1097
01:46:36,730 --> 01:46:38,816
We'll bring it.

1098
01:46:40,108 --> 01:46:42,486
You go tell your pa that
a company of rangers...

1099
01:46:42,569 --> 01:46:44,780
...all 14 of 'em, fully armed and equipped...

1100
01:46:44,863 --> 01:46:46,615
...will be in the field by daylight.

1101
01:46:46,698 --> 01:46:49,117
We'll be headin' for the south end
of the Malapai.

1102
01:46:49,201 --> 01:46:51,912
If he can catch up with us,
all well and good!

1103
01:46:52,579 --> 01:46:55,916
We can't take the field tomorrow.
For your own protection.

1104
01:46:57,334 --> 01:47:00,129
Sonny. Out yonder is a pack
of murderers...

1105
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:03,590
...complete with Texican scalps
and a white-girl captive!

1106
01:47:03,674 --> 01:47:06,635
If you want to protect us,
just keep out of our way.

1107
01:47:06,718 --> 01:47:08,595
Now you skedaddle back to your pa!

1108
01:47:08,679 --> 01:47:09,721
Ethan...

1109
01:47:09,805 --> 01:47:13,767
You and Martin are hereby appointed
civilian scouts. Without pay.

1110
01:47:13,851 --> 01:47:17,604
Take the boys and get back
to headquarters and pick up my company.

1111
01:47:20,524 --> 01:47:21,775
Martin?

1112
01:47:27,823 --> 01:47:29,992
You're not going! Not this time.

1113
01:47:31,201 --> 01:47:32,452
Are you crazy?

1114
01:47:32,870 --> 01:47:35,664
It's too late. She is a woman grown now.

1115
01:47:36,331 --> 01:47:38,959
I gotta go, Laurie. I gotta fetch her home.

1116
01:47:39,042 --> 01:47:40,461
Fetch what?

1117
01:47:40,752 --> 01:47:44,631
The leavings of Comanche bucks sold time
and again to the highest bidder with...

1118
01:47:44,715 --> 01:47:46,091
Laurie, shut your mouth!

1119
01:47:46,175 --> 01:47:48,760
Do you know what Ethan
will do if he has a chance?

1120
01:47:48,844 --> 01:47:50,929
He'll put a bullet in her brain!

1121
01:47:51,597 --> 01:47:53,932
I tell you, Martha would want him to!

1122
01:47:54,391 --> 01:47:56,143
Only if I'm dead!

1123
01:48:44,691 --> 01:48:47,152
We can get within 200 yards of them.

1124
01:48:47,820 --> 01:48:50,197
There's a hub back off to the left.

1125
01:48:51,323 --> 01:48:52,866
How many, you figure?

1126
01:48:53,659 --> 01:48:55,452
About a dozen each.

1127
01:48:56,078 --> 01:48:57,621
Enough to go around.

1128
01:49:06,505 --> 01:49:08,298
Well, we found 'em!

1129
01:49:10,175 --> 01:49:11,343
Now, men...

1130
01:49:11,677 --> 01:49:15,681
...the state of Texas is paying you
12 Yankee dollars a month.

1131
01:49:17,307 --> 01:49:19,309
Now is your chance to earn it!

1132
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:23,021
Tighten up your cinches.
We'll go chargin' in about sunup.

1133
01:49:23,689 --> 01:49:27,067
Now make sure that...
Just a minute, Reverend!

1134
01:49:32,489 --> 01:49:35,284
If we go charging in, they'll kill her!
And you know it.

1135
01:49:35,367 --> 01:49:38,370
That's what I'm countin' on.
I know you are.

1136
01:49:38,453 --> 01:49:41,331
Well, it ain't gonna be that way!
She's alive and she's gonna stay alive!

1137
01:49:41,415 --> 01:49:43,083
Living with Comanches ain't bein' alive.

1138
01:49:43,167 --> 01:49:46,378
It's better she's alive and livin' with
Comanches than her brains bashed out!

1139
01:49:46,462 --> 01:49:49,339
Now, son, I know
this is a bitter thing to say...

1140
01:49:49,465 --> 01:49:51,925
...but there's more at stake here
than your sister.

1141
01:49:52,009 --> 01:49:54,761
There sure is.
I'm gonna tell you somethin'.

1142
01:49:55,512 --> 01:49:58,807
I didn't mean to speak of it,
but I'm gonna tell you now.

1143
01:49:59,099 --> 01:50:02,853
You remember that scalp strung
on Scar's lance? Long and wavy?

1144
01:50:03,312 --> 01:50:06,607
Yeah, I saw it. And don't try to tell me
it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's!

1145
01:50:06,648 --> 01:50:08,317
It was your mother's.

1146
01:50:12,863 --> 01:50:16,116
That don't change it.
That don't change nothing!

1147
01:50:19,620 --> 01:50:23,081
Give me a chance to sneak in and
get her out, before you come chargin' in.

1148
01:50:23,165 --> 01:50:24,625
What if you get caught?

1149
01:50:24,708 --> 01:50:27,836
-That don't tell them nothin', does it?
-I said no!

1150
01:50:28,670 --> 01:50:33,383
You go right ahead, son. But at the first
sign of an alarm, we're comin' in.

1151
01:50:35,010 --> 01:50:38,972
We ain't gonna have no time to pick
and choose our targets when we do!

1152
01:50:41,767 --> 01:50:43,227
It's your funeral.

1153
01:51:49,710 --> 01:51:51,920
Captain Clayton!

1154
01:51:52,713 --> 01:51:54,381
Captain Clayton!

1155
01:51:54,465 --> 01:51:56,258
What the Sam Hill...?

1156
01:51:58,552 --> 01:52:00,429
Captain Clayton, sir.

1157
01:52:01,513 --> 01:52:05,392
Go ahead! Why don't you have
your bugler blow the charge too?

1158
01:52:07,186 --> 01:52:10,189
Oh, never mind.
Does your pa know you're out here?

1159
01:52:10,439 --> 01:52:12,983
Yes, sir. The troops are 10 miles back.

1160
01:52:13,233 --> 01:52:14,943
The colonel sent me to find you.

1161
01:52:15,027 --> 01:52:17,738
You found me. Good work and goodbye.

1162
01:52:18,155 --> 01:52:19,907
Is there anything I can do, sir?

1163
01:52:19,990 --> 01:52:21,158
God forbid.

1164
01:52:21,241 --> 01:52:25,245
You just go back and tell your pa
where we are and where he is.

1165
01:52:25,788 --> 01:52:28,373
But he knows that, sir. Can't I stay?

1166
01:52:29,666 --> 01:52:30,667
Please?

1167
01:52:31,794 --> 01:52:34,546
Oh, all right. But you watch me, boy.

1168
01:52:34,838 --> 01:52:38,926
I'm the hard case you're up against
out here, not them childish savages.

1169
01:52:39,176 --> 01:52:41,553
If you don't hear my first holler...

1170
01:52:41,804 --> 01:52:43,180
...you better read my mind...

1171
01:52:43,263 --> 01:52:47,100
...'cause I don't aim to raise no two hollers
on any subject at hand!

1172
01:52:47,184 --> 01:52:48,894
-Yes, sir.
-Boy...

1173
01:52:49,812 --> 01:52:51,355
...watch that knife!

1174
01:52:51,563 --> 01:52:52,731
Sorry, sir.

1175
01:53:12,835 --> 01:53:13,877
Halt!

1176
01:53:15,838 --> 01:53:16,880
Mount!

1177
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:23,262
Mount! Mount!

1178
01:53:51,206 --> 01:53:52,458
Debbie.

1179
01:53:53,333 --> 01:53:54,460
Debbie.

1180
01:53:58,130 --> 01:53:59,423
Don't say anything!

1181
01:53:59,506 --> 01:54:01,216
It's your brother Marty!

1182
01:54:01,425 --> 01:54:05,012
I'm gonna take you away.
I'm gonna get you out of here, Debbie.

1183
01:54:05,929 --> 01:54:07,097
Yes, Marty!

1184
01:54:15,814 --> 01:54:18,066
Brethren, let us go amongst them!

1185
01:54:58,232 --> 01:55:00,692
Charlie, Nesby, run off that pony herd...

1186
01:55:01,401 --> 01:55:03,570
Boy, you watch out for that knife!

1187
01:55:03,654 --> 01:55:04,988
Let's go!

1188
01:55:39,523 --> 01:55:41,024
No, Ethan!

1189
01:55:58,876 --> 01:56:00,419
Debbie!

1190
01:56:05,966 --> 01:56:07,426
No, Ethan!

1191
01:56:20,522 --> 01:56:22,274
Let's go home, Debbie.

1192
01:56:31,617 --> 01:56:34,495
Does that hurt, Reverend?
Shut up!

1193
01:56:36,830 --> 01:56:37,915
Ow!

1194
01:56:48,801 --> 01:56:51,762
Good work, Captain! Good work, Son.

1195
01:56:51,845 --> 01:56:53,305
You wounded?

1196
01:56:54,139 --> 01:56:56,225
-A bullet? An arrow?
-No!

1197
01:57:47,818 --> 01:57:49,570
"A man will search"

1198
01:57:51,697 --> 01:57:53,490
"His heart and soul"

1199
01:57:55,450 --> 01:57:57,619
"Go searching way out there"

1200
01:58:02,666 --> 01:58:04,418
"His peace of mind"

1201
01:58:06,170 --> 01:58:08,005
"He knows he'll find"

1202
01:58:09,882 --> 01:58:11,633
"But where, O Lord"

1203
01:58:13,510 --> 01:58:14,970
"Lord, where"

1204
01:58:19,224 --> 01:58:20,601
"Ride away"

1205
01:58:26,732 --> 01:58:28,108
"Ride away"

1206
01:58:34,031 --> 01:58:35,449
"Ride away"
