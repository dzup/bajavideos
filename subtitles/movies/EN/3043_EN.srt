1
00:02:35,084 --> 00:02:38,334
When Bruce Lee died, he was only 32.

2
00:02:38,917 --> 00:02:41,292
His sudden death shocked the world.

3
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:43,501
To his fans,

4
00:02:43,667 --> 00:02:45,876
he was a unique superstar.

5
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:47,709
But to our family,

6
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,417
he was our brother.

7
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:54,459
We grew up and spent our childhood together.

8
00:02:54,792 --> 00:02:58,209
Looking at this house reminds me of

9
00:02:58,376 --> 00:03:01,334
my brother Phoenix, my family

10
00:03:01,501 --> 00:03:04,792
and how we grew up together.

11
00:03:05,126 --> 00:03:07,126
I'm overwhelmed with emotions.

12
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:10,751
This movie is about Bruce Lee's untold story,

13
00:03:10,917 --> 00:03:13,709
which is also our family story.

14
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,792
Why did you set me up?

15
00:03:52,126 --> 00:03:54,751
I'm just a poor farmer,

16
00:03:54,917 --> 00:03:59,917
I can't read poetry.

17
00:04:16,834 --> 00:04:18,084
Chuen, I just got a call.

18
00:04:18,251 --> 00:04:19,876
Your wife is going into labor.

19
00:04:20,876 --> 00:04:22,334
Quick.

20
00:04:22,584 --> 00:04:23,917
Get the car.

21
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:34,792
My Father Lee Hoi-chuen was

22
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:37,126
a leading comic in Cantonese Opera.

23
00:04:37,792 --> 00:04:40,876
That year, he took Mother with him
on a tour in San Francisco.

24
00:04:41,042 --> 00:04:43,584
They were greeted with a surprise.

25
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:47,876
It actually snowed in San Francisco.

26
00:04:48,334 --> 00:04:52,042
Push...

27
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:55,126
You can do it, push...

28
00:04:55,292 --> 00:04:57,417
I can see your son.

29
00:05:05,334 --> 00:05:07,417
Chuen, here they come.

30
00:05:11,251 --> 00:05:12,751
Grace,

31
00:05:13,417 --> 00:05:14,584
are you tired?

32
00:05:15,209 --> 00:05:15,959
I'm fine.

33
00:05:16,126 --> 00:05:17,167
Boy or girl?

34
00:05:17,834 --> 00:05:20,292
Boy...

35
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:22,251
A son.

36
00:05:22,751 --> 00:05:24,126
Thank Heavens.

37
00:05:24,292 --> 00:05:25,959
Excuse me.

38
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:27,292
- Are you alright?
- Chuen...

39
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:29,126
- Excuse me, sir.
- She's talking to you.

40
00:05:29,292 --> 00:05:31,626
We need the boy's name for registration.

41
00:05:32,626 --> 00:05:34,917
Name?

42
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:40,334
Push... Push...

43
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:42,334
Push...

44
00:05:42,751 --> 00:05:44,876
P... Push... Push...

45
00:05:45,042 --> 00:05:45,959
Bruce?

46
00:05:46,126 --> 00:05:48,417
Push... Lee...

47
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:51,959
- Bruce Lee?
- Yes...

48
00:05:52,876 --> 00:05:53,459
Is that it?

49
00:05:53,626 --> 00:05:55,584
Push...

50
00:05:56,792 --> 00:05:58,292
Push Lee.

51
00:06:20,126 --> 00:06:22,709
Camera... action.

52
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,334
I'm sure the three of us

53
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:29,876
will be happy here.

54
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:34,917
Cut.

55
00:06:35,084 --> 00:06:36,167
Is that OK?

56
00:06:36,334 --> 00:06:37,501
Good take.

57
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:40,334
Is he done?

58
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:41,292
Yes.

59
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:43,167
Thanks for letting us use him.

60
00:06:43,334 --> 00:06:44,667
This is for him.

61
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:46,042
You shouldn't have.

62
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:48,292
Chinese on the road

63
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:50,334
should help each other out.

64
00:06:50,501 --> 00:06:51,834
You're going back to Hong Kong?

65
00:06:52,001 --> 00:06:53,876
Yes, I'm trying to get tickets.

66
00:06:54,042 --> 00:06:56,584
It's not safe back home. You should stay.

67
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:59,501
I can't. I have a big family to support.

68
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:01,167
I have to go back.

69
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:04,126
Mother sent a telegram yesterday.

70
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:05,542
She wanted us to stay for now.

71
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:07,959
She doesn't mean it.

72
00:07:08,126 --> 00:07:11,126
She couldn't wait to meet her grandson.
We must go.

73
00:07:26,876 --> 00:07:28,626
Welcome home, Master Chuen.

74
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:34,209
Lee Jun-fan, you're home.

75
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,376
You're home.

76
00:07:42,542 --> 00:07:43,751
- Where's Mother?
- Upstairs...

77
00:07:43,876 --> 00:07:45,751
- Watch out.
- Let me see him.

78
00:07:46,792 --> 00:07:49,251
- Mother...
- Mother is upstairs.

79
00:07:49,917 --> 00:07:51,584
Mother.

80
00:07:52,542 --> 00:07:54,084
Master Chuen is back.

81
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:55,626
Mother.

82
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:00,792
Chuen?

83
00:08:01,584 --> 00:08:02,876
Mother.

84
00:08:05,376 --> 00:08:06,584
Father.

85
00:08:06,751 --> 00:08:10,959
Phoebe, Agnes, Peter.

86
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:12,376
- Mother.
- Mother.

87
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:13,292
You're home.

88
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:14,917
Yes.

89
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:18,126
Kowtow to your ancestors, not to me.

90
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:20,126
Mother.

91
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:22,084
My grandson.

92
00:08:23,084 --> 00:08:24,417
So cute.

93
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:26,126
Look at Him.

94
00:08:28,834 --> 00:08:30,042
Have you named him yet?

95
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:31,626
I want to call him...

96
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:34,709
Phoenix... give him a girl's name,

97
00:08:34,876 --> 00:08:37,334
to fool the demons so he'll grow up well.

98
00:08:37,501 --> 00:08:38,626
Phoenix...

99
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:54,126
Get me two eggs.

100
00:08:55,084 --> 00:08:55,834
Pass me the ginger.

101
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:57,626
The soup is ready, turn down the stove.

102
00:08:58,834 --> 00:09:00,584
The fish looks very delicious.

103
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:02,459
Hurry.

104
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,459
Clean up the kitchen.

105
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:10,501
Let's eat.

106
00:09:11,001 --> 00:09:12,292
Let's eat.

107
00:09:13,251 --> 00:09:15,209
Stop playing, Skinny.

108
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:17,334
Come here and eat.

109
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:20,876
Dinner is ready.

110
00:09:21,042 --> 00:09:23,626
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

111
00:09:25,042 --> 00:09:28,334
Let's eat... Phoenix. Let's eat.

112
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:31,334
Good boy.

113
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:34,417
Let's eat.

114
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:41,292
Sorry.

115
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:49,167
Let's eat.

116
00:09:49,376 --> 00:09:50,917
Let's eat, Mother.

117
00:09:51,334 --> 00:09:54,126
Let's eat.

118
00:09:56,626 --> 00:09:59,751
The food in San Francisco is not for man.

119
00:09:59,917 --> 00:10:01,751
It's for those devils.

120
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:03,917
It's for those foreign devils.

121
00:10:04,084 --> 00:10:05,376
Those steaks and potatoes...

122
00:10:05,542 --> 00:10:06,751
There's no place like home, I like rice...

123
00:10:06,917 --> 00:10:10,376
Chuen, don't talk with your mouth full.

124
00:10:11,167 --> 00:10:13,167
- Right, Mother.
- Good boy...

125
00:10:13,334 --> 00:10:14,292
You know why I

126
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:16,417
named him Phoenix?

127
00:10:16,584 --> 00:10:17,584
Why?

128
00:10:17,876 --> 00:10:19,084
He's born in wartime.

129
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:23,959
I want him to rise like a phoenix in a fire.

130
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:26,751
Back in San Francisco, I already...

131
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:31,959
I told you not to talk with your mouth full.

132
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,251
Right, Mother.

133
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:54,917
Kiddo, this house is full of women,

134
00:10:55,084 --> 00:10:57,001
and with a girl's name like Phoenix,

135
00:10:57,167 --> 00:10:59,542
you might grow up to be a sissy.

136
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:03,709
Let me help you be a man.

137
00:11:06,376 --> 00:11:09,792
Does he look like me?

138
00:11:11,084 --> 00:11:14,542
Oh my goodness. Leave him alone.

139
00:11:15,126 --> 00:11:18,542
Ngan, please take Phoenix.

140
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:20,459
- Phoenix.
- Look at you.

141
00:11:20,626 --> 00:11:22,751
What has he done to you?

142
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:25,167
I'll put you to bed, all right?

143
00:11:25,334 --> 00:11:26,792
Clean him up.

144
00:11:27,167 --> 00:11:28,542
Don't worry.

145
00:11:28,834 --> 00:11:31,126
Go. Phoenix has gone to bed.

146
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:46,626
When I met you,

147
00:11:47,876 --> 00:11:50,376
your hands were soft

148
00:11:51,084 --> 00:11:54,792
and smooth.

149
00:11:55,334 --> 00:11:58,667
Now they're coarse and yellow...

150
00:12:00,501 --> 00:12:02,876
Thanks to your pipe.

151
00:12:04,417 --> 00:12:06,209
Who knows

152
00:12:06,376 --> 00:12:09,834
when the Japs will be here?

153
00:12:11,042 --> 00:12:14,251
Let's hope the Brits can hold them off.

154
00:12:21,542 --> 00:12:24,792
Actually, what's important is

155
00:12:25,542 --> 00:12:28,251
for our family to be in a piece

156
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:30,417
and to be together.

157
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:48,542
Go to sleep, Phoenix.

158
00:13:19,084 --> 00:13:22,834
Our house was always bustling.

159
00:13:23,001 --> 00:13:25,251
Father worked hard to support us

160
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:27,709
while Mother looked after everyone.

161
00:13:27,876 --> 00:13:31,542
The days went by quickly.

162
00:13:48,792 --> 00:13:50,584
Don't bother with make-up,

163
00:13:50,751 --> 00:13:52,709
the show will probably be canceled.

164
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:53,917
Why?

165
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:55,834
The Japs dropped a bomb in Shatin.

166
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,251
They'll be crossing the Lo Wu Bridge soon.

167
00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:01,959
Forget the show.

168
00:14:02,126 --> 00:14:04,167
Let's go home.

169
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,626
You're so lucky, Mother.

170
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:41,709
The Japs are at our front door

171
00:14:41,876 --> 00:14:44,834
but you don't have to worry anymore.

172
00:14:50,876 --> 00:14:55,292
The family is still together.

173
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:58,001
Phoenix is coming to his senses.

174
00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:00,001
Don't worry.

175
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:05,876
Open up.

176
00:15:06,042 --> 00:15:07,417
Brother Chuen?

177
00:15:07,751 --> 00:15:09,001
Open the door.

178
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:10,584
Open up.

179
00:15:13,001 --> 00:15:14,834
So this is the Lee residence.

180
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,501
Go inside... hurry.

181
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:22,834
Go with Auntie Ngan.

182
00:15:23,042 --> 00:15:24,584
Go inside... hurry.

183
00:15:29,792 --> 00:15:35,251
General Wakuda wants to
meet the famous actor Lee Hoi-chuen.

184
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:38,542
I want your whole family to come out.

185
00:15:55,334 --> 00:15:56,709
Yes.

186
00:16:02,876 --> 00:16:05,209
Wakuda-san wants to

187
00:16:05,376 --> 00:16:09,334
use Mr Lee's popularity

188
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:14,542
to incite your fellow actors to
serve the Japanese Imperial Army.

189
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:17,417
I'm flattered

190
00:16:17,584 --> 00:16:21,292
but I'm only an actor trying to support a family.

191
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:25,542
I'm afraid I can't manage.

192
00:16:28,084 --> 00:16:32,834
Don't be stupid, Mr Lee.

193
00:16:33,584 --> 00:16:36,751
Actors like me can only entertain the people.

194
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:41,626
I can't help you

195
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:45,376
keep a facade of peace and stability.

196
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:49,251
That's what the Greater East Asia
Co-Prosperity Sphere is about.

197
00:16:49,417 --> 00:16:55,084
Me and the Imperial Army are serving the people.

198
00:16:55,251 --> 00:16:57,834
My brother said no. Get lost.

199
00:16:58,209 --> 00:16:59,542
Go away.

200
00:17:05,334 --> 00:17:06,667
If he won't,

201
00:17:06,834 --> 00:17:09,459
perhaps you can dance for the troops.

202
00:17:09,626 --> 00:17:11,626
Let go of me, asshole.

203
00:17:11,792 --> 00:17:13,459
Bitch.

204
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,251
- Traitor.
- Idiot.

205
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:18,751
I'm sorry, Mr Wakuda.

206
00:17:18,917 --> 00:17:20,792
I'm so sorry, Mr Wakuda.

207
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,209
Please forgive her naivete.

208
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,501
Please forgive her... I'm so sorry.

209
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:27,584
Can't you walk properly?

210
00:17:30,126 --> 00:17:32,917
Apologize if you don't want to die. Say it.

211
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:35,292
I'm sorry...

212
00:17:35,459 --> 00:17:36,209
Sorry.

213
00:17:36,376 --> 00:17:38,251
Louder.

214
00:17:39,126 --> 00:17:41,167
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm so sorry.

215
00:17:41,376 --> 00:17:43,001
Bruce.

216
00:17:45,084 --> 00:17:46,501
I'm sorry.

217
00:17:47,459 --> 00:17:50,459
I'm sorry...

218
00:17:50,751 --> 00:17:53,042
I'm sorry...

219
00:17:53,209 --> 00:17:54,834
I'll handle this.

220
00:17:55,001 --> 00:17:57,042
I'm sorry.

221
00:17:58,417 --> 00:18:06,292
I'm sorry.

222
00:18:06,834 --> 00:18:13,251
About the show... wise up

223
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:16,417
and do the right thing.

224
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:23,417
My name is Ngai.

225
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:27,167
Goodbye.

226
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:40,876
Sorry...

227
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:24,917
After the endless 3 years and 8 months,

228
00:19:25,084 --> 00:19:28,084
Japan was defeated and Hong Kong was liberated.

229
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:33,876
Prosperity was restored and
life went back to normal.

230
00:19:36,501 --> 00:19:41,126
Father continued to act while the kids grew up.

231
00:19:41,501 --> 00:19:44,626
Everything was fine again in the Lee Family.

232
00:19:56,584 --> 00:19:58,084
The baby kicked me again.

233
00:19:59,001 --> 00:20:00,251
I won.

234
00:20:00,417 --> 00:20:03,292
You're so lucky. I'm sure you'll win today.

235
00:20:08,126 --> 00:20:11,167
It's Margaret's turn. She's our guest.

236
00:20:12,209 --> 00:20:14,001
Thanks,Phoebe.

237
00:20:14,709 --> 00:20:16,751
- Is the been ready yet?
- Get me two eggs.

238
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:18,251
OK. OK.

239
00:20:18,834 --> 00:20:21,001
Where's the sausage?

240
00:20:22,626 --> 00:20:24,751
I'll kill you Japs.

241
00:20:28,001 --> 00:20:29,209
Here comes the anti-Japanese fighter.

242
00:20:29,376 --> 00:20:32,334
Stop it, Phoenix. Stop it.

243
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:37,042
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

244
00:20:37,209 --> 00:20:40,667
I'll kill you Jap for bullying Margaret.

245
00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:57,042
Father was enjoying a rare day off
when a guest dropped by.

246
00:20:57,376 --> 00:20:58,709
His name was Leung Sing-po.

247
00:20:59,251 --> 00:21:02,042
Don't be mad, I'll buy you dinner.

248
00:21:02,209 --> 00:21:04,917
- What a crowd.
- I'm lucky today.

249
00:21:05,209 --> 00:21:07,126
I'll get out of your way.

250
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:10,542
- Honey.
- Daddy.

251
00:21:10,709 --> 00:21:12,959
Be a good girl, Honey.

252
00:21:13,501 --> 00:21:14,792
Sir.

253
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:17,876
Sir.

254
00:21:19,209 --> 00:21:20,917
Po.

255
00:21:21,084 --> 00:21:22,667
I came to pick up my brat.

256
00:21:22,834 --> 00:21:25,459
What's your hurry? Sit down

257
00:21:25,876 --> 00:21:27,667
and have a smoke.

258
00:21:27,834 --> 00:21:30,042
No thanks, I smoke cigars in Singapore.

259
00:21:30,209 --> 00:21:32,084
Help yourself.

260
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:34,334
What have you been up to lately?

261
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:37,001
I just finished a run

262
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:38,959
with "Fa Kam Sau" in Guangzhou.

263
00:21:39,126 --> 00:21:42,751
I'll stay in Hong Kong after the New Year.

264
00:21:42,917 --> 00:21:43,917
Good. You should come back.

265
00:21:44,084 --> 00:21:47,251
When would you get me into films?

266
00:21:47,417 --> 00:21:48,709
That will be swell.

267
00:21:48,876 --> 00:21:50,251
I'll speak to the directors.

268
00:21:50,417 --> 00:21:52,626
- I'm counting on you.
- You're welcome.

269
00:21:54,626 --> 00:21:55,501
What?

270
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:56,751
I won.

271
00:21:56,917 --> 00:21:59,084
- Pay up.
- Look.

272
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:01,667
You're a tile short. This one doesn't count.

273
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:04,417
What's the racket? Did someone win?

274
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:07,626
Get off it.

275
00:22:07,751 --> 00:22:08,751
I think my baby is coming out.

276
00:22:08,917 --> 00:22:09,959
You can't be...

277
00:22:10,126 --> 00:22:11,751
Chuen. Your wife is having the baby.

278
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:16,042
Help her to her room.

279
00:22:19,667 --> 00:22:21,376
Over here.

280
00:22:21,751 --> 00:22:27,251
Ready. 1, 2, 3, smile.

281
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:42,792
Aim carefully.

282
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:44,292
How could I miss?

283
00:22:44,459 --> 00:22:46,792
Gosh, way too bad.

284
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:51,459
You lost again.

285
00:22:54,709 --> 00:22:57,667
- Damn.
- it's a piece of cake.

286
00:22:59,292 --> 00:23:01,709
- Great. We won.
- Brilliant.

287
00:23:06,834 --> 00:23:07,292
Run.

288
00:23:07,459 --> 00:23:08,501
He stole our marbles.

289
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:11,834
Stop there, you son of a bitch. Go after him.

290
00:23:12,709 --> 00:23:15,084
Run faster.

291
00:23:15,334 --> 00:23:16,501
How dare you took from me.

292
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:19,334
- Come back.
- Over there.

293
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:22,542
Kiddo, what's wrong with you?

294
00:23:28,501 --> 00:23:30,709
- You bastard.
- Bastard.

295
00:23:30,834 --> 00:23:32,501
Serve you right for taking my marbles.

296
00:23:33,834 --> 00:23:36,042
How dare you try to rip me off.

297
00:23:36,209 --> 00:23:37,209
Stop it.

298
00:23:37,376 --> 00:23:39,292
I will return them to you.

299
00:23:40,709 --> 00:23:42,459
You'll be my Chief, alright?

300
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:43,542
What's your name?

301
00:23:43,751 --> 00:23:45,001
Unicorn.

302
00:23:45,167 --> 00:23:47,001
- Do you know who I am?
- Yes

303
00:23:47,167 --> 00:23:50,876
You're Lee Hoi-chuen's son, Phoenix.

304
00:23:51,376 --> 00:23:52,292
You know me?

305
00:23:52,459 --> 00:23:55,876
My father Choi Fei-I am is a stuntman.

306
00:23:56,042 --> 00:23:57,501
I've seen you before.

307
00:23:57,667 --> 00:23:59,126
Then I'll let you go.

308
00:23:59,292 --> 00:24:01,376
- He's the Chief now.
- Yes.

309
00:24:01,542 --> 00:24:02,834
Chief.

310
00:24:03,001 --> 00:24:04,209
Thanks. Chief.

311
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:05,834
Why did you kick me?

312
00:24:06,001 --> 00:24:08,126
Your old man is a stuntman.
You should fight better.

313
00:24:08,292 --> 00:24:09,209
Come fight with me.

314
00:24:09,376 --> 00:24:12,376
Give him a hand, Skinny.

315
00:24:12,542 --> 00:24:14,667
Tell your friends to jump in.

316
00:24:14,834 --> 00:24:16,251
You're such a sloppy cat.

317
00:24:40,042 --> 00:24:41,709
- Great.
- Brilliant.

318
00:24:41,876 --> 00:24:43,834
You know what's in the box?

319
00:24:44,834 --> 00:24:46,292
Mail?

320
00:24:46,459 --> 00:24:51,417
Wrong. They hang rat bins on lamp posts.

321
00:24:51,584 --> 00:24:54,084
Hanging rat bins on lamp posts.

322
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:55,751
Here's another one.

323
00:24:59,334 --> 00:25:02,834
A rat. Grab it, don't let it get away.

324
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:12,334
You go first.

325
00:25:22,209 --> 00:25:23,917
Damn you, Skinny.

326
00:25:24,084 --> 00:25:25,376
You stink.

327
00:25:58,626 --> 00:26:00,209
OK.

328
00:26:03,917 --> 00:26:05,251
Don't get smug.

329
00:26:05,417 --> 00:26:07,209
I can smell you from a mile away.

330
00:26:07,376 --> 00:26:08,667
This is so unfair.

331
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:10,459
Get down on your knees.

332
00:26:12,876 --> 00:26:15,042
Tell me what you have done.

333
00:26:15,209 --> 00:26:17,584
I picked a fight, played hooky
and climbed up the pipes.

334
00:26:17,751 --> 00:26:19,251
What else?

335
00:26:19,417 --> 00:26:21,209
- What have you done?
- Ouch.

336
00:26:21,376 --> 00:26:23,459
How many times did I tell you?

337
00:26:23,626 --> 00:26:26,709
How can I face Master Chuen? Why won't you listen?

338
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:30,001
- Skinny's Mom.
- When will you ever learn?

339
00:26:32,209 --> 00:26:33,459
Don't hit him.

340
00:26:33,626 --> 00:26:37,209
It's my fault. I failed to discipline him.

341
00:26:39,376 --> 00:26:42,126
Go inside.

342
00:26:42,292 --> 00:26:45,876
You should look after Master Phoenix,

343
00:26:47,209 --> 00:26:49,042
What are you doing? Give me that.

344
00:26:49,209 --> 00:26:51,792
She's telling me I can't discipline my son.

345
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:53,209
He's too little to get a beating.

346
00:26:53,376 --> 00:26:56,084
I must discipline him while he's little. Go away.

347
00:26:56,251 --> 00:26:58,042
Sit down.

348
00:27:02,042 --> 00:27:04,751
What have you done? The cops were here.

349
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:06,126
I did nothing illegal.

350
00:27:09,251 --> 00:27:10,542
No? You broke every rat bin

351
00:27:10,709 --> 00:27:11,626
on the street.

352
00:27:11,792 --> 00:27:13,626
You're getting out of hand.

353
00:27:16,084 --> 00:27:18,584
Why are you crying? I haven't even started.

354
00:27:18,876 --> 00:27:20,626
Peter.

355
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:24,251
You should watch your little brother.

356
00:27:27,417 --> 00:27:29,417
Stop crying. Phoebe.

357
00:27:29,584 --> 00:27:32,376
I know you tipped him off.

358
00:27:32,542 --> 00:27:35,501
And you, Agnes, you knew but didn't tell me.

359
00:27:35,667 --> 00:27:38,209
You all covered up for him.

360
00:27:40,334 --> 00:27:42,876
Kowtow to your ancestors. 200 times each.

361
00:27:58,417 --> 00:27:59,751
Welcome, Mr Fung.

362
00:28:03,251 --> 00:28:04,834
What's going on?

363
00:28:07,501 --> 00:28:10,001
What brings you here?

364
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:13,167
I want to talk to you about Phoenix.

365
00:28:13,334 --> 00:28:15,001
Phoenix?

366
00:28:15,209 --> 00:28:18,751
Yuen Po-wan wrote an excellent script.
I'm directing it.

367
00:28:18,917 --> 00:28:22,292
I want Phoenix for the lead.

368
00:28:24,417 --> 00:28:27,376
Him? In a film? No.

369
00:28:27,542 --> 00:28:30,917
He has the talent. He takes after you.

370
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:34,001
The role is tailor-made for him.

371
00:28:34,126 --> 00:28:37,292
It's a good opportunity. Think about it.

372
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:41,042
Have some tea.

373
00:28:45,042 --> 00:28:46,501
Chuen.

374
00:28:47,334 --> 00:28:49,959
Mr Fung has a good point.

375
00:28:50,126 --> 00:28:53,667
He even gave him a name:

376
00:28:54,709 --> 00:28:57,251
Lee Siu-lung, the Little Dragon.

377
00:28:58,084 --> 00:29:00,167
Little Dragon?

378
00:29:00,792 --> 00:29:05,126
It suits him.

379
00:29:05,917 --> 00:29:07,834
He's born in the year of the Dragon.

380
00:29:16,501 --> 00:29:20,167
I'll think about it.

381
00:29:23,376 --> 00:29:25,834
Little Dragon.

382
00:29:27,292 --> 00:29:33,292
Cool. I can skip school and act.

383
00:29:35,084 --> 00:29:36,751
Cool.

384
00:29:36,917 --> 00:29:40,542
Follow him from the door.

385
00:29:40,709 --> 00:29:42,417
Bruce Lee, stand by.

386
00:29:42,709 --> 00:29:44,292
Right here.

387
00:29:45,376 --> 00:29:47,126
Yes, stop right here.

388
00:29:47,334 --> 00:29:48,876
Phoenix,

389
00:29:49,084 --> 00:29:50,876
I mean Dragon.

390
00:29:51,084 --> 00:29:53,292
This is what I want you to do...

391
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:54,917
I'll hide in here

392
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,001
and you'll let me out.

393
00:29:57,167 --> 00:29:58,709
Still remember my name in the film?

394
00:29:58,917 --> 00:30:01,751
You're Flying Dagger Lee.

395
00:30:01,917 --> 00:30:03,584
Brilliant.

396
00:30:03,917 --> 00:30:05,751
Action.

397
00:30:16,501 --> 00:30:17,334
Where are the cops?

398
00:30:17,501 --> 00:30:19,917
They're gone, you better split.

399
00:30:21,084 --> 00:30:23,542
Want some money, kid?

400
00:30:23,709 --> 00:30:26,751
No. Let me double check.

401
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:35,459
They're gone?

402
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:36,542
Gone.

403
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:37,917
Listen up, kid.

404
00:30:38,126 --> 00:30:40,501
If someone bullies you from now on,

405
00:30:40,709 --> 00:30:43,334
look for me at No. 4, Tai Yuan Lane.

406
00:30:43,501 --> 00:30:45,626
Just ask for Flying Dagger Lee.

407
00:30:45,792 --> 00:30:48,042
Flying Dagger Lee, right?

408
00:30:48,209 --> 00:30:49,251
You better go.

409
00:30:49,417 --> 00:30:50,917
Right.

410
00:30:53,542 --> 00:30:54,792
Close the door.

411
00:30:57,834 --> 00:31:00,001
Cut. How was it?

412
00:31:00,209 --> 00:31:01,167
No problem.

413
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:02,751
You did good.

414
00:31:02,917 --> 00:31:03,959
You bet.

415
00:31:04,126 --> 00:31:04,876
Next.

416
00:31:05,042 --> 00:31:07,251
Since then, not only Phoebe,

417
00:31:07,417 --> 00:31:10,626
but our whole family became Bruce's fans.

418
00:31:10,792 --> 00:31:12,959
He made a dozen more films

419
00:31:13,126 --> 00:31:16,167
and became a big star.

420
00:31:45,501 --> 00:31:48,084
Peter, you'll represent

421
00:31:48,251 --> 00:31:52,542
La Salle at the Inter-school Fencing Tournament.

422
00:31:52,709 --> 00:31:55,792
I'll do my best, Father Andrew.

423
00:31:56,709 --> 00:31:59,251
How's your brother

424
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,334
at St. Francis Xavier?

425
00:32:02,501 --> 00:32:04,501
He came in No. 41

426
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:06,501
in a class of 42.

427
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:09,542
That's not bad, considering
he's always playing hooky.

428
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:42,042
Where do you live?

429
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:43,876
She lives next door to us.

430
00:32:44,042 --> 00:32:45,417
What's your name?

431
00:33:05,959 --> 00:33:08,584
Did you notice how pretty my partner is?

432
00:33:08,751 --> 00:33:10,709
Yours is so-so.

433
00:33:10,917 --> 00:33:12,417
I'm not as fussy as you.

434
00:33:12,584 --> 00:33:13,917
Good for you.

435
00:33:14,084 --> 00:33:16,001
Cut the crap, Sloppy Cat.

436
00:33:16,376 --> 00:33:17,084
This is my cousin's friend,

437
00:33:17,251 --> 00:33:18,751
Lau Lin-kong. He's from the U.K.

438
00:33:18,917 --> 00:33:19,876
Call me Kong.

439
00:33:20,042 --> 00:33:20,876
Hi, Kong.

440
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:22,584
You danced very well.

441
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:23,501
Thanks.

442
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:26,667
From hanging out with the Brits?
No one dance like that in Hong Kong.

443
00:33:28,667 --> 00:33:30,334
Are you jealous?

444
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:34,959
She likes a good looking guy, not you.

445
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:40,792
Me? Jealous of him?
Girls fall for me right and left.

446
00:33:46,084 --> 00:33:50,334
I dare you to go over there
and see who she'll choose.

447
00:33:50,584 --> 00:33:53,001
Don't embarrass yourself, Sloppy Cat.

448
00:34:07,126 --> 00:34:09,709
You? She'll dance with you.

449
00:34:13,001 --> 00:34:14,584
Elvis Piggy comes.

450
00:34:14,834 --> 00:34:17,084
May I?

451
00:34:17,334 --> 00:34:18,959
You're both so cute.

452
00:34:19,126 --> 00:34:21,876
I can't decide.

453
00:34:52,542 --> 00:34:54,459
What? The power is out?

454
00:34:58,417 --> 00:34:59,667
May.

455
00:34:59,834 --> 00:35:01,209
Maybe next time.

456
00:35:01,417 --> 00:35:02,959
You think you're Elvis?

457
00:35:03,126 --> 00:35:05,417
I know Elvis of the Orient,

458
00:35:05,584 --> 00:35:07,792
but who are you?

459
00:35:12,792 --> 00:35:14,334
Move over.

460
00:35:17,667 --> 00:35:19,667
Margaret, you better come with me.

461
00:35:20,376 --> 00:35:21,876
You know this place?

462
00:35:22,042 --> 00:35:24,084
We all paid 50 cents to get in.

463
00:35:24,251 --> 00:35:26,792
My old man owns this joint.

464
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:28,667
You're on my turf.

465
00:35:28,834 --> 00:35:31,626
I can't help it
if the girls prefer to dance with me.

466
00:35:31,792 --> 00:35:33,584
Get lost.

467
00:35:35,917 --> 00:35:37,251
Get lost.

468
00:35:37,459 --> 00:35:39,417
You want to pick a fight?

469
00:35:39,584 --> 00:35:41,584
Get lost if you know what's good for you

470
00:35:47,167 --> 00:35:48,501
Run.

471
00:35:49,584 --> 00:35:51,501
Don't let them get away.

472
00:35:54,126 --> 00:35:55,251
Get them.

473
00:35:58,459 --> 00:35:59,792
- Stop.
- Move away.

474
00:35:59,959 --> 00:36:03,084
Move or I'll run over you...

475
00:36:03,376 --> 00:36:05,584
- Hurry, Bruce.
- Move.

476
00:36:05,751 --> 00:36:08,167
This is for pedestrians.

477
00:36:11,417 --> 00:36:14,001
- Stop them.
- Don't move.

478
00:36:15,626 --> 00:36:17,292
Stop. Don't move.

479
00:36:18,292 --> 00:36:19,542
Run.

480
00:36:19,709 --> 00:36:21,501
Why did you ditch the bike?

481
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:23,501
I can't ride a bike.

482
00:36:24,334 --> 00:36:25,417
They're coming.

483
00:36:25,584 --> 00:36:26,959
Meet up at the old joint.

484
00:36:29,209 --> 00:36:30,084
Stop.

485
00:36:30,251 --> 00:36:33,334
Hop on, Bruce. Hurry.

486
00:36:33,501 --> 00:36:34,626
Hurry. Don't let them get away.

487
00:36:45,959 --> 00:36:49,792
I came back for you, Phoenix.

488
00:36:50,376 --> 00:36:54,376
Bruce Lee can't ride a bike.

489
00:36:56,376 --> 00:36:58,542
Bruce Lee can't ride a bike.

490
00:37:07,501 --> 00:37:09,209
Bastard.

491
00:37:34,042 --> 00:37:37,126
Skinny, you really crushed them.

492
00:37:37,292 --> 00:37:40,126
Your cat claws weren't so bad either.

493
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:42,251
You bet. I can claw 10 at a time.

494
00:37:42,417 --> 00:37:44,209
But nothing like Phoenix.

495
00:37:44,376 --> 00:37:46,376
He took on 20.

496
00:37:46,542 --> 00:37:48,751
You're flattering me.

497
00:37:49,876 --> 00:37:52,417
At least, nobody lost a tooth.

498
00:37:52,584 --> 00:37:53,667
It was my fault.

499
00:37:53,834 --> 00:37:55,709
If you hadn't come back for me,
we wouldn't be in such a mess.

500
00:37:55,876 --> 00:37:57,376
I'm sorry to have dragged you into this.

501
00:37:57,584 --> 00:38:00,584
We're buddies through thick and thin.

502
00:38:00,709 --> 00:38:04,959
We'll chase girls and spend some money.

503
00:38:05,126 --> 00:38:05,709
In your dreams.

504
00:38:05,876 --> 00:38:06,834
Hey, that hurts.

505
00:38:07,001 --> 00:38:07,792
Really?

506
00:38:07,959 --> 00:38:09,542
Yes.

507
00:38:09,709 --> 00:38:11,584
Does it hurt here?

508
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:16,667
Come here...

509
00:38:16,834 --> 00:38:18,959
Get him.

510
00:38:21,709 --> 00:38:23,209
Stop.

511
00:38:35,709 --> 00:38:37,126
Go first.

512
00:38:51,626 --> 00:38:53,584
You stink.

513
00:39:35,376 --> 00:39:36,959
You went on a date?

514
00:39:37,126 --> 00:39:38,792
What about you? Another fight?

515
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,792
You should talk.

516
00:39:40,959 --> 00:39:44,334
Father is performing in Cheung Chau tonight.

517
00:39:44,501 --> 00:39:45,834
No need to worry.

518
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:06,751
Girls, why were you out so late?

519
00:40:07,584 --> 00:40:09,626
We went to the 7:30 show.

520
00:40:09,792 --> 00:40:11,459
We saw "Waterloo Bridge."

521
00:40:11,626 --> 00:40:14,792
it's after 11.

522
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:18,001
Why didn't you come straight home?

523
00:40:18,751 --> 00:40:20,626
I'm sorry.

524
00:40:25,376 --> 00:40:29,834
Look at you. You're in black and blue again.

525
00:40:30,584 --> 00:40:31,667
It's not his fault.

526
00:40:31,834 --> 00:40:35,584
I picked the fight. He was bailing me out.

527
00:40:35,751 --> 00:40:37,626
Skinny.

528
00:40:38,126 --> 00:40:39,876
I'm not asking you.

529
00:40:42,501 --> 00:40:44,042
I'm responsible for my own mistakes.

530
00:40:44,209 --> 00:40:46,709
I'll kowtow to the ancestors.

531
00:40:47,209 --> 00:40:48,876
No, it was my fault.

532
00:40:49,042 --> 00:40:50,834
No, it was mine.

533
00:40:51,001 --> 00:40:52,459
It was my fault.

534
00:40:52,626 --> 00:40:56,876
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- I'm sorry.

535
00:40:57,042 --> 00:41:00,542
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

536
00:41:00,751 --> 00:41:03,751
- It was my fault.
- I'm sorry.

537
00:41:03,876 --> 00:41:06,917
Get down, Robert.

538
00:41:07,542 --> 00:41:09,417
- I'm sorry.
- Kowtow to the ancestors.

539
00:41:09,584 --> 00:41:13,251
- I'm sorry.
- It was my fault.

540
00:41:24,876 --> 00:41:27,084
I want you to learn,

541
00:41:27,792 --> 00:41:30,042
not just to kowtow.

542
00:41:31,251 --> 00:41:35,334
Your Father works hard for this family.

543
00:41:35,917 --> 00:41:43,001
You get out of hand when he's away.

544
00:41:44,292 --> 00:41:47,501
You're all being insensible.

545
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:55,959
How can you face your Father?

546
00:41:58,084 --> 00:42:00,751
Sorry, Mom. We'll be good.

547
00:42:02,042 --> 00:42:03,751
Sorry, Mom.

548
00:42:03,917 --> 00:42:05,959
We won't go out at night anymore.

549
00:42:06,126 --> 00:42:08,042
We won't go out at night.

550
00:42:15,292 --> 00:42:17,126
There's more, Miss Phoebe.

551
00:42:17,292 --> 00:42:18,542
Thanks.

552
00:42:19,251 --> 00:42:20,626
This is for you, Phoenix.

553
00:42:20,792 --> 00:42:21,626
No thanks.

554
00:42:21,792 --> 00:42:23,876
It's for your eye. Not for you to eat.

555
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:25,417
Your eye is swollen.

556
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:26,917
Save it for your ass.

557
00:42:27,167 --> 00:42:28,126
Let me do it.

558
00:42:28,292 --> 00:42:31,251
Stop it. Hurry up, we'll be late for school.

559
00:42:31,417 --> 00:42:33,376
Hurry, Robert. Finish that egg.

560
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:35,334
Open the door.

561
00:42:36,542 --> 00:42:38,126
Open the door.

562
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:43,167
This is a warrant

563
00:42:43,334 --> 00:42:46,376
to Search your house.

564
00:42:46,959 --> 00:42:48,459
Get in.

565
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:49,792
I've been here before.

566
00:42:49,959 --> 00:42:51,501
Where's the famous Lee Hoi-chuen?

567
00:42:51,667 --> 00:42:54,667
What do you want? He's not here.

568
00:42:55,876 --> 00:42:58,501
Please have a seat, Mr Robinson.

569
00:42:58,667 --> 00:42:59,917
Serve tea.

570
00:43:00,084 --> 00:43:02,376
Want a smoke?

571
00:43:08,042 --> 00:43:09,501
A cigarette

572
00:43:09,667 --> 00:43:12,542
won't make your trouble go away.

573
00:43:14,251 --> 00:43:17,209
If your husband is an ordinary smoker,

574
00:43:17,376 --> 00:43:19,959
it'd be simple, but

575
00:43:22,834 --> 00:43:24,334
he's into that...

576
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:26,042
Men, take action. Search the house.

577
00:43:26,209 --> 00:43:26,917
Yes, sir.

578
00:43:27,084 --> 00:43:28,042
What are you looking for?

579
00:43:28,209 --> 00:43:30,251
You know damn well.

580
00:43:30,709 --> 00:43:32,001
Phoenix.

581
00:43:32,292 --> 00:43:34,042
I know you. Traitor.

582
00:43:34,209 --> 00:43:35,667
What are you doing here?

583
00:43:37,542 --> 00:43:39,042
I know you too.

584
00:43:39,209 --> 00:43:40,376
You're the old maid.

585
00:43:40,542 --> 00:43:42,376
Don't argue with him, Auntie.

586
00:43:52,792 --> 00:43:54,292
Hong Kong is British colony.

587
00:43:54,459 --> 00:43:56,084
You are under British law.

588
00:43:56,251 --> 00:44:00,876
Smoking opium is a very serious offense,
do you understand?

589
00:44:21,251 --> 00:44:23,917
My husband always smokes when he is performing.

590
00:44:24,084 --> 00:44:28,959
This is a very common habit
among all entertainers.

591
00:44:29,251 --> 00:44:30,584
For your information, Sir.

592
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:36,626
Smoking opium is a tradition that
was left from the last Chinese empire.

593
00:44:36,792 --> 00:44:38,834
The British caused the Opium War, didn't they?

594
00:44:39,001 --> 00:44:40,251
Shut up, Phoenix.

595
00:44:48,042 --> 00:44:52,709
Mr Robinson, is there any way at all

596
00:44:52,876 --> 00:44:54,626
that you could perhaps...

597
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:56,959
over the situation?

598
00:44:59,459 --> 00:45:02,792
Of course.

599
00:45:04,126 --> 00:45:08,459
But that'll depend on you.

600
00:45:14,626 --> 00:45:16,001
Here. Treat yourself to a meal.

601
00:45:17,501 --> 00:45:21,167
We have a very big precinct.

602
00:45:21,334 --> 00:45:22,917
Not to mention I don't fancy tea.

603
00:45:23,084 --> 00:45:25,042
The boys prefer to go drinking.

604
00:45:25,167 --> 00:45:27,251
How much do you want?

605
00:45:28,042 --> 00:45:30,042
Let's go straight to the chase.

606
00:45:30,167 --> 00:45:32,042
At least cough up a brown one.

607
00:45:32,167 --> 00:45:33,334
That's too greedy.

608
00:45:33,501 --> 00:45:35,209
$500 can buy a flat in Sham Shui Po.

609
00:45:35,376 --> 00:45:37,459
It's your call.

610
00:45:37,626 --> 00:45:40,376
Why didn't they shoot a running dog like you?

611
00:45:40,542 --> 00:45:42,209
That's all I have.

612
00:45:46,334 --> 00:45:47,542
That'll do, Sir.

613
00:45:47,709 --> 00:45:49,792
Let's go.

614
00:45:50,042 --> 00:45:52,251
Shall we confiscate the evidence, Sir?

615
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:53,917
What evidence?

616
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:56,334
We found nothing here today.

617
00:45:57,751 --> 00:45:59,167
Ladies.

618
00:46:02,209 --> 00:46:03,834
See you later.

619
00:46:11,626 --> 00:46:13,126
Mother.

620
00:46:38,626 --> 00:46:40,667
What about your voice?

621
00:47:15,126 --> 00:47:16,001
Want a smoke?

622
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:17,292
It's bad for you. You should quit.

623
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:20,001
This is nothing compared to my Father's addiction.

624
00:47:20,167 --> 00:47:22,501
When I'm bored,

625
00:47:22,667 --> 00:47:25,876
smoking helps me think.

626
00:47:26,167 --> 00:47:28,001
What's taking her so long?

627
00:47:28,167 --> 00:47:31,584
A girl should keep us waiting.

628
00:47:33,959 --> 00:47:35,417
Here she is.

629
00:47:39,459 --> 00:47:41,667
- You...
- I'm sorry.

630
00:47:41,834 --> 00:47:43,876
Relax. It's only right for a girl

631
00:47:44,042 --> 00:47:45,459
to keep a guy waiting.

632
00:47:45,626 --> 00:47:47,751
Let's go see "Rebel Without a Cause."

633
00:47:47,917 --> 00:47:49,417
James Dean is in it.

634
00:47:49,584 --> 00:47:50,667
That's what I want to see, too.

635
00:47:50,834 --> 00:47:51,834
Are you Bruce Lee?

636
00:47:53,209 --> 00:47:54,251
Yes.

637
00:47:54,417 --> 00:47:55,959
Can I have your autograph?

638
00:47:56,126 --> 00:47:58,209
I'm a huge fan.

639
00:48:02,584 --> 00:48:03,626
Margaret, can I have yours too?

640
00:48:03,792 --> 00:48:05,001
My boyfriend likes you.

641
00:48:05,167 --> 00:48:06,292
Sure.

642
00:48:06,584 --> 00:48:08,459
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

643
00:48:09,167 --> 00:48:10,542
You both have fans?

644
00:48:10,709 --> 00:48:11,959
Why not?

645
00:48:12,126 --> 00:48:14,334
I've never been to a studio.

646
00:48:14,501 --> 00:48:16,334
When can you give me a tour?

647
00:48:16,501 --> 00:48:17,876
- We'll do it now.
- Great. Let's go.

648
00:48:18,042 --> 00:48:19,209
Let me drive.

649
00:48:19,501 --> 00:48:23,542
We're giving you the grand tour.

650
00:48:23,709 --> 00:48:26,542
You'll see

651
00:48:26,709 --> 00:48:28,667
the great Bruce Lee in action.

652
00:48:28,834 --> 00:48:32,001
You'll see Wong Fei-hung. He's my friend.

653
00:48:37,209 --> 00:48:38,542
Great

654
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:41,042
Phoenix.

655
00:48:42,042 --> 00:48:43,376
Ready.

656
00:48:43,542 --> 00:48:44,292
Scene 2.

657
00:48:44,459 --> 00:48:46,209
Action.

658
00:48:47,459 --> 00:48:48,834
Si-fung.

659
00:48:49,751 --> 00:48:51,042
Si-fung.

660
00:48:51,209 --> 00:48:52,626
What is it, Master Chung?

661
00:48:52,792 --> 00:48:54,917
Mother knows you're leaving.

662
00:48:55,084 --> 00:48:57,792
She wants me to give you $100.

663
00:48:57,959 --> 00:49:00,084
No, thank you.

664
00:49:00,251 --> 00:49:02,542
Please give it back to her.

665
00:49:03,167 --> 00:49:04,709
That means you're angry with us.

666
00:49:06,167 --> 00:49:08,292
I'm sorry about what happened today.

667
00:49:08,917 --> 00:49:11,251
I didn't mean it.

668
00:49:11,417 --> 00:49:14,501
I'm sorry about what happened today.

669
00:49:15,501 --> 00:49:20,417
Master Chung, take me...

670
00:49:20,584 --> 00:49:25,334
Si-fung, let's go inside the woodshed.

671
00:49:26,751 --> 00:49:29,667
Cut. Who's laughing?

672
00:49:29,834 --> 00:49:31,751
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

673
00:49:31,917 --> 00:49:34,751
You again? Stop messing around.

674
00:49:34,917 --> 00:49:37,167
Let's do it again.

675
00:49:37,376 --> 00:49:39,709
It's him. I'm not to blame.

676
00:49:43,209 --> 00:49:45,917
I'm romancing her and you're laughing.

677
00:49:46,084 --> 00:49:48,376
Your look not only makes me laugh.

678
00:49:48,542 --> 00:49:49,751
It makes me want to puke.

679
00:49:49,917 --> 00:49:52,084
Want to puke now?

680
00:49:53,292 --> 00:49:54,584
This is boring...

681
00:49:54,751 --> 00:49:55,626
Anything more exciting?

682
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:57,584
Melodrama is definitely boring.

683
00:49:57,751 --> 00:49:59,917
I'll show you something awesome.

684
00:50:00,084 --> 00:50:01,834
Let's go.

685
00:50:03,251 --> 00:50:05,959
This is another world.

686
00:50:06,459 --> 00:50:07,751
This is not only a studio.

687
00:50:08,042 --> 00:50:10,334
It's also a playground.

688
00:50:10,542 --> 00:50:12,709
Phoenix, let's go see Chun Siu-lei.

689
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:14,501
Who's that?

690
00:50:14,667 --> 00:50:17,042
She's the lead in "Lady Tan Kei"?

691
00:50:17,209 --> 00:50:18,709
Skinny, you are such a loser.

692
00:50:18,876 --> 00:50:20,459
You're a lecherous cat.

693
00:50:21,042 --> 00:50:21,834
Wong Fei-hung Vs Shek Kin.

694
00:50:22,001 --> 00:50:23,001
That's Shek Kin.

695
00:50:23,167 --> 00:50:24,126
Where's Wong Fei-hung?

696
00:50:24,334 --> 00:50:27,334
Just focus on me.

697
00:50:32,334 --> 00:50:33,084
Kin,

698
00:50:33,251 --> 00:50:35,251
you guys will kick down the door.

699
00:50:35,417 --> 00:50:38,001
Wah, your Leung Foon comes from over there.

700
00:50:38,167 --> 00:50:40,126
Let's do it.

701
00:50:40,334 --> 00:50:41,459
Wait.

702
00:50:41,626 --> 00:50:42,917
Shall we do the fight scene as well?

703
00:50:43,084 --> 00:50:43,959
Of course.

704
00:50:44,126 --> 00:50:45,959
You don't scare me.

705
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:49,126
I won't go easy on you.

706
00:50:52,376 --> 00:50:55,084
I'm a martial artist too.

707
00:50:55,251 --> 00:50:57,834
Are you ready?

708
00:50:58,001 --> 00:50:58,751
Anytime.

709
00:50:58,917 --> 00:50:59,834
Come on.

710
00:51:00,001 --> 00:51:01,459
Everyone, stand by.

711
00:51:01,626 --> 00:51:03,209
- it's rolling
- Here we go.

712
00:51:03,376 --> 00:51:05,376
Ready. Camera.

713
00:51:10,292 --> 00:51:11,459
If you won't mind your own business,

714
00:51:11,626 --> 00:51:13,251
you must deal with me.

715
00:51:17,542 --> 00:51:18,459
Who are you?

716
00:51:18,626 --> 00:51:19,834
My Master is in Guangzhou.

717
00:51:20,001 --> 00:51:22,876
You can take it up with me.

718
00:51:24,251 --> 00:51:26,667
I'm here to settle a score.

719
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:29,334
Wise up and step aside,

720
00:51:29,501 --> 00:51:31,292
or else...

721
00:51:33,042 --> 00:51:34,876
Tear down the Po Chi Lam sign.

722
00:51:38,209 --> 00:51:39,334
Here we go.

723
00:51:39,501 --> 00:51:40,709
This is the notorious Uncle Kin.

724
00:51:44,542 --> 00:51:46,209
How dare you.

725
00:51:49,376 --> 00:51:50,709
Uncle Kin is so cool.

726
00:51:54,834 --> 00:51:56,376
Stop.

727
00:51:58,417 --> 00:51:59,751
What now?

728
00:52:00,376 --> 00:52:02,584
You're not supposed to grab my face.

729
00:52:02,751 --> 00:52:05,751
I got carried away. It looks better that way.

730
00:52:05,917 --> 00:52:07,126
I have another shoot.

731
00:52:07,292 --> 00:52:09,084
Don't mess up my face.

732
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:11,542
Come on, let's do it again.

733
00:52:11,709 --> 00:52:13,084
Let's...

734
00:52:13,876 --> 00:52:15,459
Mr Iron Man?

735
00:52:18,126 --> 00:52:19,542
He's rusty.

736
00:52:20,251 --> 00:52:22,709
Chun Siu-lei isn't here or I'll introduce you.

737
00:52:22,876 --> 00:52:24,126
- Uncle Wah.
- Uncle Wah.

738
00:52:24,292 --> 00:52:26,876
Bruce, can I take a picture with him?

739
00:52:27,042 --> 00:52:29,459
Can my friend take a picture with you?

740
00:52:29,584 --> 00:52:30,751
Sure.

741
00:52:30,917 --> 00:52:32,376
I'll get that.

742
00:52:33,459 --> 00:52:35,792
1,2, 3.

743
00:52:36,167 --> 00:52:37,751
I'm counting on you for tomorrow's shoot.

744
00:52:37,917 --> 00:52:39,209
- OK.
- Better fight well.

745
00:52:39,376 --> 00:52:41,584
- Uncle Kin.
- You can count on me.

746
00:52:41,751 --> 00:52:44,459
Getting yourself in trouble again?

747
00:52:44,626 --> 00:52:46,459
No, I'm here to learn something.

748
00:52:46,626 --> 00:52:47,626
Uncle Kin.

749
00:52:47,876 --> 00:52:50,251
I'll take a picture for you.

750
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:51,584
Thanks, Uncle Kin.

751
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:52,792
Phoenix.

752
00:52:52,959 --> 00:52:54,959
You boys are showing off

753
00:52:55,126 --> 00:52:57,292
in Kowloon City, eh?

754
00:52:57,501 --> 00:52:59,209
- No.
- No.

755
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:00,959
Look over here.

756
00:53:01,126 --> 00:53:01,792
Tigers...

757
00:53:01,959 --> 00:53:02,792
of...

758
00:53:02,959 --> 00:53:03,501
Kowloon...

759
00:53:03,667 --> 00:53:05,251
City.

760
00:53:07,084 --> 00:53:09,376
- See you around.
- Thanks.

761
00:53:09,542 --> 00:53:11,751
Uncle Kin, can I take a picture of you?

762
00:53:12,126 --> 00:53:13,709
With him?

763
00:53:15,209 --> 00:53:16,626
I'll do it.

764
00:53:16,792 --> 00:53:18,042
You're too good a fighter.

765
00:53:18,209 --> 00:53:19,876
Who else?

766
00:53:20,459 --> 00:53:23,042
Uncle Kin, I really admire you.

767
00:53:27,334 --> 00:53:28,126
Don't laugh.

768
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:31,459
Look over here, 1, 2, 3.

769
00:53:31,626 --> 00:53:33,709
Tigers.

770
00:53:34,251 --> 00:53:35,667
Brats.

771
00:53:37,626 --> 00:53:38,834
Thank you.

772
00:53:39,167 --> 00:53:41,834
Let me buy you a drink.

773
00:53:42,001 --> 00:53:45,792
No thanks, I'm playing dominoes.

774
00:53:45,959 --> 00:53:47,709
Next time, drop by my place.

775
00:53:47,876 --> 00:53:50,042
- Alright.
- it's a deal.

776
00:54:05,084 --> 00:54:08,042
The second day of the Chinese New Year
was always rowdy for us,

777
00:54:08,209 --> 00:54:11,292
because it was also Auntie Ngan's birthday.

778
00:54:11,459 --> 00:54:14,417
Father's friends from work

779
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,542
would drop by.

780
00:54:23,292 --> 00:54:24,917
You two have been making fun
of Big Sis, haven't you.

781
00:54:25,084 --> 00:54:26,334
- You scared us.
- Got away.

782
00:54:26,501 --> 00:54:27,501
Just ignore him.

783
00:54:27,667 --> 00:54:30,042
Tell Wah to take it easy.

784
00:54:30,209 --> 00:54:33,584
Filming night and day is bad for his health.

785
00:54:33,751 --> 00:54:36,584
I know, that's why I'm making him...

786
00:54:36,751 --> 00:54:37,959
sleep in right now.

787
00:54:38,126 --> 00:54:41,917
He should spend more time with his family.

788
00:54:42,084 --> 00:54:43,084
Sixty Thousand.

789
00:54:43,376 --> 00:54:44,584
You're so right.

790
00:54:44,751 --> 00:54:46,876
Pearl is back and he has no time for her.

791
00:54:47,042 --> 00:54:47,876
Really?

792
00:54:48,042 --> 00:54:51,167
Tell him there's always money to earn.

793
00:54:51,334 --> 00:54:53,084
Am I right, Mui Yee?

794
00:54:53,251 --> 00:54:54,542
Game.

795
00:54:54,709 --> 00:54:55,959
Not when I'm on a draw.

796
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,667
- You're missing a tile.
- What?

797
00:54:58,834 --> 00:55:00,751
Because you couldn't

798
00:55:00,917 --> 00:55:02,251
take your eyes off her.

799
00:55:02,417 --> 00:55:03,542
You're already wearing glasses.

800
00:55:03,709 --> 00:55:05,251
I knew I had a 6 Circles. Where did it go?

801
00:55:05,417 --> 00:55:07,209
Where did it go?

802
00:55:08,084 --> 00:55:09,376
Pay up.

803
00:55:09,626 --> 00:55:11,834
Come and eat a birthday bun.

804
00:55:15,417 --> 00:55:19,126
Let's eat, we'll play later.

805
00:55:20,251 --> 00:55:22,501
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

806
00:55:28,084 --> 00:55:31,751
- Happy birthday, Auntie Ngan.
- Happy birthday.

807
00:55:34,042 --> 00:55:34,917
Master Phoenix is back.

808
00:55:35,084 --> 00:55:37,251
Kong, come with me for red packets.

809
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:38,542
Phoenix.

810
00:55:41,417 --> 00:55:41,959
Auntie Ngan.

811
00:55:42,167 --> 00:55:45,709
You're home. Have a birthday bun.

812
00:55:46,292 --> 00:55:46,792
Happy birthday.

813
00:55:47,042 --> 00:55:48,459
Kong, this is my Auntie Ngan.

814
00:55:48,626 --> 00:55:49,792
Happy birthday.

815
00:55:49,959 --> 00:55:50,792
Thanks.

816
00:55:50,959 --> 00:55:52,667
Go inside and say hello.

817
00:55:54,667 --> 00:55:55,542
Thanks.

818
00:55:56,126 --> 00:55:58,667
- Father.
- Phoneix.

819
00:55:59,376 --> 00:56:00,667
This is my good friend Lau Lin-kong.

820
00:56:00,834 --> 00:56:02,792
Kung Hei Fat Choy.

821
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:04,126
Give him a red packet.

822
00:56:04,292 --> 00:56:06,792
- Come.
- Thanks. Kung Hei Fat Choy.

823
00:56:07,959 --> 00:56:09,542
Kung Hei Fat Choy. Thanks.

824
00:56:09,709 --> 00:56:11,084
This is for you, Phoenix.

825
00:56:11,251 --> 00:56:13,001
- Auntie Tso.
- Phoenix, Come here.

826
00:56:14,126 --> 00:56:17,542
This is from me and Uncle Wah.

827
00:56:17,959 --> 00:56:18,251
Thanks, Auntie Tso.

828
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:21,001
Put it away properly and be good.

829
00:56:22,834 --> 00:56:26,292
Margaret's been waiting for you all morning.

830
00:56:26,459 --> 00:56:28,001
Come here, Kong

831
00:56:29,334 --> 00:56:30,417
Peter. Margaret.

832
00:56:30,584 --> 00:56:32,292
I've waited for you all morning.

833
00:56:32,459 --> 00:56:34,917
Meet my elder brother Peter and my sisters.

834
00:56:35,084 --> 00:56:36,042
Hello.

835
00:56:36,209 --> 00:56:38,542
You have a big family.

836
00:56:38,917 --> 00:56:40,001
Where's Skinny?

837
00:56:40,167 --> 00:56:41,626
In the back.

838
00:56:41,792 --> 00:56:43,417
- Let's go get him.
- OK.

839
00:56:43,584 --> 00:56:44,667
Play with me, Sloppy Cat.

840
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:47,001
OK, let the girls stay here.

841
00:56:47,167 --> 00:56:48,376
We'll go outside.

842
00:56:50,709 --> 00:56:52,667
You barely finished 4 rounds.

843
00:56:52,834 --> 00:56:55,876
Chor-fan wants me to relay a message.

844
00:56:56,042 --> 00:56:58,042
Stay away from sloppy films.

845
00:56:58,209 --> 00:57:02,501
Make more films for Union and
do your snare for qualify Cantonese films.

846
00:57:03,376 --> 00:57:05,751
I'm really flattered, but as you know,

847
00:57:05,917 --> 00:57:10,126
I've 30 mouths to feed. I must keep working.

848
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,834
Tell Chor-fan,

849
00:57:13,001 --> 00:57:17,042
I'll be there if he needs me.

850
00:57:17,209 --> 00:57:19,292
Alright. I have to go.

851
00:57:19,459 --> 00:57:20,876
- Kung Hei Fat Choy.
- Kung Hei Fat Choy.

852
00:57:21,084 --> 00:57:23,209
Come on.

853
00:57:23,376 --> 00:57:25,209
Bet more, win more.

854
00:57:25,501 --> 00:57:27,542
I bet on everything.

855
00:57:28,042 --> 00:57:30,042
Bet on it, bet on it.

856
00:57:31,542 --> 00:57:33,042
No more bets.

857
00:57:33,376 --> 00:57:37,084
- Come on.
- Come on.

858
00:57:37,251 --> 00:57:41,292
All chickens. Clean sweep, thank you.

859
00:57:41,459 --> 00:57:42,917
Kung Hei Fat Choy.

860
00:57:45,126 --> 00:57:46,001
Skinny.

861
00:57:46,167 --> 00:57:47,459
You're here.

862
00:57:47,626 --> 00:57:49,334
Let's play.

863
00:57:49,501 --> 00:57:50,751
You like to gamble?

864
00:57:50,917 --> 00:57:54,084
No, only for the New Year.

865
00:57:54,251 --> 00:57:55,459
Come and sit.

866
00:57:56,709 --> 00:57:58,667
- Kung Hei Fat Choy.
- Kung Hei Fat Choy.

867
00:57:58,834 --> 00:58:00,459
What a crowd.

868
00:58:00,626 --> 00:58:02,792
- Your daughter?
- Kung Hei Fat Choy.

869
00:58:03,209 --> 00:58:04,251
Yes, say hello to Auntie.

870
00:58:04,417 --> 00:58:05,251
What's your name?

871
00:58:05,417 --> 00:58:07,584
Bobo Fung. I'm 4 years old.

872
00:58:07,792 --> 00:58:12,042
I wish Uncle Chuen a prosperous New Year.

873
00:58:13,584 --> 00:58:16,792
Thank you. Give her a red packet.

874
00:58:16,917 --> 00:58:19,084
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

875
00:58:19,251 --> 00:58:20,042
Let's play there, ok?

876
00:58:20,209 --> 00:58:21,792
Come with me.

877
00:58:23,042 --> 00:58:25,792
Why bring all this?

878
00:58:25,917 --> 00:58:28,792
It's nothing. Where's Phoenix?

879
00:58:29,001 --> 00:58:31,709
In the back.

880
00:58:31,876 --> 00:58:33,126
They ain't kids anymore.

881
00:58:33,292 --> 00:58:35,459
I envy you. Your kids are all grown up.

882
00:58:35,626 --> 00:58:38,626
You'll be off the hook soon. Mine is only 4.

883
00:58:38,792 --> 00:58:42,126
She's smart and cute.

884
00:58:42,292 --> 00:58:44,667
Put her in a film.

885
00:58:45,542 --> 00:58:47,626
Right. Keep it in the family.

886
00:58:48,584 --> 00:58:52,584
I'll tell you the story about Snow White.

887
00:58:52,751 --> 00:58:54,334
- Come on.
- Believe it or not.

888
00:58:54,501 --> 00:58:56,834
3 Chickens again.

889
00:58:58,167 --> 00:58:59,542
What are you doing here?

890
00:58:59,709 --> 00:59:01,751
I've been here since I was a kid.

891
00:59:01,917 --> 00:59:04,167
I know them very well.

892
00:59:04,334 --> 00:59:06,209
Who's talking? Your house is so big.

893
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:08,001
When will you give us a tour?

894
00:59:08,167 --> 00:59:11,251
There's nobody there.

895
00:59:12,917 --> 00:59:14,001
What about your parents?

896
00:59:14,334 --> 00:59:16,584
They're never in Hong Kong.

897
00:59:16,751 --> 00:59:19,501
Even if they are, they're never home.

898
00:59:19,667 --> 00:59:21,959
It's always just me and the servants.

899
00:59:22,126 --> 00:59:24,751
That's better than me. My house is tiny.

900
00:59:24,917 --> 00:59:26,376
I can't stay there.

901
00:59:26,542 --> 00:59:27,667
I like it better here.

902
00:59:27,834 --> 00:59:30,667
Let's all go inside for a picture.

903
00:59:30,876 --> 00:59:32,667
- Come on.
- Let's go.

904
00:59:35,501 --> 00:59:38,417
3, 2, 1. Smile.

905
00:59:43,542 --> 00:59:45,501
No need to go to work today?

906
00:59:45,667 --> 00:59:47,042
A leading man can decide

907
00:59:47,209 --> 00:59:49,001
when to go to work.

908
00:59:49,167 --> 00:59:50,292
- Really?
- I will go to work at 3.

909
00:59:50,459 --> 00:59:52,167
What about Skinny and Kong?

910
00:59:52,376 --> 00:59:54,084
We're here to work.

911
00:59:54,251 --> 00:59:57,126
You think it's really fun to watch filming?

912
00:59:57,542 --> 00:59:58,376
Today will be awesome.

913
00:59:58,542 --> 01:00:02,209
Uncle Wah and Yu So-chow are filming a wuxia film.

914
01:00:02,376 --> 01:00:03,751
Keep watching and be quiet.

915
01:00:05,376 --> 01:00:06,376
Action.

916
01:00:06,709 --> 01:00:07,751
Now that you have completed your training,

917
01:00:07,917 --> 01:00:10,042
you may seek revenge.

918
01:00:10,209 --> 01:00:11,376
But remember...

919
01:00:11,542 --> 01:00:15,042
you must always help the needy.

920
01:00:15,209 --> 01:00:17,584
Master, thanks for rescuing me 18 years ago.

921
01:00:17,751 --> 01:00:21,834
I'll find my parents' killer and avenge them.

922
01:00:26,042 --> 01:00:27,959
Cut. Where's the dubbing artist?

923
01:00:28,126 --> 01:00:29,501
- Dubbing artist.
- Where is she?

924
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:31,001
Right here.

925
01:00:31,334 --> 01:00:32,876
I'm sorry.

926
01:00:33,042 --> 01:00:34,251
- No problem.
- No problem.

927
01:00:34,417 --> 01:00:35,542
I'm sorry.

928
01:00:36,084 --> 01:00:37,126
Let's do it again.

929
01:00:37,292 --> 01:00:39,084
Ready. Action.

930
01:00:39,251 --> 01:00:42,417
You're leaving?

931
01:00:42,667 --> 01:00:44,542
I'll leave you two alone.

932
01:00:45,917 --> 01:00:47,792
I don't know

933
01:00:47,959 --> 01:00:49,876
when I'll be back.

934
01:00:50,042 --> 01:00:53,584
No, I'll tell Father I'm going with you.

935
01:00:53,751 --> 01:00:55,292
Yu So-chow is so amazing.

936
01:00:55,459 --> 01:00:58,167
I think the dubbing artist is more amazing.

937
01:00:58,334 --> 01:01:00,792
Cut. Done. Get ready for the next scene.

938
01:01:00,959 --> 01:01:02,751
Uncle Wah & Ms Yu, we are waiting for you.

939
01:01:02,917 --> 01:01:04,001
Be right there.

940
01:01:04,167 --> 01:01:05,792
Sorry, Mr Koo, they want me for another film.

941
01:01:05,959 --> 01:01:09,042
They're filming "The Story of Wang Ying" next door.
Let's go watch.

942
01:01:09,209 --> 01:01:10,209
No.

943
01:01:10,376 --> 01:01:11,584
Come on.

944
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:15,251
I'm tired. I need a break.

945
01:01:17,584 --> 01:01:21,001
- Hurry.
- Go change.

946
01:01:21,126 --> 01:01:22,917
Give me your best. Lights off.

947
01:01:26,751 --> 01:01:30,709
Miss Wang, I wish you'll cooperate with us.

948
01:01:32,126 --> 01:01:35,001
If I didn't why else

949
01:01:35,126 --> 01:01:37,459
did I call you, Inspector?

950
01:03:12,126 --> 01:03:14,667
Are you OK?

951
01:03:36,667 --> 01:03:37,501
Bruce.

952
01:03:37,667 --> 01:03:38,542
What?

953
01:03:38,709 --> 01:03:40,334
Come, sign your name.

954
01:03:40,501 --> 01:03:42,334
You're selling my autographs again?

955
01:03:42,501 --> 01:03:44,459
Hurry. We're waiting for you.

956
01:03:44,626 --> 01:03:46,001
That's my signature. Isn't it nice?

957
01:03:46,167 --> 01:03:47,126
It's your turn.

958
01:03:47,251 --> 01:03:48,792
Come here.

959
01:03:48,959 --> 01:03:50,126
Today is Mom's birthday.

960
01:03:50,292 --> 01:03:51,626
We're giving her an English album.

961
01:03:51,792 --> 01:03:54,501
I thought Robert's

962
01:03:54,667 --> 01:03:56,376
selling my autograph.

963
01:03:56,584 --> 01:03:57,417
Who do you think you are? Tso Tat-wah?

964
01:03:57,584 --> 01:03:59,001
Who'd want your autograph?

965
01:03:59,501 --> 01:04:02,876
Someday,

966
01:04:03,626 --> 01:04:06,084
the entire world will want my autograph.

967
01:04:08,626 --> 01:04:09,459
Who are we missing?

968
01:04:09,626 --> 01:04:11,167
Me.

969
01:04:15,792 --> 01:04:17,126
Like motif writing.

970
01:04:17,292 --> 01:04:18,876
What do you know?

971
01:04:19,042 --> 01:04:20,792
It's ugly.

972
01:04:20,959 --> 01:04:23,792
Agnes, does Uncle Wah have a daughter?

973
01:04:23,959 --> 01:04:27,251
Why don't you ask Mrs Tso?

974
01:04:41,209 --> 01:04:43,501
They buy the soy sauce, I buy the chicken.

975
01:04:43,667 --> 01:04:48,209
They buy you an album, I pay for the machine.

976
01:04:49,959 --> 01:04:53,501
It's in English. You understand this?

977
01:04:53,667 --> 01:04:55,667
As long as you like it.

978
01:05:11,501 --> 01:05:12,834
Happy birthday.

979
01:05:13,792 --> 01:05:16,501
I thought you forgot.

980
01:05:17,751 --> 01:05:19,209
No way.

981
01:05:20,209 --> 01:05:24,584
I remember it better than my lines.

982
01:05:27,376 --> 01:05:28,834
20 years ago,

983
01:05:29,709 --> 01:05:32,126
we pledged our love on your birthday.

984
01:05:33,542 --> 01:05:35,876
These last 20 years have been tough oh you.

985
01:05:39,334 --> 01:05:43,334
You come from a rich family and
married an actor like me

986
01:05:44,334 --> 01:05:46,376
and raised my children.

987
01:05:48,167 --> 01:05:49,376
Thank you.

988
01:05:49,542 --> 01:05:50,792
What for?

989
01:05:52,042 --> 01:05:57,334
You worked hard for this family too.

990
01:05:58,876 --> 01:06:02,417
Like I always say, the family must...

991
01:06:02,584 --> 01:06:06,792
Live happily together.

992
01:06:08,126 --> 01:06:10,001
I "larve" you.

993
01:06:14,751 --> 01:06:17,376
It's I "love" you.

994
01:06:19,251 --> 01:06:22,917
Those brats are listening outside our door.

995
01:06:29,876 --> 01:06:34,584
I love you.

996
01:06:34,917 --> 01:06:37,084
Who taught you to say something so corny?

997
01:06:38,876 --> 01:06:40,501
Leung Sing-po.

998
01:06:41,084 --> 01:06:43,292
I love you.

999
01:07:40,542 --> 01:07:42,417
Why are you following me?

1000
01:07:42,959 --> 01:07:44,459
I'm not.

1001
01:07:44,792 --> 01:07:48,542
You want to say something?

1002
01:07:51,501 --> 01:07:52,917
You're Uncle Wah's daughter?

1003
01:07:53,126 --> 01:07:55,751
You're Bruce Lee, a.k.a. Phoenix.

1004
01:07:55,917 --> 01:07:56,834
How did you know?

1005
01:07:57,001 --> 01:07:59,167
Do you know I'm one year older than you?

1006
01:08:01,376 --> 01:08:03,667
Say hi to Uncle Chuen and Auntie Grace.

1007
01:08:04,292 --> 01:08:05,667
Bye.

1008
01:08:23,876 --> 01:08:25,334
Thank you, Bruce.

1009
01:08:26,292 --> 01:08:27,251
For what?

1010
01:08:29,251 --> 01:08:32,001
I don't particularly enjoy making friends.

1011
01:08:33,417 --> 01:08:36,001
I never had any good friends.

1012
01:08:36,292 --> 01:08:37,417
But I have one now

1013
01:08:37,542 --> 01:08:41,167
since I met you.

1014
01:08:42,001 --> 01:08:43,209
Like you took me to the studio.

1015
01:08:43,376 --> 01:08:45,459
I really had fun.

1016
01:08:45,876 --> 01:08:49,042
And this food... it's delicious.

1017
01:08:49,751 --> 01:08:52,501
If you didn't bring me,

1018
01:08:52,667 --> 01:08:53,834
I'll never know

1019
01:08:54,001 --> 01:08:56,001
Hong Kong has such a place at night.

1020
01:08:56,167 --> 01:08:57,376
Don't exaggerate.

1021
01:08:57,542 --> 01:08:58,501
Really?

1022
01:08:58,667 --> 01:08:59,751
You're not so bad yourself.

1023
01:08:59,917 --> 01:09:02,709
You've been abroad,

1024
01:09:02,876 --> 01:09:06,876
unlike us parochial local boys.

1025
01:09:07,042 --> 01:09:08,959
Come on.

1026
01:09:10,084 --> 01:09:11,459
Cheers.

1027
01:09:21,001 --> 01:09:22,459
Tell me about your dream.

1028
01:09:23,251 --> 01:09:26,001
My dream? I'm greedy.

1029
01:09:27,417 --> 01:09:29,417
I want to do something no one's done before.

1030
01:09:30,251 --> 01:09:32,292
I want the world to know who I am.

1031
01:09:34,084 --> 01:09:35,501
You're in the movies.

1032
01:09:35,667 --> 01:09:38,251
Many people in Hong Kong know

1033
01:09:38,417 --> 01:09:39,834
Bruce Lee.

1034
01:09:40,001 --> 01:09:41,251
That's not enough.

1035
01:09:41,417 --> 01:09:44,876
I'm talking about worldwide.

1036
01:09:46,917 --> 01:09:48,292
That's too greedy.

1037
01:09:50,751 --> 01:09:51,917
What about you?

1038
01:09:52,834 --> 01:09:53,751
Me?

1039
01:09:54,792 --> 01:10:00,042
I wanted to be many things: a scientist,

1040
01:10:00,292 --> 01:10:02,417
a pilot, etc, etc.

1041
01:10:02,584 --> 01:10:04,126
Now that I'm older,

1042
01:10:04,292 --> 01:10:06,792
I know I've been naive.

1043
01:10:06,959 --> 01:10:09,167
Nothing is ever that simple.

1044
01:10:11,001 --> 01:10:13,917
I should be practical, find a girl

1045
01:10:15,667 --> 01:10:17,542
and be nice to her,

1046
01:10:18,167 --> 01:10:19,959
take over my Dad's business,

1047
01:10:20,459 --> 01:10:24,251
get married and have lots of kids.

1048
01:10:24,626 --> 01:10:25,876
No way.

1049
01:10:28,001 --> 01:10:29,834
You must not give in.

1050
01:10:35,292 --> 01:10:36,667
I'm confident you can do it.

1051
01:10:36,834 --> 01:10:38,167
You can do it.

1052
01:10:38,792 --> 01:10:41,084
Right, buddy.

1053
01:10:45,584 --> 01:10:48,292
Turn like this.

1054
01:10:50,376 --> 01:10:52,542
Let's take a break.

1055
01:10:54,584 --> 01:10:56,167
Sir?

1056
01:10:56,751 --> 01:10:57,542
Sing-po.

1057
01:10:57,709 --> 01:10:59,292
What took you so long?

1058
01:10:59,459 --> 01:11:03,167
With all those stairs? You must be kidding.

1059
01:11:04,584 --> 01:11:06,459
Want one?

1060
01:11:07,584 --> 01:11:08,709
I've quit.

1061
01:11:08,959 --> 01:11:11,167
I come hereto practice Tai Chi each morning.

1062
01:11:11,334 --> 01:11:14,209
The air is fresh here. I'm healthier now.

1063
01:11:14,376 --> 01:11:17,959
For your own good, get rid of that belly.

1064
01:11:18,126 --> 01:11:20,459
You're the leading man after all.

1065
01:11:20,626 --> 01:11:23,792
That's ancient history. Now I'm a comedian.

1066
01:11:23,959 --> 01:11:25,751
And you're taking my parts.

1067
01:11:28,376 --> 01:11:34,209
Smoke a cigar and act like the boss.

1068
01:11:34,376 --> 01:11:36,876
- Use your brain when you work.
- OK. OK.

1069
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:39,334
I'm just kidding.

1070
01:11:39,876 --> 01:11:42,084
Comedians come in all sizes.

1071
01:11:42,251 --> 01:11:47,167
If fat Lady Tam can be a comedian, so can I.

1072
01:11:47,459 --> 01:11:49,792
We're family in the Cantonese opera world.

1073
01:11:50,584 --> 01:11:53,001
Why not become real family?

1074
01:11:54,251 --> 01:11:55,709
You mean...

1075
01:11:56,709 --> 01:11:57,876
Margaret and Phoenix?

1076
01:11:58,042 --> 01:12:02,334
My wife told me they're very close.

1077
01:12:02,959 --> 01:12:04,417
It's marvelous if that's true.

1078
01:12:04,626 --> 01:12:06,792
The brat is always up to no good.

1079
01:12:06,959 --> 01:12:09,251
It'd be great if she can keep him in line.

1080
01:12:16,167 --> 01:12:18,084
Phoenix, where's your Margaret?

1081
01:12:18,251 --> 01:12:19,251
You mean your Margaret?

1082
01:12:19,417 --> 01:12:20,626
I Wish.

1083
01:12:20,876 --> 01:12:25,959
Kong bought us soda.

1084
01:12:26,126 --> 01:12:28,792
Grab your own bottle.

1085
01:12:29,292 --> 01:12:31,834
We usually drink herbal tea.
You're buying us soda?

1086
01:12:32,001 --> 01:12:33,542
What's the occasion?

1087
01:12:34,042 --> 01:12:35,501
I want you to meet my girlfriend.

1088
01:12:35,959 --> 01:12:38,292
She's coming.

1089
01:12:38,542 --> 01:12:40,167
So you're trying to act rich.

1090
01:12:40,459 --> 01:12:44,292
It's not an act, he is rich.

1091
01:12:44,459 --> 01:12:47,376
You never told us you have a girlfriend.

1092
01:12:47,542 --> 01:12:49,584
It never came up.

1093
01:12:49,751 --> 01:12:52,167
She just came back to Hong Kong.

1094
01:12:52,334 --> 01:12:55,084
What else did you not tell us?

1095
01:13:00,292 --> 01:13:02,751
What are you doing?

1096
01:13:03,001 --> 01:13:04,501
Nothing, I'm playing a song.

1097
01:13:04,667 --> 01:13:07,709
Ours is still on, wait your turn.

1098
01:13:14,209 --> 01:13:16,251
Go outside if you want to quarrel.

1099
01:13:16,417 --> 01:13:18,334
Take your fight outside, young men.

1100
01:13:18,709 --> 01:13:20,376
Do you know who he is?

1101
01:13:20,542 --> 01:13:22,584
I know him from shit.

1102
01:13:23,876 --> 01:13:26,917
He's Charlie Owen,
the 3-time Inter-school Boxing champ.

1103
01:13:27,084 --> 01:13:31,251
Do you know who he is?

1104
01:13:32,584 --> 01:13:35,167
You gweilos are so ignorant.

1105
01:13:35,459 --> 01:13:37,709
He's Bruce Lee,

1106
01:13:37,834 --> 01:13:41,751
the best fighter in Hong Kong.

1107
01:13:43,334 --> 01:13:45,001
You heard of the Tigers of Kowloon City?

1108
01:13:45,167 --> 01:13:47,042
He's our chief.

1109
01:13:52,542 --> 01:13:53,709
So what if he's taller.

1110
01:13:53,876 --> 01:13:55,376
Don't worry, Phoenix.

1111
01:13:55,626 --> 01:13:57,209
He's wearing a girl's scarf.

1112
01:13:57,459 --> 01:13:58,459
Dwarf.

1113
01:13:58,626 --> 01:14:00,501
Don't move, it's toe-to-toe for them.

1114
01:14:00,667 --> 01:14:01,501
Damn dwarf.

1115
01:14:01,667 --> 01:14:02,626
You're jealous of our good looks?

1116
01:14:02,792 --> 01:14:04,459
Move it.

1117
01:14:29,417 --> 01:14:30,084
Phoenix.

1118
01:14:30,251 --> 01:14:31,251
- Are you OK?
- Are you OK?

1119
01:14:31,417 --> 01:14:33,417
- Get up.
- Are you OK?

1120
01:14:33,792 --> 01:14:34,792
We're here for herbal tea,

1121
01:14:34,917 --> 01:14:37,417
not to fight, barbarian.

1122
01:14:38,709 --> 01:14:40,792
You look a tad disappointed.

1123
01:14:42,084 --> 01:14:44,084
You can fight me again when you're ready.

1124
01:14:44,626 --> 01:14:46,209
I don't understand what you say.

1125
01:14:48,251 --> 01:14:49,501
Lau Lin-kong?

1126
01:14:50,251 --> 01:14:51,792
What's going on?

1127
01:14:52,792 --> 01:14:55,334
Those gweilos are ridiculous.

1128
01:14:56,792 --> 01:14:59,001
Let me introduce you, she's...

1129
01:14:59,167 --> 01:15:03,251
Forget it, we know her.

1130
01:15:03,626 --> 01:15:05,292
I didn't know you're friends.

1131
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:07,126
Bruce is an old friend.

1132
01:15:07,292 --> 01:15:09,251
You knew each other?

1133
01:15:09,417 --> 01:15:12,834
I'm glad, let's go in for herbal tea.

1134
01:15:13,001 --> 01:15:15,751
- Come on.
- Go.

1135
01:15:16,084 --> 01:15:17,334
Don't worry, we're fine.

1136
01:15:17,501 --> 01:15:19,376
2 more seats, please.

1137
01:15:19,959 --> 01:15:21,417
Can't think of anything better to play?

1138
01:15:21,584 --> 01:15:23,376
Yup, it's poop.

1139
01:15:23,667 --> 01:15:27,834
I'll sign up for the next boxing tournament.

1140
01:15:28,001 --> 01:15:30,751
It's one thing to get even,

1141
01:15:31,001 --> 01:15:33,792
but that guy is a 3-time boxing champ.

1142
01:15:33,959 --> 01:15:36,167
Did you see his biceps?

1143
01:15:36,334 --> 01:15:39,251
His fist is as big as Sloppy Cat's head.

1144
01:15:39,417 --> 01:15:41,251
So? Phoenix has biceps too.

1145
01:15:41,417 --> 01:15:44,042
We still have 6 months. I can get a coach.

1146
01:15:44,209 --> 01:15:52,834
The profundity of Chinese martial arts.

1147
01:15:53,001 --> 01:15:56,542
He can find a coach in some lofty mountain.

1148
01:15:58,334 --> 01:16:00,626
What mountain?

1149
01:16:00,792 --> 01:16:02,334
Victoria Peak or Lion Rock?

1150
01:16:02,501 --> 01:16:03,876
You can be so stupid, Skinny.

1151
01:16:04,001 --> 01:16:06,626
What do you think, Sloppy Cat?

1152
01:16:07,001 --> 01:16:08,626
You're my brother,

1153
01:16:08,792 --> 01:16:11,376
you must learn Wing Chun.

1154
01:16:12,584 --> 01:16:13,626
Why?

1155
01:16:13,792 --> 01:16:15,001
Because

1156
01:16:15,167 --> 01:16:16,209
I know someone.

1157
01:16:16,667 --> 01:16:18,001
Who do you know?

1158
01:16:18,209 --> 01:16:19,417
You trust me?

1159
01:16:20,376 --> 01:16:21,334
Yes.

1160
01:16:23,751 --> 01:16:25,959
Master Yip Man is bound to ask you

1161
01:16:26,126 --> 01:16:28,501
why you want to learn Wing Chun.
What will you tell him?

1162
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:30,501
That I want to fight better.

1163
01:16:30,667 --> 01:16:32,251
Don't be so honest.

1164
01:16:32,417 --> 01:16:35,084
Why learn something if you won't use it?

1165
01:16:35,251 --> 01:16:37,084
That's the only way to tell if it works.

1166
01:16:37,709 --> 01:16:39,417
Why don't you learn to ride a bike too?

1167
01:16:40,917 --> 01:16:41,917
Let's go.

1168
01:16:52,751 --> 01:16:54,209
- Master.
- Master.

1169
01:16:54,376 --> 01:16:57,917
I'm not the Master. He's inside.

1170
01:16:58,084 --> 01:16:59,876
You're here to learn martial arts?

1171
01:17:00,042 --> 01:17:01,042
Yes.

1172
01:17:03,209 --> 01:17:04,792
- Did you bring money?
- Yes.

1173
01:17:06,084 --> 01:17:07,042
And you?

1174
01:17:07,209 --> 01:17:08,917
I can't afford it,

1175
01:17:09,042 --> 01:17:10,709
but you can teach me.

1176
01:17:13,376 --> 01:17:14,501
Master.

1177
01:17:14,917 --> 01:17:16,626
- Master.
- Master.

1178
01:17:16,917 --> 01:17:18,209
You're Bruce Lee?

1179
01:17:18,376 --> 01:17:19,626
Lee Hoi-chuen is your Father?

1180
01:17:19,792 --> 01:17:20,917
Yes.

1181
01:17:21,501 --> 01:17:24,459
Why do you want to learn?
To fight or for your well-being?

1182
01:17:25,084 --> 01:17:27,584
I want to know why everyone is learning.

1183
01:17:28,459 --> 01:17:32,501
You need a coach, but you must practice.

1184
01:17:34,001 --> 01:17:36,084
Master doesn't give lessons anymore.

1185
01:17:36,417 --> 01:17:37,751
I'll teach you the basics.

1186
01:17:37,917 --> 01:17:38,501
Thanks.

1187
01:17:38,667 --> 01:17:40,917
He took you in. Take a picture, hurry.

1188
01:17:43,251 --> 01:17:46,459
Ready, 1, 2, 3.

1189
01:17:56,501 --> 01:17:57,584
Phoenix.

1190
01:17:57,751 --> 01:17:58,751
Uncle Chor-fan.

1191
01:17:58,917 --> 01:18:03,334
Can't you walk properly?

1192
01:18:03,501 --> 01:18:05,126
I'm thinking of some moves.

1193
01:18:06,959 --> 01:18:09,126
I want you to play the lead in a film.

1194
01:18:09,459 --> 01:18:10,792
What's the name?

1195
01:18:11,042 --> 01:18:12,667
"The Orphan."

1196
01:18:13,959 --> 01:18:18,334
I'm financing it and will shoot it
in Eastman Color for the widescreen.

1197
01:18:18,501 --> 01:18:20,167
That'll cost a lot of money.

1198
01:18:22,667 --> 01:18:28,584
One must not bite the hand that feeds him.

1199
01:18:29,751 --> 01:18:32,626
Even in films,

1200
01:18:33,001 --> 01:18:37,667
one must take one's acting seriously.

1201
01:18:38,084 --> 01:18:40,667
I have always admired the Union spirit.

1202
01:18:41,084 --> 01:18:42,876
No, it should be the Ng Chor-fan spirit.

1203
01:18:43,167 --> 01:18:47,376
One for all and all for one.

1204
01:18:57,042 --> 01:18:58,376
Bruce.

1205
01:18:59,876 --> 01:19:02,584
I heard you're a great cha-cha dancer.

1206
01:19:03,709 --> 01:19:06,251
Will you be my partner at the dance contest?

1207
01:19:08,542 --> 01:19:10,084
Kong is good too.

1208
01:19:10,626 --> 01:19:12,251
But I want you to be my partner.

1209
01:19:14,084 --> 01:19:15,417
Let me think about it.

1210
01:19:19,376 --> 01:19:21,251
Let me know.

1211
01:19:45,251 --> 01:19:48,334
This song is from Robert Chan of La Salle

1212
01:19:48,501 --> 01:19:53,376
to Phoebe Lee of Maryknoll,
wishing she'll stay young forever.

1213
01:19:55,084 --> 01:19:58,626
Robert Chan really likes you.

1214
01:19:58,792 --> 01:20:00,751
Did he ask you out?

1215
01:20:00,917 --> 01:20:03,792
He'll have to take a number.

1216
01:20:03,959 --> 01:20:07,459
Patrick Tse has been calling her every night.

1217
01:20:07,626 --> 01:20:10,251
Don't talk nonsense.

1218
01:20:10,917 --> 01:20:13,417
Margaret, are you waiting for Phoenix?

1219
01:20:14,334 --> 01:20:17,001
I want him to fill out a form.

1220
01:20:17,626 --> 01:20:18,459
For what?

1221
01:20:18,876 --> 01:20:20,751
The Cha-cha contest.

1222
01:20:20,917 --> 01:20:23,917
Good. You make such a good team.

1223
01:20:36,459 --> 01:20:38,834
Why don't you want to dance with Margaret?

1224
01:20:41,042 --> 01:20:44,251
I know. You don't want Pearl to be jealous.

1225
01:20:47,542 --> 01:20:50,167
Then who'll be your partner?

1226
01:20:59,917 --> 01:21:01,792
- Sit well.
- Phoebe

1227
01:21:01,959 --> 01:21:03,459
Hurry up and overtake him.

1228
01:21:05,542 --> 01:21:06,084
Phoenix.

1229
01:21:06,251 --> 01:21:08,209
- Hurry up.
- it's real fast already.

1230
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:10,834
Robert. Give me a hand.

1231
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:14,209
Get your own soda.

1232
01:21:16,709 --> 01:21:17,959
Kong.

1233
01:21:18,542 --> 01:21:20,376
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

1234
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:23,459
Margaret, let's go for a ride.

1235
01:21:24,251 --> 01:21:26,042
Phoenix, let's go.

1236
01:21:26,209 --> 01:21:27,376
Get off my case.

1237
01:21:27,542 --> 01:21:29,209
I can teach you.

1238
01:21:30,084 --> 01:21:32,542
What's wrong, Bruce? You're always so cocky.

1239
01:21:32,709 --> 01:21:34,376
Something finally shut you up?

1240
01:21:34,542 --> 01:21:35,876
Yeah. Remember last time?

1241
01:21:36,084 --> 01:21:37,542
It's all because he couldn't ride a bike.

1242
01:21:37,709 --> 01:21:38,917
We all took a beating as a result.

1243
01:21:39,084 --> 01:21:40,209
Not that again.

1244
01:21:41,167 --> 01:21:42,334
Thanks.

1245
01:21:42,501 --> 01:21:43,376
Thanks to you.

1246
01:21:43,542 --> 01:21:45,167
1,2, 3.

1247
01:21:45,334 --> 01:21:47,501
OK

1248
01:21:48,334 --> 01:21:51,084
Kong, I'll take one of you and Pearl.

1249
01:21:51,251 --> 01:21:52,834
1,2, 3.

1250
01:21:53,209 --> 01:21:53,876
Not this one.

1251
01:21:54,042 --> 01:21:55,917
- Pass it to me.
- OK. Want one?

1252
01:21:56,126 --> 01:21:58,417
-I do.
- No more film.

1253
01:21:58,792 --> 01:22:00,251
Bruce, who'll be

1254
01:22:00,417 --> 01:22:02,417
your partner at the contest?

1255
01:22:04,292 --> 01:22:05,709
I don't know yet.

1256
01:22:07,126 --> 01:22:09,417
Why? You need a good partner for Cha-cha.

1257
01:22:09,584 --> 01:22:12,126
You and Margaret will make a good team.

1258
01:22:12,959 --> 01:22:14,834
We all make a good team, right?

1259
01:22:15,001 --> 01:22:17,292
Stop taking pictures, Sloppy Cat.
Show us your moves.

1260
01:22:17,459 --> 01:22:18,417
No problem.

1261
01:22:23,209 --> 01:22:24,542
I'm really good.

1262
01:22:24,709 --> 01:22:27,709
You are, but not me.

1263
01:22:28,417 --> 01:22:30,042
Get someone else.

1264
01:22:35,709 --> 01:22:38,584
Margaret, I can be your partner.

1265
01:22:38,917 --> 01:22:41,959
Pearl doesn't want me.

1266
01:22:45,126 --> 01:22:48,042
That's because you're too good.

1267
01:22:48,209 --> 01:22:52,334
What's the matter with you?
You're all in this contest.

1268
01:22:52,501 --> 01:22:54,334
You'll come in first and second.

1269
01:22:54,501 --> 01:22:55,834
That'll be perfect.

1270
01:22:56,001 --> 01:22:59,084
You make it sound so easy.

1271
01:22:59,251 --> 01:23:00,667
If we go, we'll definitely come in third.

1272
01:23:00,834 --> 01:23:01,876
That's good.

1273
01:23:02,042 --> 01:23:03,667
Good my ass. Shut up.

1274
01:23:04,084 --> 01:23:05,626
I'll dance with you.

1275
01:23:07,584 --> 01:23:09,167
Phoenix, then you can dance with Margaret.

1276
01:23:09,334 --> 01:23:10,667
OK. OK.

1277
01:23:11,626 --> 01:23:13,167
I know what to do.

1278
01:23:16,084 --> 01:23:17,501
What's wrong with you lately?

1279
01:23:17,667 --> 01:23:19,751
You won't go to the movies with me.

1280
01:23:19,917 --> 01:23:22,376
You're never there when I go to your house.

1281
01:23:22,751 --> 01:23:23,501
Let me help you.

1282
01:23:23,667 --> 01:23:25,501
Is she or is she not your girlfriend?

1283
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:27,251
Of course not.

1284
01:23:37,001 --> 01:23:37,584
Damn you.

1285
01:23:37,751 --> 01:23:40,334
- Whatever you say. Margaret.
- Margaret.

1286
01:24:17,917 --> 01:24:20,376
What about Phoebe and Agnes?

1287
01:24:22,001 --> 01:24:24,376
They said Phoenix was...

1288
01:24:24,542 --> 01:24:27,417
I can't hear you, you talk like a girl.

1289
01:24:27,584 --> 01:24:32,501
They wouldn't root for
Phoenix as he was mean to Margaret.

1290
01:24:32,667 --> 01:24:35,667
Don't yell. I'm sitting right next to you.

1291
01:24:35,834 --> 01:24:39,084
See? She told you to shut up.

1292
01:24:46,501 --> 01:24:49,751
After the first 4 pairs of contestants,

1293
01:24:49,917 --> 01:24:52,417
let's meet the next 4 pairs.

1294
01:24:52,584 --> 01:24:53,626
Look.

1295
01:24:53,792 --> 01:24:57,751
She wants to know who's Phoenix's partner.

1296
01:24:58,334 --> 01:25:01,167
He didn't pick a girl. She can't be jealous.

1297
01:25:01,334 --> 01:25:03,709
Lastly, the only all-boys team,

1298
01:25:03,876 --> 01:25:06,542
Brothers Bruce and Robert Lee.

1299
01:25:07,167 --> 01:25:08,792
Let's begin.

1300
01:25:54,459 --> 01:25:55,917
Margaret.

1301
01:25:56,667 --> 01:25:58,292
Don't be mad.

1302
01:25:58,792 --> 01:26:03,709
Phoenix didn't pick a girl.

1303
01:26:03,876 --> 01:26:04,959
Right?

1304
01:26:05,167 --> 01:26:07,667
Why won't he

1305
01:26:07,834 --> 01:26:09,001
dance with me?

1306
01:26:09,167 --> 01:26:11,001
- I know.
- What do you know?

1307
01:26:11,167 --> 01:26:12,751
- What?
- I don't know...

1308
01:26:12,917 --> 01:26:15,042
He doesn't know anything.

1309
01:26:15,209 --> 01:26:17,292
Look at them. They're brilliant.

1310
01:26:54,917 --> 01:26:57,959
Let's invite all contestants to come out.

1311
01:27:06,084 --> 01:27:09,626
Ladies and gents, the winning team is...

1312
01:27:12,709 --> 01:27:16,042
Bruce and Robert Lee.

1313
01:27:17,209 --> 01:27:19,042
Phoenix.

1314
01:27:19,334 --> 01:27:22,459
And now the award ceremony.

1315
01:27:30,876 --> 01:27:32,334
Congratulations, Bruce Lee.

1316
01:27:32,501 --> 01:27:33,376
Thanks.

1317
01:27:33,542 --> 01:27:34,751
Congratulations.

1318
01:27:36,084 --> 01:27:37,959
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

1319
01:27:41,542 --> 01:27:43,917
You won. Robert, let's take a pic outside.

1320
01:27:46,251 --> 01:27:47,584
Bruce.

1321
01:27:49,334 --> 01:27:50,709
I'm disappointed in you.

1322
01:27:51,001 --> 01:27:52,167
What do you mean?

1323
01:27:53,376 --> 01:27:56,834
I know you really like Pearl.

1324
01:27:58,126 --> 01:27:58,876
I do not.

1325
01:27:59,042 --> 01:28:01,084
Pearl already told me.

1326
01:28:03,001 --> 01:28:05,626
You turned her down because of me.

1327
01:28:07,751 --> 01:28:10,959
Don't worry. I'll get out of the picture.

1328
01:28:11,126 --> 01:28:12,501
You got this all wrong.

1329
01:28:13,126 --> 01:28:15,376
You know me, Bruce.

1330
01:28:15,876 --> 01:28:19,209
I don't want handouts: not love,

1331
01:28:20,876 --> 01:28:23,251
and definitely not friendship.

1332
01:28:39,626 --> 01:28:43,917
Soon after that,
Kong, Margaret and Pearl stopped showing up.

1333
01:28:44,834 --> 01:28:47,209
For the first time, Bruce couldn't

1334
01:28:47,376 --> 01:28:50,584
settle a matter with his fists.

1335
01:28:52,626 --> 01:28:54,751
I have never seen him like this.

1336
01:28:55,459 --> 01:28:58,792
He was so quiet he seemed like another man.

1337
01:28:59,209 --> 01:29:01,001
It's 2 months before the boxing tournament.

1338
01:29:01,167 --> 01:29:04,959
He decided to focus on this quest.

1339
01:29:21,209 --> 01:29:22,251
Left hand.

1340
01:29:22,417 --> 01:29:23,542
Go.

1341
01:29:25,334 --> 01:29:26,626
Again.

1342
01:30:13,917 --> 01:30:15,459
Bruce. Telephone.

1343
01:30:21,001 --> 01:30:21,959
Hello?

1344
01:30:22,126 --> 01:30:23,251
Bruce.

1345
01:30:23,417 --> 01:30:24,251
Pearl?

1346
01:30:24,417 --> 01:30:25,751
Are you free tomorrow?

1347
01:30:35,417 --> 01:30:36,917
I asked you out

1348
01:30:37,084 --> 01:30:39,167
because I need your help.

1349
01:30:39,459 --> 01:30:40,709
What is it?

1350
01:30:41,251 --> 01:30:43,042
Help me find Kong.

1351
01:30:43,709 --> 01:30:47,501
He's been missing for 2 weeks.

1352
01:30:49,084 --> 01:30:51,084
He's become a junkie.

1353
01:30:53,751 --> 01:30:55,834
All junkies buy from pushers.

1354
01:30:56,001 --> 01:30:58,459
They are like brokers.

1355
01:30:58,792 --> 01:31:00,292
Sham Shui Po is full of them.

1356
01:31:00,459 --> 01:31:01,209
Sorry.

1357
01:31:01,501 --> 01:31:03,292
How do you know all these?

1358
01:31:03,626 --> 01:31:06,251
There're all kinds of folks in a film studio.

1359
01:31:06,417 --> 01:31:07,792
It's not difficult to learn these things.

1360
01:31:07,959 --> 01:31:10,126
That's so unlike Kong. What happened to him?

1361
01:31:10,959 --> 01:31:12,959
I didn't expect him to be so weak.

1362
01:31:14,292 --> 01:31:16,667
It was my fault. I should look for him sooner.

1363
01:31:16,834 --> 01:31:18,376
Look at those two.

1364
01:31:18,542 --> 01:31:21,459
They look like gangsters. So scary.

1365
01:31:21,667 --> 01:31:25,126
He's a major pusher in the neighborhood.

1366
01:31:25,792 --> 01:31:27,834
Come, Skinny. We'll pretend to buy from him.

1367
01:31:28,001 --> 01:31:29,292
OK.

1368
01:31:29,542 --> 01:31:32,501
Stay put, Phoenix. They may recognize you.

1369
01:31:33,126 --> 01:31:34,542
Be careful.

1370
01:31:41,334 --> 01:31:43,876
Are you ready for the boxing tournament?

1371
01:31:44,917 --> 01:31:46,251
Will you come?

1372
01:31:47,042 --> 01:31:48,876
No, I'm heading back to the U.K.

1373
01:31:50,251 --> 01:31:51,417
When?

1374
01:31:52,042 --> 01:31:53,667
Soon.

1375
01:31:54,417 --> 01:31:55,501
I'll come see you.

1376
01:31:56,917 --> 01:31:58,251
What for?

1377
01:32:01,792 --> 01:32:04,584
If I were your partner,

1378
01:32:04,751 --> 01:32:06,292
none of this would have happened.

1379
01:32:10,417 --> 01:32:12,167
If I met you before Kong,

1380
01:32:13,292 --> 01:32:14,501
you suppose we could be

1381
01:32:15,626 --> 01:32:17,292
good friends?

1382
01:32:19,334 --> 01:32:21,209
You cherish your friends too much.

1383
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:23,667
That's why I know you'll find Kong.

1384
01:32:28,834 --> 01:32:30,292
Wrong place.

1385
01:32:30,459 --> 01:32:33,501
They don't know Kong.

1386
01:32:34,459 --> 01:32:35,709
What about the pusher?

1387
01:32:36,709 --> 01:32:38,167
I don't know.

1388
01:32:47,334 --> 01:32:52,167
Come on, Bruce.

1389
01:32:54,917 --> 01:32:59,209
Bruce...

1390
01:33:02,084 --> 01:33:03,417
Let the match begin.

1391
01:33:03,584 --> 01:33:08,084
Charlie Owen from King George V School.

1392
01:33:21,542 --> 01:33:24,459
And Bruce Lee from St. Francis Xavier.

1393
01:33:39,834 --> 01:33:42,542
- Come on, Phoenix.
- Come on, Phoenix.

1394
01:33:42,709 --> 01:33:45,042
You're from La Salle. Why root for him?

1395
01:33:45,209 --> 01:33:46,667
Because I know Bruce Lee.

1396
01:33:46,834 --> 01:33:48,209
He used to go to La Salle.

1397
01:33:48,376 --> 01:33:50,626
His brother Peter is my pal.

1398
01:33:50,876 --> 01:33:52,167
Really? What's your name?

1399
01:33:54,042 --> 01:33:56,792
James Wong. What about you, ladies?

1400
01:33:56,959 --> 01:34:00,126
Sit over there. This seat is taken.

1401
01:34:00,292 --> 01:34:01,542
Really?

1402
01:34:04,626 --> 01:34:06,917
Right, have a drink first.

1403
01:34:15,626 --> 01:34:16,917
I will give you 3 commands:

1404
01:34:17,084 --> 01:34:20,417
go, stop and split.

1405
01:34:21,167 --> 01:34:24,334
No elbows. Put on your mouth guard.

1406
01:34:29,417 --> 01:34:31,834
Punch him up for me.

1407
01:34:32,209 --> 01:34:33,876
Look at him. He's so cocky.

1408
01:34:34,001 --> 01:34:35,459
You can do it, Phoenix.

1409
01:34:38,959 --> 01:34:40,126
Are you ready?

1410
01:34:43,501 --> 01:34:44,376
Go.

1411
01:34:55,334 --> 01:34:57,542
- Phoebe. Agnes.
- Margaret.

1412
01:34:59,459 --> 01:35:00,584
Come on, Bruce.

1413
01:35:00,751 --> 01:35:02,084
Margaret, I'll swap seats with you.

1414
01:35:02,251 --> 01:35:03,626
Sure.

1415
01:35:12,292 --> 01:35:15,042
Good job, Charlie.

1416
01:35:21,042 --> 01:35:25,084
- Dodge
- Watch out, Phoenix.

1417
01:35:25,251 --> 01:35:27,042
- Good.
- Go on.

1418
01:35:45,167 --> 01:35:48,167
Watch his punch... be careful.

1419
01:35:52,501 --> 01:35:54,209
Dodge.

1420
01:35:55,626 --> 01:35:57,126
Fight wisely

1421
01:36:18,667 --> 01:36:20,542
Phoenix.

1422
01:36:23,126 --> 01:36:24,001
Are you OK?

1423
01:36:24,126 --> 01:36:25,501
You're sure?

1424
01:36:26,209 --> 01:36:27,126
Good.

1425
01:36:27,709 --> 01:36:29,917
Come here, Phoenix. Sit down.

1426
01:36:30,167 --> 01:36:32,626
You OK, Phoenix?

1427
01:36:32,792 --> 01:36:34,751
Recognize me?

1428
01:36:34,917 --> 01:36:36,167
Give him some water.

1429
01:36:36,792 --> 01:36:38,084
- Water?
- Don't look at me.

1430
01:36:38,251 --> 01:36:40,126
You won't spill water if he finished it.

1431
01:36:40,292 --> 01:36:41,751
Get him another glass.

1432
01:36:50,917 --> 01:36:52,626
Good job, Finish him off.

1433
01:36:52,792 --> 01:36:54,334
All eyes are on you

1434
01:36:54,501 --> 01:36:56,792
but no pressure. Go.

1435
01:36:59,292 --> 01:37:00,209
Go.

1436
01:37:35,709 --> 01:37:37,167
Bravo. Hit him hard.

1437
01:37:39,334 --> 01:37:41,042
Stop.

1438
01:37:41,167 --> 01:37:43,084
Don't move. Don't move.

1439
01:37:43,251 --> 01:37:44,751
Stop. You can't do this,

1440
01:37:44,917 --> 01:37:48,376
or I'll dock your points. Understand?

1441
01:37:49,126 --> 01:37:50,626
Good. Go.

1442
01:37:59,084 --> 01:38:00,376
Hit back, Phoenix.

1443
01:38:00,542 --> 01:38:02,126
Hurry up.

1444
01:38:51,792 --> 01:38:53,584
Split. Back to your corner.

1445
01:38:55,917 --> 01:38:57,917
It's over...

1446
01:39:13,001 --> 01:39:14,792
Awesome, Phoenix.

1447
01:39:19,501 --> 01:39:20,667
I knew we'd win.

1448
01:39:20,834 --> 01:39:21,667
Phoenix.

1449
01:39:21,834 --> 01:39:23,167
Brilliant, Phoenix.

1450
01:39:23,292 --> 01:39:25,626
You make the family proud.

1451
01:39:25,959 --> 01:39:27,626
I need to talk to you.

1452
01:39:28,459 --> 01:39:29,584
I didn't expect you to show up.

1453
01:39:29,959 --> 01:39:32,626
Of course. We grew up together.

1454
01:39:32,792 --> 01:39:34,209
We're pals.

1455
01:39:34,792 --> 01:39:36,459
Pals...

1456
01:39:36,792 --> 01:39:38,376
I never treated you like a boy,

1457
01:39:38,584 --> 01:39:41,084
so don't treat me like a girl.

1458
01:39:41,917 --> 01:39:42,959
We're buddies.

1459
01:39:43,792 --> 01:39:45,251
Buddies.

1460
01:39:47,292 --> 01:39:49,001
I got a letter for you.

1461
01:39:50,292 --> 01:39:52,126
Pearl has a letter for you.

1462
01:39:55,001 --> 01:39:59,834
Bruce, I found out later you liked me.

1463
01:40:01,001 --> 01:40:02,959
Why didn't you tell me from the get go?

1464
01:40:03,792 --> 01:40:06,001
When I was with Kong,

1465
01:40:06,917 --> 01:40:09,167
I thought you and Margaret were an item.

1466
01:40:10,001 --> 01:40:11,959
Your behavior in front of everyone

1467
01:40:12,417 --> 01:40:15,001
led me to believe you didn't care.

1468
01:40:15,917 --> 01:40:18,834
What happened to Kong broke my heart.

1469
01:40:20,959 --> 01:40:22,834
I got to know you better

1470
01:40:23,334 --> 01:40:25,834
because of your selflessness to your friends.

1471
01:40:27,126 --> 01:40:30,667
But it's too late now.

1472
01:40:31,959 --> 01:40:34,126
I'm on a plane back to the U.K.

1473
01:40:34,626 --> 01:40:37,751
Until we meet again.

1474
01:41:18,084 --> 01:41:22,334
Charlie, it's not all the win, or lose.

1475
01:41:22,792 --> 01:41:23,792
It's one have to

1476
01:41:23,959 --> 01:41:26,459
learn from this experience.

1477
01:41:28,126 --> 01:41:30,501
Bruce Lee... he is so fast.

1478
01:41:33,417 --> 01:41:34,792
I want to fight again.

1479
01:41:35,001 --> 01:41:37,584
Wow, Charlie, I am glad to
hear that you've recovered.

1480
01:41:37,959 --> 01:41:39,334
What is your plan?

1481
01:41:40,334 --> 01:41:42,584
Wow, I request to fight again.

1482
01:41:43,084 --> 01:41:44,917
So I give a message to his brother.

1483
01:41:46,001 --> 01:41:48,334
Bruce Lee has a friend, Lau Lin-kong.

1484
01:41:49,126 --> 01:41:51,376
He's come into investigation with this department.

1485
01:41:51,542 --> 01:41:54,334
We think he's probably involved in drugs dealing.

1486
01:42:00,792 --> 01:42:02,834
Bruce Lee, this is Charlie Owen.

1487
01:42:04,292 --> 01:42:07,251
It's good fight, but I want to fight you again.

1488
01:42:08,792 --> 01:42:12,834
This match has no audience, no arena,

1489
01:42:13,126 --> 01:42:17,626
no gloves, no rules.

1490
01:42:19,126 --> 01:42:20,292
I want a re-match.

1491
01:44:24,459 --> 01:44:25,584
Again.

1492
01:46:30,709 --> 01:46:32,292
Are you OK?

1493
01:46:49,417 --> 01:46:51,251
I just thought of a new strategy.

1494
01:46:51,501 --> 01:46:53,417
Next time we fight, I'm going to win.

1495
01:46:54,251 --> 01:46:55,751
Fight again? Now?

1496
01:46:55,917 --> 01:46:57,251
No, thanks.

1497
01:46:58,167 --> 01:47:00,751
I think you broke my rib with your kick.

1498
01:47:02,209 --> 01:47:03,209
That was amazing.

1499
01:47:03,376 --> 01:47:05,251
You must teach me.

1500
01:47:09,876 --> 01:47:11,667
That's how street fights

1501
01:47:11,834 --> 01:47:13,709
differ from boxing.

1502
01:47:14,792 --> 01:47:19,292
Honestly, our match was pretty close.

1503
01:47:20,834 --> 01:47:22,001
But I've never been

1504
01:47:22,167 --> 01:47:25,917
beat down so bad.

1505
01:47:27,959 --> 01:47:29,792
You got potential to be a good fighter.

1506
01:47:29,959 --> 01:47:31,709
So do you, my friend.

1507
01:47:32,917 --> 01:47:35,667
Do you have a friend named Lau Lin-kong?

1508
01:47:37,417 --> 01:47:39,126
I've been looking for him.

1509
01:47:39,834 --> 01:47:42,292
My dad is superintendent. I know where he is.

1510
01:47:43,459 --> 01:47:47,292
Lau Lin-kong's parents are my dad's friends.

1511
01:47:47,542 --> 01:47:49,001
They reported him missing.

1512
01:47:49,959 --> 01:47:51,959
My dad sent out a detective to look for him.

1513
01:47:52,459 --> 01:47:55,876
He found out Kong's involved with
a drug house in the New Territories.

1514
01:47:56,042 --> 01:47:57,459
I think he's there.

1515
01:47:58,376 --> 01:47:59,417
Light a cigarette for me.

1516
01:47:59,667 --> 01:48:00,876
Get away.

1517
01:48:01,084 --> 01:48:03,292
- Give me a cigarette.
- Get away...

1518
01:48:11,792 --> 01:48:13,042
Recognize him?

1519
01:48:13,709 --> 01:48:14,834
Yes.

1520
01:48:15,501 --> 01:48:17,501
Especially that asshole in the back.

1521
01:48:29,709 --> 01:48:30,792
One by one.

1522
01:48:31,001 --> 01:48:32,167
Get in line.

1523
01:48:35,376 --> 01:48:36,709
One by one.

1524
01:48:59,209 --> 01:49:01,084
We're done, let's go eat.

1525
01:49:01,542 --> 01:49:03,126
I'll walk you out, Boss.

1526
01:49:07,126 --> 01:49:08,626
When is the next shipment?

1527
01:49:08,792 --> 01:49:10,876
- I'll take care of that.
- Right.

1528
01:49:21,459 --> 01:49:23,001
Come with me, Sloppy Cat.

1529
01:49:23,626 --> 01:49:25,292
Skinny, you're on the lookout.

1530
01:49:25,459 --> 01:49:26,876
Call the cops if anything goes wrong.

1531
01:49:27,042 --> 01:49:29,251
Be careful, Phoenix. You too.

1532
01:49:36,584 --> 01:49:37,834
Kong.

1533
01:49:39,584 --> 01:49:41,209
Go away, leave me alone.

1534
01:49:42,209 --> 01:49:43,376
What happened to you?

1535
01:49:43,542 --> 01:49:45,126
We can talk about this.

1536
01:49:45,417 --> 01:49:46,792
Go away, leave me alone.

1537
01:49:46,917 --> 01:49:48,584
Pearl sent me.

1538
01:49:49,751 --> 01:49:51,167
We've been looking for you for 2 months.

1539
01:49:52,876 --> 01:49:57,501
Please don't tell her where I am.

1540
01:49:57,917 --> 01:49:59,209
I beg you.

1541
01:49:59,626 --> 01:50:01,501
She cares about you.

1542
01:50:03,542 --> 01:50:04,417
Let's go.

1543
01:50:04,584 --> 01:50:05,792
Leave me alone.

1544
01:50:05,917 --> 01:50:07,501
What's wrong with you, Kong?

1545
01:50:10,084 --> 01:50:14,459
Get money from my parents. I'm broke.

1546
01:50:14,626 --> 01:50:20,959
Wake up, Lau Lin-kong.

1547
01:50:22,584 --> 01:50:27,001
Leave me alone.

1548
01:50:27,876 --> 01:50:30,167
I don't need your mercy.

1549
01:50:30,626 --> 01:50:33,251
Especially you, Bruce Lee.

1550
01:50:33,667 --> 01:50:35,501
Bruce Lee.

1551
01:50:35,959 --> 01:50:38,792
Remember what you promised me?

1552
01:50:39,501 --> 01:50:41,167
Remember that?

1553
01:50:41,959 --> 01:50:46,876
You're going to be a pilot,

1554
01:50:47,209 --> 01:50:51,626
get married

1555
01:50:51,876 --> 01:50:54,626
and have kids.

1556
01:50:54,834 --> 01:50:56,834
Leave me alone.

1557
01:50:58,792 --> 01:51:00,959
Just turn back.

1558
01:51:01,126 --> 01:51:03,667
- Leave me alone.
- Go away.

1559
01:51:05,667 --> 01:51:06,209
Don't do this, Kong.

1560
01:51:06,376 --> 01:51:08,001
Get up.

1561
01:51:09,876 --> 01:51:11,542
What are you doing?

1562
01:51:11,876 --> 01:51:12,376
Kong.

1563
01:51:12,542 --> 01:51:15,667
I knew I saw you just now. Let go.

1564
01:51:18,376 --> 01:51:20,084
What's wrong with you?

1565
01:51:20,251 --> 01:51:22,834
It's the movie star Bruce Lee.

1566
01:51:23,001 --> 01:51:24,792
I have such affinity with your family.

1567
01:51:25,001 --> 01:51:26,876
Don't let them get away, Boss.

1568
01:51:27,042 --> 01:51:30,251
They'll probably squeal to the cops.

1569
01:51:30,501 --> 01:51:31,751
Boss.

1570
01:51:37,542 --> 01:51:38,251
What the hell.

1571
01:51:41,501 --> 01:51:42,126
What the hell.

1572
01:51:47,917 --> 01:51:49,709
Kong. You're OK.

1573
01:51:50,251 --> 01:51:54,084
Call the cops. Bruce is trapped.

1574
01:51:54,251 --> 01:51:55,792
What?

1575
01:51:59,167 --> 01:52:01,376
Do whatever, but don't mess with the goods.

1576
01:52:01,542 --> 01:52:02,792
Don't make me...

1577
01:52:02,959 --> 01:52:03,417
Phoenix.

1578
01:52:03,584 --> 01:52:05,459
If you toss that, you'll never get out alive.

1579
01:52:05,626 --> 01:52:08,084
You wouldn't dare.

1580
01:52:15,834 --> 01:52:17,251
Give me a hand, Sloppy Cat.

1581
01:52:19,667 --> 01:52:21,001
Sloppy Cat.

1582
01:52:26,959 --> 01:52:28,292
Help me open it.

1583
01:52:30,542 --> 01:52:31,792
There.

1584
01:52:35,001 --> 01:52:36,126
Go up.

1585
01:52:40,751 --> 01:52:42,084
Give me your hand.

1586
01:52:48,792 --> 01:52:49,959
They're up there.

1587
01:52:58,001 --> 01:52:58,584
Get them.

1588
01:52:58,792 --> 01:52:59,917
Be careful, Boss.

1589
01:53:01,167 --> 01:53:02,834
Wrap your hand with this.

1590
01:53:09,459 --> 01:53:10,917
Don't move.

1591
01:53:12,167 --> 01:53:14,084
- Stop.
- Don't move.

1592
01:53:15,334 --> 01:53:18,459
Stop. Bruce Lee.

1593
01:53:18,959 --> 01:53:20,292
- Go.
- Hurry.

1594
01:53:21,542 --> 01:53:22,834
Get them.

1595
01:53:25,126 --> 01:53:27,876
- There. Hurry.
- Don't move.

1596
01:53:30,501 --> 01:53:31,626
Come on.

1597
01:53:32,959 --> 01:53:34,501
- Jump over.
- Come on.

1598
01:53:35,251 --> 01:53:37,709
Don't look, just jump.

1599
01:53:39,751 --> 01:53:41,001
Go.

1600
01:53:42,042 --> 01:53:43,042
You idiot.

1601
01:53:43,709 --> 01:53:46,001
Quick.

1602
01:53:47,876 --> 01:53:50,876
- Just go.
- Don't mind me, go

1603
01:53:51,792 --> 01:53:53,917
Yes, yes, don't let go of him.

1604
01:53:57,459 --> 01:53:58,667
You're useless.

1605
01:54:04,667 --> 01:54:06,167
Careful, Boss.

1606
01:54:07,334 --> 01:54:09,834
Faster, don't let him run away.

1607
01:54:15,959 --> 01:54:18,167
Faster. I can run faster with a broken leg.

1608
01:54:22,876 --> 01:54:24,542
- Go.
- Stop there.

1609
01:54:28,042 --> 01:54:29,251
Stop there.

1610
01:54:33,376 --> 01:54:35,042
Watch out.

1611
01:54:47,334 --> 01:54:48,834
Phoenix, don't let go. Help.

1612
01:54:49,001 --> 01:54:50,501
Hang on.

1613
01:54:53,251 --> 01:54:54,542
Let me...

1614
01:55:15,834 --> 01:55:17,501
Don't let go.

1615
01:55:18,876 --> 01:55:20,417
Help pull me up.

1616
01:55:35,084 --> 01:55:36,959
Hurry.

1617
01:55:37,501 --> 01:55:38,876
Over there.

1618
01:55:39,417 --> 01:55:42,501
Boss, the cops are here.

1619
01:55:43,042 --> 01:55:44,376
Go, Boss.

1620
01:55:46,751 --> 01:55:48,334
Don't let go.

1621
01:55:50,334 --> 01:55:51,709
Kong went down.

1622
01:55:54,959 --> 01:55:56,459
Kong.

1623
01:56:18,959 --> 01:56:20,792
Lau Lin-kong, he's from the U.K.

1624
01:56:25,417 --> 01:56:26,626
We're the Tigers

1625
01:56:27,459 --> 01:56:28,459
of

1626
01:56:29,126 --> 01:56:30,167
Kowloon

1627
01:56:30,626 --> 01:56:31,792
City.

1628
01:56:35,126 --> 01:56:35,584
Buddy.

1629
01:56:35,751 --> 01:56:37,834
Just turn back.

1630
01:56:38,042 --> 01:56:40,334
Leave me alone.

1631
01:56:45,709 --> 01:56:47,167
Thanks, Bruce.

1632
01:57:00,667 --> 01:57:02,209
Run.

1633
01:57:13,084 --> 01:57:16,501
The Police busted the joint and
arrested the drug dealer.

1634
01:57:17,084 --> 01:57:19,084
Lau Lin-kong was rushed to the hospital.

1635
01:57:20,209 --> 01:57:22,709
He kept his distance after his recovery.

1636
01:57:23,709 --> 01:57:27,042
His death in the mid-60s was
allegedly drug related.

1637
01:57:27,959 --> 01:57:31,167
Bruce never got over losing him.

1638
01:58:22,751 --> 01:58:24,251
Down on your knees.

1639
01:58:29,209 --> 01:58:31,459
Kowtow to your ancestors.

1640
01:58:38,959 --> 01:58:41,376
You're in big trouble.

1641
01:58:42,834 --> 01:58:44,459
People are injured

1642
01:58:44,959 --> 01:58:46,792
and you destroyed their dope.

1643
01:58:47,542 --> 01:58:51,167
Two things will happen if you stay.

1644
01:58:53,209 --> 01:58:57,084
You either go to jail or get beaten to death.

1645
01:58:59,584 --> 01:59:01,584
That's why I'm sending you to the U.S.

1646
01:59:06,584 --> 01:59:11,251
I hope you'll keep your nose clean

1647
01:59:12,376 --> 01:59:14,584
and stay out of trouble.

1648
01:59:19,209 --> 01:59:20,876
When you come back,

1649
01:59:23,084 --> 01:59:26,167
the family can be reunited.

1650
02:01:33,292 --> 02:01:37,792
Mother, watch over Phoenix in the U.S.

1651
02:01:38,001 --> 02:01:42,042
Pray he'll make a name for himself abroad.

1652
02:01:43,292 --> 02:01:44,626
When he comes back,

1653
02:01:44,792 --> 02:01:50,084
we'll be one happy family again.

1654
02:02:05,251 --> 02:02:06,334
3 days later,

1655
02:02:06,501 --> 02:02:09,667
we sent Bruce off
at the Kowloon Wharf pier.

1656
02:02:10,626 --> 02:02:13,751
I remember the ship was called
the SS President Wilson.

1657
02:02:26,876 --> 02:02:28,167
Mom.

1658
02:02:30,667 --> 02:02:33,501
According to Shunde customs,

1659
02:02:33,667 --> 02:02:35,876
the father cannot see his son off.

1660
02:02:37,501 --> 02:02:39,084
I understand.

1661
02:02:39,459 --> 02:02:40,876
You're on your own out there.

1662
02:02:41,042 --> 02:02:43,167
Be careful.

1663
02:02:43,417 --> 02:02:44,834
Don't worry about me.

1664
02:02:45,001 --> 02:02:48,459
Settle down first.

1665
02:02:48,626 --> 02:02:50,417
I've applied for college.

1666
02:02:50,542 --> 02:02:53,001
You can pick me up then.

1667
02:02:53,167 --> 02:02:55,501
- Phoenix.
- Phoenix.

1668
02:02:58,001 --> 02:03:01,584
Like I said, we're buddies.

1669
02:03:01,751 --> 02:03:02,834
You said it.

1670
02:03:07,417 --> 02:03:08,709
What's the matter?

1671
02:03:09,209 --> 02:03:10,417
Enter the Dragon into a foreign land.

1672
02:03:10,584 --> 02:03:12,334
OK, Dragon.

1673
02:03:13,417 --> 02:03:15,001
We'll make a film when you get back.

1674
02:03:15,167 --> 02:03:17,542
You'll be Wong Fei-hung, I'll be Shek Kin.

1675
02:03:22,251 --> 02:03:23,792
Phoenix.

1676
02:03:26,667 --> 02:03:28,292
When are you coming home?

1677
02:03:29,959 --> 02:03:31,001
Robert.

1678
02:03:31,792 --> 02:03:34,751
You'll be proud of me when I come home.

1679
02:03:38,667 --> 02:03:40,084
