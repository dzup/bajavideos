Several years ago,I obtained a private video under
the title GUlNEA PlG.

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:19,075
Its commentary said that
''This is a report of an experiment on the breaking point
of bearable pain and the corrosion of people's senses''...

3
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:27,036
...but it was, in fact, an exhibition of devilish cruelty as 3
perpetrators severely abused a woman.

4
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:36,878
Note: ''Guinea Pig'' is defined as any
experimental material.

5
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,989
Summer 198X

6
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:40,596
HIT

7
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,229
Gee, my hand hurts.

8
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:36,429
KICK

9
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,389
Ho,ho, what are you doing, Yegg?

10
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,877
Ho,ho, stand up, hurry.

11
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,350
Who said stand up?

12
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,995
Ditzy!

13
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,109
Yegg, why are you alive?

14
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:43,389
Stand up, hey. Quick! You live for nothing, don't you?

15
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,757
Dumb!

16
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,989
Don't try and get away, you bitch. Stupid!

17
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,389
Hey, where are you going, where are you going?

18
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,549
Don't make me tell you again!

19
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,669
Don't stand up. Stay there, ho.

20
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,389
I didn't say stand up, psss!

21
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:40,549
Idiot, hey.

22
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,880
Hey, what? I see, you can't stand up any more.

23
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,829
Try to stand up, hey. I said stand up.

24
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,069
Hey, don't go away. I said, don't go away.

25
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,309
Hey, ho.

26
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,829
What? lt is too early to sleep, hey. Get up!

27
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:18,469
Get up! I said, get up, hey. Get up!

28
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,109
I can't tell if you're alive or dead. Say something, Yegg.

29
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,469
Pssss!

30
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,549
I know, it's painfull!

31
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,869
What? You finished? Hey!

32
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:50,640
Stand up to me, hey.

33
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,589
Are you alive or dead? Hey!

34
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,869
Hurry up, hurry.

35
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:06,469
Ho!

36
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,429
Hurry up!

37
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,429
What? Give you a crack.

38
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:33,309
CLAW

39
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:30,030
UNCONSCIOUS

40
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,869
Hey, it's to early to pass out.

41
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:04,229
It has just started.

42
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:27,349
Hey, open your mouth. Hey, drink! More!

43
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,709
Open your mouth. Wider!

44
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,829
You must open.

45
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:54,349
Uh.oh, make a dodge!

46
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:39,989
A SOUND

47
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,189
SKIN

48
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:31,549
BURN

49
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,349
WORM

50
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:28,269
GUTS

51
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,789
That's something.

52
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:24,909
A little more. See!

53
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:30,069
All right, all right.

54
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:55,629
NEEDLE

55
00:41:39,800 --> 00:42:01,554
The details of this experiment were missing when I received
this video but the name, age and other information on the woman
and the three man in this video are under investigation.
