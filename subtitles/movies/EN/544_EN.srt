1
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,547
Prime Minister Musayev,

2
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,882
if you don't recognize me,

3
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:57,882
Iook hard at my face and you'll understand.

4
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:02,585
General Vasilly Topov
was not only my father,

5
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:05,560
he was my comrade, my leader in battle.

6
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,698
And now his fight
for the liberation of Pasalan

7
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,095
is my own.

8
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,305
His army is under my command,

9
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,164
and I will stop at nothing

10
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:16,741
to make his dreams become reality.

11
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,542
Prime Minister Musayev,

12
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:29,712
we have occupied
the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.

13
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,752
The abandoned city surrounding
the complex is under our control.

14
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:41,896
No longer can we be ignored.

15
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,764
Now, we are the occupiers.

16
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,408
Any attempt to penetrate its borders

17
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,636
will be met with fierce resistance.

18
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,672
The reactor
has been rigged with explosives.

19
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:59,377
Detonators have been set to 72 hours.

20
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,476
Should our demands go unanswered,
they will go off.

21
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:05,215
Such an explosion
would produce a radiation cloud

22
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:07,417
100 times stronger
than the bombs dropped on Japan.

23
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,592
We call for the imminent release of all

24
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:16,691
227 political prisoners you've held captive.

25
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:21,166
We call for the complete
and total independence of Pasalan.

26
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,336
Nothing less will be deemed acceptable.

27
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:29,447
Prime Minister Musayev, this fight
is not only about country and politics,

28
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:31,842
it is about blood.

29
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:32,985
Mine...

30
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:34,052
...and now yours.

31
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,818
We have your children.

32
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:39,019
Should you ignore my demands

33
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,989
they will be the first to go.

34
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,495
I urge you to act responsibly.

35
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,057
We ask only to be free,

36
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:52,569
as you would want your children to be free.

37
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,140
Come on, come on, come on.

38
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:09,118
That's it. Hey, take it easy.

39
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:14,153
This way.

40
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:18,961
Okay, come on, come on.

41
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:23,768
Over there, right over there.
All right, now take it easy. Take it easy.

42
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:28,734
Hey, easy! For Christ's sake,
there's spare parts in there!

43
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:30,902
Morons.

44
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,101
Sit.

45
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:22,259
-How do you feel?
-I feel good.

46
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,827
-Any problems?
-No.

47
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,001
-Do you know where you are?
-Yes.

48
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,901
-Do you know why you're here?
-Yes.

49
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:40,670
Is it necessary for you to question
the things you don't know?

50
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,748
-No.
-Excuse me, Doctor.

51
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,379
Thank you.

52
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,849
Okay, can you please move
your right fingers,

53
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,751
one by one, beginning with the forefinger?

54
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,483
-Limited range.
-All right.

55
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:54,951
Okay.

56
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:59,358
-Do you feel warm?
-Yes.

57
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,932
I'm gonna cool you off.

58
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:23,017
Very good. You were very good today.

59
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,048
So you've seen the security tape
from the museum?

60
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,317
I have.

61
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,995
You want to describe what you saw,
or shall l?

62
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:06,888
I saw an armed assailant take
direct hits to vital areas

63
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,460
and still manage
to overpower a security detail.

64
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,331
This remind you of something?

65
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,971
White Tower was shut down over a year ago.

66
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,001
-Maybe it was something else.
-Maybe.

67
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:24,739
But we should still prepare for the worst,
however remote the possibility.

68
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:29,785
So, if we assume the worst,
the problem becomes ours to share.

69
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,412
Hypothetically.

70
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,587
So then, hypothetically,

71
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:37,387
what is our shared solution?

72
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:29,208
Let's load them up.

73
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:45,963
On April 26th, 1986,
Chernobyl Reactor Number 4 exploded.

74
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:49,534
Worst nuclear power plant accident
in history.

75
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,133
The ensuing fire released a plume

76
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:55,401
of highly radioactive fallout
into the atmosphere.

77
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,175
The city of Chernobyl was evacuated

78
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,178
and has remained abandoned
for over 20 years.

79
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:04,811
We believe the rebels have set up
their bunker

80
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:07,715
in one of the buildings adjacent
to the reactor complex,

81
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:12,051
about two miles due east
from our current position in Chernobyl city.

82
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:18,385
While the site itself
no longer has enough fuel to make a bomb,

83
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:20,795
it has 100 times the radiation.

84
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:26,195
An explosion in Reactor Number 3
would release that radiation.

85
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:29,573
And now for the bad news.

86
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:33,270
It appears the general's son has gotten
his hands on some of our weaponry.

87
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:36,937
Here to explain, Dr. Richard Porter.

88
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:45,884
In the 1960s, with war in Asia looming,

89
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:50,023
the U.S. began research
into Operation Black Tower,

90
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,063
what we've now come to call
the Universal Soldier program.

91
00:13:55,534 --> 00:14:00,403
A high-response, self-sustaining,
quick-healing, stronger, faster soldier,

92
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,498
fueled by high-concentrate
nutritional supplements.

93
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:07,409
A soldier that operates
without conscience or hesitation.

94
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:11,345
By freezing a human body
with nitrogen-based gas,

95
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:15,853
repairing it and reheating it
through thyroid and pituitary augmentation,

96
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:19,486
we were able to revive
a recently-deceased soldier,

97
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,391
and, in the process, improve them.

98
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:25,294
Programmable and erasable.

99
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,327
One that you can turn on and turn off.

100
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:32,302
Deceased, as in dead?

101
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:38,333
That's right.
Five years ago, the program was suspended,

102
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:42,380
or, rather, replaced by a program
known as White Tower.

103
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:46,643
Led by Dr. Robert Colin,
under my supervision,

104
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:51,348
White Tower sought to improve and perfect
what Black Tower had introduced.

105
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:57,386
Using gene therapy techniques developed
during Dr. Colin's cloning research,

106
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:02,456
we were able to give our UniSols
a DNA tune-up from the inside out.

107
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:06,169
The new model was superior
in every physical capacity,

108
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,264
a virtual killing machine.

109
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,672
The next generation UniSols,

110
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,778
or NGUs, as we like to call them.

111
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:20,843
There was, however,
an incident in a government building.

112
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:25,715
Twelve dead. Nobody injured.

113
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,292
It was considered to be a malfunction,

114
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:33,456
though I believe their temperature
had not been properly moderated.

115
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:37,592
We were instructed to shut down
all the existing NGUs, which we did.

116
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,861
But there was a break-in.

117
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:44,475
Some things were taken,
including a Series 7 model.

118
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:49,213
We have reason to believe
it was my former colleague, Dr. Colin.

119
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:52,215
We suspect
he's been continuing his studies.

120
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:57,120
Colin's been operating
out of Eastern Europe as a gun-for-hire.

121
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:01,389
Gentlemen, we'll be fighting
against the perfect soldier.

122
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:05,594
One who is impervious to injury and pain,
quicker than hell,

123
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:08,861
and with a nervous system
unaffected by radiation.

124
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,771
We have four first-generation UniSols

125
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:16,102
that are more than capable
in this type of endgame.

126
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,373
Dismissed.

127
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:25,341
-You say four, Colonel.
-That's correct.

128
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:28,978
-I thought there was five.
-There were. Now there's four.

129
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,646
What happened to the fifth?

130
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:34,817
He's the subject of a privately-funded
program run by Dr. Sandra Fleming.

131
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,122
-Project Phoenix.
-Doing what?

132
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,461
Behavioral modification therapy

133
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:43,932
or psychological rehabilitation,
as Dr. Fleming calls it.

134
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,974
She's trying to reintroduce him into society.

135
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:54,277
He was one of the very first,
but by far the best of the group.

136
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:59,647
Dr. Fleming has been conducting
her research in Switzerland.

137
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,981
I think of escape.

138
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,151
Peaceful feeling.

139
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,633
-Shame.
-Why do you say that?

140
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:20,995
-I don't know.
-Yes, you do.

141
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,270
Just say the first thing
that comes into your mind.

142
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,968
I don't remember.

143
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:32,477
Maybe for things I have done.

144
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,254
What have you done, Luc?

145
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,293
I don't know.

146
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,496
I think he's hungry.

147
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:54,569
Why don't you feed him?

148
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,781
How do you feel?

149
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,688
Helpless.

150
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:20,626
Maybe you're feeling
the weight of responsibility.

151
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,967
It's what it feels like to grow older, Luc.

152
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,738
Do you realize how far you've come?

153
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,338
Two years ago when we started this,
when you first woke up,

154
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,003
you couldn't remember the day before.

155
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:41,376
-My head feels full.
-It's just another stage in your development.

156
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:45,651
We're getting there.

157
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:07,839
You may have forgotten our agreement,
Doctor, but I haven't.

158
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:10,107
Consider this my last reminder.

159
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:14,948
I haven't forgotten, I've been in surgery,
which appears to be quite a success.

160
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:19,488
-So, when will we do it?
-I told you, I'm gonna run a diagnostic...

161
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:23,288
I have to guarantee the safety of my men,
as well as my own.

162
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:27,462
It'll be taken care of.

163
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,837
So you want to wait? Then I guess
the wire transfers can wait as well.

164
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:35,840
What's the hurry, right?

165
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,572
-Miles.
-Yes, Doctor?

166
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,741
The general's son is growing anxious.

167
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:46,175
He'd like to be micro-chipped this instant.
It can't possibly wait.

168
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:51,350
I'm nobody's son anymore, Doctor.
It is Commander Topov.

169
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:54,451
Right.

170
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:02,026
I've done it to myself.
It does hurt a little bit now.

171
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:03,601
Maybe for you.

172
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:10,097
-Failsafe is active, sir.
-Satisfied?

173
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:12,941
No. My men.

174
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,471
Fine. Round them up.

175
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:43,924
Gentlemen, two-pronged objective.

176
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:47,403
Securing of the reactor site
and the dismantling of the detonators,

177
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:49,770
and the extraction
of the two known hostages.

178
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:53,206
Now, we have reason to believe
that the children are being held here.

179
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,870
However, their positions could be fluid,

180
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,177
so we're moving in
on a staggered six-front maneuver.

181
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:00,649
Disable all communication
and transportation vehicles

182
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:03,687
that you encounter,
and remember the objective.

183
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:08,192
If it comes down to either-or,
we go big picture and we take the reactor.

184
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:12,188
-Are there any questions?
-What if we encounter the freak?

185
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:14,228
Avoidance, if you can.

186
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:19,626
-Keep it occupied.
-ls that the best you can do, Doctor?

187
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:23,904
It's probably programmed
to defend the reactor site,

188
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:26,677
so it'll stick close to it like a nest,

189
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:31,772
making it impossible to use high-powered
weaponry in the presence of the explosives.

190
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:35,709
Captain, your men should not engage
with the NGU.

191
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:38,946
That's what my men are for.

192
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,506
-It's hot in here.
-Take your coat off.

193
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:08,013
-We've been here before?
-Every week.

194
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:11,185
That's what I thought.

195
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:15,749
-Can I get you guys some coffee?
-Yeah, sure, I'll have some coffee, thanks.

196
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:19,558
-What would you like, Luc, to drink?
-Orange juice.

197
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:23,124
Great. I'll be right back to take your orders.

198
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:29,474
-How are your knees feeling?
-A little better.

199
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:34,373
I think the anti-inflammatories are working.
We need to get you some more of those.

200
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:37,744
The weather report said
there may be another snow front on the way.

201
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:40,147
Could get a couple of inches
over the weekend.

202
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,653
I think the cold weather's
been affecting your joints.

203
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:48,019
The next shipment should be in
by next week, so...

204
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:00,929
Luc!

205
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:06,104
Luc, stop! Luc! No!

206
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:09,642
Luc, stop! Luc!

207
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:14,341
Luc, stop! Stop!

208
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,415
No! Luc, no!

209
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:20,687
No! Luc, stop, stop!

210
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,260
Luc, stop!

211
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:28,457
-Somebody help him.
-Go! Go! Go!

212
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,306
-Man down! We got a man down.
-Move, move, move!

213
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:37,529
-Let's go! Move, move, move! Go!
-Come on, come on!

214
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:54,984
Hold fire, holding fire.
All units proceed to reactor complex.

215
00:25:55,687 --> 00:26:00,420
Repeat, hold fire, holding fire.
All units proceeding to reactor complex.

216
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:04,689
Copy that. Unit One holding fire.
All units holding fire.

217
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:07,196
-All systems green, sir.
-Good.

218
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:14,266
The complex in sight.
All units falling into position, over.

219
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:22,813
Unit One, Unit Two, two units,
report to the south perimeter. Cover your...

220
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,178
Unit One holding. Contact back.

221
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,053
I'll take the north side.

222
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,288
Unit Two is on the move.
Proceeding to north perimeter.

223
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:35,484
Unit Two to north perimeter.

224
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:40,462
Unit Two, hold position in north perimeter.

225
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:46,865
We're on the south perimeter, Structure 3.
We're going in. Over.

226
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:49,406
Burke, the show's on.
Send them in and provide cover.

227
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:51,941
Sir, we have successfully taken out
all lines of defense.

228
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:53,601
We need to send in two units.

229
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:57,842
Negative. Send in the freaks.
That's an order, Burke. Pull back.

230
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,881
Roger that.

231
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:02,949
It's all yours, boys.

232
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:08,250
Don't fuck it up.

233
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,998
How long before they reach
the Meeting Point A?

234
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:49,566
Stand by, sir.

235
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:29,931
There he is. There he is.

236
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,032
-Shut him down.
-I'm on it.

237
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:03,472
Holy shit, did you see that?
Did you see that?

238
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:07,273
One is out. Tell Two and Three
One is down.

239
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:10,472
We need Two, Three and Four to triangulate
on the new position. Do it!

240
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:42,839
We're gonna triangulate... Come on!

241
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,642
We're gonna triangulate on what's...
Hang on!

242
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:46,011
Triangulate... Listen to me.

243
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,233
Let him go! Let him go!
Move Four to the reactor.

244
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:06,462
Have Three engage. Have Three engage.

245
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,286
-What the hell is going on?
-He's too fast. They can't track him.

246
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,633
All right, let's get Four to the reactor.
Get Four.

247
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:19,835
Four moving to the reactor, sir.
Four moving.

248
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:44,093
-Sir, approaching the reactor right now.
-Okay, there they are. There they are.

249
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:47,729
-Shut them down, Doctor.
-Deactivate. Repeat, deactivate.

250
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:37,069
Complete evac. Send the order.
Burke, complete evac. Pull them out!

251
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:38,267
-Evac. Evac.
-Pull back now!

252
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:40,276
-Get everybody out of there!
-Complete evac now. Complete evac.

253
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:41,436
Colonel.

254
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:44,174
Tell them to retreat. Get them out.
Get the men out of there.

255
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:47,046
-Retreat. I repeat, retreat...
-Get them all out. Tell him that is an order...

256
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:49,517
-You're not coming in clear.
-Sir.

257
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:25,084
We're under fire. Unit One under fire.
Falling back.

258
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:55,076
Shit.

259
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:59,044
Colonel Petrov's down.
Request transportation.

260
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,483
No, no.

261
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,952
Request transport.

262
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:04,218
Go. Go.

263
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:07,456
Listen to me, God damn it.
You're coming with me.

264
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:16,902
Go now. Take him with you. Go.

265
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:24,914
Take him with you! Go!

266
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:30,819
Look. Is he coming?

267
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:29,143
-How's my boy?
-I feel good.

268
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:33,873
Good. That's very good.
That's my good boy.

269
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:35,643
Yes.

270
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:38,920
Magnificent.

271
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:07,915
That's because
we're gonna give you a chance

272
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,782
to explain the situation when they get here.

273
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:11,821
-I told you from the start...
-We were sitting ducks out there.

274
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:14,083
You don't need to tell me.
I saw it with my own eyes.

275
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:16,056
If you let us in,
we would've taken him out ourselves.

276
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,185
You didn't stand a chance. You never did.

277
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:22,630
-Hey, hey, come on. Knock it off. Get back.
-You don't have to like it, but it's the truth.

278
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:25,531
It took on your entire outfit
and forced you to retreat.

279
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:28,969
One man.
We're talking about a perfect specimen.

280
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:32,099
One who knows nothing other
than to obey an order.

281
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:34,074
Something you seem
to know nothing about.

282
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:37,147
-Fucking knock your teeth out!
-Hey, hey, hey! Get back!

283
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:48,556
What the hell was that?

284
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,987
"This imprudent act of aggression
has resulted in a swift response.

285
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:58,458
"We have detonated one of the explosives
around the reactor.

286
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,129
"Consider it a warning shot.

287
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:05,604
"The world doesn't appear to apply pressure
to the Bosorow bullies.

288
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,507
"They're allowing them to stall.

289
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:10,838
"You are not doing anything.
Think about your children."

290
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:39,490
I empathize with your father.

291
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:40,925
I know how he feels.

292
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:45,533
You only hope for your family to be safe.

293
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:48,871
And when they are not you carry it with you

294
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:50,133
Iike a cancer.

295
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:54,472
Unlike me, he can change this.

296
00:41:58,616 --> 00:42:02,814
I would rather die
than see my father give in to you.

297
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:08,415
And so it may be, for all of us.

298
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:14,157
Hey. Stockholm syndrome, huh?
Bonding with the captives.

299
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,389
You know, I'm touched.

300
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:20,459
What's the matter with you, Doctor?
Did the kids pick on you in school?

301
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:25,270
Yes, yes, they did.
I was asthmatic, bad athlete, terrible skin.

302
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:28,368
-Don't be so hard on yourself.
-No, no, it's true.

303
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,969
Perhaps I overcompensated.

304
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,071
Yes, we all congratulate you
on your science project.

305
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:35,777
Now, why don't you go back to your room?
You're boring us.

306
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:39,815
Hey, you know, kids,
this is an important lesson.

307
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:43,419
You always have to ask yourself
who's in control.

308
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:49,957
It's not always the one doing the talking.
Sometimes it's the guy in the background.

309
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,898
I mean, okay,
let's be honest with ourselves here.

310
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:56,970
You call that an army?

311
00:42:57,141 --> 00:43:00,304
Come on, it's a bunch of peasants
with slingshots.

312
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:03,344
But just one of my men, just one...

313
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:06,176
That's all it took.

314
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:10,444
Now I want you to imagine
an army of men like that.

315
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,721
That, children,

316
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:18,322
that is real power.

317
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:22,357
Bravo.

318
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:27,196
-Very captivating.
-Thank you.

319
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,634
Or maybe your poodle
would like to get a word in.

320
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:36,542
My poodle. Well, he's kind of shy.

321
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:40,242
-No, please...
-He's not blessed with the gift of the gab.

322
00:43:41,852 --> 00:43:45,948
Then maybe you can shut the fuck up
and do what I'm paying you for.

323
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:51,522
Hey, you're the boss.

324
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:06,668
We think that the main detonators
are over here.

325
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:08,745
Pull back and encompass
the whole compound.

326
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:10,336
Copy that, sir.

327
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:11,770
That's the cooling tower.

328
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:14,475
If we can get in those pipes,
we can access the reactor there.

329
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:17,645
It's probably been capped off after
the accident, but it can be reopened, sir.

330
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,121
He's here.

331
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,174
Hello, Luc.

332
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:47,945
I expect you're feeling somewhat fatigued.
That's normal.

333
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:52,217
The sedation should wear off soon enough.

334
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:55,117
Sandra?

335
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:58,626
Dr. Fleming is here
and has authorized this examination,

336
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:04,599
so there should be no cause for alarm.
We're your friends. You're home, Luc.

337
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:08,967
I have a few questions for you.
Please answer yes or no.

338
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:12,474
-I want to talk to Sandra.
-Just answer the questions.

339
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:17,304
Do you see yourself as a person
who is a reliable worker?

340
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,517
Yes.

341
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:25,020
Do you see yourself as a person
who is original, comes up with new ideas?

342
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:26,712
No.

343
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:31,718
-ls relaxed? Handles stress well?
-Yes.

344
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:35,731
-Starts quarrels with others?
-Sometimes.

345
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:38,598
Yes or no.

346
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:41,267
Sometimes.

347
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:47,575
I'm gonna give you something
that will help with your recovery.

348
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:52,204
I'm gonna make you feel better, Luc.

349
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:55,843
Gonna make you whole again.

350
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:11,398
Where am l?

351
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:21,208
Where am I?

352
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:35,621
We started him on a mixture of both
psychotropic drugs and ergogenics.

353
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:37,216
-His system isn't ready for that.
-Methylphenidate

354
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:39,022
-and mentenolone...
-Please, listen to me.

355
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,562
His nervous system will break down.

356
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:43,633
You can't reverse years of hormonal therapy
in a day.

357
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:48,034
It's like rehabilitating a fight dog,
then putting it back to fight.

358
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:53,198
-This could backfire in a myriad of ways.
-Rehabilitation was never part of his design.

359
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,505
And as you can see,
he's at odds with his nature.

360
00:46:55,612 --> 00:46:58,172
He was created to serve a need,
and he's not doing that.

361
00:46:58,282 --> 00:47:01,251
But now
you're just compounding the situation.

362
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:05,151
Dr. Fleming, you have to ask yourself
whether a dog, once it has tasted blood,

363
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:07,189
can ever forget that taste.

364
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:12,092
There is substantial power inside of him
that I have spent two years regulating.

365
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:15,197
If you unleash it this quickly,
you may not be able to control it.

366
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:19,497
Just get him up to speed, Doc.
You let me worry about controlling it.

367
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:25,769
Listen. You said something
about some pipes earlier.

368
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:26,843
-Yes, sir.
-You still think you can

369
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:28,809
-get in through there?
-I know I can, sir.

370
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:30,903
Okay, we're gonna try this your way.
Listen to me.

371
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,380
This is strictly recon.
Do not engage this thing.

372
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:34,745
It's not combat. You understand?

373
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,479
-Yes, sir.
-Okay, let's go.

374
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:29,647
Why is she in there?

375
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:33,783
Unfortunately, at the moment,
she's the only one he trusts.

376
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:41,563
You know, in business, as in life,
people are so distrustful.

377
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:43,995
-They always want insurance.
-Yes, sir.

378
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:47,730
I mean, whatever happened
to the handshake deal? Am I right?

379
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:51,569
-You're right, sir.
-Failsafe. Everybody wants a failsafe.

380
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:56,038
-But where is my failsafe? You understand?
-Yes, Doctor.

381
00:51:56,713 --> 00:51:59,910
No, no, I'm asking you. Where's my failsafe?

382
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:07,419
-This is your failsafe.
-And why is that?

383
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:13,252
Because the NGU cannot hurt
the commander and his men.

384
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:14,489
Right.

385
00:52:14,664 --> 00:52:17,565
But... But he can.

386
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:19,535
Indeed he can.

387
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:22,062
-Very smart, Doctor.
-Of course it is.

388
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:25,403
You see, Miles,
there's always a way around things.

389
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:29,672
Now, I want you to count his fingers
and toes. No, I'm just kidding.

390
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:33,445
We've come a long way from replicating
sheep, wouldn't you say, Miles?

391
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:34,778
Yes, sir.

392
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:40,587
Happy birthday, my boy.

393
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:33,701
Colonel, I can disconnect this thing.

394
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:36,269
That'll tip them off too soon.

395
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:39,974
Find the kids. Do not engage the freak.
We need you alive.

396
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:41,814
Roger that.

397
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:18,414
He's going to do as he threatens, you know.

398
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:22,918
Are you listening to me?

399
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:26,188
I have to address the country in an hour.

400
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:28,025
I can't discuss this with you right now.

401
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:30,223
You are not alone in this.

402
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,358
You think I don't know this?

403
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:35,669
Sending in troops
was the act of a desperate man.

404
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,569
That frightens me.

405
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:39,365
They've left me with no choice.

406
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:40,667
Yes they have.

407
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:42,639
Is it right to sacrifice others' children
but not our own?

408
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:43,735
And what then?

409
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:44,814
What is proved?

410
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:50,886
I am obliged to think beyond myself.

411
00:54:51,187 --> 00:54:53,087
Beyond our son and daughter.

412
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:54,348
Obliged to what?

413
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:56,391
Your image in history?

414
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:00,989
If you allow something to happen to them,

415
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:04,299
I will never forgive you.

416
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:01,321
I hear two voices.
You guys picking this up? Over.

417
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:08,022
There's a female voice.
That must be where he's got the kids.

418
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:31,081
-We don't have all day, Miles.
-Yeah, right. Okay, Doctor, all right.

419
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:38,126
Miles is gonna run the diagnostic today,
Andrew. Are you okay with that?

420
00:56:40,797 --> 00:56:44,096
-Yes.
-Okay, first question.

421
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:47,363
You are a punctual and reliable person.

422
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:50,030
Yes.

423
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:55,035
You know how to make efficient use
of your time.

424
00:56:55,678 --> 00:56:56,702
Yes.

425
00:56:57,147 --> 00:57:01,049
Okay. Friends find you impulsive
and unpredictable.

426
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:03,608
No.

427
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:08,890
You like to spend leisure time relaxing
in a tranquil family atmosphere.

428
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:11,451
Yes.

429
00:57:13,897 --> 00:57:16,798
You often contemplate
the complexity of life.

430
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:23,596
Yes.

431
00:57:27,177 --> 00:57:29,577
Andrew, did you hear the question?

432
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:33,680
-Hook him up.
-Yes, sir.

433
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:43,518
Okay, just a sec.

434
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:49,894
Andrew, listen carefully.

435
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:54,995
You often contemplate
the complexity of life.

436
00:57:58,107 --> 00:58:00,234
-No.
-That's right.

437
00:58:01,177 --> 00:58:04,044
You have to listen, Andrew. It's important.

438
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:44,782
As the leader of a nation in crisis,

439
00:58:44,888 --> 00:58:49,985
my decisions have been dictated
by a single principle:

440
00:58:50,093 --> 00:58:52,755
to serve the common good of the people,

441
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:54,921
no matter what might be sacrificed
in the process.

442
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:59,764
While pride demands aggression
be met with aggression,

443
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:03,703
humanity depends on diplomatic
and peaceful conflict resolution.

444
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:07,708
It is therefore the responsibility
of those in positions of power

445
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:12,247
to question any hard line policy

446
00:59:12,348 --> 00:59:14,578
that threatens survival as we know it.

447
00:59:14,684 --> 00:59:17,881
Therefore, I have authorized

448
00:59:17,987 --> 00:59:20,820
the release of 110 prisoners

449
00:59:20,924 --> 00:59:23,518
in exchange for immediate
deactivation of the detonator

450
00:59:23,626 --> 00:59:25,924
at Chernobyl reactor three.

451
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:28,429
Over the next 48 hours

452
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:32,865
all troops will stand down
in ceasefire mode,

453
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:36,302
as the terms of exchange are implemented.

454
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:39,307
The remaining prisoners
will then be released

455
00:59:39,442 --> 00:59:41,967
in exchange for the hostages.

456
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:56,948
It's over, Luc.

457
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:20,314
We might have had our share of differences,

458
01:00:21,217 --> 01:00:24,118
but it is the result that is important, yes?

459
01:00:26,189 --> 01:00:27,213
Yes.

460
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:32,757
For a world leader to give in to the demands
of a small outfit such as our own,

461
01:00:34,664 --> 01:00:37,633
one should savor
the rarity of the experience.

462
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:40,234
The thing is,

463
01:00:41,104 --> 01:00:46,235
to stop at this moment would be a shameful
waste of both leverage and position.

464
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:49,473
Yeah, you're young, you'll learn,

465
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:53,538
-but now we have to move...
-lt is over,

466
01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:58,552
-and that is that.
-That's not really for you to say,

467
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:03,558
because there have been expenses.
Unanticipated expenses.

468
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:08,120
It's hard to budget these things in advance.
Now, I have an army to build.

469
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:13,097
And, like you said, moments like these
don't often present themselves.

470
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:15,634
I don't think you're hearing me.

471
01:01:20,643 --> 01:01:24,238
You want to fuck around?
Is that what you're trying to do?

472
01:01:27,216 --> 01:01:28,877
You have been paid.

473
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:32,148
You and me, our business together,
it is all over.

474
01:01:32,655 --> 01:01:34,714
You want to try to test me?

475
01:01:35,124 --> 01:01:37,752
Easy. Easy.

476
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:42,129
Who is this?

477
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:44,994
Vasilly!

478
01:02:24,006 --> 01:02:27,134
Okay. Very good.

479
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:30,038
That's a good boy.

480
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:33,541
We have to go now.

481
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:36,951
You have to finish your job. Then we'll go.

482
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:41,822
The children.

483
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:47,196
Can I ask you a question?

484
01:02:48,898 --> 01:02:50,388
No, you cannot.

485
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:55,632
You often contemplate
the complexity of life?

486
01:02:57,406 --> 01:03:00,637
Hey, it's not for you
to ask questions, understand?

487
01:03:06,215 --> 01:03:08,012
-Andrew.
-Yes or no?

488
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:13,085
Andrew, you're tired.
You've been through a lot today.

489
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:17,152
Are you a punctual and reliable person?

490
01:03:18,995 --> 01:03:21,691
I don't like your tone. Sit.

491
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:26,225
-You answer my question.
-I'm not gonna...

492
01:03:27,403 --> 01:03:31,430
How do you feel? Do you feel warm?
Do you need me to cool you off?

493
01:03:32,108 --> 01:03:35,839
-Answer me. Answer my question.
-You answer my question.

494
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:39,171
I'm not gonna an...
Andrew, I want you to sit down.

495
01:03:39,282 --> 01:03:45,187
I need to help... To cool you off now, please.
Sit down. I order you to sit!

496
01:03:46,455 --> 01:03:48,514
Stop it. You have to...

497
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:50,816
You know how to put every minute
of your time to good purpose?

498
01:03:50,927 --> 01:03:53,691
-No! This is a mistake...
-Are you rested?

499
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:55,586
Are you happy?

500
01:03:56,132 --> 01:03:58,726
-Stop. Stop. No.
-Yes or no?

501
01:03:59,302 --> 01:04:03,204
You often think about humankind
and its destiny?

502
01:04:04,073 --> 01:04:05,370
Yes or no?

503
01:04:08,444 --> 01:04:09,672
Who am l?

504
01:04:40,076 --> 01:04:43,512
Be quiet. I'm on your side.
It's okay. It's okay.

505
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:45,277
Are you one of them?

506
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:48,179
-Who?
-One of the ones who can't be killed?

507
01:04:48,484 --> 01:04:52,750
Let's hope so. Now come with me
and be very quiet. Come on.

508
01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:05,491
Come on, let's go. Come on, let's go!

509
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:24,813
Colonel, they've reactivated the detonators.

510
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:27,788
-What the hell are you talking about?
-Look.

511
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:31,323
What's the communication status
on Captain Burke?

512
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:32,519
None.

513
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:36,020
Game's back on.

514
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:18,399
Communications are down.

515
01:06:18,507 --> 01:06:20,532
We've got no way of knowing
if anyone's alive over there.

516
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:22,304
-What about Burke?
-Nothing.

517
01:06:22,411 --> 01:06:26,541
Is it possible your creation might have had
an episode, Dr. Porter?

518
01:06:26,782 --> 01:06:28,272
It's possible.

519
01:06:28,718 --> 01:06:31,744
Thirty minutes.
We're officially at Defcon One.

520
01:06:32,788 --> 01:06:33,948
Where are we with Deveraux?

521
01:06:34,056 --> 01:06:37,082
As he is right now,
he wouldn't stand a chance against the NGU.

522
01:06:37,193 --> 01:06:38,217
Dr. Fleming?

523
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:40,921
If we proceed with the double dosage
and leave him something in reserve,

524
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:43,590
-it's possible we can get him there.
-Then let's do it.

525
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:45,860
But understand this is your last bullet.

526
01:06:45,968 --> 01:06:49,870
Assuming he survives, there'll be no
controlling him, no communication hookup.

527
01:06:49,972 --> 01:06:51,633
He'll know only
what he's been programmed for.

528
01:06:51,741 --> 01:06:54,335
To find those kids and stop the detonation.

529
01:06:54,443 --> 01:06:56,604
-Beyond that...
-Who's gonna dose him?

530
01:06:56,712 --> 01:07:00,307
-It's not gonna be safe in there. I'll do it.
-No, I will.

531
01:07:00,616 --> 01:07:02,174
I owe it to him.

532
01:07:29,812 --> 01:07:31,746
I know what's happening.

533
01:07:34,417 --> 01:07:37,648
-What is happening, Luc?
-I'm going back.

534
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:41,551
I'm going to fight.

535
01:07:45,027 --> 01:07:46,085
Yeah.

536
01:07:49,698 --> 01:07:51,029
I remember.

537
01:07:59,208 --> 01:08:00,675
Give it to me.

538
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,410
I'll do it.

539
01:08:06,148 --> 01:08:08,241
I want to be here with you.

540
01:08:11,053 --> 01:08:12,884
It's not safe for you.

541
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:15,687
It's okay.

542
01:08:22,665 --> 01:08:23,825
Go now.

543
01:09:13,849 --> 01:09:14,838
Go.

544
01:14:52,921 --> 01:14:55,981
Run! Run! Get out of here!
Run! Go, go, go! Run!

545
01:15:59,755 --> 01:16:01,723
Fucking prick.

546
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:11,262
Fucking prick...

547
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:24,559
Keep asking them questions, just...

548
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:29,868
Trying to get some... An answer.

549
01:18:33,275 --> 01:18:34,469
Nothing.

550
01:18:36,311 --> 01:18:38,245
Just a simple yes or no.

551
01:18:40,182 --> 01:18:41,740
It's ridiculous.

552
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:47,888
I knew I had something to tell you.

553
01:18:49,491 --> 01:18:53,655
It was right there on the tip of my tongue.

554
01:18:55,597 --> 01:18:56,655
Shit.

555
01:18:58,867 --> 01:19:03,099
I'm sure I'll remember it in a minute, just...
Just wait right there.

556
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:07,905
Something so familiar.

557
01:19:09,611 --> 01:19:11,238
Can't explain it.

558
01:19:13,215 --> 01:19:16,241
You know exactly
what I'm talking about, right?

559
01:19:16,818 --> 01:19:19,753
You understand. You don't have to answer.

560
01:19:22,157 --> 01:19:24,250
We're good like that, right?

561
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:34,098
We've been over this all before.

562
01:19:42,978 --> 01:19:45,344
I'm just gonna do something here.

563
01:22:13,428 --> 01:22:16,329
I just remembered what I wanted to tell you.

564
01:22:20,435 --> 01:22:21,902
Wait a second.

565
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:52,964
That's Luc.

566
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:59,368
He's just used the booster shot.
Something must have slowed him down.

567
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:02,442
We'll get another 20 good minutes
out of him.

568
01:23:03,478 --> 01:23:04,638
I hope.

569
01:24:15,817 --> 01:24:17,250
Come with me.
