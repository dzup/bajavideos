1
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:38,859
What happened to the dog?

2
00:01:40,206 --> 00:01:41,639
I don't know. He must be around.

3
00:01:51,217 --> 00:01:52,479
They're getting scarce.

4
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:55,617
Yes. And we'll be out soon.

5
00:01:57,123 --> 00:01:59,182
There must be something we can do...

6
00:01:59,926 --> 00:02:02,895
If you need them?

7
00:02:03,896 --> 00:02:05,090
Use them. Period.

8
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:07,291
And don't ask any questions...

9
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:48,608
Fran Zembrino, the actress' son

10
00:02:48,608 --> 00:02:51,202
Disappeared in this cave
with two others guys.

11
00:02:51,544 --> 00:02:54,914
Renzo, this isn't
really news!

12
00:02:54,914 --> 00:02:56,882
Not yet, but it could be.

13
00:02:57,216 --> 00:03:00,186
- I want you there just in case.
- We'll be the only ones there.

14
00:03:00,186 --> 00:03:00,953
Better still.

15
00:03:00,953 --> 00:03:04,013
Did you explain it to him?

16
00:03:04,557 --> 00:03:05,489
Trust me.

17
00:03:07,126 --> 00:03:10,118
- I want us go back there right now.
- What's the matter?

18
00:03:10,496 --> 00:03:12,298
We still have all afternoon.

19
00:03:12,298 --> 00:03:14,567
- We have all our life.
- One moment please,

20
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:17,837
they're sleeping.
They'II be right with you.

21
00:03:17,837 --> 00:03:24,072
- Thanks.
- Let me decide what's best for me.

22
00:03:25,111 --> 00:03:28,945
Maria I'd write a blank check
for each and every word.

23
00:03:29,615 --> 00:03:32,675
Beware of those fantasies smart ass.

24
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:35,188
Or you'll end up with nothing.

25
00:03:35,188 --> 00:03:37,247
You dote on those fantasies.

26
00:03:37,957 --> 00:03:39,754
I live on fantasy.

27
00:03:40,526 --> 00:03:43,796
Happiness wasn't meant for me.

28
00:03:43,796 --> 00:03:46,663
- Hello.
- Sorry. Did I wake you?

29
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:50,466
Yes, this is a town. At this time
of day, we are all sleeping.

30
00:03:51,037 --> 00:03:55,701
- Can I make a reservation?
- No, you can't. It's siesta time.

31
00:03:56,008 --> 00:03:57,339
OK. Sweet dreams.

32
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:00,379
Just leave me alone.

33
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:02,882
I could never be faithful.

34
00:04:02,882 --> 00:04:04,474
Not you, nor anybody.

35
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:07,520
This is Lala Zembrino,
one of her last photos.

36
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,748
And this is a photo of the cave...

37
00:04:09,121 --> 00:04:12,992
And you want us there because
Lala Zembrino's son is missing?

38
00:04:12,992 --> 00:04:15,187
Yes. And because she
may show up in the town.

39
00:04:19,332 --> 00:04:20,959
Will they come and get us?

40
00:04:21,667 --> 00:04:25,159
No. They'll wait for us to leave.

41
00:04:25,738 --> 00:04:26,636
Why?

42
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,267
No one in this town
dares come in here.

43
00:04:31,043 --> 00:04:33,841
- I thought she was dead.
- Who knows?

44
00:04:34,447 --> 00:04:35,641
There was no funeral...

45
00:04:36,215 --> 00:04:37,842
One day she just vanished.

46
00:04:38,451 --> 00:04:40,319
That was forty years ago.

47
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,982
He disappeared a few days ago
and the mother had been in that cave

48
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:49,454
- Do you have enough?
- Yes. I still have some.

49
00:04:50,763 --> 00:04:52,162
Here, take a few more in case...

50
00:04:58,004 --> 00:04:59,639
See? It's got rhythm.

51
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:02,233
No matter what he says,
he keeps his rhythm.

52
00:05:03,876 --> 00:05:05,867
Keeps them glued to the TV.

53
00:05:08,014 --> 00:05:11,350
- I won't be able to speak that fast.
- Don't worry.

54
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,080
It's easy.
I'll explain later. Love you.

55
00:05:28,067 --> 00:05:30,970
I tried to make reservations
by phone but no one took them.

56
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,105
Don't worry about it.

57
00:05:33,105 --> 00:05:34,538
Renzo's made them already.

58
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,966
Renzo?

59
00:05:39,712 --> 00:05:42,448
Julieta. Isn't this all a bit strange?

60
00:05:42,448 --> 00:05:44,550
Don't worry about it.
Just be careful.

61
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,420
- What do you mean, careful?
- Yes, it's one a day,

62
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,910
a while before recording.

63
00:05:50,222 --> 00:05:51,814
Why? What happens?

64
00:05:53,092 --> 00:05:55,617
I have no idea.
But just in case, take only one.

65
00:05:56,195 --> 00:05:58,095
No, really. I don't know...
maybe we shouldn't be...

66
00:05:58,631 --> 00:06:00,929
Trust me.

67
00:06:02,168 --> 00:06:03,396
They can't harm you.

68
00:06:03,869 --> 00:06:05,837
Everybody's taken them
and nothing ever happened.

69
00:06:06,172 --> 00:06:06,763
OK?

70
00:06:24,824 --> 00:06:26,883
Is this the Pablo
you mentioned?

71
00:06:27,193 --> 00:06:27,921
Yes.

72
00:06:44,343 --> 00:06:45,173
Take it.

73
00:06:54,487 --> 00:06:55,818
Come on, don't worry.

74
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:57,177
I'll register you in.

75
00:08:00,986 --> 00:08:02,920
Who's this beauty in the photo?

76
00:08:04,924 --> 00:08:06,926
Ah... a friend.

77
00:08:06,926 --> 00:08:09,495
Don't you recognize her?
It's Lala Zembrino, the actress.

78
00:08:09,495 --> 00:08:10,621
Of course.

79
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,824
I meant the other one.

80
00:08:14,633 --> 00:08:15,998
Ah... her?

81
00:08:17,236 --> 00:08:19,170
That's me. Why?

82
00:09:10,689 --> 00:09:11,485
Hello.

83
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:14,957
Is something the matter?

84
00:09:17,463 --> 00:09:22,526
No. I was... like transported.

85
00:09:24,703 --> 00:09:26,830
That rhythm...
An allegro con fuoco. Right?

86
00:09:29,108 --> 00:09:29,767
Yes.

87
00:09:36,148 --> 00:09:38,013
You're the guy who...
called yesterday, right?

88
00:09:39,018 --> 00:09:39,985
The very same.

89
00:09:41,153 --> 00:09:42,450
What's your room number?

90
00:09:48,127 --> 00:09:49,321
Room five.

91
00:09:49,628 --> 00:09:51,255
This way.

92
00:09:52,932 --> 00:09:55,799
- You treated me really badly.
- Normal.

93
00:09:56,702 --> 00:09:59,728
- Don't you want people to stay here?
- Don't really care.

94
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,597
I just want to get out of here.

95
00:10:02,141 --> 00:10:04,803
- You're journalists, aren't you?
- Yes.

96
00:10:06,378 --> 00:10:07,880
I didn't imagine you like this.

97
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,747
- How then?
- I don't know.

98
00:10:11,951 --> 00:10:14,818
I didn't expect
sensitive souls to music.

99
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,884
- Well, let me be the exception.
- Sure.

100
00:10:32,771 --> 00:10:36,976
You can ask my aunt for breakfast
between 8:30 and 10:30.

101
00:10:36,976 --> 00:10:39,968
The towels are in the closet...

102
00:10:40,546 --> 00:10:43,882
Don't throw the paper
in the toilet. It clogs.

103
00:10:43,882 --> 00:10:48,012
Don't worry. We sensitive souls
don't use the bathroom.

104
00:10:51,156 --> 00:10:53,852
- And where do you want to go to?
- To Buenos Aires.

105
00:10:54,827 --> 00:10:57,523
- What for?
- I'm preparing for a piano audition.

106
00:10:57,997 --> 00:10:58,895
You play really well.

107
00:11:00,332 --> 00:11:04,268
- How old are you?
- How old do you think?

108
00:11:04,903 --> 00:11:09,274
- I don't know, not old.
- Well, I'm older than you think.

109
00:11:09,274 --> 00:11:13,574
- Here are the keys.
- Thanks.

110
00:11:16,482 --> 00:11:19,645
How'd you know the rhythm
on the metronome?

111
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:23,411
I can't tell you.
It's a secret.

112
00:11:25,724 --> 00:11:27,988
And if I told you how old I am?

113
00:11:29,695 --> 00:11:33,825
In that case, it's different.

114
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:41,528
- But you'd have to go first.
- Forget it. I don't trust you.

115
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,069
OK. Come here.

116
00:11:45,644 --> 00:11:47,168
Give me your hand.

117
00:11:57,256 --> 00:11:58,883
Well... what about our deal?

118
00:12:01,226 --> 00:12:03,194
Fourteen...

119
00:12:05,898 --> 00:12:07,490
on Saturday.

120
00:13:35,187 --> 00:13:38,384
Tree explorers disappear in a cave.

121
00:13:39,391 --> 00:13:42,485
Fran Zembrino, Igor and Mauricio.

122
00:13:42,795 --> 00:13:45,662
Fran is trapped where his mother
disappeared years ago.

123
00:13:45,964 --> 00:13:50,526
Lala Zembrino,
the renowned actress.

124
00:13:52,037 --> 00:13:54,028
Just a few pictures remain.

125
00:13:55,974 --> 00:13:58,377
Fran was raised
by nannies far from his mother,

126
00:13:58,377 --> 00:14:00,312
of whom we've known
nothing in 40 years.

127
00:14:00,312 --> 00:14:02,303
Witness report to saw her...

128
00:14:07,686 --> 00:14:08,921
What does seek in the cave?

129
00:14:08,921 --> 00:14:10,445
What lies behind the lady's veil?

130
00:14:12,891 --> 00:14:16,258
Everything that happens, happens,
Be the first to know, beforehand.

131
00:14:22,334 --> 00:14:26,293
That's great! See.

132
00:14:27,072 --> 00:14:29,404
It wasn't so bad.

133
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,061
What's that?

134
00:14:57,169 --> 00:14:59,171
Don't touch it!

135
00:14:59,171 --> 00:15:02,908
- Why?
- I don't know.

136
00:15:02,908 --> 00:15:05,536
Mauricio,
I'm getting tired of this...

137
00:15:21,493 --> 00:15:24,519
- This was the guide.
- What guide?

138
00:15:25,097 --> 00:15:26,564
My mother's.

139
00:15:27,065 --> 00:15:28,498
How do you know that?

140
00:15:29,935 --> 00:15:31,197
He was the one who died.

141
00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:41,746
- Is him?
- No, this is Narciso.

142
00:16:13,845 --> 00:16:14,834
Metronome.

143
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,663
What's the matter, Ana?

144
00:16:34,533 --> 00:16:37,832
- I'm losing my rhythm.
- You should practice more.

145
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,937
The class is over.

146
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:54,144
Ana, you have a good ear.
But it's not enough.

147
00:16:54,853 --> 00:16:57,481
Let's leave this piece for now.

148
00:16:57,923 --> 00:17:01,693
- But the exam is on Wednesday.
- You need to increase the speed.

149
00:17:01,693 --> 00:17:03,820
Let's leave it for next year.

150
00:17:05,197 --> 00:17:07,097
They won't have me next year.

151
00:17:07,466 --> 00:17:08,899
I'll be too old.

152
00:17:16,675 --> 00:17:19,269
- Bye.
- Bye.

153
00:17:21,813 --> 00:17:23,982
- Who is she?
- Just a friend.

154
00:17:23,982 --> 00:17:25,717
Now she's going to start again.

155
00:17:25,717 --> 00:17:28,954
It's a difficult piece.
And very fast.

156
00:17:28,954 --> 00:17:30,922
It reminds me of something.

157
00:17:31,256 --> 00:17:35,127
- Isn't it from a film?
- No, but it resembles "The Hands of Orlac"

158
00:17:35,127 --> 00:17:37,529
- Could be. How'd it go?
- He's a pianist

159
00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:40,198
who loses his hands in an accident.

160
00:17:40,198 --> 00:17:43,190
He has a hand transplant.

161
00:17:43,468 --> 00:17:46,204
That's it! He wanted to play
this piece but couldn't.

162
00:17:46,204 --> 00:17:49,241
- Why?
- His hands belonged to an assassin

163
00:17:49,241 --> 00:17:51,977
and when he started playing,
he had criminal urges.

164
00:17:51,977 --> 00:17:53,968
Those films are all the same.

165
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:56,581
You cannot alter the natural order.

166
00:17:56,581 --> 00:17:59,551
He who rebels
suffers terribly in the end.

167
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,019
- That's the way it is.
- Not always.

168
00:18:02,421 --> 00:18:05,123
- Let's change the subject?
- Don't worry.

169
00:18:05,123 --> 00:18:08,559
For something to happen, she has to
play two consecutive musical phrases

170
00:18:12,364 --> 00:18:13,888
At last!

171
00:18:20,005 --> 00:18:21,370
What will you have for dinner?

172
00:18:32,451 --> 00:18:34,919
- Need any help?
- No.

173
00:18:38,757 --> 00:18:40,816
You should use gloves for that.

174
00:18:41,893 --> 00:18:43,622
This is how we do it here.

175
00:18:45,397 --> 00:18:49,128
- What are you doing up so early?
- I couldn't sleep.

176
00:18:49,634 --> 00:18:50,602
Must be your heart.

177
00:18:50,602 --> 00:18:51,864
It beats too fast.

178
00:18:54,072 --> 00:18:56,540
- Could be...
- Where's your girlfriend?

179
00:18:57,776 --> 00:19:00,142
- Sleeping.
- So... she is your girlfriend.

180
00:19:00,846 --> 00:19:02,837
No. She's my wife, actually.

181
00:19:06,318 --> 00:19:08,684
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

182
00:19:08,954 --> 00:19:11,354
You should care for your hands
if you play the piano.

183
00:19:12,023 --> 00:19:14,253
- It's nothing.
- Show me.

184
00:19:14,826 --> 00:19:16,885
- What for? I'm fine.
- Let me see.

185
00:19:20,132 --> 00:19:22,862
- Let me put cream on that.
- You use cream?

186
00:19:23,268 --> 00:19:25,236
Not me, my wife.

187
00:19:53,598 --> 00:19:54,622
Nice!

188
00:19:57,035 --> 00:19:58,332
What do you keep inside it?

189
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,929
It's a secret.

190
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,803
Aren't you going to tell me?

191
00:20:04,376 --> 00:20:06,469
- No.
- Why not?

192
00:20:10,248 --> 00:20:12,011
If you won't tell me, don't.

193
00:20:12,384 --> 00:20:13,985
You'll tell me at some point.

194
00:20:13,985 --> 00:20:15,953
I'll find something
to negotiate with.

195
00:20:16,521 --> 00:20:19,752
We'd have to get to know
each other too well.

196
00:20:20,358 --> 00:20:21,593
I don't think

197
00:20:21,593 --> 00:20:23,117
I'd even tell you then.

198
00:20:58,496 --> 00:21:03,866
Stop. Don't you feel
something weird here?

199
00:21:04,603 --> 00:21:07,766
Something that's holding us back...

200
00:21:10,942 --> 00:21:12,432
No, not me. And you?

201
00:21:13,345 --> 00:21:14,107
Me neither.

202
00:21:17,315 --> 00:21:18,680
Let me see the map?

203
00:21:23,421 --> 00:21:28,825
We're here,
there should be a trail here.

204
00:21:30,195 --> 00:21:31,219
And where is it?

205
00:21:32,464 --> 00:21:33,931
The place caves in, Mauricio.

206
00:21:34,332 --> 00:21:35,697
That can change the trails.

207
00:21:36,134 --> 00:21:38,336
What do you mean by
trails can change?

208
00:21:38,336 --> 00:21:39,496
Yes... maybe.

209
00:21:40,672 --> 00:21:44,403
So, the places we've passed
they don't exist anymore?

210
00:21:50,282 --> 00:21:51,112
Fran.

211
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:53,577
What now?

212
00:21:54,586 --> 00:21:56,850
Well, if the trails change

213
00:21:57,656 --> 00:22:01,353
our only chance is to get lost.

214
00:22:03,461 --> 00:22:05,053
If so, we're doing great.

215
00:22:18,576 --> 00:22:21,446
Little is known of the explorers
who escaped from the cave.

216
00:22:21,446 --> 00:22:22,881
No one ever said a world.

217
00:22:22,881 --> 00:22:25,250
As if they all...
guarded a common secret.

218
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,686
They say that the cave
gradually swallowed.

219
00:22:27,686 --> 00:22:30,655
The few men who ventured in.

220
00:22:30,655 --> 00:22:31,089
Maybe Fran

221
00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:34,959
needed to travel
to the end of this labyrinth

222
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:37,696
where his mother was lost
many years ago.

223
00:22:37,696 --> 00:22:38,797
Everything that happens, happens.

224
00:22:38,797 --> 00:22:40,731
Be the first to know, beforehand.

225
00:22:44,536 --> 00:22:45,161
Good.

226
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,838
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

227
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:55,075
- Are you sure?
- Yes, everything's fine

228
00:22:57,349 --> 00:23:00,819
- You're acting weird.
- I'm a little dizzy.

229
00:23:00,819 --> 00:23:02,218
It's happened before.

230
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,489
I feel as
if you were talking slower.

231
00:23:07,525 --> 00:23:09,728
When, before?
Why didn't you tell me?

232
00:23:09,728 --> 00:23:11,896
I told you it was weird
from the beginning.

233
00:23:11,896 --> 00:23:15,093
- How much did you take?
- Just one. Count them.

234
00:23:17,902 --> 00:23:19,471
- What are you doing?
- I'm keeping them.

235
00:23:19,471 --> 00:23:20,938
You're not taking any.

236
00:23:21,206 --> 00:23:23,675
- You'll get in trouble, Julieta?
- I don't care.

237
00:23:23,675 --> 00:23:25,336
They'd be stupid to fire me
because of this.

238
00:23:26,745 --> 00:23:28,235
They'll fire you then.

239
00:23:29,647 --> 00:23:30,909
I'll find something else.

240
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,947
I don't yet understand
why you wanted me to come.

241
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:36,086
I thought it would do you good.

242
00:23:37,422 --> 00:23:40,914
That if we could share something
maybe things got better between us.

243
00:23:42,494 --> 00:23:44,189
Or... did you want me to meet Pablo?

244
00:23:46,398 --> 00:23:47,831
That has nothing to do with it.

245
00:23:49,434 --> 00:23:52,767
Although, maybe, this needed
a definition of some sort.

246
00:25:16,154 --> 00:25:17,587
Let's head back guys!

247
00:25:19,023 --> 00:25:21,993
- How?
- I don't know. Let's try that way...

248
00:25:21,993 --> 00:25:23,654
I'm not going back.

249
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,727
Well then, I'm leaving by myself.

250
00:25:33,137 --> 00:25:35,128
I think you should come with us.

251
00:25:35,573 --> 00:25:38,176
- Why?
- Because you're really scared.

252
00:25:38,176 --> 00:25:39,507
And that attracts danger.

253
00:25:40,245 --> 00:25:41,974
Let him go then, Fran.

254
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,475
I'm not following you.

255
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:49,543
I'm not going with a madman.

256
00:25:54,926 --> 00:25:55,824
Can you hear that?

257
00:25:58,229 --> 00:26:02,393
- What?
- The absolute silence.

258
00:26:05,503 --> 00:26:09,774
It's gone. It rarely happens.

259
00:26:09,774 --> 00:26:11,765
It's as if the whole world stopped.

260
00:26:13,044 --> 00:26:17,310
The animals are quiet and the wind
is still for a few seconds.

261
00:26:22,887 --> 00:26:24,081
Hey!

262
00:26:24,956 --> 00:26:26,457
Are you going to town for dinner?

263
00:26:26,457 --> 00:26:27,981
Yes, to see what's happening.

264
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,962
If you want, we can have dinner
then, you can do your thing.

265
00:26:30,962 --> 00:26:32,597
Thanks. I prefer to do my own thing.

266
00:26:32,597 --> 00:26:35,633
- I'm dead tired.
- OK. Bye.

267
00:26:35,633 --> 00:26:37,498
- Another time.
- See you.

268
00:26:38,736 --> 00:26:41,671
- Excuse me. Have you seen my niece?
- No

269
00:26:42,373 --> 00:26:45,035
- We saw her this morning.
- She's nowhere.

270
00:26:45,577 --> 00:26:46,976
I'm going into town.

271
00:26:47,378 --> 00:26:48,279
Maybe somebody saw her.

272
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:50,543
Don't worry,
she must have a boy somewhere.

273
00:26:50,915 --> 00:26:51,643
I don't think so.

274
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,517
She should be back.

275
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:56,614
I rarely go out myself. I don't
like going out alone at night.

276
00:26:57,055 --> 00:26:58,790
- Shall I go with you?
- It's not necessary.

277
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:02,089
- You must have things to do.
- No, I'll go with you.

278
00:27:02,961 --> 00:27:05,429
Remember we have
an early start tomorrow...

279
00:27:49,574 --> 00:27:50,563
He's dead, Fran.

280
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:56,569
In the end, he was right.

281
00:27:59,851 --> 00:28:01,682
There is something funny here.

282
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,953
She only cares about her piano.

283
00:28:04,455 --> 00:28:06,923
She says the town boys
are all stupid.

284
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:09,252
I think she's left town.

285
00:28:10,028 --> 00:28:11,655
She's obsessed with leaving.

286
00:28:12,296 --> 00:28:16,995
It's my fault for letting
Carmen put those ideas in her head.

287
00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:20,035
- Who is Carmen?
- Her piano teacher.

288
00:28:21,639 --> 00:28:25,598
Let's go to her house. I called her
today but she didn't answer.

289
00:28:26,377 --> 00:28:27,344
Carmen!

290
00:28:28,579 --> 00:28:29,637
Carmen!

291
00:28:44,395 --> 00:28:45,987
I think we found her.

292
00:28:48,199 --> 00:28:50,690
Felipe, we have to talk to Carmen.

293
00:28:52,904 --> 00:28:55,202
Come on Felipe...
Just for a second.

294
00:28:59,844 --> 00:29:01,812
What is it that you want?

295
00:29:02,647 --> 00:29:05,207
Don't just stand there
like an idiot?

296
00:29:07,051 --> 00:29:09,110
Have you seen my niece?

297
00:29:10,221 --> 00:29:11,813
She's definitely not here.

298
00:29:12,757 --> 00:29:13,883
Just what we needed.

299
00:29:15,893 --> 00:29:20,694
- Did she say anything about leaving?
- No.

300
00:29:21,099 --> 00:29:22,566
Hello.

301
00:29:24,669 --> 00:29:26,830
Just keep on putting
those ideas into her head.

302
00:29:27,371 --> 00:29:29,271
Don't start that again.

303
00:29:30,408 --> 00:29:33,502
I'd better not say
what I'm thinking.

304
00:29:34,445 --> 00:29:36,777
There are men present.

305
00:29:39,117 --> 00:29:40,948
But if she's left,
it's on your account...

306
00:29:41,486 --> 00:29:46,719
If so, don't worry. She hasn't
got a chance at the audition...

307
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:02,364
Excuse me.
Are you coming from the cave?

308
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,432
- Did you see my niece?
- No.

309
00:30:05,176 --> 00:30:05,972
Are you sure?

310
00:30:06,377 --> 00:30:08,079
We haven't seen her for hours.

311
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:10,013
The last time someone saw her,
she was around there.

312
00:30:10,748 --> 00:30:11,916
Don't worry, Ma'am.

313
00:30:11,916 --> 00:30:12,746
She'II show up.

314
00:30:13,451 --> 00:30:14,713
All right. Thank you.

315
00:30:19,791 --> 00:30:20,883
What was that?

316
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,418
I don't know.

317
00:30:39,977 --> 00:30:40,841
Fran!

318
00:30:46,751 --> 00:30:47,513
Fran!

319
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,208
It's her writing.

320
00:31:24,121 --> 00:31:25,952
- Fran, did you see that?
- Yes.

321
00:31:33,331 --> 00:31:34,730
Look at that.

322
00:31:51,515 --> 00:31:52,777
Were you out all night?

323
00:31:54,986 --> 00:31:56,510
Yeah. We didn't find her.

324
00:31:58,422 --> 00:31:59,787
I'll take a shower and we can go.

325
00:32:01,225 --> 00:32:02,692
It's OK to worry...

326
00:32:04,428 --> 00:32:06,521
but don't forget we're working.

327
00:32:07,832 --> 00:32:09,299
I won't neglect the work.

328
00:32:11,335 --> 00:32:15,139
She must have run away a hundred
times. It's like that in small towns

329
00:32:15,139 --> 00:32:18,108
She probably dates
the milkman since she was seven.

330
00:32:20,177 --> 00:32:21,838
You're adorable, today.

331
00:32:22,847 --> 00:32:23,905
Thanks, love.

332
00:32:25,516 --> 00:32:27,450
Sometimes,
you look like the fourteen year old.

333
00:32:28,486 --> 00:32:29,680
Fourteen?

334
00:32:31,355 --> 00:32:32,344
I thought she was older.

335
00:32:33,557 --> 00:32:35,855
She's a kid.
Are you jealous?

336
00:32:51,776 --> 00:32:53,744
Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

337
00:32:56,213 --> 00:32:59,080
- Any news on your niece?
- No.

338
00:32:59,417 --> 00:33:02,545
- What do you want?
- I'm a little hungry.

339
00:33:03,888 --> 00:33:07,551
- So?
- I woke up and couldn't sleep.

340
00:33:08,292 --> 00:33:10,886
Ah... you slept?

341
00:33:11,729 --> 00:33:14,857
Why? Does it worry you?

342
00:33:15,232 --> 00:33:18,035
No, look this is off limits.

343
00:33:18,035 --> 00:33:20,435
The dining room opens at eight.

344
00:33:21,872 --> 00:33:24,238
So what then? I'm hungry.

345
00:33:25,676 --> 00:33:28,474
I told you.
You can't be in here, wait outside.

346
00:33:30,147 --> 00:33:31,307
OK.

347
00:33:32,016 --> 00:33:33,711
Call me if you need anything.

348
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,894
I'm fine. Don't go looking for me.
You won't find me. Ana

349
00:33:53,938 --> 00:33:54,870
I'm waiting for you

350
00:38:37,521 --> 00:38:38,351
Are you OK?

351
00:38:44,595 --> 00:38:45,653
Can you hear me?

352
00:38:45,929 --> 00:38:46,588
Let me see.

353
00:39:07,184 --> 00:39:08,014
Are you Ana?

354
00:39:10,187 --> 00:39:11,245
Are you Ana?

355
00:39:12,222 --> 00:39:13,052
Can you hear me?

356
00:39:13,957 --> 00:39:15,083
Can you talk...

357
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,697
What took you so long?

358
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,205
Why? How long has it been?

359
00:39:35,179 --> 00:39:37,477
For you, it's been a night.

360
00:39:40,317 --> 00:39:42,785
But for me, a long time.

361
00:39:51,962 --> 00:39:54,698
- No, don't.
- Don't worry, she can't see us.

362
00:39:54,698 --> 00:39:57,724
- Why?
- Because we're moving too fast.

363
00:39:58,035 --> 00:40:00,196
Are we moving too fast
or is it that they've stopped?

364
00:40:00,671 --> 00:40:02,206
No, they're moving as usual.

365
00:40:02,206 --> 00:40:05,573
It is us who are in fast motion
and see them like that.

366
00:40:07,544 --> 00:40:09,913
So, you were waiting for me?

367
00:40:09,913 --> 00:40:13,542
Yes. I'd hoped
you'd know how to get back.

368
00:40:14,485 --> 00:40:16,282
But, it seems you have no idea.

369
00:40:18,322 --> 00:40:21,450
I guess the effect
must wear off at some point.

370
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,454
Or, we'll just have to get
used to one other.

371
00:40:25,896 --> 00:40:26,863
Yes.

372
00:40:28,232 --> 00:40:30,768
Well, I'm going to bed.
I'm a little tired.

373
00:40:30,768 --> 00:40:33,464
- What? Are you still taking siestas?
- It's not a nap.

374
00:40:33,771 --> 00:40:38,435
- Yes it is. It's day time.
- But it's a long time before dark.

375
00:40:39,143 --> 00:40:43,079
No, wait. I had a busy day.

376
00:40:44,114 --> 00:40:48,608
- Pick your house of choice.
- Cool.

377
00:40:54,258 --> 00:40:56,658
Good morning.

378
00:41:00,297 --> 00:41:01,730
Good morning.

379
00:41:02,566 --> 00:41:03,965
How long did I sleep?

380
00:41:05,369 --> 00:41:06,996
A few seconds with any luck.

381
00:41:07,337 --> 00:41:08,702
That's more than enough.

382
00:41:10,574 --> 00:41:15,307
- How did you now I was here?
- It's the biggest house and bed in town.

383
00:41:15,846 --> 00:41:17,404
I used to come here too at first.

384
00:41:18,482 --> 00:41:23,215
If you've tried it all, then tell me
what's best and we can save time.

385
00:41:23,987 --> 00:41:27,524
Mine's the best but,
I'm not going to share it with you.

386
00:41:27,524 --> 00:41:29,014
The bed or the house?

387
00:41:30,227 --> 00:41:31,626
Neither.

388
00:41:32,229 --> 00:41:34,298
Did you have an allergic reaction?

389
00:41:34,298 --> 00:41:36,960
My back itches all over.

390
00:41:37,434 --> 00:41:40,028
That's not a symptom,
it's just the grime.

391
00:41:40,704 --> 00:41:42,262
I think I preferred you
as a teenager.

392
00:41:42,906 --> 00:41:43,895
I don't think so.

393
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,475
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to scratch myself.

394
00:41:52,816 --> 00:41:53,784
If only it had longer legs.

395
00:41:53,784 --> 00:41:54,876
Can you help me?

396
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:01,457
A little more to the left and up...

397
00:42:02,359 --> 00:42:05,726
Harder and further down.

398
00:42:06,597 --> 00:42:08,588
Towards the centre,
Lower...

399
00:42:11,001 --> 00:42:11,695
Lower.

400
00:42:14,271 --> 00:42:14,738
There.

401
00:42:14,738 --> 00:42:15,966
That's enough.

402
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,107
Come with me.

403
00:42:17,107 --> 00:42:19,632
I'll show you something,
you'll want to see.

404
00:42:30,554 --> 00:42:31,788
I discovered a way out of the cave.

405
00:42:31,788 --> 00:42:32,880
No one knows it.

406
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:35,792
- How did you find it?
- I had lots of time.

407
00:42:35,792 --> 00:42:38,729
When I went in, I left signs to
avoid getting lost.

408
00:42:38,729 --> 00:42:42,332
- And, did you see them?
- Yes. I signaled the way out.

409
00:42:42,332 --> 00:42:43,196
Look.

410
00:42:47,037 --> 00:42:50,029
- What about the rest?
- One died.

411
00:42:50,674 --> 00:42:52,972
The other, didn't follow the signs.

412
00:42:53,377 --> 00:42:55,746
- Or he didn't see them?
- Yes he did.

413
00:42:55,746 --> 00:42:58,015
He decided to stay,
to find something.

414
00:42:58,015 --> 00:43:00,484
- Looking for what?
- I don't know.

415
00:43:00,484 --> 00:43:02,653
They found a manuscript.

416
00:43:02,653 --> 00:43:04,354
It mentioned a substance

417
00:43:04,354 --> 00:43:07,414
it could only be found
in that type of soil.

418
00:43:09,192 --> 00:43:11,194
- Do they have enough food?
- I don't know.

419
00:43:11,194 --> 00:43:13,253
Now they can leave
if they want to.

420
00:43:28,645 --> 00:43:31,978
Come on. I need more clothes.

421
00:43:33,483 --> 00:43:35,953
It will be hot when the sun is out.

422
00:43:35,953 --> 00:43:39,047
- Are you wearing your old clothes?
- No, I'll use my mother's.

423
00:43:39,489 --> 00:43:41,582
- And where is she?
- She died.

424
00:43:42,192 --> 00:43:44,394
My aunt told me
she kept her old clothes.

425
00:43:44,394 --> 00:43:47,886
She tries them on
to see if they fit...

426
00:43:48,165 --> 00:43:52,158
but she never gets thin
so they must be in the closet.

427
00:43:53,737 --> 00:43:55,466
- We should come back another day.
- What's the matter?

428
00:43:55,739 --> 00:43:58,537
- Nothing.
- Let me see.

429
00:44:01,411 --> 00:44:03,879
Ana, come here!

430
00:44:05,148 --> 00:44:06,945
I'd better not.

431
00:44:08,018 --> 00:44:11,989
- Why? It's something natural.
- But she's my aunt.

432
00:44:11,989 --> 00:44:14,617
So? Don't aunts have sex?

433
00:44:15,092 --> 00:44:17,219
- What?
- Don't they have sex?

434
00:44:17,694 --> 00:44:21,960
- OK. Well...
- Come on, choose some clothes.

435
00:44:37,714 --> 00:44:41,084
Don't tell me that you've never
spied on anyone in all this time.

436
00:44:41,084 --> 00:44:44,417
- That's what you'd have done.
- You know, I don't believe you.

437
00:44:45,055 --> 00:44:47,080
You'II never know, will you?

438
00:44:47,791 --> 00:44:49,952
So you think you know me well?

439
00:44:51,395 --> 00:44:53,864
I don't see how when
I was a girl, you would...

440
00:44:53,864 --> 00:44:58,267
- I... what? Tell me.
- Nothing.

441
00:44:58,869 --> 00:45:02,339
Well... I haven't talked
to anyone in a while.

442
00:45:02,339 --> 00:45:04,603
So if you'd just keep quiet.

443
00:45:07,778 --> 00:45:11,214
He's finally opened. Going in
through the back was uncomfortable.

444
00:45:17,487 --> 00:45:19,523
Why is there so little food?

445
00:45:19,523 --> 00:45:21,855
I've been eating it all.

446
00:45:22,993 --> 00:45:24,824
Could I make dinner?

447
00:45:25,128 --> 00:45:27,898
Please yourself.
But mind you, I'm not easy.

448
00:45:27,898 --> 00:45:28,796
You're not?

449
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:36,499
How about roast lamb
with mashed peas and mint sauce?

450
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:40,309
You won't find that here.

451
00:45:40,711 --> 00:45:42,345
There are chips, nuts...

452
00:45:42,345 --> 00:45:46,111
That sort of thing.
No. You'll like it.

453
00:45:46,383 --> 00:45:49,318
- I don't know, I'd have to try it.
- You'll see...

454
00:45:49,953 --> 00:45:51,716
Why don't you pick the wine?

455
00:45:58,328 --> 00:46:00,319
You'll like this one,
it's expensive.

456
00:46:00,864 --> 00:46:03,166
No, this doesn't go with lamb.

457
00:46:03,166 --> 00:46:07,193
We should take... A young Malbec.

458
00:46:07,804 --> 00:46:10,500
- As you wish. I'm having coke.
- No you're not!

459
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:14,811
- What are you doing?
- I taking them just in case.

460
00:46:14,811 --> 00:46:15,746
No.

461
00:46:15,746 --> 00:46:19,147
- I'll take them.
It's the best with chips.

462
00:46:21,985 --> 00:46:24,321
- What are you doing?
- We'll get it later.

463
00:46:24,321 --> 00:46:26,789
- I don't have much money.
- Are you going to pay?

464
00:46:27,324 --> 00:46:27,924
Sure.

465
00:46:27,924 --> 00:46:30,260
I've known the owner all my life.
I'm not going to steal.

466
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:31,227
Not this either.

467
00:46:32,562 --> 00:46:35,690
- Where are you getting the money from?
- Stealing it from the bank.

468
00:47:12,769 --> 00:47:13,701
What's wrong?

469
00:47:16,406 --> 00:47:19,075
Nothing, I'll be fine.

470
00:47:19,075 --> 00:47:20,804
It must be the poor diet.

471
00:47:21,278 --> 00:47:23,079
You are going to have a proper meal.

472
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:25,707
A while ago, you told me
it would take a minute

473
00:47:26,216 --> 00:47:27,808
Good things take time.

474
00:47:30,487 --> 00:47:32,114
Are you OK?

475
00:47:32,489 --> 00:47:33,421
I don't know.

476
00:47:38,962 --> 00:47:42,728
- Maybe the effect is wearing off?
- I hope not.

477
00:47:44,167 --> 00:47:44,963
And why not?

478
00:47:52,142 --> 00:47:53,700
Will you bring me the chips?

479
00:47:54,744 --> 00:47:57,372
Don't eat junk.

480
00:47:57,781 --> 00:47:59,840
I'll speed up dinner.

481
00:48:23,306 --> 00:48:25,536
Are you eating junk?

482
00:48:26,276 --> 00:48:29,404
It doesn't cook.
I don't know why.

483
00:48:32,015 --> 00:48:35,712
To cook with this fire
you'd need years.

484
00:48:37,187 --> 00:48:40,156
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Because you didn't ask.

485
00:48:40,457 --> 00:48:43,483
But we went to the supermarket,
got the meat...

486
00:48:43,927 --> 00:48:46,096
- Did you know this would happen?
- Yes.

487
00:48:46,096 --> 00:48:49,156
But you had to
experience it for yourself.

488
00:48:52,302 --> 00:48:54,202
I see you're feeling better,
aren't you?

489
00:48:55,305 --> 00:48:59,142
And I'll be even better
when you beg me for chips.

490
00:48:59,142 --> 00:49:02,245
- That'll never happen.
- Are you going to starve then?

491
00:49:02,245 --> 00:49:04,147
No. You'll give me one
without my asking.

492
00:49:04,147 --> 00:49:07,344
- You're crazy.
- Then, I'll take it by force now.

493
00:49:09,886 --> 00:49:12,354
- I'll report you.
- To whom?

494
00:49:12,689 --> 00:49:14,424
You're taking advantage
of the situation!

495
00:49:14,424 --> 00:49:16,358
No, you are. Come here!

496
00:50:12,682 --> 00:50:15,583
At last. I thought
I'd never manage it.

497
00:50:16,953 --> 00:50:20,184
Here is your prize.

498
00:50:22,525 --> 00:50:24,755
I'm tired of breakfast.

499
00:50:25,328 --> 00:50:27,523
What will we do when
there is nothing left in this town?

500
00:50:27,864 --> 00:50:30,000
- Move to another one.
- Did you ever try that?

501
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:30,830
Yes...

502
00:50:32,202 --> 00:50:33,937
but I came right back.

503
00:50:33,937 --> 00:50:36,872
I knew you'd find me someday.

504
00:50:38,808 --> 00:50:41,538
Plus, there were no pianos in tune.

505
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:52,181
I often imagined this...

506
00:50:53,356 --> 00:50:56,348
- but something is missing.
- And what is that?

507
00:50:57,227 --> 00:50:58,888
To be able to tell somebody.

508
00:51:05,802 --> 00:51:08,293
Tell it to me. I'm Carmen.

509
00:51:12,075 --> 00:51:12,700
Well...

510
00:51:13,076 --> 00:51:17,809
Remember this guy
we didn't like that much?

511
00:51:18,515 --> 00:51:20,312
Who? The good looking one?

512
00:51:21,551 --> 00:51:23,746
No, he was normal.

513
00:51:24,487 --> 00:51:27,388
OK. Well, I'm giving him a chance.

514
00:51:30,393 --> 00:51:31,519
Why is that?

515
00:51:31,861 --> 00:51:34,625
I don't even know why.

516
00:51:35,198 --> 00:51:36,495
And... what else?

517
00:51:38,768 --> 00:51:41,100
- He has a problem.
- What?

518
00:51:41,938 --> 00:51:43,633
He's married...

519
00:51:44,641 --> 00:51:47,576
He must look at this
as a minor episode in his life.

520
00:51:47,944 --> 00:51:50,580
I don't think so. I know the sort.

521
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:52,605
He seems pretty hooked.

522
00:51:53,283 --> 00:51:56,650
Plus, I feel so weird.

523
00:51:58,154 --> 00:52:00,520
I don't let him even get close.

524
00:52:01,224 --> 00:52:02,248
What about him?

525
00:52:03,193 --> 00:52:06,424
He's a little slow.

526
00:52:07,097 --> 00:52:10,294
He respects my space.

527
00:52:13,203 --> 00:52:16,639
What a fool. I thought
they didn't make those anymore.

528
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:18,300
It seems that they do.

529
00:52:19,843 --> 00:52:23,847
I think you should choose
your friends better.

530
00:52:23,847 --> 00:52:25,109
Yes. I agree.

531
00:52:26,416 --> 00:52:28,680
- OK. Now it's your turn.
- For what?

532
00:52:28,952 --> 00:52:30,249
Your turn to tell someone.

533
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:32,815
Mine? I don't need to tell anyone.

534
00:52:33,156 --> 00:52:37,149
Come on, your go.
Talk...

535
00:54:34,544 --> 00:54:37,707
- I know what I'm doing.
- Don't get angry.

536
00:54:39,282 --> 00:54:42,479
- Any news on your niece?
- Yes. She left a letter...

537
00:54:44,621 --> 00:54:47,749
She'll be back
when she runs out of money.

538
00:54:48,391 --> 00:54:49,692
Good morning.

539
00:54:49,692 --> 00:54:51,159
Will you be staying?

540
00:54:51,694 --> 00:54:55,255
- No, I just want something to eat.
- You look familiar.

541
00:54:55,898 --> 00:54:59,469
- Is this your first time here?
- No, I was here as a child. See?

542
00:54:59,469 --> 00:55:04,007
- I never forget a face.
- Yes, you seem very observant.

543
00:55:04,007 --> 00:55:07,943
- I can only offer you tea or coffee.
- I have no toast or croissants.

544
00:55:08,244 --> 00:55:12,382
- I need to eat.
- I've been robbed.

545
00:55:12,382 --> 00:55:15,112
- That's terrible.
We're all missing things.

546
00:55:17,487 --> 00:55:19,717
You must have
something hot and salty.

547
00:55:20,089 --> 00:55:21,818
Some pasta perhaps...

548
00:55:22,158 --> 00:55:22,988
At this time of day?

549
00:55:23,893 --> 00:55:25,793
I have money, to pay you.

550
00:55:31,834 --> 00:55:34,137
- Hello?
- Hello, Gise.

551
00:55:34,137 --> 00:55:37,163
- Where have you been?
- Here... Wasting my time.

552
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:40,636
- Anything on our story?
- Not that I've seen.

553
00:55:40,943 --> 00:55:42,843
People have been asking about you.

554
00:55:43,112 --> 00:55:45,882
Really? Put Renzo on.

555
00:55:45,882 --> 00:55:49,010
He's not here.
We haven't heard from him lately.

556
00:55:49,452 --> 00:55:52,250
If you see him,
tell him to call me.

557
00:55:52,655 --> 00:55:53,917
Bye.

558
00:56:03,633 --> 00:56:05,032
- Have you seen Alex?
- No.

559
00:56:34,564 --> 00:56:37,158
Where are you?

560
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:39,361
Here. Hugging you

561
00:56:45,775 --> 00:56:47,072
How do I go back?

562
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:53,580
A matter of time

563
00:57:33,523 --> 00:57:35,491
- How are you?
- OK.

564
00:57:36,125 --> 00:57:39,356
- OK, I think.
- You're back so soon!

565
00:57:40,129 --> 00:57:43,428
- To me, it seemed forever.
- I was going to wait.

566
00:57:43,766 --> 00:57:46,599
- Obviously. I waited for you.
- What did you wait?

567
00:57:46,903 --> 00:57:50,306
- For years, for you to grow up.
- That was really fast.

568
00:57:50,306 --> 00:57:53,104
But I was ready to wait
for as long as it took.

569
00:57:53,676 --> 00:57:56,110
- What a liar!
- No, I mean it.

570
00:57:57,847 --> 00:57:59,815
I must get to Buenos Aires.

571
00:58:00,316 --> 00:58:02,944
- The audition is today.
- I'm going with you.

572
00:58:03,853 --> 00:58:04,979
What?

573
00:58:06,122 --> 00:58:07,817
And what will you tell your wife.

574
00:58:08,424 --> 00:58:10,359
It doesn't matter. Don't worry.

575
00:58:10,359 --> 00:58:11,694
I want us to stay together.

576
00:58:11,694 --> 00:58:12,929
After all we've been through...

577
00:58:12,929 --> 00:58:14,396
Don't exaggerate.

578
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:16,095
It was only three minutes.

579
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:19,561
Wait for me
at the door at the theatre.

580
00:58:20,036 --> 00:58:21,765
OK. I'II count on you.

581
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:46,351
- Finally. Where have you been?
- I went for a walk.

582
00:58:47,063 --> 00:58:49,691
- What's the matter?
- I took too many.

583
00:58:50,399 --> 00:58:52,301
How many? Are you crazy?

584
00:58:52,301 --> 00:58:53,402
I told you it could be dangerous.

585
00:58:53,402 --> 00:58:56,303
Don't worry. Now, just tell me
everything you know about this.

586
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:00,509
What I know is that Renzo
buys them from a so called Narciso.

587
00:59:13,856 --> 00:59:15,992
When you recover,
we have work to do.

588
00:59:15,992 --> 00:59:17,093
They are asking too many questions.

589
00:59:17,093 --> 00:59:18,294
If they catch us,

590
00:59:18,294 --> 00:59:20,296
- we'll be wasting the morning.
- I can't go on.

591
00:59:20,296 --> 00:59:22,457
I can't go on,
this is all crazy.

592
00:59:23,032 --> 00:59:26,559
Maybe. But you should
have listened. Look at you...

593
00:59:26,903 --> 00:59:27,494
so dirty...

594
00:59:27,803 --> 00:59:29,005
Didn't you just take a bath?

595
00:59:29,005 --> 00:59:31,303
I'm quitting
and I think you should too.

596
00:59:33,142 --> 00:59:34,609
Let's get today over with.

597
00:59:36,178 --> 00:59:37,611
We'll talk about it later.

598
00:59:48,524 --> 00:59:49,388
Narciso.

599
01:00:17,086 --> 01:00:19,486
I couldn't find you
and was really scared.

600
01:00:20,256 --> 01:00:21,814
- Why?
- I don't know.

601
01:00:22,792 --> 01:00:24,555
I though something could happen...

602
01:00:28,664 --> 01:00:31,030
For a second,
I thought you wouldn't come back.

603
01:00:53,189 --> 01:00:54,056
He's delirious.

604
01:00:54,056 --> 01:00:58,117
Says he saw a virgin
who helped them get out.

605
01:01:02,632 --> 01:01:04,500
- Igor?
- Who are you?

606
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:05,398
- I believe you.

607
01:01:06,335 --> 01:01:08,704
Then tell them to follow
the signs and get Fran.

608
01:01:08,704 --> 01:01:10,906
Why doesn't he follow them?

609
01:01:10,906 --> 01:01:11,702
What is he looking for?

610
01:01:12,441 --> 01:01:14,272
He wants to know
why he was abandoned.

611
01:01:25,554 --> 01:01:27,647
I took something.

612
01:01:28,391 --> 01:01:30,586
I was the first woman
to even try it,

613
01:01:33,029 --> 01:01:35,998
Narciso and I traveled
to the centre of the cave...

614
01:01:38,934 --> 01:01:41,835
Where there was a spring
of red glowing liquid.

615
01:01:45,708 --> 01:01:47,972
He was always afraid
of the unknown...

616
01:01:48,711 --> 01:01:50,975
and wanted me to try it first.

617
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:59,650
Everything began to slow down.

618
01:02:01,957 --> 01:02:04,448
Narciso was petrified...

619
01:02:05,161 --> 01:02:08,494
when he saw me... disappear.

620
01:02:58,114 --> 01:03:00,583
The pills are more dangerous
than we thought.

621
01:03:00,583 --> 01:03:02,351
I need you to give them all back.

622
01:03:02,351 --> 01:03:04,046
Why? What happened?

623
01:03:05,387 --> 01:03:06,877
They found Renzo's body.

624
01:03:07,389 --> 01:03:09,357
It looked 120 years old...

625
01:03:11,093 --> 01:03:14,790
- I don't have any left.
- They need to study the pills.

626
01:03:15,531 --> 01:03:17,260
- I don't have any.
- Where are the missing pills then?

627
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:18,901
I don't know.

628
01:03:18,901 --> 01:03:20,459
It's hard to explain.

629
01:03:21,070 --> 01:03:22,264
What are you saying?

630
01:03:23,572 --> 01:03:24,903
And what the fuck
are you looking at?

631
01:03:26,609 --> 01:03:27,234
Stop.

632
01:03:39,288 --> 01:03:41,223
- What are you doing?
- Let me see.

633
01:03:41,223 --> 01:03:43,657
- Why did you take them?
- I didn't. Ana did...

634
01:03:44,193 --> 01:03:46,629
- Who's Ana?
- She's the girl you saw

635
01:03:46,629 --> 01:03:48,256
this morning
when you were with Pablo.

636
01:03:49,064 --> 01:03:51,532
- How do you know that?
- Because I saw you.

637
01:03:53,169 --> 01:03:55,000
I was looking for you
while you were spying on me?

638
01:03:55,638 --> 01:03:58,368
No. It's hard to explain.
And, you wouldn't believe me.

639
01:03:59,508 --> 01:04:00,600
It doesn't matter!

640
01:04:01,076 --> 01:04:03,010
Say it regardless.

641
01:04:04,713 --> 01:04:06,816
I was so accelerated
that you couldn't see me.

642
01:04:06,816 --> 01:04:08,909
To me, it was
as if time had stopped.

643
01:04:09,652 --> 01:04:12,021
For you,
time stopped a long time ago.

644
01:04:12,021 --> 01:04:14,717
- You're right. More than a year ago.
- Since you stopped working.

645
01:04:15,024 --> 01:04:16,592
No, since you lost interest in me.

646
01:04:16,592 --> 01:04:19,322
- Why do you say that?
- Because it's true.

647
01:04:19,695 --> 01:04:21,822
- Tell me who Ana is.
- What for? It's not worth it.

648
01:04:22,131 --> 01:04:25,123
- I want to hear it.
- She's the hotel owner's niece.

649
01:04:27,303 --> 01:04:30,136
For you it's been a moment,
for us, much longer.

650
01:04:33,175 --> 01:04:38,875
- I don't understand.
- It's weird but that's how it is.

651
01:04:39,782 --> 01:04:41,147
But she grew old and you didn't.

652
01:04:41,851 --> 01:04:44,615
I accelerated for a moment.
She accelerated all night.

653
01:04:45,321 --> 01:04:46,754
Where are you going?

654
01:04:47,189 --> 01:04:48,087
To Buenos Aires.

655
01:04:50,025 --> 01:04:50,548
What?

656
01:04:52,695 --> 01:04:53,627
Don't do this to me.

657
01:04:54,663 --> 01:04:56,528
You were a one night stand.

658
01:04:56,866 --> 01:05:00,893
- And you did for love?
- No, I'm fine on my own.

659
01:05:01,370 --> 01:05:05,306
Are you in love
with the chauffeur?

660
01:05:05,708 --> 01:05:10,079
- No! Lord, no!
- Lf it's serious, ask him to stay.

661
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:12,411
- The guy is up for grabs.
- You're crazy?

662
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:16,651
- Let him go.
- So... what's all the fuss about?

663
01:05:18,821 --> 01:05:21,381
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Just pay and let's go.

664
01:05:43,479 --> 01:05:46,039
What is happening here.
It won't start.

665
01:05:48,384 --> 01:05:49,851
Let's see... start the car.

666
01:05:53,455 --> 01:05:57,551
- What's happening?
- Come on, give it some more.

667
01:05:59,561 --> 01:06:01,961
- Go on...
- Well? What's wrong?

668
01:06:03,899 --> 01:06:04,957
It won't work.

669
01:06:05,301 --> 01:06:06,825
Call the mechanic.

670
01:06:32,294 --> 01:06:34,626
If a normal minute...

671
01:06:35,764 --> 01:06:40,394
equals 1440 minutes
of accelerated time...

672
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:43,802
This girl...

673
01:06:44,707 --> 01:06:45,901
the kid...

674
01:06:46,642 --> 01:06:48,576
spent nine hours,

675
01:06:50,579 --> 01:06:57,246
it means she's been 7.000, 700...

676
01:06:57,519 --> 01:07:01,182
Alex, it was much easier
to say it's over between us?

677
01:07:43,866 --> 01:07:45,200
Excuse me.

678
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:47,002
Are the auditions over?

679
01:07:47,002 --> 01:07:50,563
- Yes.
- I'm looking for a friend.

680
01:07:50,973 --> 01:07:52,736
Ana Berardi. Have you seen her?

681
01:07:53,075 --> 01:07:53,871
Let's see...

682
01:07:55,778 --> 01:07:58,113
No, there's no one with that name.

683
01:07:58,113 --> 01:07:59,381
Could you check again?

684
01:07:59,381 --> 01:08:04,053
She has light brown hair,
she's thin, has blond curls,

685
01:08:04,053 --> 01:08:05,954
wears an antique locket.

686
01:08:05,954 --> 01:08:06,755
I know!

687
01:08:06,755 --> 01:08:09,349
Her ID said she was fourteen.

688
01:08:12,027 --> 01:08:15,197
- Come on!
- Did she audition?

689
01:08:15,197 --> 01:08:17,633
No, she was too old
for the orchestra.

690
01:08:17,633 --> 01:08:19,935
- Why? What's the age limit?
- Fifteen.

691
01:08:19,935 --> 01:08:22,204
Though, she said she'd audition
for the symphonic orchestra.

692
01:08:22,204 --> 01:08:24,440
- And when is that?
- Tomorrow. At 10 am.

693
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:27,042
- She has to learn all repertoires
- She may just make it...

694
01:08:27,042 --> 01:08:29,408
From one day to he next?
She won't have time.

695
01:08:29,878 --> 01:08:33,974
Plus, there is something
you can only achieve with time.

696
01:09:09,218 --> 01:09:09,741
Sorry.

697
01:09:39,047 --> 01:09:44,883
Ana, I thought I'd never find you.

698
01:09:47,589 --> 01:09:48,954
Renzo's dead.

699
01:09:49,391 --> 01:09:51,325
Give me the pills...

700
01:09:51,827 --> 01:09:54,955
- Why weren't you here before?
- It got complicated, Ana.

701
01:09:55,664 --> 01:09:57,962
This is very dangerous...

702
01:09:59,001 --> 01:10:00,263
It's too late now.

703
01:10:02,571 --> 01:10:03,902
What did you do?

704
01:10:05,941 --> 01:10:07,932
I thought you wouldn't come.

705
01:10:08,744 --> 01:10:10,439
No, give it to me.
I'II go with you.

706
01:10:10,779 --> 01:10:11,973
I don't have any.

707
01:10:16,018 --> 01:10:18,816
I hope we meet again.

708
01:11:48,710 --> 01:11:49,699
Who are you?

709
01:11:52,948 --> 01:11:55,940
Your son, Fran.

710
01:11:59,888 --> 01:12:00,718
Stay there.

711
01:12:03,792 --> 01:12:05,453
Don't move.

712
01:12:36,325 --> 01:12:38,452
How could you
lock her up like this?

713
01:12:39,027 --> 01:12:41,461
I didn't force her.

714
01:12:41,763 --> 01:12:43,965
She wanted to isolate herself.

715
01:12:43,965 --> 01:12:48,902
To stop time
and be remembered like that.

716
01:12:49,204 --> 01:12:53,008
I had to create a world...
in which nothing moved.

717
01:12:53,008 --> 01:12:54,873
You are a coward!

718
01:12:55,210 --> 01:12:58,907
You gave her something
you'd never have taken.

719
01:13:16,498 --> 01:13:22,437
I had to spare her
from the passing of time.

720
01:13:22,771 --> 01:13:25,535
And did so as best I could.

721
01:13:25,841 --> 01:13:29,436
Now it's your turn to take it
and die in the same way Renzo did.

722
01:13:30,312 --> 01:13:32,114
These are for you.

723
01:13:32,114 --> 01:13:33,945
All for you.

724
01:13:45,327 --> 01:13:48,263
- Fran!
- Who are you?

725
01:13:48,263 --> 01:13:51,164
I need to find the person
who helped you out of the cave.

726
01:13:51,666 --> 01:13:52,826
Is this what you want?

727
01:13:53,568 --> 01:13:55,729
- Yes.
- No.

728
01:13:56,238 --> 01:13:59,007
This is the last of it.
There are no more raw materials.

729
01:13:59,007 --> 01:14:02,408
- The cave is dried up.
- Give it to me! I have to find her.

730
01:14:02,878 --> 01:14:03,867
It's not worth it.

731
01:14:04,312 --> 01:14:05,506
They'll ruin your life.

732
01:14:06,281 --> 01:14:07,771
- They took everything I had.
- And me.

733
01:14:08,216 --> 01:14:11,413
But I still have
some time to get her back.

734
01:16:30,926 --> 01:16:32,154
Is this staying?

735
01:16:32,861 --> 01:16:33,987
No, we're taking it.

736
01:16:34,396 --> 01:16:35,829
I've had it since I was a child.

737
01:16:40,502 --> 01:16:42,834
Don't you want to take that one too.

738
01:16:43,505 --> 01:16:46,372
- You always liked it.
- OK. Thanks.

739
01:16:47,309 --> 01:16:48,071
What did you tell him?

740
01:16:51,479 --> 01:16:53,003
That you were my uncle.

741
01:17:26,815 --> 01:17:29,409
- Shall we go in?
- I'll be right there.

742
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:46,000
