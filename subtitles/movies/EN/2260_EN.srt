1
00:00:14,964 --> 00:00:20,203
Wherever and whenever society
deems life is worthless,

2
00:00:20,203 --> 00:00:25,175
we must see trough the eyes of Eros.
In the fullness of time., it is up to Eros

3
00:00:25,175 --> 00:00:30,113
to restore the balance between life
and death that has been tipped in death's favor.

4
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,842
Andre Breton

5
00:00:56,973 --> 00:01:03,003
Don't look down

6
00:01:35,712 --> 00:01:39,705
Nothing interesting ever happened
to me before I met Elvira.

7
00:02:32,135 --> 00:02:36,037
I was a walking billboard on stilts

8
00:02:38,007 --> 00:02:40,134
and was working as a stuffed pastry

9
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:44,946
up to the very day my life changed forever,

10
00:02:45,315 --> 00:02:48,978
the day that began my transformation.

11
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:20,408
"If the Earth stopped attracting the sea,

12
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,712
the oceans would rise up
and flow towards the Moon"

13
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,507
Dad

14
00:04:35,992 --> 00:04:37,694
Your idea is

15
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,889
Dad's spirit comes home at night
to read your notebook

16
00:04:40,496 --> 00:04:41,485
Yes. I'm sure of it.

17
00:04:45,335 --> 00:04:46,632
And you think he wrote this?

18
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:57,402
You miss the old man a lot.
Don't you?

19
00:05:03,252 --> 00:05:07,245
Even if I didn't miss him.
I know he'd still come home every night.

20
00:05:08,124 --> 00:05:10,560
The dead visit the places they've lived'

21
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,520
They do it for a time
until they forget the lives they once led'

22
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:22,831
Eloy... Are you on drugs?

23
00:06:55,932 --> 00:06:57,524
In a right angle triangle.,

24
00:06:58,434 --> 00:07:05,108
the square of the hypotenuse is equal
to the sum of the squares of the other two sides'

25
00:07:05,108 --> 00:07:06,909
Thinking about your old school days?

26
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:08,103
Yes...

27
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:12,040
Eloy

28
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:19,112
Do you really think Dad would come back from the
grave to remind you of the Pythagorean Theorem?

29
00:07:19,455 --> 00:07:22,356
Last night., that wasn't in my notebook.

30
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:53,549
Events continued to unfold inexhorably

31
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:03,929
The battle unleashed on May 2., 1852 was bloody

32
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:10,833
The troops advanced into enemy territory
razing every village in their path

33
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:22,340
What a disappointment
to discover I was a sleepwalker.

34
00:08:26,556 --> 00:08:28,387
Dad wasn't writing in my notebook.

35
00:08:29,025 --> 00:08:32,562
He wasn't reading it either because
the dead don't need to read to stay informed.

36
00:08:32,562 --> 00:08:33,494
He wasn't reading it either because
the dead don't need to read to stay informed.

37
00:08:38,801 --> 00:08:42,601
I know because my neighborhood
borders on the Under. World.

38
00:08:44,974 --> 00:08:48,535
Every day I cross the border.

39
00:08:59,922 --> 00:09:02,686
The angels avert their eyes to avoid my gaze.

40
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:06,462
They know that if they once looked at me.,

41
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:11,695
they would have to tell me that one day
I'll have to stay on this side of the border... forever

42
00:09:35,391 --> 00:09:40,522
At sunset. The dead come out to sit in the cool
of the evening along the cemetery sidewalk.

43
00:09:41,063 --> 00:09:44,362
They have a sort of a nervous tic

44
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,427
They make the same gesture over and over

45
00:09:50,773 --> 00:09:54,573
I hope I'll see you one
of these late afternoons. Dad.

46
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:58,873
Where are you?

47
00:10:09,992 --> 00:10:13,262
Nobody knows what to do with a sleepwalker.

48
00:10:13,262 --> 00:10:19,068
I read in a magazine we sleepwalkers
are night visitors....

49
00:10:19,068 --> 00:10:24,870
souls electrified and liberated
from our bodies by the moon.

50
00:10:29,645 --> 00:10:33,783
To my mother., my soul free floating
from my body seemed very dangerous

51
00:10:33,783 --> 00:10:37,617
for someone who slept on the terrace as I did.

52
00:10:40,623 --> 00:10:44,527
My brother Andrés built a ghostcatcher.

53
00:10:44,527 --> 00:10:48,861
The idea was for the noise to wake me up
before I went down the stairs.

54
00:10:52,768 --> 00:10:54,870
His invention worked.

55
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,773
I didn't go down the stairs...

56
00:10:57,773 --> 00:11:01,410
I kept right on going
to another neighbor's terraces...

57
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:07,474
and discovered that sometimes
you can fall into Paradise.

58
00:11:20,896 --> 00:11:21,864
Where am I?

59
00:11:21,864 --> 00:11:25,766
In my bed...
You almost killed me...

60
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,668
What happened?

61
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,639
How long have you been sleepwalking?

62
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,546
Since my Dad died...
a few months ago...

63
00:11:43,986 --> 00:11:45,317
Don't you want to be cured?

64
00:11:51,827 --> 00:11:52,794
No...

65
00:11:56,065 --> 00:12:00,502
Then you'll have to learn a few things
so it won't happen again...

66
00:12:02,071 --> 00:12:03,629
You could get hurt.

67
00:12:05,508 --> 00:12:11,538
My name is Celia and this is Elvira.,
my granddaughter.

68
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,809
I wonder why God has sent you...

69
00:12:22,858 --> 00:12:27,659
Dad... Yesterday I went to sleep in my bed
and I woke up in another world.

70
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:31,467
Hi...

71
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:33,560
Elvira is in that world.

72
00:12:33,869 --> 00:12:36,702
I'm going to tell you all about
what it's like to live there.

73
00:12:37,873 --> 00:12:44,608
Pastries... I should have brought
some pastries for tea., not flowers...

74
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:47,572
I preferflowers.

75
00:12:47,883 --> 00:12:50,784
I'm going to look for a vase to put them in.

76
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,474
What does your grandmother do for a living?

77
00:13:21,283 --> 00:13:23,581
She's a therapist.

78
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,586
Do you live here with her?

79
00:13:31,627 --> 00:13:36,462
No. I live in Barcelona.
I'm on vacation.

80
00:13:36,966 --> 00:13:40,800
My Nana is the person
I love most in the whole world...

81
00:13:43,506 --> 00:13:46,532
And besides that., she's my teacher about life.

82
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:04,527
It's one of Nana's specialties.
Apple pie.

83
00:14:04,527 --> 00:14:05,357
Taste it.

84
00:14:13,802 --> 00:14:15,565
She's reading your aura.

85
00:14:17,473 --> 00:14:18,565
What's that?

86
00:14:27,883 --> 00:14:30,545
It's the energy field surrounding all matter...

87
00:14:32,087 --> 00:14:34,385
It's the light surrounding the body...

88
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:43,454
You too can learn to see it...

89
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:50,429
Our aura's color and transparency
say many things about us...

90
00:14:51,774 --> 00:14:53,435
And what color is my aura?

91
00:14:54,877 --> 00:14:56,401
Blue,

92
00:14:57,613 --> 00:14:58,602
indigo blue...

93
00:15:15,864 --> 00:15:19,356
I always knew there were doors
in my neighborhood that led to other worlds.

94
00:15:20,736 --> 00:15:22,438
But the interesting thing was,

95
00:15:22,438 --> 00:15:25,430
I hadn't entered Celia's and Elvira's world
by walking through a door.

96
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:38,718
How about taking a walk with me on stilts?

97
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,649
Teach me how.

98
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:28,527
There must have been some special
chemical component in Elvira's saliva.

99
00:16:36,845 --> 00:16:39,982
Elvira found it easy to walk on stilts.

100
00:16:39,982 --> 00:16:43,679
For a witch., it would be simple.

101
00:16:48,857 --> 00:16:52,486
On a very foggy day, we went for a walk...

102
00:16:52,861 --> 00:16:55,523
We kissed above the clouds.

103
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:10,769
After lunch., Nana takes a nap...
until five o'clock...

104
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,688
I don't want to see God after I'm dead.

105
00:17:25,561 --> 00:17:28,359
I want to see Him here and now while I'm alive.

106
00:17:29,732 --> 00:17:31,359
Let's go look for Him.

107
00:19:29,551 --> 00:19:30,518
I'm sorry

108
00:19:30,853 --> 00:19:36,485
It doesn't matter.
You'll learn.

109
00:19:39,461 --> 00:19:43,420
I can teach you to walk in
Paradise with any woman...

110
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:50,532
I want you to learn to come without climaxing.

111
00:19:52,641 --> 00:19:54,108
What?

112
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,478
Your climax is only a brief sensation.

113
00:20:00,716 --> 00:20:03,446
After. Wards., you're spent for a time...

114
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,650
Lost seed is lost energy.

115
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:11,493
It's fuel that can activate your higher realms...

116
00:20:11,493 --> 00:20:15,429
My higher realms? My head?

117
00:20:16,698 --> 00:20:18,791
My semen is going to go to my head?

118
00:20:19,668 --> 00:20:21,465
No. It's not going to go to your head...

119
00:20:22,838 --> 00:20:28,401
But the energy you don't waste
will power your higher realms...

120
00:20:29,878 --> 00:20:32,711
since you love walking on stilts...

121
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:39,680
You have to learn two things;

122
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:45,718
To control your climax
and to satisfy your partner completely.

123
00:20:48,563 --> 00:20:53,694
If you learn these two things.,
you'll become the best lover in the world...

124
00:20:54,536 --> 00:20:57,505
and you'll live a long and happy life to boot.

125
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,372
Your Nana taught you that too?

126
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,508
In my body there's a hidden pearl...

127
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,455
Your job is to find it.

128
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,254
Look...

129
00:21:20,495 --> 00:21:26,832
I have three buttons
that need your special attention.

130
00:21:28,103 --> 00:21:30,401
Two are here...

131
00:21:33,608 --> 00:21:36,771
They're my positive pole.

132
00:21:41,016 --> 00:21:42,779
Here is the other one.

133
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,444
Come on. Feel it.

134
00:21:48,824 --> 00:21:51,554
It's my negative pole.

135
00:21:53,829 --> 00:21:56,423
Your positive pole is here...

136
00:22:00,002 --> 00:22:02,402
And here is your negative pole...

137
00:22:05,107 --> 00:22:08,508
Every human body has the ability
to generate electricity...

138
00:22:12,214 --> 00:22:15,547
and to make it flow within.

139
00:22:16,885 --> 00:22:23,654
Whenever we are together,
we are going to create a divine bioelectricity.

140
00:22:25,894 --> 00:22:28,761
So we came to talk about electricity?

141
00:22:29,531 --> 00:22:31,726
I thought we came to fuck...

142
00:22:36,471 --> 00:22:38,371
We came to be together.

143
00:22:42,744 --> 00:22:47,579
You can be with me as
you have never been with any other woman...

144
00:22:49,084 --> 00:22:58,425
First., you must kiss., caress,
and suck my three buttons with all your love...

145
00:23:07,169 --> 00:23:08,727
How beautiful...

146
00:23:10,439 --> 00:23:11,428
Thanks...

147
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,475
You'd like me to give you some head.,
wouldn't you?

148
00:23:17,612 --> 00:23:19,739
I'd like to too.

149
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:26,021
But for now. None of that...
It would only make you climax faster...

150
00:23:26,021 --> 00:23:30,424
Practice with my bottom button first.

151
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:45,402
Go ahead... The golden valley awaits you...

152
00:23:52,781 --> 00:23:54,772
That cat is a peeping Tom.

153
00:23:56,585 --> 00:23:58,620
Teodoro W. Is Nana's cat.

154
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,523
Don't worry. He's very discreet...

155
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,792
Don't break your concentration., Eloy.

156
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:05,419
Forget the cat.

157
00:24:21,743 --> 00:24:24,579
We've been in bed for almost an hour...

158
00:24:24,579 --> 00:24:27,048
and "Slim" is asking himself;

159
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:30,484
Why was I invited to this party
if nobody's going to pay attention to me?

160
00:24:33,421 --> 00:24:37,289
I don't think "Slim" is having such a bad time.

161
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,432
Look at how beautiful you are...

162
00:24:44,432 --> 00:24:46,400
You're a lusting faun.

163
00:24:47,636 --> 00:24:50,105
You're beginning to succeed., Eloy!

164
00:24:50,105 --> 00:24:53,597
You've satisfied a woman and haven't lost a drop...

165
00:24:55,644 --> 00:24:57,612
You have the energy to keep going...

166
00:24:58,547 --> 00:24:59,714
Isn't it wonderful?

167
00:24:59,714 --> 00:25:02,774
It may be marvelous, but I'm dying...

168
00:25:03,985 --> 00:25:07,648
Easy. Take it easy.

169
00:25:07,989 --> 00:25:09,320
Now. It's his turn.

170
00:25:10,992 --> 00:25:13,961
No rush. We're doing fine.

171
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:26,908
Tell him to bundle up
so he doesn't catch cold...

172
00:25:26,908 --> 00:25:29,638
What's his name?

173
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:36,518
Tiger fish... otter...

174
00:25:36,518 --> 00:25:37,219
No

175
00:25:37,219 --> 00:25:37,919
Goose...

176
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,387
! NO!! NO...

177
00:25:39,387 --> 00:25:41,223
Those names are too common...

178
00:25:41,223 --> 00:25:45,956
He has to have a unique name...
a name that's his alone.

179
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,988
For example, her name is Adoratrice...

180
00:25:51,666 --> 00:25:52,834
Adoratrice?

181
00:25:52,834 --> 00:25:56,471
Yes. Because I went to a Catholic school
run by the Adoratices.,

182
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:59,440
the Adoring Sisters of the Divine Protuberance...

183
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:11,978
Marlon... His name is Marlon...

184
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,422
Marlon?

185
00:26:14,422 --> 00:26:16,424
In honor of Brando.

186
00:26:16,424 --> 00:26:17,482
Show off...

187
00:26:18,893 --> 00:26:21,453
Slowly... very slowly...

188
00:26:23,398 --> 00:26:24,831
Enjoy the moment...

189
00:26:27,636 --> 00:26:34,599
Feel Marlon penetrating slowly
and gently into Adoratrice...

190
00:26:36,611 --> 00:26:43,813
Feel that naughty girl
opening up to welcome Marlon...

191
00:26:44,986 --> 00:26:52,460
to hold him in a wet., trembling embrace at last...

192
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,394
Do you feel me?

193
00:26:58,633 --> 00:27:02,535
Welcome, Marlon...
What brings you here?

194
00:27:03,972 --> 00:27:06,941
Did you come to play with little Adoratrice?

195
00:27:10,578 --> 00:27:13,547
Wait, wait...

196
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:26,392
Now, I want you to thrust
three times with just the tip...

197
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,193
One...

198
00:27:32,834 --> 00:27:34,062
two...

199
00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:43,578
and one more...

200
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:46,547
deeply, but gently...

201
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:56,284
Stop. Pull out., pull out.

202
00:27:59,694 --> 00:28:09,204
Our first goal will be for you
to reach 81 thrusts without climaxing.

203
00:28:09,204 --> 00:28:10,501
What??

204
00:28:12,073 --> 00:28:16,601
Pull out., Stay there... Withdraw, withdraw...

205
00:28:20,315 --> 00:28:23,451
Stay right there a bit...
wait just a few centimeters away.

206
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:24,686
I'm going to die...

207
00:28:24,686 --> 00:28:28,456
No, you won't die. You won't die...

208
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:30,358
You're going to live a long time.

209
00:28:30,358 --> 00:28:34,021
A man who conserves his
seed will live to a ripe old age.

210
00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:37,363
Then I'm going to die young...

211
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:41,162
Let's breathe together...

212
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:18,640
Now., gently...

213
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:30,780
5, 6., 7., and 8 go deep...

214
00:29:35,623 --> 00:29:46,557
9, 10., 11., and 12... go deep...

215
00:29:49,804 --> 00:29:53,331
you're doing fine... you're doing fine, my love.

216
00:29:53,741 --> 00:30:03,912
Gently... 15., 16, 17, deep!

217
00:30:05,153 --> 00:30:08,179
18... Oh, my God...

218
00:30:09,457 --> 00:30:14,827
The intersection point of two straight lines
that divide the angles of any triangle

219
00:30:16,464 --> 00:30:20,835
into three equal parts are the vertices
of a right angle triangle.

220
00:30:20,835 --> 00:30:22,996
What did you say?

221
00:30:23,938 --> 00:30:27,032
36,37...

222
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:33,481
The amount of current flowing
through a pure resistance circuit is...

223
00:30:33,481 --> 00:30:38,976
directly proportional to
the electromotive force...

224
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:45,858
applied to the circuit and indirectly proportional to...

225
00:30:46,995 --> 00:30:53,594
the circuit's... total... resistance!

226
00:31:03,745 --> 00:31:07,647
I tried... I really tried...

227
00:31:09,417 --> 00:31:11,653
You did very well., my love...

228
00:31:11,653 --> 00:31:13,553
40 thrusts!

229
00:31:14,722 --> 00:31:18,626
You've improved a lot.

230
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:21,618
Next time. I'll have to think of
a more complicated problem.

231
00:31:21,763 --> 00:31:23,594
Ohm's Law is very simple...

232
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:35,402
I don't want you to be a sleepwalker.

233
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:40,538
What guarantee do I have
you won't fall into another woman's bed?

234
00:31:42,517 --> 00:31:45,577
If I stop sleepwalking,
Ana's going to miss me...

235
00:31:46,854 --> 00:31:48,549
Who's Ana?

236
00:31:48,923 --> 00:31:52,393
The hardware store lady around the corner.

237
00:31:52,393 --> 00:31:54,588
It's a long story...

238
00:31:56,264 --> 00:32:01,269
Years ago., it dawned on me that
I could find screws and nuts...

239
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:05,501
tucked away in every nook
and cranny of the house.

240
00:32:10,445 --> 00:32:12,106
And why was that?

241
00:32:13,781 --> 00:32:16,750
I solved the mystery the day
I visited the hardware store...

242
00:32:26,961 --> 00:32:28,360
I agreed with my Dad...

243
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:32,500
I would have been attracted to her too.

244
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,900
Her name was Ana.
The hardware store owner.

245
00:32:44,078 --> 00:32:46,546
I need a nut for this screw...

246
00:33:09,771 --> 00:33:13,673
After my Dad died.,
Ana became a sleepwalker.

247
00:33:42,737 --> 00:33:49,438
One night., we bumped into each other
on the neighborhood rooftops., like two cats.

248
00:33:50,344 --> 00:33:53,006
We struck up a conversation.

249
00:33:54,015 --> 00:33:58,281
Why did the affair end?
Didn't you want it to continue?

250
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,585
He didn't want it to.

251
00:34:02,557 --> 00:34:05,526
But in his letters
he was dying of love for you.

252
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:11,421
Yes... but he chose your mother., your family... you...

253
00:34:14,936 --> 00:34:18,428
Had he been at your side,
would he have died anyway?

254
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,374
We'll never know. Will we?

255
00:34:21,743 --> 00:34:24,405
About a year before he died.,

256
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:29,573
I came across the box in which
he kept your love letters one day...

257
00:34:35,923 --> 00:34:38,756
I couldn't resist the temptation to read them...

258
00:34:46,367 --> 00:34:49,268
I had never read such beautiful letters.

259
00:34:50,538 --> 00:34:53,632
I wouldn't want to die without experiencing
a love like that...

260
00:34:58,412 --> 00:35:00,243
When I saw him burning those letters.,

261
00:35:00,648 --> 00:35:04,209
I thought death might have
something to do with it...

262
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:13,261
I love you. I think about you.
I search for you...

263
00:35:13,261 --> 00:35:14,922
I think I'm afraid.

264
00:35:15,763 --> 00:35:19,426
I only want to caress you,
take care of you...

265
00:35:19,767 --> 00:35:24,372
tell you those stories that made you
fall asleep at my side...

266
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:28,365
trusting our closeness would keep death at bay...

267
00:35:38,686 --> 00:35:41,655
We can wait. Life can't...

268
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:45,359
Nothing lasts forever.

269
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:48,385
That's why it's useless for us
to try to cling to each other.

270
00:35:50,364 --> 00:35:54,824
...between your thighs there
is a well of sleeping water...

271
00:35:56,637 --> 00:36:03,201
That's why it's a vain hope to believe
we can make life go the way we want it to...

272
00:36:03,711 --> 00:36:05,679
Luckily., Mom wasn't home.

273
00:36:07,381 --> 00:36:12,420
Burning wisps of love filled
the patio and were smothered...

274
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,755
by the smoke until they disappeared in the air...

275
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:17,859
...Hours last an eternity
...infinite kisses you sent me...

276
00:36:17,859 --> 00:36:22,630
- I can't help loving you
...travelling along a Moebius strip...

277
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:25,466
- I miss holding you...
- I don't want the forgetting to begin...

278
00:36:25,466 --> 00:36:27,735
and are coming back around to you...

279
00:36:27,735 --> 00:36:30,471
- I don't want the forgetting to begin...
- Yesterday, while inspecting boxes...

280
00:36:30,471 --> 00:36:33,574
- I came across that box of chocolates...
- My hand has become empty and sad...

281
00:36:33,574 --> 00:36:35,676
...I only want to melt my dreams into yours.,
...you gave me for Christmas...

282
00:36:35,676 --> 00:36:37,143
for us to invent new promised lands together...

283
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,638
My love for my Dad deepened...

284
00:36:41,682 --> 00:36:43,582
but I couldn't tell him.

285
00:36:47,722 --> 00:36:52,659
Men, just like elephants.,
have a premonition they are going to die...

286
00:36:58,099 --> 00:37:00,533
And you never saw Ana during the day?

287
00:37:01,369 --> 00:37:06,329
Yes. But Ana never remembered
what had happened the night before.

288
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,271
What can I get for you?

289
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:11,237
A nut for this screw...

290
00:37:26,694 --> 00:37:28,296
Though he never knew it...

291
00:37:28,296 --> 00:37:31,697
from then on I was the keeper of
the greatest secret of his life...

292
00:37:38,472 --> 00:37:41,441
Sex wasn't an important part of my life, Dad...

293
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,368
until the witch's granddaughter turned up.

294
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:51,808
Elvira says all man's weaknesses
are due to his poor sexual technique, but...

295
00:37:53,254 --> 00:37:57,358
How can I be spending all day thinking about...

296
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:00,555
how many times I can thrust
in and out without finishing?

297
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:04,721
.81... impossible.

298
00:38:05,566 --> 00:38:06,533
What's impossible?

299
00:38:09,303 --> 00:38:10,292
No... It's nothing...

300
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,773
You're not a sleepwalker anymore,
are you?

301
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:15,403
I'm not?

302
00:38:16,177 --> 00:38:17,007
I don't think so.

303
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:19,577
How did you cure yourself?

304
00:38:23,517 --> 00:38:25,280
I've been working out...

305
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,292
Your Nana?

306
00:38:34,295 --> 00:38:36,229
Preparing a potion?

307
00:38:37,031 --> 00:38:40,262
No. She's with a patient.

308
00:39:18,806 --> 00:39:20,603
What is it?

309
00:39:22,143 --> 00:39:23,701
Be still.

310
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,941
Is it one of her recipes?

311
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:32,478
It's a recipe more ancient than my Nana.

312
00:39:37,491 --> 00:39:38,753
What's in it?

313
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,483
Taste it.

314
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:47,634
Honey?

315
00:39:49,437 --> 00:39:52,873
It has honey... and what else?

316
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,239
Jasmine?

317
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,242
Jasmine...

318
00:40:02,683 --> 00:40:11,250
Vanilla... dill... orange blossoms...

319
00:40:13,761 --> 00:40:16,457
and essence of musk...

320
00:40:18,466 --> 00:40:21,196
Three virgin's sighs from Granada...

321
00:40:22,703 --> 00:40:25,194
and some cottony August clouds...

322
00:40:26,607 --> 00:40:31,306
and some petals of sorrow mixed
with strawberry ice cream...

323
00:40:40,955 --> 00:40:43,924
Now I'm going to pass the brew over to you...

324
00:40:44,725 --> 00:40:50,498
When we're both well rubbed in oil,
we'll eat each other up. All right?

325
00:40:50,498 --> 00:40:51,658
All right.

326
00:41:10,284 --> 00:41:11,774
What does it say?

327
00:41:14,188 --> 00:41:16,122
"A new life is beginning."

328
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:24,289
That's what Dante said when
he met Beatrice in the Divine Comedy.

329
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:34,000
Whoever would have said I'd discover Dante this
way...

330
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,900
thanks to Elvira's bottom?

331
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,280
We'll take turns caring for her.

332
00:41:44,485 --> 00:41:46,419
This week it's your turn.

333
00:42:28,429 --> 00:42:31,262
I was dying of love for Elvira.

334
00:42:32,266 --> 00:42:35,436
But since no one holds a wake
for the victims of love.

335
00:42:35,436 --> 00:42:37,700
Nobody had noticed yet.

336
00:42:38,772 --> 00:42:40,399
And there I was...

337
00:42:41,242 --> 00:42:43,870
the only "dead" guy in the neighborhood
who reeked of sex...

338
00:42:48,682 --> 00:42:51,318
Silkworm Weaving a Cocoon.

339
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:52,376
What??

340
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,880
In the Tao of Love., this position is called that.

341
00:42:58,525 --> 00:43:00,652
How many positions do you know?

342
00:43:01,695 --> 00:43:05,426
There are four basic positions and 26 variations.

343
00:43:05,699 --> 00:43:08,293
And are we going to try them all?

344
00:43:09,703 --> 00:43:10,897
Maybe.

345
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:16,443
Come on. Let's go for 81 thrusts...

346
00:43:16,443 --> 00:43:18,570
I don't think I can.

347
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,548
Get that idea out of your head...

348
00:43:21,548 --> 00:43:23,550
You can do anything...

349
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:25,245
You just need to try.

350
00:43:27,721 --> 00:43:32,426
Now. Let's increase to five shallow thrusts...

351
00:43:32,426 --> 00:43:35,088
followed by a deep one...

352
00:43:37,631 --> 00:43:39,531
Come on. Marlon...

353
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:44,599
Five times...
slowly and... go deep.

354
00:43:46,774 --> 00:43:49,868
Easy, easy now...

355
00:43:51,011 --> 00:44:02,752
1... 2... 3... 4... slowly.

356
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:13,067
What happens if we divide the angles into
three equal parts instead of two equal parts?

357
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:16,935
Oh., my love...
Do I have to answer you right this minute?

358
00:46:05,946 --> 00:46:08,176
When did you start walking on stilts?

359
00:46:10,317 --> 00:46:12,376
My Dad made my first pair for me...

360
00:46:52,626 --> 00:46:55,652
He made bigger ones for me as I grew.

361
00:47:02,936 --> 00:47:08,397
Mom got scared the day I looked up the world
record for walking on the tallest stilts...

362
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:14,613
I actually built a pair that put me
four meters above the ground...

363
00:47:17,184 --> 00:47:21,280
One windy day., I fell asleep
with my arms wrapped around a cypress tree.

364
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:32,358
That day I was a tree.

365
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:49,513
Is that you., Eloy?

366
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:53,545
No. I'm ham and cheese.
Eloy is tender and spicy beef.

367
00:47:56,490 --> 00:47:58,825
Are you tender and spicy beef?

368
00:47:58,825 --> 00:48:01,919
No, I'm Roquefort cheese.
Tender and spicy beef is the first on line...

369
00:48:06,833 --> 00:48:07,765
Eloy?

370
00:48:08,769 --> 00:48:10,498
What are you doing here?
How did you find me?

371
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,164
They told me you were "tender...
and spicy beef."

372
00:48:15,576 --> 00:48:17,100
I failed again...

373
00:48:18,211 --> 00:48:22,113
No, no! 60 thrusts...
That's very good!

374
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:26,386
M'am., do you know who he is?

375
00:48:26,386 --> 00:48:30,482
You're looking at
the best lover in Buenos Aires...

376
00:48:57,784 --> 00:49:00,582
How long ago did you emigrate to Spain?

377
00:49:02,222 --> 00:49:04,391
I left seven years ago...

378
00:49:04,391 --> 00:49:06,460
But I wasn't always in Spain.

379
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:09,329
I lived in London for a while...

380
00:49:09,329 --> 00:49:16,292
and one day I made the mistake of falling
in love and spent a few months in Paris...

381
00:49:18,171 --> 00:49:21,607
and afterward I spent
a year traveling all over India...

382
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,542
and I've been living in Barcelona
for the last two years...

383
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:27,708
You're a gypsy...

384
00:49:29,116 --> 00:49:31,346
I'm part of the Jewish diaspora...
a wanderer...

385
00:49:34,655 --> 00:49:35,747
What do you do in Barcelona?

386
00:49:37,257 --> 00:49:40,590
I'm a set designer...
and I design clothing too...

387
00:49:42,429 --> 00:49:46,559
And you never found a man
who asked you to stay?

388
00:49:52,673 --> 00:49:55,369
That's the most dangerous
word a lover can say...

389
00:49:59,379 --> 00:50:04,407
But., that's enough nonsense...
Come on...

390
00:50:05,886 --> 00:50:06,910
Let's go to bed...

391
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:12,222
No... Not to bed...

392
00:50:13,894 --> 00:50:17,489
In the Tao., this position is called
Goat Facing a Tree...

393
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:21,329
Now it's called a Goat Riding a Bull...

394
00:50:24,137 --> 00:50:26,731
Let's try for 100., sweetheart...

395
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:29,837
I'm going to die...

396
00:50:32,479 --> 00:50:35,676
It wouldn't be a bad way to die.

397
00:50:37,884 --> 00:50:41,547
What you're learning will prolong your life.
You'll see...

398
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:47,360
When you're 90., you'll be making love to me...

399
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,521
Thousands ofthrusts...

400
00:50:50,363 --> 00:50:54,322
When I'm 90., a thousand thrusts before finishing?

401
00:50:58,839 --> 00:51:00,807
I promise.

402
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:04,041
66...

403
00:51:05,879 --> 00:51:07,437
67...

404
00:51:09,416 --> 00:51:10,542
68...

405
00:51:11,885 --> 00:51:13,284
69...

406
00:51:16,556 --> 00:51:21,619
When I got to 70 thrusts,
the phenomenon happened for the first time...

407
00:51:54,928 --> 00:51:56,725
I was somewhere else...

408
00:52:00,467 --> 00:52:02,901
If you're making a joke.,
I'll kill you...

409
00:52:03,837 --> 00:52:05,964
No, no. I was somewhere else...

410
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:11,344
Yes. But it took you a long time to come.

411
00:52:11,344 --> 00:52:13,403
You're doing better and better.

412
00:52:15,415 --> 00:52:18,350
I really was elsewhere...
several seconds.

413
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:26,621
It was an old street... narrow.

414
00:52:31,364 --> 00:52:34,527
I saw a sign that said "De la Gloria Street."

415
00:52:38,505 --> 00:52:40,735
You were in Seville., Spain?

416
00:52:41,441 --> 00:52:42,339
No.

417
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:53,207
"De la Gloria Street" is in
the Santa Cruz neighborhood of Seville.

418
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:01,390
What else did you see?

419
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:05,690
It opened onto a small plaza...

420
00:53:09,469 --> 00:53:12,370
Lady Elvira's Plaza...

421
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:22,341
Do you know what the Moors called
Granada when they founded it?

422
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:24,473
Elvira...

423
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:29,545
Human evolution hasn't ended.

424
00:53:31,524 --> 00:53:35,585
Every so often new mental abilities appear....

425
00:53:37,364 --> 00:53:39,423
as has always happened...

426
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:43,393
Are you saying I could be
the human prototype of the future?

427
00:53:45,939 --> 00:53:48,237
Traveling by orgasm...

428
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:52,305
Cheaper and more fun than traveling by airplane...

429
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:59,478
If I could just make those moments last longer...

430
00:54:03,423 --> 00:54:05,721
Perhaps, it's not a coincidence...

431
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:09,392
Maybe my mind...

432
00:54:13,233 --> 00:54:15,292
No, that's crazy.

433
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:18,498
It must have been a coincidence...

434
00:54:19,806 --> 00:54:21,296
Let's try again.

435
00:54:27,914 --> 00:54:30,439
Marlon says he needs to rest a bit.

436
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:38,290
Adoratrice says she doesn't need him to do
anything...

437
00:54:38,825 --> 00:54:42,283
She just wants to hold him close.

438
00:54:58,945 --> 00:55:01,277
Let him rest there...

439
00:55:09,689 --> 00:55:12,249
It reminds me of the joke...

440
00:55:13,293 --> 00:55:17,389
"If she likes a limp biscuit.,
then I'm the one for her."

441
00:55:39,986 --> 00:55:43,319
Adoratrice isn't completely awake either...

442
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:52,423
but when she opens the door
and sees Marlon...

443
00:55:53,633 --> 00:55:56,659
she looks at him and says;,

444
00:55:58,371 --> 00:55:59,770
Hi. Marlon.

445
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:07,274
I can tell you're down and lacking affection.

446
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:14,386
Come here so I can hug you.

447
00:56:44,784 --> 00:56:55,353
The curious, adventurous snake
penetrates deeper into the cave...

448
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:19,380
Sir Marlon and Lady Adoratrice
awake at the same time...

449
00:57:20,286 --> 00:57:24,390
If someone touched us right now,
they would be electrocuted.

450
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:29,259
I'm touching you... and I think I'm dying...

451
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:38,471
We continued trying different positions...

452
00:57:38,471 --> 00:57:40,632
"A Pair of Flying Ducks"...

453
00:57:41,641 --> 00:57:43,336
"Wild Horses Bucking"...

454
00:57:44,611 --> 00:57:46,738
"Intertwined Mandarin Ducks"...

455
00:57:48,148 --> 00:57:50,548
"Phoenix Playing in a Red Cave"...

456
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:55,719
In each case, I appeared in a different city.

457
00:57:56,689 --> 00:58:00,693
We figured out I had been in Valparaiso,

458
00:58:00,693 --> 00:58:05,687
Madrid., Medell'n., Calcutta, Paris...

459
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:16,365
I want to see Rome.

460
00:58:18,611 --> 00:58:21,273
All right. We can try...

461
00:58:23,983 --> 00:58:26,213
But don't blame me if you end up in Iraq

462
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:30,789
At that point., I no longer cared why it happened.

463
00:58:32,325 --> 00:58:38,264
Moreover, I was afraid that if someone could
explain it, it would never happen again.

464
00:58:39,332 --> 00:58:43,603
I am so in love making love to Elvira...

465
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:46,239
and I'm seeing the world...

466
00:58:46,239 --> 00:58:47,774
I don't want it to end.

467
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:50,299
I want time to stand still...

468
00:58:51,344 --> 00:58:55,337
I couldn't dissuade Elvira from consulting
her wise grandmother about it.

469
00:58:55,682 --> 00:58:59,584
Elvira was sure Celia could find
an explanation for the phenomenon.

470
00:59:00,553 --> 00:59:04,216
Why would you want to find an explanation?

471
00:59:36,389 --> 00:59:40,291
Eloy, you need to deliver this
headstone to this grave site...

472
00:59:41,861 --> 00:59:43,795
"Silence. Daddy's asleep."

473
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:46,192
Was that gem your idea?

474
00:59:46,599 --> 00:59:48,328
No. The widow's...

475
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:52,497
I wonder what my epitaph will say?

476
00:59:52,872 --> 00:59:56,843
Pity, the best fuck in the neighborhood
has kicked the bucket.

477
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,708
No. Too long...

478
00:59:59,078 --> 01:00:00,647
Do want a cup of tea., Eloy?

479
01:00:00,647 --> 01:00:01,636
No, thanks.

480
01:00:02,749 --> 01:00:03,545
I do.

481
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:12,590
"He who best conserved his cum,
alas. Has suc-cumbed..."

482
01:00:13,826 --> 01:00:17,330
Stop screwing around and deliver this headstone...

483
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:19,890
It's urgent. Get going!

484
01:00:56,536 --> 01:00:58,237
So., what are you worried about, Mom?

485
01:00:58,237 --> 01:01:00,873
It's good he's being careful...

486
01:01:00,873 --> 01:01:04,331
But his room is full of condoms...

487
01:01:04,844 --> 01:01:07,506
You probably have a son who's a sex fiend...

488
01:01:08,614 --> 01:01:11,284
Why don't you talk to him., Andrés?

489
01:01:11,284 --> 01:01:13,343
Find out what he's up to...

490
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:17,315
Do you want to know what he's up to or with
whom?

491
01:01:19,425 --> 01:01:24,364
In other words., it's as if you had
your own private sex tutor...

492
01:01:24,364 --> 01:01:25,558
Something like that...

493
01:01:26,366 --> 01:01:28,334
Is it just sex or...

494
01:01:28,334 --> 01:01:30,268
are you in love with her?

495
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:35,297
You're screwed.

496
01:01:36,509 --> 01:01:40,309
I feel sensations I've neverfelt before...

497
01:01:41,848 --> 01:01:44,578
If I told you., you wouldn't believe me.

498
01:01:44,917 --> 01:01:46,817
Like what?

499
01:01:49,922 --> 01:01:51,791
When we make love...

500
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:55,561
at a given moment I materialize in other places...

501
01:01:55,561 --> 01:01:57,461
other cities...

502
01:01:57,930 --> 01:02:02,492
I materialized in Seville,
in Valparaiso... in Montevideo...

503
01:02:03,436 --> 01:02:05,427
Only for a few seconds...

504
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:13,079
Yesterday., I began to think that maybe
the human mind is a space ship...

505
01:02:13,079 --> 01:02:16,173
that uses semen as fuel...

506
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:21,215
And people think space
ships will come from space...

507
01:02:22,855 --> 01:02:27,360
Eloy... Do you smoke marijuana beforehand?

508
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:28,995
No... We don't drink anything either.

509
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:30,895
Elvira won't even drink beer...

510
01:02:31,431 --> 01:02:32,989
Pure sex.

511
01:02:33,433 --> 01:02:37,870
When I kissed her for the first time.
I felt many strange sensations...

512
01:02:37,870 --> 01:02:40,600
as if I'd smoked a joint...

513
01:02:41,908 --> 01:02:45,366
I think all her body secretions are hallucinagenic.

514
01:02:46,979 --> 01:02:49,243
It's the only explanation...

515
01:02:50,049 --> 01:02:53,917
So., you're dating a chick
who has a hallucinagenic twat.

516
01:02:55,888 --> 01:02:58,448
You are a genious.

517
01:03:01,961 --> 01:03:04,931
To spend less and less time here,

518
01:03:04,931 --> 01:03:08,196
I have to succeed in staying longer
in those places Elvira takes me.

519
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:20,873
"Monkey Wrapped Around a Tree".

520
01:03:34,994 --> 01:03:38,122
Give me a sign when you materialize somewhere.

521
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:16,868
Venice is incredible!

522
01:04:20,172 --> 01:04:25,200
You materialize in other cities
between 80 and 100 thrusts...

523
01:04:28,881 --> 01:04:31,817
I think you dematerialize when you climax...

524
01:04:31,817 --> 01:04:35,116
Then I'll try to come a lot later.

525
01:04:51,203 --> 01:04:54,900
"Eagle Poised on a Mountaintop."

526
01:05:19,865 --> 01:05:22,231
How beautiful Barcelona is...

527
01:05:40,286 --> 01:05:42,846
I have annihilated myself

528
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:46,154
and I live for you...

529
01:05:47,994 --> 01:05:50,258
If I love myself, I love you.

530
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:53,957
If I love you, I love myself.

531
01:06:01,173 --> 01:06:04,836
One afternoon Elvira came across her old crib...

532
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:12,011
If my parents hadn't left
me asleep at Nana's that night,

533
01:07:12,011 --> 01:07:14,002
I wouldn't be here today...

534
01:07:15,047 --> 01:07:18,608
They had gone out to celebrate
my mother's birthday...

535
01:07:19,985 --> 01:07:22,749
She had just turned 28...

536
01:07:25,691 --> 01:07:26,988
my age now...

537
01:07:38,070 --> 01:07:41,005
Before dawn., they took them away...

538
01:08:02,695 --> 01:08:05,027
Elvira couldn't stop trembling.

539
01:08:05,064 --> 01:08:07,862
I held her in my arms and
her trembling spread to me.

540
01:08:09,301 --> 01:08:11,771
That afternoon. We didn't have sex.

541
01:08:11,771 --> 01:08:15,502
Though we spent a long time trembling together...

542
01:08:37,763 --> 01:08:40,789
I had not been sleepwalking for a long time.

543
01:08:40,833 --> 01:08:45,104
Nevertheless, I had the sensation
of just coming out of a dream...

544
01:08:45,104 --> 01:08:51,100
when Elvira told me her vacation was over
and she would be returning to Spain.

545
01:08:56,816 --> 01:08:58,408
Stay...

546
01:09:03,589 --> 01:09:05,614
That dangerous word...

547
01:09:13,032 --> 01:09:14,761
I'm going with you...

548
01:09:19,271 --> 01:09:20,932
Just like that...

549
01:09:28,247 --> 01:09:31,648
I'm not leaving and you're not staying...

550
01:09:35,788 --> 01:09:38,757
Our love knows no separation...

551
01:09:45,931 --> 01:09:48,900
Besides, you need to keep
practicing with other girls.

552
01:09:50,903 --> 01:09:52,838
Be careful.

553
01:09:52,838 --> 01:09:56,638
Once they sleep with you.,
they'll never want to let you go...

554
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:08,810
Look.

555
01:10:10,890 --> 01:10:15,020
When a heart goes up in flames,
it smells like incense...

556
01:10:53,966 --> 01:10:59,734
Let's say goodbye with a "Swan in Late Spring."

557
01:11:03,742 --> 01:11:06,677
How do we do that?

558
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:15,484
I get down on all fours and arch my back...

559
01:11:18,791 --> 01:11:21,589
You hold me by the waist from behind...

560
01:12:13,078 --> 01:12:17,947
Are you made of tender and spicy beef?

561
01:12:18,917 --> 01:12:22,614
Come with me. Accompany me to the taxi stand.

562
01:12:48,213 --> 01:12:50,078
Elvira went away.

563
01:12:50,916 --> 01:12:53,817
At home., important changes
were happening in my family...

564
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:03,819
The house began to smell like dirty diapers.

565
01:13:04,830 --> 01:13:07,731
How odd... death smelled like flowers.

566
01:13:08,033 --> 01:13:10,695
Life smelled like shit...

567
01:13:17,876 --> 01:13:20,606
I'm not going...

568
01:13:20,846 --> 01:13:22,609
and you're not staying...

569
01:13:26,718 --> 01:13:30,313
My greatest fear was that without Elvira...

570
01:13:31,857 --> 01:13:36,851
my life would become as routine and
colorless as the lives of so many other people...

571
01:13:38,197 --> 01:13:42,531
But then, my Dad appeared and invited me
to go have a cup of coffee.

572
01:13:44,903 --> 01:13:48,862
He brought with him some Coltrane CDs
he had found in a store in San Francisco

573
01:13:51,710 --> 01:13:55,476
and he was wearing boutique
clothing from Saint Moritz.

574
01:13:57,783 --> 01:13:59,512
What's up with the hat?

575
01:14:00,185 --> 01:14:03,055
I always wanted to wear a hat like this one...

576
01:14:03,055 --> 01:14:05,319
but I never did...

577
01:14:09,628 --> 01:14:13,724
I've actually dared to dance...

578
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:17,068
I'm no longer melancholy...

579
01:14:17,936 --> 01:14:19,801
It's about time, don't you think?

580
01:14:21,673 --> 01:14:24,877
I wasn't half as concerned about
being with my dead father...

581
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:29,280
as I was that he had become an international
shoplifter of CDs and designer clothing.

582
01:14:30,249 --> 01:14:34,276
Anyway., it wasn't so important at this point.

583
01:14:35,888 --> 01:14:39,881
The most important thing was that
my Dad took my hand and said;

584
01:14:40,759 --> 01:14:45,130
"Your whole life you'll always be saying goodbye.

585
01:14:45,130 --> 01:14:48,122
Don't let that keep you from loving."

586
01:14:54,706 --> 01:14:57,543
There is a sea not far from us.
It is invisible, but it is not hidden.

587
01:14:57,543 --> 01:15:00,546
It is forbidden to speak of it...

588
01:15:00,546 --> 01:15:02,912
Yet it is a sin and a sign of ingratitude not to.

589
01:15:05,584 --> 01:15:07,643
To my Sons and Daughter.
