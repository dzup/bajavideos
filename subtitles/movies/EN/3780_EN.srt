1
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,752
Yare, yare!

2
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,513
Take in the topsail

3
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,352
Tend to the master's whistle!

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,436
Bestir, bestir!

5
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,875
Good Boatswain, have care

6
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,838
Where's the master?
Play the men

7
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,195
l pray now, keep below

8
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,271
Where is the master, bos'n?

9
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,793
Do you not hear him!?

10
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,157
You mar our labour,
keep your cabins

11
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,799
you do assist the storm

12
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,952
Nay, good, be patient

13
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,519
When the sea is

14
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,471
Good, yet remember
whom thou hast aboard

15
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,991
None that l more love than myself

16
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,071
Silence, trouble us not!

17
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,037
Out of our way, l say!

18
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,276
Yet again? What do you here?

19
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,749
Shall we give o'er, and drown?
Have you a mind to sink?

20
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,040
A pox o' your throat, you bawling,
blasphemous, incharitable dog!

21
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,997
Work you, then

22
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,915
Hang, cur, hang! You whoreson,
insolent noisemaker

23
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,799
we are less afraid
to be drowned than thou art

24
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,556
Off to sea again!
Lay her off!

25
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,999
Hell is empty and all the devils here!

26
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,476
lf by your art, my dearest mother, you
have put the wild waters in this roar

27
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,550
allay them...

28
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,316
O, l have suffered with those that
l saw suffer

29
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,756
A brave vessel, who had, no doubt,
some noble creature in her

30
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,276
dash'd all to pieces

31
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,471
Poor souls, they perish'd!

32
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,708
Be collected
No more amazement

33
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,550
tell thy piteous heart there's no
harm done

34
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,792
- O, woe the day!
- No harm

35
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,275
l have done nothing but in care of thee,
of thee, my dear one, thee

36
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,353
my daughter, who art ignorant
of what thou art

37
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,716
nought knowing of whence l am

38
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,031
nor that l am more better than Prospera

39
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,876
master of a full poor cell
and thy no greater mother

40
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,840
More to know did never meddle
with my thoughts

41
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,717
'Tis time l should inform thee farther

42
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,079
So. Lie there, my art

43
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,875
Wipe thou thine eyes, have comfort

44
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,152
The direful spectacle of the wreck

45
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,828
which touch'd the very virtue
of compassion in thee

46
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,357
l have with such provision in mine art so
safely ordered that there is no soul

47
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,114
No, not so much perdition as an hair

48
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,357
betid to any creature in the vessel

49
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,196
which thou heard'st cry,
which thou saw'st sink

50
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,397
Sit down, and be attentive

51
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,951
Canst thou remember a time
before we came unto this cell?

52
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,998
l do not think thou canst, for then thou
wast not out three years old

53
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,593
Certainly, ma'am, l can

54
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,192
By what? By any other
house or person?

55
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,389
Of any thing the image tell me that hath
kept with thy remembrance

56
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,950
'Tis far off, and rather like a dream

57
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,715
Had l not Four or five women
once that tended me?

58
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,477
Thou hadst, and more, Miranda

59
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:03,431
Twelve year since, Miranda,
twelve year since

60
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,919
thy mother held the Dukedom
of Milan and its princely power

61
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,150
But are not you my mother?

62
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:18,512
The very same, who long ago was wife
to him who ruled Milan most liberally

63
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,672
who, with as tolerant a hand toward me

64
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,913
gave license to my long hours
in pursuit of hidden truths

65
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:32,997
of coiled powers contained within
some elements to harm, or heal

66
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,708
l brooked no interruption
but your squalling

67
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,997
for thou, child, art a princess born

68
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,116
O, Heavens!

69
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,317
What foul play had we, that we
came from thence?

70
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,475
Upon thy father's death, authority was
conferred as was his will to me alone

71
00:06:53,640 --> 00:07:00,716
thereby awaking the ambitions of my
brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio

72
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,155
- Thou attendst not...
- Good Madam, l do!

73
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:09,919
l pray thee, mark me
that a brother should be so perfidious!

74
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,678
He whom l did charge to execute
express commands

75
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,911
as to the prudent
governing of fair Milan

76
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,709
instead undid, subverted
Dost thou attend me?

77
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,833
Ma'am, most heedfully!

78
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,798
Perverting my upstanding studies

79
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,795
now his slandering and bile-dipped
brush did paint a faithless portrait

80
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,872
His sister, a practicer of the black arts!

81
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,076
A demon, not a woman, nay a witch!

82
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,755
And he full-knowing others of
my sex have burned for no less!

83
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,754
The flames now fanned, my counselors
turned against me. Dost thou hear?

84
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,638
Your tale, ma'am, would cure deafness

85
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,030
To credit his own lie he did
believe he was indeed the Duke

86
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,556
confederates wi' the King of
Naples to give him annual tribute

87
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,918
and bend my Dukedom yet unbow'd
to most ignoble stooping

88
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,229
O the heavens!

89
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,673
Now the condition

90
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,674
The King of Naples, being an enemy
to me inveterate

91
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,478
hearkens my brother's suit

92
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,474
which was, that he, should presently
eradicate me and mine

93
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,636
out of the dukedom

94
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,237
and confer fair Milan with
all its honours upon my brother

95
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,997
whereon, one midnight

96
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,118
did Antonio open the gates of Milan

97
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,876
and, i' the dead of darkness his
ministers for the purpose hurried thence

98
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,272
me and thy crying self

99
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,871
Wherefore did they not
that hour destroy us?

100
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,754
Dear, they durst not

101
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,478
so dear the love my people bore me

102
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,518
ln few, they hurried us aboard a bark
bore us some leagues to sea

103
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,036
where they prepared a rotten
carcass of a boat

104
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,716
not rigg'd, nor tackle, sail, nor mast

105
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,435
the very rats instinctively had quit it

106
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,233
there they hoist us to cry
to the sea that roar'd to us

107
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:15,793
to sigh to the winds whose pity sighing
back again, did us but loving wrong

108
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,236
Alack, what trouble was l then to you!

109
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:24,315
O, a cherubim thou wast
that did preserve me!

110
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,268
Thou didst smile
lnfused with a fortitude from heaven

111
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,795
that raised in me
an undergoing stomach

112
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,719
to bear up against what should ensue

113
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,553
- How came we ashore?
- By providence divine

114
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,876
Some food we had
and some fresh water

115
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,510
that a noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo

116
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,798
out of his charity, did give us, with rich
garments, stuffs and necessaries

117
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,918
which since have steaded much

118
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,868
Of his gentleness,
knowing l loved my books

119
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,679
he furnish'd me from mine own
library with volumes

120
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,677
that l prize above my dukedom

121
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,957
Would l might but ever see that man!

122
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,636
l pray you, ma'am

123
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,112
for still 'tis beating in my mind, your
reason for raising this sea-storm?

124
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,834
By accident most strange

125
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,518
bountiful fortune now my dear lady, hath
mine enemies brought to this shore

126
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,238
Here cease more questions

127
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:26,592
Thou art inclined to sleep
'Tis a good dulness, and give it way

128
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,718
l know thou canst not choose

129
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,151
Come away, servant, come

130
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,758
l am ready now
Approach, my Ariel, come

131
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,074
All hail, great master!
Grave dame, hail!

132
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,277
l come to answer thy best pleasure

133
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,389
be't to fly, to swim, to dive into the fire

134
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,835
to ride on the curl'd clouds

135
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,109
to thy strong bidding task Ariel
and all his quality

136
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,114
Hast thou, spirit, perform'd, to point,
the tempest that l bade thee?

137
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,870
To every article
l boarded the King's ship

138
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,113
Now on the beak, now in the
waist, the deck, in every cabin

139
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:27,479
l flamed amazement; sometime l'd
divide and burn in many places

140
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,030
the fire and cracks of sulphurous roaring
the most mighty Neptune

141
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,597
seem to besiege
and make his bold waves tremble

142
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,558
yea, his dread trident shake

143
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,358
Hi ho!

144
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,478
My brave spirit!

145
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,428
Who was so firm, so constant, that
this coil would not infect his reason?

146
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,469
Not a soul but felt a fever of the mad
and play'd some tricks of desperation

147
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,838
The king's son Ferdinand, with hair
up-staring was the first man that leap'd

148
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,835
cried; Hell is empty
and all the devils here!

149
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,312
Why that's my spirit!
But was not this nigh shore?

150
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,756
- Close by, my master
- But are they, Ariel, safe?

151
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,754
Not a hair perish'd

152
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,469
On their sustaining garments
not a blemish

153
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,279
but fresher than before

154
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,236
and, as thou badest me, in troops l have
dispersed them 'bout the isle

155
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,437
The King's son have l landed by himself

156
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,478
whom l left cooling of the air
with sighs

157
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:37,192
in an odd angle of the isle and sitting,
his arms in this sad knot

158
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,875
Of the King's ship, the mariners,
say how thou hast disposed

159
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,875
Safely in harbour is the King's ship
in the deep nook, there she's hid

160
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,192
the mariners all under hatches stow'd,
who, with a charm, l have left asleep

161
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,796
Ariel, thy charge exactly is perform'd

162
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,598
but there's more work
What is the time o' the day?

163
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,634
- Past the mid season
- At least two glasses

164
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,759
The time 'twixt six and now must by
us both be spent most preciously

165
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,194
ls there more toil?

166
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,355
Since thou dost give me pains let me
remember thee what thou hast promised

167
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,112
which is not yet perform'd me

168
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:17,236
How now? Moody?
What is't thou canst demand?

169
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,672
My liberty

170
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,195
Before the time be out? No more!

171
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,238
l prithee, remember
l have done thee worthy service

172
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,908
thou didst promise to bate me a full year

173
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,198
Dost thou forget from what
a torment l did free thee?

174
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,358
- No
- Thou dost

175
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,272
- l do not, ma'am
- Thou liest, malignant thing!

176
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,157
Hast thou forgot the foul witch Sycorax

177
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,875
hast thou forgot her?

178
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,110
- No, ma'am
- Thou hast

179
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,918
Where was she born? Speak! Tell me

180
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,513
Ma'am, in Algiers

181
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,593
O, was she so?

182
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,230
l must once in a month recount what
thou hast been, which thou forget'st

183
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,833
This damn'd witch Sycorax

184
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,476
for mischiefs manifold and sorceries
terrible to enter human hearing

185
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,393
from Algiers, thou know'st,
was banish'd ls not this true?

186
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,390
Ay, ma'am

187
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,028
This blue-eyed hag was
hither brought with child

188
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,555
and here was left by the sailors

189
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,269
Thou, my slave, as thou report'st
thyself, wast then her servant

190
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,036
And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate to
act her earthy and abhorr'd commands

191
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,317
she did confine thee into a cloven pine

192
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,110
within which rift imprison'd thou didst
painfully remain a dozen years

193
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,158
within which space she died
and left thee there

194
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,596
thou best knows what a torment
l did found thee

195
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,479
thy groans did make wolves howl

196
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,428
and penetrate the breasts
of ever angry bears

197
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,833
lt was mine art,
when l arrived and heard thee

198
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,514
that made gape the pine,
and let thee out

199
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,032
l thank thee, master

200
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,749
lf thou more murmur'st l will rend an oak

201
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:06,358
and peg thee in his knotty entrails till
thou hast howl'd away twelve winters

202
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,758
Pardon, master

203
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,911
l will be correspondent to the command

204
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,039
- and do my spiriting gently
- Do so

205
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,229
and after two days l will discharge thee

206
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,995
That's my noble master!

207
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,318
What shall l do? Say what?
What shall l do?

208
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,029
Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea

209
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,159
Be subject to no sight but thine or mine,
invisible to every eyeball else

210
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,436
Go! Hence with diligence!

211
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,117
Awake, dear heart, awake!

212
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,989
Thou hast slept well. Awake!

213
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,514
The strangeness of your story put
heaviness in me

214
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,989
Shake it off. Come on

215
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,879
We'll visit with Caliban, my slave

216
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,874
who never yields us kind answer

217
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,919
'Tis a villain, ma'am,
l do not love to look on

218
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,555
But, as 'tis, we cannot miss him

219
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,951
He does make our fire,
fetches in our wood

220
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,078
and serves in offices that profit us

221
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,312
What, ho! Slave!

222
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:55,113
Caliban! Thou earth, thou! Speak

223
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,671
- There's wood enough within!
- Come forth, l say!

224
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,752
l must eat my dinner

225
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,196
There's other business for thee.
Come, thou tortoise! When?

226
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,792
Thou poisonous slave, got by the
devil himself upon thy wicked dam

227
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,190
Come forth!

228
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,550
As wicked dew as e'er my mother

229
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:44,033
brush'd with raven's feather from
unwholesome fen drop on you both!

230
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,876
A south-west blow on ye
and blister you all o'er!

231
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,918
For this, be sure, to-night thou
shalt have cramps

232
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,674
side-stitches that shall pen
thy breath up

233
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,308
Urchins shall work all exercise on thee

234
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,835
thou shalt be pinch'd as thick as
honeycomb

235
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,788
each pinch more stinging
than bees that made 'em

236
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,915
This island is mine by Sycorax my
mother, which thou tak'st from me

237
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,755
When thou camest first, thou strok'st
me and madest much of me

238
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,675
wouldst give me water with berries in't

239
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,434
and teach me how to
name the bigger light

240
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,956
and how the less,
that burn by day and night

241
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:35,519
And then l loved thee and show'd
thee all the qualities o' th' isle

242
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:41,710
the fresh springs, brine-pits
barren place and fertile

243
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,953
Cursed be l that did so!

244
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:51,310
All the charms of Sycorax toads,
beetles, bats, light on you!

245
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:57,590
For l am all the subjects that you have,
which first was mine own king

246
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,279
and here you sty me in this hard rock

247
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,591
whiles you do keep from me
the rest o' th' island

248
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,469
Thou most lying slave, whom
stripes may move, not kindness!

249
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,156
l have used thee, with humane care,
lodged thee in mine own cell

250
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,551
till thou didst seek to violate
the honour of my child

251
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,433
Would't had been done!

252
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,752
Thou didst prevent me: l had peopled
else this isle with Calibans

253
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,512
Abhorred slave

254
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,349
which any print of goodness
wilt not take

255
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,837
l pitied thee

256
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,718
took pains to make thee speak

257
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:41,159
You taught me language, and my
profit on't is, l know how to curse

258
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,709
The red plague rid you for
learning me your language!

259
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,792
Hagseed, hence!

260
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,714
Fetch us in fuel. Shrug'st thou, malice?

261
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:54,192
lf thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly what
l command, l'll rack thee with old cramps

262
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:59,639
fill all thy bones with aches, make thee
roar that beasts shall tremble at thy din

263
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,678
No, pray thee

264
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,429
l must obey. Her art is of such power

265
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,431
So, slave: hence!

266
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:54,752
Come unto these darkened sands

267
00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:01,837
and then take hands

268
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:11,433
Curtsied when you have and kiss'd

269
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:18,199
the wild waves whist

270
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,876
foot it featly here and there

271
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,670
and, sweet sprites, the burden bear

272
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,391
Hark, hark! The watchdogs bark!

273
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:37,395
Hark, hark! The watchdogs bark!

274
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,915
Where should this music be?

275
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,390
l' th' air or th' earth?

276
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,998
lt sounds no more: and sure,
it waits upon some god o' th' island

277
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:54,478
Thence l have follow'd it,
or it hath drawn me rather

278
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,154
but 'tis gone

279
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,468
No, it begins again

280
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:16,277
Full fathom five thy father lies

281
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:23,193
of his bones are coral made

282
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:31,153
Those are pearls that were his eyes

283
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,518
nothing of him that doth fade

284
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:46,635
but doth suffer a sea change

285
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:54,880
into something rich

286
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,272
and strange

287
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,750
The ballard does remember
my drown'd father

288
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:09,835
This is no mortal business, nor no
sound that the earth owes

289
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,230
l hear it now above me

290
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,515
The fringed curtains of thine eye
advance and say...

291
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,274
say what thou seest yond

292
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,440
What is't? A spirit?

293
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:48,278
No, child: it eats and sleeps and hath
such senses as we have, such

294
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,111
This gallant which thou seest
was in the wreck

295
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:58,196
l might call him a thing divine, for
nothing natural l ever saw so noble

296
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:07,157
lt goes on, l see, as my soul prompts it

297
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,195
Oh spirit, fine spirit! l'll free
thee within two days for this

298
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,829
Most sure, the goddess on whom
these airs attend!

299
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,514
Vouchsafe my prayer may know if
you remain upon this island

300
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,639
and that you will some good instruction
give how l may bear me here

301
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,118
My prime request, which l
do last pronounce, is

302
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,190
O you wonder!

303
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,709
lf you be maid or no?

304
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,838
No wonder, sir, but certainly a maid

305
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,316
My language! Heavens!

306
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,354
l am the best of them
that speak this speech

307
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,080
were l but where 'tis spoken

308
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,800
How? The best?

309
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,077
What wert thou, if the King
of Naples heard thee?

310
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,392
A single thing, as l am now, that
wonders to hear thee speak of Naples

311
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,398
He does hear me
and that he does l weep

312
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,596
myself am Naples

313
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:09,630
who with mine eyes, never since at ebb
beheld the King my father wreck'd

314
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,234
Alack, for mercy!

315
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,551
Yes, faith, and all his lords

316
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,589
At the first sight they have
changed eyes

317
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,439
Delicate Ariel,
l'll set thee free for this

318
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,712
A word, good sir

319
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,512
l fear you have done yourself
some wrong. A word!

320
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,910
Why speaks my mother so ungently?

321
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,198
This is the second man that e'er l saw,
the first that e'er l sigh'd for

322
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,277
They are both in either's powers

323
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,236
but this swift business
l must uneasy make

324
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,756
lest too light winning make the prize light

325
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,475
One word more

326
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,995
l charge thee that thou attend me

327
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,994
Thou dost here usurp
the name thou ow'st not

328
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,311
and hast put thyself
upon this island as a spy

329
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,789
to win it from me, the sovereign on't

330
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,756
No, as l am a man

331
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,831
There's nothing ill can dwell in
such a temple

332
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,037
Follow me. Speak not you for him:
he's a traitor

333
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,760
Come! l'll manacle thy neck
and feet together

334
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,036
sea-water shalt
thou drink. Follow!

335
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,158
No. l will resist such entertainment
till mine enemy has more pow'r

336
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,359
O dear mother, make not too rash a trial
of him, for he's gentle and not fearful

337
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,512
What, l say, my foot my tutor?
Put thy sword up, traitor

338
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,759
For l can here disarm thee with this
stick and make thy weapon drop

339
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,718
- Beseech you, mother
- Hence! Hang not on my garments

340
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,075
Ma'am, have pity. l'll be his surety

341
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,233
Silence! One word more shall make
me chide thee, if not hate thee

342
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,228
Thou think'st there is no more
such shapes as he

343
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,431
having seen but him and Caliban

344
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,828
Foolish child!

345
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,833
To th' most of men this is a Caliban
and they to him are angels

346
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,028
My affections are then most humble
l have no ambition to see a goodlier man

347
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,350
Come on, obey!

348
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,993
Thy nerves are in their infancy
again and have no vigour in them

349
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,913
So they are

350
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,596
My spirits, as in a dream,
are all bound up

351
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,238
My father's loss, the weakness
which l feel

352
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,759
the wreck of all my friends, nor this
dame's threats, to whom l am subdued

353
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,798
are but light to me

354
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,948
might l but through my prison
once a day behold this maid

355
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,277
All corners else o' the earth
let liberty make use of

356
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,228
Space enough have l in such a prison

357
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,352
lt works

358
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,552
Come on

359
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,994
Thou hast done well, fine Ariel!
Hark what thou else shalt do me

360
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:04,029
Be of comfort. My mother's of a better
nature, sir, than she appears by speech

361
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,196
Thou shalt be free as mountain winds

362
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,513
then exactly do all points
of my command

363
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,272
To th' syllable

364
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,751
Come, follow. Speak not for him

365
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,554
Beseech you, sir, be merry

366
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,156
you have cause, so have we all, of joy

367
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:52,520
for our escape is much beyond our loss

368
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,471
But for the miracle,
l mean our preservation

369
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,949
few in millions can speak like us

370
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,033
Then wisely, good sir, weigh our
sorrow with our comfort

371
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,829
- Prithee, peace
- He receives comfort like cold porridge

372
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,391
Look he's winding up the watch of
his wit: by and by it will strike

373
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:15,075
- Sir
- One... Tell

374
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:19,393
When every grief is entertain'd
that's offer'd

375
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:23,235
- comes to the entertainer
- A dollar

376
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:27,359
Dolour comes to him, indeed. You have
spoken truer than you purposed

377
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,717
You have taken it wiselier
than l meant you should

378
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,359
Therefore, my lord...

379
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,988
Fie, what a spendthrift is he
of his tongue!

380
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,357
- l prithee, spare
- Well...

381
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,393
l have done

382
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:45,119
- But yet...
- He will be talking!

383
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,832
Though this island seem to be desert

384
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,389
- Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible
- Yet...

385
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,199
- Yet
- He could not miss't

386
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,397
The air breathes upon us here
most sweetly

387
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,278
As if it had lungs, and rotten ones

388
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,317
Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen

389
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,789
Here is everything advantageous to life

390
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,393
True: save means to live

391
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,198
Of that there's none, or little

392
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:13,195
How lush and lusty the grass
looks! How green!

393
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,715
The ground indeed is tawny

394
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,238
With an eye of green in't

395
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:25,231
But the rarity of it is, which is
indeed almost beyond credit

396
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,358
that our garments, being,
as they were, drenched in the sea

397
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,751
are now as fresh as when
we put them on first in Afric

398
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,635
ln Tunis

399
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:40,157
At the marriage of your fair daughter
Claribel to the King of Tunis

400
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,313
You cram these words into mine ears
against the stomach of my sense

401
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,474
Would l had never married my daughter
there! For, coming thence, my son is lost

402
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,834
and, in my rate, she too

403
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,754
who is so far from ltaly removed
l ne'er again shall see her

404
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,114
O thou mine heir of Naples and of Milan

405
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,273
what strange fish hath made
his meal on thee

406
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,919
Sir, he may live

407
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,113
l saw him beat the surges under him,
and ride upon their backs

408
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,273
- l not doubt he came alive to land
- No, no, he's gone

409
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,750
Sir, you may thank yourself
for this great loss

410
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,911
that would not bless our Europe
with your daughter

411
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,911
but rather lose her to an African

412
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,069
Prithee, peace

413
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,954
We have lost your son, l fear, for ever
The fault's your own

414
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,032
So is the dear'st o' the loss

415
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:32,196
My lord Sebastian, the truth you
speak doth lack some gentlenes

416
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,114
You rub the sore, when you should
bring the plaster

417
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,875
- Very well
- And most like a surgeon

418
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:43,595
lt is foul weather in us all, good
sir, when you are cloudy

419
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,950
Foul weather?

420
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,318
Very foul

421
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,472
Prospera! Prospera!

422
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:16,429
All the infections that the sun
sucks up from bogs, fens, flats

423
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,479
on Prospera fall and make her by
inchmeal a disease!

424
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,032
Her spirits hear me

425
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,911
And yet l needs must curse

426
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,755
But for every trifle are they set upon me

427
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,270
sometime like apes

428
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,113
that mow

429
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:52,670
and chatter at me and after bite me

430
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:57,994
then like hedgehogs which lie
tumbling in my barefoot way

431
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:03,393
and mount their pricks at my footfall

432
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:07,030
Sometime... am l all wound...

433
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:13,435
with adders who with cloven tongues
do hiss me into madness!

434
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,678
Lo! Here comes a spirit of hers

435
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,718
and to torment me for bringing
wood in slowly

436
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:56,952
l'll fall flat. Perchance he will
not mind me

437
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:13,675
Here's neither bush nor shrub,
to bear off any weather at all

438
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,718
and another storm brewing

439
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,552
l hear it sing i' the wind

440
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:24,472
Yond same black cloud, yond huge one

441
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:30,033
looks like a foul bombard that
would shed his liquor

442
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,668
lf it should thunder as it did before

443
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,910
l know not where to hide my head

444
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,398
Yond same cloud cannot choose
but fall by pailfuls

445
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,151
What have we here?

446
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,278
A man or a fish?

447
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,396
Dead or alive?

448
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,588
A fish! He smells like a fish

449
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,753
a very ancient fishlike smell

450
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,996
A strange fish!

451
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:16,514
Were l in England now, as once l was

452
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,240
and had but this fish painted

453
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,154
not a holiday fool there
but would give a piece of silver

454
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:27,911
There would this monster make a man

455
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,752
any strange beast there makes a man

456
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,150
When they will not give a penny
to relieve a lame beggar

457
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,871
they will lay out ten to see
a dead lndian

458
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,710
Legged...

459
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,190
like a man...

460
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:51,388
and his fins like arms!

461
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:56,156
Warm o' my troth!

462
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:01,348
l do now let loose my opinion,
hold it no longer

463
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,516
This is no fish

464
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,879
but an islander, that hath lately
suffered by a thunderbolt

465
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,073
Alas, the storm is come again!

466
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:19,916
My best way is to creep
under his gaberdine

467
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,152
there is no other shelter hereabouts

468
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:31,514
Misery acquaints a man with
strange bedfellows

469
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,278
Do not torment me! O!

470
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:49,073
The master, the swabber,
the boatswain and l

471
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,800
the gunner and his mate

472
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:58,389
loved Mall, Meg and Marian
and Margery

473
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,233
but none of us cared for Kate

474
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,391
for she had a tongue with a tang

475
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,518
would cry to a sailor, Go hang!

476
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,832
She loved not the savour
of tar nor of pitch

477
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,912
yet...

478
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:18,833
yet a tailor might scratch her

479
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,639
where'er she did itch

480
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:27,278
then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!

481
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,992
Then to sea, boys, and let her

482
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,795
This is a very scurvy tune to sing
at a mans funeral

483
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,075
Well, here's my comfort

484
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,477
What's the matter?

485
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,910
Have we devils here?

486
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:03,119
Do you put tricks upon's with
savages and men of lnde, ha?

487
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:09,592
l have not scaped drowning to be
afeard now of your four legs

488
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,478
The spirit torments me. O!

489
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,471
This is some monster of the isle
with four legs

490
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,279
who hath got, as l take it, an ague

491
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,079
Where the devil should he learn
our language?

492
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,315
l will give him some relief
if it be but for that

493
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,148
lf l can recover him, and keep him
tame and get to Naples with him

494
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,833
he's a present for any emperor

495
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:35,639
Do not torment me, prithee
l'll bring my wood home faster

496
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,110
He's in his fit now and does not
talk after the wisest

497
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,354
He shall taste of my bottle
Come on your ways

498
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:50,079
Open your mouth. This will shake your
shaking l can tell you, and that soundly

499
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,830
You cannot tell who's your friend
Open your chaps again

500
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,994
l should know that voice! lt should be...
but he is drowned: and these are devils

501
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,275
O, defend me

502
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,757
Four legs and two voices a most
delicate monster!

503
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,273
Come

504
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:14,274
Amen! l will pour some
in thy other mouth

505
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,238
Stephano!

506
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,038
Doth thy other mouth call me?

507
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,630
Mercy, mercy! This is a devil,
and no monster l will leave him

508
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,475
Stephano! lf thou beest Stephano,
touch me and speak to me

509
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:31,191
be not afeard, for l am Trinculo,
thy good friend Trinculo

510
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,272
lf thou beest Trinculo, come forth

511
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,034
l'll pull thee by the lesser legs

512
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,672
lf any be Trinculo's legs, these are they

513
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,190
Thou art very Trinculo indeed!

514
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,228
How camest thou to be the siege of this
mooncalf? Can he vent Trinculos?

515
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,278
l took him to be killed with
a thunder-stroke

516
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,670
But art thou not drowned, Stephano?

517
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:00,158
l hid me under the dead moon-calfs
gaberdine for fear of the storm

518
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,198
And art thou living, Stephano?

519
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:07,273
O Stephano, two Neapolitans 'scaped!

520
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:13,519
Prithee, do not turn me about
my stomach is not constant

521
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,356
These be fine things,
an if they be not sprites

522
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:21,832
That's a brave god and bears
celestial liquor

523
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,558
l will kneel to him

524
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,951
How didst thou 'scape?
How camest thou hither?

525
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,951
Swear by this bottle
how thou cam'st hither

526
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:33,120
l escaped upon a butt of sack
which the sailors heaved o'erboard

527
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:37,910
l'll swear upon that bottle
to be thy true subject

528
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,548
for the liquor is not earthly

529
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,154
Here! Swear by this bottle
how thou escapedst

530
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,995
Swum ashore, man, like a duck
l can swim like a duck, l'll be sworn

531
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,833
Here, kiss the book

532
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,596
Though thou canst swim like a
duck, thou art made like a goose

533
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,469
O Stephano. Hast thou any
more of this?

534
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,314
The whole butt, man

535
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:04,879
How now, mooncalf!

536
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,271
How does thine ague?

537
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,872
Hast thou not dropp'd from heaven?

538
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:16,229
Out o' th' moon, l do assure thee

539
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,517
l was the Man i' the Moon
when time was

540
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,349
l have seen thee in her

541
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,954
and l do adore thee

542
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,680
Come, swear to that

543
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,269
Kiss the book. Swear

544
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:37,953
By this good light, this is a very
shallow monster!

545
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,669
l afeard of him? A very weak monster!

546
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:46,709
The Man i' the Moon! A most poor
credulous monster!

547
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:53,156
l'll show thee every fertile inch
o' th' island

548
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,958
And l will kiss thy foot

549
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,632
l prithee, be my god

550
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,789
Come on then
Down, and swear!

551
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:11,036
l shall laugh myself to death
at this puppy-headed monster

552
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,555
A most scurvy monster!

553
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,870
l could find in my heart to beat him

554
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:21,835
- But that the poor monster's in drink
- Come, kiss

555
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:34,309
l'll show thee the best springs

556
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,032
l'll pluck thee berries

557
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:43,075
l'll fish for thee
and get thee wood enough

558
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:47,154
A plague upon the tyrant that l serve!
l'll bear her no more sticks

559
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:50,437
but follow thee thou wondrous man

560
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:55,754
A most ridiculous monster
to make a wonder of a poor drunkard!

561
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,878
l prithee, let me bring thee
where crabs grow

562
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:03,792
and l with my long nails will dig
thee pignuts

563
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,996
show thee a jay's nest

564
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,709
and instruct thee how to snare
the nimble marmoset

565
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,598
l'll bring thee to clust'ring filberts

566
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,117
and sometimes l'll get thee young
scamels from the rock

567
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,269
Wilt thou go with me?

568
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:23,075
l prithee now, lead the way without
any more talking, Trinculo

569
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,279
The King and all our company else
being drowned, we will inherit here

570
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,910
Farewell master: farewell, farewell!

571
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,992
A howling monster!
A drunken monster!

572
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,628
No more dams l'll make for fish

573
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,837
nor fetch in firing at requiring

574
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,629
nor scrape trencher, nor wash dish

575
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,554
'Ban, 'Ban
Ca- Ca- Ca- Ca- Caliban

576
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,598
has a new master

577
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,398
Get a new man!

578
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,678
Freedom, high day!
High day, freedom!

579
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,509
Freedom, high day,
high day freedom!

580
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,275
O brave monster! Lead the way

581
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:40,911
This my mean task
would be as heavy to me as odious

582
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:44,629
but the mistress which l serve
quickens what's dead

583
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,429
and makes my labours... pleasures

584
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,909
She is ten times more gentle than
her mother's crabbed

585
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:59,198
and she's composed of harshness!

586
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,477
l must remove some thousands
of these logs

587
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,235
and pile them up,
upon a sore injunction

588
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,192
My sweet mistress weeps
when she sees me work

589
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:16,310
and says, such baseness
had never like executor

590
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:23,995
l forget: but these sweet thoughts
do even refresh my labours

591
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,594
most busiest, when l do work

592
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:47,269
Alas, now, pray you, work not so hard!

593
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,115
l would the lightning had burnt up those
logs that you are enjoin'd to pile!

594
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,589
Pray, set it down and rest you

595
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,596
When this burns, 'twill weep
for having wearied you

596
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,830
My mother is hard at study

597
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,116
pray now, rest yourself
she's safe for these three hours

598
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,952
O most dear mistress, the sun will set

599
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,997
before l shall discharge
what l must strive to do

600
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,037
lf you'll sit down, l'll bear your
logs the while

601
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,279
Pray, give me that: l'll carry it to the pile

602
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,035
No, precious creature, l had rather
crack my sinews, break my back

603
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,794
than you should such dishonour
undergo, while l sit lazy by

604
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,393
lt would become me as well
as it does you

605
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,198
and l should do it with much more ease

606
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:25,753
for my good will is to it,
and yours it is against

607
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,960
You look wearily

608
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,678
No, noble mistress 'tis fresh morning
with me when you are by at night

609
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:43,039
l do beseech you, what is your name?

610
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:47,159
Miranda. O my mother,
l have broke your hest to say so!

611
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,676
Admired Miranda!

612
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:54,391
lndeed the top of admiration!
Worth what's dearest to the world!

613
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:59,759
Poor worm, thou art infected!
This visitation shows it

614
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:03,278
Full many a lady l have eyed
with best regard

615
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,795
and many a time the harmony of their
tongues hath into bondage brought

616
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:06,836
my too diligent ear

617
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:10,598
For several virtues have l liked
several women

618
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:14,309
never any with so full soul

619
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,756
but some defect in her did quarrel
with the noblest grace she owed

620
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,354
and put it to the foil

621
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,231
But you...

622
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:29,154
O you, so perfect and so peerless

623
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,072
are created of every creature's best!

624
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:37,358
l know only one more of my sex
no young woman's face remember

625
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,557
save from my glass, mine own
nor have l seen

626
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,951
more that l may call men than you,
good friend

627
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:48,272
how features are abroad, l am
skilless of: but, by my modesty

628
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,154
l would not wish any companion
in the world but you

629
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:57,834
nor can imagination form a shape,
besides yourself, to like of

630
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,318
But l prattle something too wildly
and my mother's precepts

631
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,708
l therein do forget

632
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:06,917
l am in my condition a prince,
Miranda

633
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,671
l do think, a king l would, not so

634
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,797
Hear my soul speak!

635
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,869
The very instant that l saw you,
did my heart fly to your service

636
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:22,039
there resides, to make me slave to it

637
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,150
and for your sake am l this
patient log-man

638
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,675
Do you love me?

639
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:36,991
O heaven, O earth,
bear witness to this sound

640
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,632
l beyond all limit of what else i' th' world

641
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:49,591
Do love, prize, honour you

642
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,433
l am a fool

643
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,840
To weep at what l am glad of

644
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,118
Wherefore weep you?

645
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,114
At mine unworthiness
which dare not offer

646
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:08,520
what l desire to give and much less
take what l shall die to want

647
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,193
But this is trifling

648
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:14,877
and all the more it seeks to hide itself,
the bigger bulk it shows

649
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:20,239
Hence, bashful cunning, and prompt me,
plain and holy innocence!

650
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:26,313
l am your wife, if you will marry me

651
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,516
lf not, l'll die your maid

652
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:29,829
To be your fellow you may deny me

653
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,837
but l'll be your servant whether
you will or no

654
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:36,070
My mistress, dearest
And l thus humble ever

655
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,276
My husband, then?

656
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:43,514
Ay, with a heart as willing as
bondage e'er of freedom

657
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:48,109
- Here's my hand
- And mine

658
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:51,829
with my heart in't

659
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,119
and now farewell

660
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,909
Till half an hour hence

661
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:08,755
A thousand thousand!

662
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,278
Had l plantation of this isle,
my lord and were the king on't

663
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,350
what would l do?

664
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,557
'Scape being drunk for want of wine

665
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:45,311
No occupation: all men idle,
all and women too

666
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,471
but innocent and pure: no sovereignty

667
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,198
Yet he would be king on't

668
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:52,557
The latter end of his common
wealth forgets the beginning

669
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,909
Nature...

670
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:58,596
Nature, without sweat or endeavour
would bring forth, of its own kind

671
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,872
all foison, all abundance
to feed my innocent people

672
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:06,716
- No marrying 'mong his subjects?
- None, man, all idle

673
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:07,949
whores and knaves

674
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:12,318
l would with such perfection govern,
sir, t'excel the Golden Age

675
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,717
- God save his majesty!
- Long live Gonzalo!

676
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:18,235
And, do you mark me, sir?

677
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,597
Prithee, no more
Thou dost talk nothing to me

678
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,079
l do well believe your Majesty

679
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,834
and did it to minister occasion
to these gentlemen

680
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,912
who are of such sensible
and nimble lungs

681
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,479
that they always use
to laugh at nothing

682
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,039
'Twas you we laughed at

683
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:35,954
Who in this kind of merry fooling am
nothing to you so you may continue

684
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,314
and laugh at nothing still

685
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:40,358
What a blow was there given!

686
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,556
Nay, good my lord, be not angry

687
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:48,909
No, l warrant you: l will not
adventure my discretion so weakly

688
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,797
Will you laugh me asleep?

689
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:02,151
l am very heavy

690
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,633
Go sleep, and hear us

691
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:09,236
What, so soon asleep?

692
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:13,916
l wish mine eyes would, with
themselves, shut up my thoughts

693
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:17,789
l find they are inclined to do so

694
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,071
Do not omit the heavy offer of it

695
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:25,199
lt seldom visits sorrow
when it doth, it is a comforter

696
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,476
We two, my lord, will guard your person

697
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,949
while you take your rest
and watch your safety

698
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:34,750
Thank you! Wondrous heavy

699
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:43,033
What a strange drowsiness
possesses them!

700
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,589
lt is the quality o' th' climate

701
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,796
Why doth it not then our eyelids sink?

702
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:53,912
- l find not myself disposed to sleep
- Nor l my spirits are nimble

703
00:52:54,160 --> 00:53:00,679
They fell together, as by consent
They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke

704
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:06,676
What might, worthy Sebastian
O, what might?

705
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,919
No more!

706
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,872
And yet methinks l see it in thy
face, what thou shouldst be

707
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,794
Th' occasion speaks thee

708
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,471
and my strong imagination sees
a crown dropping upon thy head

709
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,232
What? Art thou waking?

710
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,038
Do you not hear me speak?

711
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:29,309
l do, and surely it is a sleepy language
and thou speak'st out of thy sleep

712
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,069
What is it thou didst say?

713
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:39,110
This is a strange repose,
to be asleep with eyes wide open

714
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,113
standing, speaking, moving

715
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,793
and yet so fast asleep

716
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:49,990
Noble Sebastian, thou let'st
thy fortune sleep, die, rather

717
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,594
wink'st whiles thou art waking

718
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:56,230
Thou dost snore distinctly

719
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,433
there's meaning in thy snores

720
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,875
l am more serious than my custom

721
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:06,556
You must be so too, if heed me
which to do trebles thee o'er

722
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,952
Well, l am standing water

723
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,588
l'll teach you how to flow

724
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,753
Do so. To ebb hereditary
sloth instructs me

725
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,069
Thus, sir

726
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,478
Although this lord hath here almost
persuaded the king his son's alive

727
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:27,633
'tis as impossible that he's undrown'd
as he that sleeps here swims

728
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:28,949
l have no hope that he's undrown'd

729
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:31,839
O, out of that no hope what great
hope have you!

730
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:35,477
No hope that way is another way
so high a hope

731
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:40,112
that even ambition cannot pierce a wink
beyond but doubt discovery there

732
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:43,272
Will you grant with me
that Ferdinand is drown'd?

733
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,873
- He's gone
- Then, tell me

734
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,395
Who's the next heir of Naples?

735
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,956
- Claribel
- She that is Queen of Tunis

736
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,759
she that dwells ten leagues
beyond man's life

737
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,959
she that from whom we all were
sea-swallow'd though some cast again

738
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:02,557
and, by that destiny, to perform an act
whereof what's past is prologue

739
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:06,110
what to come in yours
and my discharge

740
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,032
What stuff is this? How say you?

741
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:12,318
Say, this were death that now
hath seized them

742
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,232
why, they were no worse
than now they are

743
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,518
There be that can rule Naples as
well as he that sleeps

744
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,678
O, that you bore the mind that l do!

745
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,991
What a sleep were this for your
advancement! Do you understand me?

746
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:25,990
Methinks l do

747
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:30,551
And how does your content tender
your own good fortune?

748
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,714
l remember you did supplant
your sister Prospera

749
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:38,316
True. And look how well my
garments sit upon me

750
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,350
My sister's servants
were then my fellows

751
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,078
now they are my men

752
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,833
- But, for your conscience
- Ay, sir: where lies that?

753
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,594
Twenty consciences, that stand
'twixt me and Milan

754
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:56,036
candied be they and melt,
ere they molest!

755
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:00,239
Here lies your brother, no better
than the earth he lies upon

756
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,834
lf he were that which now
he's like, that's dead

757
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:08,199
Whom l, with this obedient steel three
inches of it can lay to bed forever

758
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:11,830
whiles you, doing thus,
to this ancient morsel

759
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,709
this Sir prudence
who should not upbraid our course

760
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:18,110
Thy case, dear friend,
shall be my precedent

761
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:20,874
As thou got'st Milan,
l'll come by Naples

762
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:24,919
Draw thy sword. One stroke shall free
thee from the tribute which thou payest

763
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:29,756
and l the King shall love thee

764
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:38,118
Draw together, and when l rear my
hand, do you the like

765
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:41,477
to fall it on Gonzalo

766
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:55,833
While you here do snoring lie

767
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,878
open-eyed conspiracy

768
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:03,188
his time doth take

769
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:07,069
lf of life you keep a care

770
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:11,313
shake off slumber and beware

771
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,550
Awake! awake!

772
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,069
Good angels preserve the King

773
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,036
Why?

774
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,153
Why are you drawn?

775
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:22,594
Wherefore this ghastly looking?

776
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:23,556
What's the matter?

777
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:26,871
Whiles we stood here securing
your repose even now

778
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,952
we heard a hollow burst
of bellowing like bulls

779
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,599
or rather lions

780
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,479
Did't not wake you?
lt struck mine ear most terribly

781
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:37,393
- l heard nothing
- O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear

782
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:38,675
to make an earthquake!

783
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:39,829
Heard you this, Gonzalo?

784
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:43,556
Upon mine honour, sir, l heard a
humming, which did awake me

785
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:46,712
As mine eyes open'd,
l saw their weapons drawn

786
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:49,999
'Tis best we stand upon our guard,
or that we quit this place

787
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,952
Let's draw our weapons

788
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:54,957
Lead off this ground

789
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:58,271
and let's make further search
for my poor son

790
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,674
Lead away

791
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:15,038
Now Prospera shall
know what l have done

792
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,351
So, King, go safely on to seek thy son

793
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:25,230
You're blind drunk!

794
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:30,030
Tell not me! When the butt is out, we will
drink water: not a drop before

795
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:34,398
Therefore bear up, and board 'em
Servant-monster, drink to me

796
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:38,231
Servant monster?
The folly of this island!

797
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,631
They say there's but five upon
this isle; we are three of them

798
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:44,553
lf th' other two be brained like
us, the state totters

799
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:51,075
Mooncalf, speak once in thy life,
if thou beest a good mooncalf

800
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,878
How does thy honour?

801
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:57,715
Let me lick thy shoe
l'll not serve him

802
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:58,995
he's not valiant

803
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:03,392
Thou liest, most ignorant monster

804
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:06,950
Why, thou deboshed fish thou

805
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:12,592
Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie, being but
half a fish and half a monster?

806
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:15,354
Lo, how he mocks me!

807
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,397
Wilt thou let him, my lord?

808
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:21,758
Lord quoth he! That a monster
should be such a natural!

809
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:25,151
Lo, lo, again! bite him
to death, l prithee

810
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,595
Trinculo, keep a good
tongue in your head

811
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,879
lf you prove a mutineer... the next tree!

812
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:36,518
The poor monster's my subject
and he shall not suffer indignity

813
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:39,478
l thank my noble lord

814
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:46,040
Wilt thou be pleased to hearken once
again to the suit l made to thee?

815
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,953
Marry, will l. Kneel and repeat it

816
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:53,477
l will stand, and so shall Trinculo

817
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:01,192
As l told thee before

818
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:06,275
l am subject to a tyrant, a sorceress

819
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:09,989
that by her cunning hath cheated
me of the island

820
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:11,510
Thou liest

821
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:16,679
Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou

822
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,073
l do not lie

823
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:22,073
Trinculo, if you trouble him any
more in's tale by this hand

824
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,912
l will supplant some of your teeth

825
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:25,559
Why, l said nothing

826
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:28,678
Mum, then, and no more

827
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:30,432
Proceed

828
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:36,394
l say, by sorcery she got this isle

829
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,628
from me she got it

830
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,034
lf thy greatness will revenge it on her

831
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:49,910
thou shalt be lord of it
and l'll serve thee

832
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:53,750
How now shall this be compassed?
Canst thou bring me to the party?

833
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,958
Yea, yea, my lord!

834
01:00:56,120 --> 01:01:01,797
l'll yield her thee asleep, where thou
mayst knock a nail into her head

835
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:05,034
Thou liest: thou canst not

836
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:09,233
What a pied ninny's this!
Thou scurvy patch!

837
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:13,029
l do beseech thy greatness, give him
blows and take his bottle from him

838
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:18,354
Why, what did l? l did nothing
l'll go farther off

839
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:20,158
Didst thou not just say he lied?

840
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:21,639
Thou liest

841
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:26,555
Do l so? Take thou that. As you like
this, give me the lie another time

842
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,632
Why? l did not give the lie

843
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:32,268
Out o' your wits and bearing too?
A pox o' your bottle!

844
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:33,839
And the devil take your fingers!

845
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:38,510
Now...

846
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:43,114
forward with your tale

847
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:46,352
- Prithee
- Stand farther off

848
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:52,077
Come, proceed

849
01:01:54,080 --> 01:02:00,792
Why, as l told thee, 'tis a custom with
her, l' th'late afternoon to sleep

850
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,474
there thou mayst brain her

851
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:08,760
having first seized her books
or with a log batter her skull

852
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:12,674
or paunch her with a stake
or cut her wezand with thy knife

853
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:18,279
But remember first
to possess her books

854
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:21,910
for without them she's but a sot,
as l am

855
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:26,119
nor hath not one spirit to command

856
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:31,479
they all do hate her as rootedly as l

857
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:35,110
Burn but her books

858
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:40,793
And that most deeply to consider

859
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:44,714
is the beauty of her daughter

860
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:49,476
Of women l've seen but these
and Sycorax my dam

861
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:53,872
But she as far surpasseth Sycorax

862
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:56,076
as great'st does least

863
01:02:57,160 --> 01:03:00,835
ls it so brave a lass?

864
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,633
Ay, lord

865
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:09,031
she will become thy bed, l warrant

866
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:13,830
And bring thee forth brave brood

867
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:18,472
Monster, l will kill this witch

868
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,391
her daughter and l will be King
and Queen

869
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:28,872
and Trinculo and thyself shall be
viceroys

870
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,915
Dost thou like the plot, Trinculo?

871
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:33,593
Excellent

872
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,159
Give me thy hand

873
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,756
l am sorry l beat thee

874
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:45,112
Within this half hour will she be asleep

875
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:46,759
Wilt thou destroy her then?

876
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:49,388
Ay, on mine honour

877
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:52,559
This will l tell my master

878
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:57,638
Thou makest me merry
l am full of pleasure

879
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,119
Come on, Trinculo, let us sing

880
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:02,475
Flout 'em and scout 'em
and scout 'em and flout 'em

881
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:06,235
Thought is free! Grog 'em then flog 'em
and flog 'em and grog 'em

882
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,628
Thought is free

883
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,756
Nab 'em and stab 'em,
stab 'em and nab 'em

884
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,035
Thought is free

885
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,111
Bag 'em and hang 'em,
hang 'em and bag 'em

886
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,599
Thought is free

887
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:18,833
Play 'em and flay 'em, flay 'em
and play 'em. Thought is free

888
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,800
What is this same?

889
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:29,836
lf thou beest a man, show thyself

890
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,709
O, forgive me my sins!

891
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:34,790
Mercy upon us!

892
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,436
Art thou afeard?

893
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:39,953
No, monster, not l

894
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:45,350
Be not afeard: the isle is full of noises

895
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:50,958
sounds and sweet airs, that give
delight and hurt not

896
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:58,072
Sometimes a thousand twangling
instruments will hum about mine ears

897
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:04,715
and sometime voices that, if l
then had waked after long sleep

898
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:07,758
will make me sleep again

899
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:13,670
and then, in dreaming,
the clouds methought would open

900
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:18,152
and show riches ready to drop
upon me that, when l waked

901
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:24,558
l cried to dream again

902
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:30,316
This will prove a brave kingdom to me,
where l shall have my music for nothing

903
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:35,356
When Prospera is destroyed

904
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:55,358
By'r Lakin

905
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:59,477
l can go no further, sir
l needs must rest me

906
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:04,270
Old lord, l cannot blame thee, who
am myself attach'd with weariness

907
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,749
Sit down, and rest

908
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:09,798
He is drown'd whom thus
we stray to find

909
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:13,555
and the sea mocks our frustrate
search on land

910
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:17,517
Well, let him go

911
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,989
l am right glad
that he's so out of hope

912
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,390
The next advantage will we take
thoroughly

913
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,073
Let it be tonight

914
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:32,678
What harmony is this?
My good friends, hark!

915
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:37,518
Marvellous sweet music!

916
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:42,590
Give us kind keepers, heavens!

917
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,151
A living drollery

918
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:55,232
Now l will believe
that there are unicorns

919
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:00,795
lf in Naples, l should report this
now, would they believe me?

920
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,876
We have stomachs

921
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:11,997
Will't please you taste of what is here?

922
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:16,273
Faith, sir, you need not fear

923
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:20,513
l will stand to and feed
although my last, no matter

924
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,432
since l feel the best is past

925
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:46,271
You are three men of sin!

926
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:51,191
Whom destiny hath caused
to belch up you

927
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,676
and on this island where man doth
not inhabit

928
01:07:56,120 --> 01:08:00,511
you 'mongst men being
most unfit to live

929
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:04,558
l have made you mad

930
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:12,793
You fools! l and my fellows
are ministers of fate

931
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:14,518
the elements

932
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,232
of whom your swords are temper'd may
as well wound the loud winds

933
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:24,428
as diminish one dowle
that's in my plume

934
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:29,196
But remember

935
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:34,157
for that's my business to you

936
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:38,598
that you three from Milan did
supplant good Prospera

937
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:42,233
her and her innocent child

938
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:46,916
for which foul deed the powers,
delaying, not forgetting

939
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:51,198
have incensed the seas and shores

940
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:56,514
yea, all the creatures,
against your peace

941
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:02,319
Thee of thy son, Alonso,
they have bereft

942
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:06,473
and do pronounce
by me lingering perdition

943
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:12,237
shall step by step attend you
and your ways

944
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:24,077
Bravely the figure of this harpy
hast thou perform'd, my Ariel

945
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:27,272
My high charms work

946
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:30,876
and these mine enemies are all
knit up in their distractions

947
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:34,157
they now are in my pow'r

948
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:39,795
l' the name of something holy, sir

949
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:42,998
why stand you in this strange stare?

950
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:46,357
O, it is monstrous, monstrous!

951
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:49,353
Methought the billows spoke
and told me of it

952
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,670
the winds did sing it to me

953
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:53,475
and the thunder

954
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:57,309
that deep and dreadful organ pipe
pronounced the name of Prospera

955
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:59,198
it did bass my trespass

956
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:02,712
Therefore my son i' th' ooze is bedded

957
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:06,351
and l'll seek him deeper than e'er
plummet sounded

958
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,111
and with him there lie mudded

959
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:12,075
But one fiend at a time,
l'll fight their legions o'er

960
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:13,799
l'll be thy second

961
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,520
All three of them are desperate

962
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:21,629
their great guilt, like poison
given to work a great time after

963
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:24,549
now 'gins to bite the spirits

964
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:28,395
l shall follow them swiftly
and hinder them

965
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:32,917
from what this ecstasy may
now provoke them to

966
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:51,909
lf l have too austerely punish'd you,
your compensation makes amends

967
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:55,550
for l have given you here a third
of mine own life

968
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:00,431
or that for which l live

969
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:04,836
all thy vexations were but
my trials of thy love

970
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,673
and thou hast strangely stood the test

971
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:12,158
O Ferdinand, do not smile at me
that l boast of her

972
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:18,111
for thou shalt find she will outstrip all
praise and make it halt behind her

973
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,869
l do believe it against an oracle

974
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:26,637
Then, as my gift and thine own
acquisition worthily purchased

975
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:32,029
take my daughter

976
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:52,157
But lf thou dost break her virgin-knot
before all sanctimonious ceremonies

977
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:56,711
no sweet aspersion shall the heavens
let fall to make this contract grow

978
01:11:56,920 --> 01:12:00,469
As l hope for quiet days,
fair issue and long life

979
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:04,555
the strongest temptation shall
never melt mine honour into lust

980
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:08,593
Fairly spoke

981
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:12,398
Sit then and talk with her

982
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,956
she is thine own

983
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:28,189
Monster, your fairy
which you say is a harmless fairy

984
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:30,271
has done little better than played
the Jack with us

985
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:35,719
Monster, l do smell all horse-piss, at
which my nose is in great indignation

986
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:37,393
So is mine. Do you hear, monster?

987
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:41,113
Good my lord, give me thy favour still

988
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,999
Ay, but to lose our bottles
in the pool

989
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:46,276
There is not only disgrace
and dishonour in that, monster

990
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:48,317
but an infinite loss

991
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:54,197
That's more to me than my wetting. Yet
all this is your harmless fairy, monster

992
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:02,991
What, Ariel!

993
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:06,398
My industrious servant

994
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:10,238
- Ariel!
-What would my potent master?

995
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:11,955
Here l am

996
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:16,079
Go bring the rabble, o'er whom l give
thee pow'r, here to this place

997
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:17,468
lncite them to quick motion

998
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,152
for l must bestow upon the eyes
of this young couple

999
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:27,154
some vanity of mine art; it is my promise
and they expect it from me

1000
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:29,311
- Presently?
- Ay, with a twink

1001
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:31,755
Before you can say ''Come' and Go''!

1002
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:33,399
Do you love me, master?

1003
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:35,874
No?

1004
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:39,476
Dearly my delicate Ariel

1005
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:53,111
O mistress mine, where are you
roaming ?

1006
01:13:54,800 --> 01:14:03,356
Oh stay and hear!
Your true love's coming

1007
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:10,478
that can sing both high and low

1008
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:18,991
trip no further, pretty sweeting,
journey's end in lover's meeting

1009
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:25,918
every wise man's son doth know

1010
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:30,119
What is love? Tis not hereafter

1011
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:34,717
present mirth hath present laughter

1012
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:41,399
what's to come is still unsure

1013
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:45,553
in delay there lies no plenty

1014
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:49,793
then come kiss me,
sweet-and-twenty

1015
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:53,236
youth's a stuff...

1016
01:14:53,400 --> 01:15:03,878
... will not endure, will not endure

1017
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:09,916
Look thou be true

1018
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:11,838
Do not give dalliance too much the rein

1019
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,197
the strongest oaths are straw
to the fire i' th' blood

1020
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:16,236
l warrant you madam

1021
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:20,951
The white cold virgin snow upon my
heart abates the ardour of my liver

1022
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:22,959
Well...

1023
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:32,519
No tongue! All eyes! Be silent

1024
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,838
l had forgot that foul conspiracy
of the beast Caliban

1025
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:38,793
and his confederates
against my life

1026
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:43,915
Avoid! No more! No more!

1027
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:53,270
This is strange. Your mother's in some
passion that works her strongly

1028
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:58,036
Never till this day saw l her
touch'd with anger so distemper'd

1029
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:03,358
You do look, my son, in a moved sort,
as if you were dismay'd be cheerful, sir

1030
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:06,875
Our revels now are ended

1031
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:12,355
These our actors, as l foretold you,
were all spirits

1032
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:17,514
and are melted into air
into thin air

1033
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:23,355
and, like the baseless fabric
of this vision

1034
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:29,277
the cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous
palaces, the solemn temples

1035
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:36,116
the great globe itself, yea, all which
it inherit shall dissolve

1036
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:41,991
and, like this insubstantial
pageant faded

1037
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:46,034
leave not a rack behind

1038
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:51,431
We are such stuff
as dreams are made on

1039
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:55,752
and our little life is rounded with a sleep

1040
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:03,792
Sir, l am vex'd

1041
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:07,591
lf you be pleased, retire into my cell
and there repose

1042
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:11,230
a turn or two l'll walk, to still
my beating mind

1043
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,994
We wish your peace

1044
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:21,198
Come with a thought!

1045
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:24,359
l thank thee, Ariel. Come

1046
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:26,874
What's thy pleasure?

1047
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:30,715
Spirit. We must prepare
to meet with Caliban

1048
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:31,915
Ay, my commander

1049
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:34,753
Say again, where didst thou leave
these varlets?

1050
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:38,276
l told you, ma'am, they were
red-hot with drinking

1051
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:40,908
l left them l' the filthy-mantled
pool beyond your cell

1052
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:45,870
There dancing up to the chins,
that the foul lake outstunk their feet

1053
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:48,558
This was well done, my bird

1054
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:56,071
The trumpery in my house, go put it
out, for stale to catch these thieves

1055
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:58,674
l go, l go

1056
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:05,231
A devil, a born devil

1057
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:08,119
on whose nature nurture
can never stick

1058
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:15,197
on whom my pains, humanely taken
all, all lost, quite lost!

1059
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:20,796
l will plague them all, even to roaring

1060
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:29,832
Pray you, tread softly
We now are near her cell

1061
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:40,034
O no

1062
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:44,955
Prithee, be quiet. Seest thou here?
This is the mouth o' the cell

1063
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:51,236
Give me thy hand. l do begin to
have bloody thoughts

1064
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:09,029
O King Stephano! O worthy Stephano!

1065
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:11,634
Look what a wardrobe here is for thee!

1066
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:14,633
Let it alone, thou fool!
lt is but trash

1067
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:18,634
O, ho, monster! We know what
belongs to a frippery

1068
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:21,593
O king Stephano!

1069
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,149
Put off that gown, Trinculo!
By this hand, l'll have that gown

1070
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,959
Thy Grace shall have it

1071
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:37,957
l look a dream, don't l

1072
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:40,076
How can it be real

1073
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:44,870
Look at the business, Gov'ner

1074
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:52,674
What do you mean to dote
thus on such luggage?

1075
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:54,671
Let's alone and do the murder first

1076
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:57,195
Be you quiet, monster

1077
01:20:57,360 --> 01:21:01,273
Mistress line, is not this my jerkin?

1078
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:06,559
Do, do! We steal by line and level

1079
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:08,676
and't like your Grace

1080
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:12,757
l thank thee for that jest
Here's a garment for't

1081
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:17,198
Wit shall not go unrewarded
while l am king of this country

1082
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:20,950
Monster, come, put some lime upon
your fingers, and away with the rest

1083
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:25,193
l will have none on't. We shall lose our
time, and all be turned to barnacles

1084
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:31,390
Monster, lay-on your fingers,
or l'll turn thee from my kingdom

1085
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:34,870
- Go to, carry this
- And this

1086
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:36,951
Ay, and this

1087
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:42,197
Hey, Mountain, hey!

1088
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:43,910
Silver!

1089
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:54,837
Fury, Fury!
There, tyrant, there!

1090
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:02,753
Hark!

1091
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:03,636
They roar!

1092
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:20,117
Let them be hunted soundly

1093
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:28,509
At this hour lie at my mercy
all mine enemies

1094
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:33,548
Now does my project gather to a head

1095
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:38,036
Shortly shall all my labours end

1096
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:42,557
and thou shalt have the air at freedom

1097
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:56,155
Say, my spirit, how fares the King
and 's followers?

1098
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:58,072
Just as you left them

1099
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:00,390
All prisoners, ma'am

1100
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:05,429
The King, his brother and yours,
abide all three distracted

1101
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:13,476
but chiefly him that you term'd, ma'am
'The good old lord Gonzalo'...

1102
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:19,317
His tears run down his beard, like
winter's drops from eaves of reeds

1103
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:23,948
Your charm so strongly works 'em

1104
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:28,070
that if you now beheld them

1105
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:32,274
your affections would become tender

1106
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:37,069
Dost thou think so, spirit?

1107
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:40,030
Mine would, master

1108
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:43,235
were l human

1109
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:49,749
And mine shall

1110
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:53,349
Hast thou, which art but air

1111
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:57,991
a touch, a feeling of their afflictions
and shall not myself

1112
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:03,154
one of their kind be kindlier
moved than thou art?

1113
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:09,874
Though with their high wrongs
l am struck to th' quick

1114
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:17,832
yet with my nobler reason
'gainst my fury do l take part

1115
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:21,232
The rarer action is in virtue
than in vengeance

1116
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:24,392
They being penitent

1117
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:29,634
the sole drift of my purpose doth
extend not a frown further

1118
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:33,031
Go, release them, Ariel

1119
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,912
My charms l'll break

1120
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:42,638
their senses l'll restore, and
they shall be themselves

1121
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:45,757
l'll fetch them, ma'am

1122
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:59,511
Ye elves of hills, brooks,
standing lakes and groves

1123
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:03,670
and ye that on the sands
with printless foot

1124
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:08,231
do chase the ebbing Neptune and do
fly him when he comes back

1125
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:14,319
you demi-puppets that by moonshine
do the green sour ringlets make

1126
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:17,438
whereof the ewe not bites

1127
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,913
and you whose pastime is to make
midnight mushrooms

1128
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:25,709
that rejoice to hear the solemn curfew

1129
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:30,472
by whose aid
weak masters though ye be

1130
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:49,949
l have bedimm'd the noontide sun

1131
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:53,909
call'd forth the mutinous winds

1132
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:58,671
and 'twixt the green sea
and the azured vault, set roaring war

1133
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:01,832
to the dread rattling thunder
have l given fire

1134
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,595
and rifted Jove's stout oak
with his own bolt

1135
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:09,230
the strong-based promontory
have l made shake

1136
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:13,279
and by the spurs pluck'd up
the pine and cedar

1137
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:17,274
graves at my command have
waked their sleepers oped

1138
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:19,749
and let 'em forth

1139
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:23,754
by my so potent art

1140
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:36,079
But this rough magic l here abjure

1141
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:42,595
and, when l have required some
heavenly music which even now l do

1142
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:47,470
to work mine end upon their senses
that this airy charm is for

1143
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:52,795
l'll break my staff

1144
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:57,516
bury it certain fathoms in the earth

1145
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:03,079
and deeper than did
ever plummet sound

1146
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:08,279
l'll drown my book

1147
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:57,953
There stand, for you are spell-stopp'd

1148
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:04,591
O good Gonzalo, my true preserver

1149
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:07,479
and a loyal sir to him you follow'st

1150
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:11,713
l will pay thy graces home
both in word and deed

1151
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:17,196
Most cruelly didst thou, Alonso,
use me and my daughter

1152
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:21,315
Thy brother was a furtherer in the act

1153
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:24,836
Thou art pinched for't now, Sebastian

1154
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:32,669
Flesh and blood, you, brother mine

1155
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:37,072
that entertain'd ambition, expell'd
remorse and nature

1156
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:40,392
who, with Sebastian, would
here have killed your king

1157
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:46,118
l do forgive thee, unnatural
though thou art

1158
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:51,192
Their understanding begins to swell

1159
01:28:57,720 --> 01:28:58,516
Ariel

1160
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:03,631
fetch me the skirt and bodice from my
cell l will discase me, and myself present

1161
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:07,110
as l was sometime Milan

1162
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:11,194
Quickly, spirit! Thou shalt ere
long be free

1163
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:29,072
O l shall miss thee Ariel

1164
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:33,478
but yet thou shalt have freedom

1165
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:37,759
so...

1166
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:40,113
so...

1167
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:42,913
so...

1168
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:47,953
Behold the wronged Duchess
of Milan, Prospera

1169
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:51,157
l bid a hearty welcome

1170
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:01,394
Whe'r thou be'st she or no, or some
enchanted trifle to abuse me l not know

1171
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:06,835
thy pulse beats as of flesh and blood

1172
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:11,911
and, since l saw thee,
th' affliction of my mind amends

1173
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:14,719
with which, l fear, a madness held me

1174
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:19,956
This must crave and if this be at all
a most strange story

1175
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:25,749
Thy dukedom l resign and do entreat
thou pardon me my wrongs

1176
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:30,152
But how should Prospera
be living and be here?

1177
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:37,828
First, noble friend

1178
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,558
let me embrace thine age

1179
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:43,829
whose honour cannot
be measured or confined

1180
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:48,994
Whether this be or be not, l'll not swear

1181
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:51,431
Welcome, my friends all

1182
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:54,431
But you, my brace of lords

1183
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:01,279
were l so minded l could here
pluck his Highness' frown upon you

1184
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:03,954
and justify you traitors

1185
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:08,309
at this time l will tell no tales

1186
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:11,948
- The devil speaks in her
- No

1187
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:19,719
For you, most wicked sir

1188
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:24,559
whom to call brother would even
infect my mouth

1189
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:31,477
l do forgive thy rankest fault, all of them

1190
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:37,793
and require my dukedom of thee, which
perforce, l know thou must restore

1191
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:42,159
lf thou beest Prospera, give us
particulars of thy preservation

1192
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:43,834
How thou hast met us here

1193
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,515
who three hours since were
wracked upon this shore

1194
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:51,355
where l have lost my dear son
Ferdinand

1195
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,558
l am woe for't, sir

1196
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,672
for l have lost my daughter

1197
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:58,278
A daughter?

1198
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:00,512
When did you lose your daughter?

1199
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:02,477
ln this last tempest

1200
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:06,109
But, howsoe'er you have been
justled from your senses

1201
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:09,590
know for certain that l am Prospera

1202
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:18,352
Welcome, sir

1203
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:21,913
This cell's my court

1204
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,319
l pray you, look in

1205
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,479
Sweet lord, you play me false

1206
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:31,676
No, my dear'st love,
l would not for the world

1207
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:34,638
Yes, for a score of kingdoms
you should wrangle

1208
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:37,030
and l would call it, fair play

1209
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:40,909
lf this prove a vision of the island,
one dear son shall l twice lose

1210
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:43,799
Though the seas threaten,
they are merciful

1211
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:46,077
l have cursed them without cause

1212
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:49,471
Now all the blessings of a glad
father compass thee about!

1213
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:52,791
Arise, and say how thou camest here

1214
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:57,239
O, wonder!

1215
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:03,279
How many goodly creatures are there
here! How beauteous mankind is!

1216
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:07,433
O brave new world, that has
such people in't!

1217
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,433
'Tis new to thee

1218
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,072
What is this maid with whom
thou wast at play?

1219
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:15,596
ls she the goddess that hath sever'd us
and brought us thus together?

1220
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:20,117
Sir, she is mortal: but by
immortal providence she's mine

1221
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:22,789
l chose her when l could not ask
my father for his advice

1222
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:25,316
nor thought l had one

1223
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:27,917
Give me your hands

1224
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:31,959
Be it so! Amen!

1225
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:35,075
Was't well done?

1226
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:39,873
Bravely, my diligence

1227
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:44,829
Set Caliban and his confederates free

1228
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,319
Untie the spell

1229
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:01,516
Every man shift for all the rest

1230
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:07,516
Coragio, bully-monster, coragio!

1231
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:24,718
lf these be true spies which l wear
in my head, then here's a goodly sight

1232
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:28,475
O Setebos, these be brave
spirits indeed!

1233
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:31,354
How fine my master is!

1234
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:33,831
l am afraid she will chastise me

1235
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:39,271
What things are these, my lord
Antonio? Will money buy 'em?

1236
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:43,638
Very like. One of them is a plain
fish, and no doubt marketable

1237
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:48,749
These three have robb'd me, and
had plotted together to take my life

1238
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:52,872
Two of these fellows
you must know and own

1239
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:59,191
This thing of darkness
l acknowledge mine

1240
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:02,828
l shall be pinched to death

1241
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:05,913
ls not this Stephano,
my drunken butler?

1242
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:09,629
And Trinculo is reeling ripe.
How camest thou in this pickle?

1243
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:13,191
l have been in such a pickle
since l saw you last

1244
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:16,830
that l fear me, it will never
out my bones

1245
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,228
Why, how now, Stephano!

1246
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:22,194
Touch me not! l am not Stephano,
but a cramp

1247
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:24,478
You'd be king o' the isle, sirrah?

1248
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:26,039
l should have been a sore one then

1249
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:28,270
This is a strange thing as e'er l look'd on

1250
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:32,430
What a thrice-double ass was l

1251
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:36,878
to take this drunkard for a god
and worship this dull fool!

1252
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:38,952
Go to! Away!

1253
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:42,834
Hence, and bestow your luggage
where you found it

1254
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,150
Or stole it, rather

1255
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:49,389
Sir, l invite your Highness and
your train to my poor cell

1256
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:52,313
where you shall take your rest
for this one night, and in the morn

1257
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:54,869
l'll bring you to your ship
and so to Naples

1258
01:35:55,040 --> 01:36:00,034
where l have hope to see the nuptial
of these our dear-beloved solemnized

1259
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:06,672
and thence retire me to my Milan

1260
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:13,231
where every third thought
shall be my grave

1261
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:19,798
My Ariel

1262
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:22,151
Chick

1263
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:28,233
That is thy charge
Then to the elements be free

1264
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:36,154
Where the bee sucks there suck l

1265
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:38,754
in a cowslip's bell l lie

1266
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:42,708
there l couch when owl's do cry

1267
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:44,791
on a bat's back l do fly

1268
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:52,799
after summer, after summer merrily,
merrily, merrily... shall l live now

1269
01:37:52,960 --> 01:38:01,117
under the blossom that hangs
on the bough

1270
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:13,269
Now my charms are all o'erthrown

1271
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:24,752
And what strength l have's mine own

1272
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:33,435
Which is most faint

1273
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:48,997
O, release me from by bands

1274
01:39:49,160 --> 01:39:56,316
With the help of your good hands

1275
01:39:56,480 --> 01:40:00,268
Gentle breath

1276
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:09,876
gentle breath of yours my sails must fill

1277
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:16,592
Or else my project fails

1278
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:22,836
Which was to please

1279
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:42,797
Now, l want...

1280
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:47,829
Spirits to enforce

1281
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:54,629
Art to enchant

1282
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:59,192
And my ending is despair

1283
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:08,758
unless lbe relieved by prayer

1284
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:15,476
Which pierces so that it assaults

1285
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:21,192
pierces so that it assaults

1286
01:41:21,640 --> 01:41:30,389
Mercy itself and frees all faults

1287
01:41:34,120 --> 01:41:43,597
As you from crimes would pardonned be

1288
01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:52,749
Let your indulgence...

1289
01:41:54,480 --> 01:42:02,637
Let your indulgence...

1290
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:11,356
... set me free

1291
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:16,912
Now l want

1292
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:22,593
Spirits to enforce

1293
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:28,836
art to enchant

1294
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:33,392
And my ending is despair

1295
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:43,550
Unless l be relieved by prayer

1296
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:19,791
Now l want

1297
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:24,590
Spirits to enforce

1298
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:31,032
art to enchant

1299
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:35,999
and my ending is despair

1300
01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:45,519
Unless l be relieved by prayer

1301
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:52,351
Which pierces so that it assaults

1302
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:58,078
pierces so that it assaults

1303
01:43:58,640 --> 01:44:06,354
Mercy itself and frees all faults

1304
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:16,433
As you from crimes

1305
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:20,832
would pardon'd be

1306
01:44:22,360 --> 01:44:29,755
Let your indulgence
