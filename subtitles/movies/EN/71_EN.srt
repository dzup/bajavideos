1
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,680
What are you reading?

2
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,279
- Nothing. I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

3
00:02:05,379 --> 00:02:06,779
- Will that be all?
- Yes.

4
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:18,176
This machine drives me crazy.
I'll register it later.

5
00:02:18,276 --> 00:02:23,875
- 1.25 plus 3.75...
- 5.

6
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,074
Yes, five, of course.
Don't you have a smaller bill?

7
00:02:28,174 --> 00:02:30,972
- Not enough change.
- I'll make it.

8
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:43,369
What an idiot! I do have it.
The change from the taxi.

9
00:02:43,869 --> 00:02:47,168
The taxi-driver's change.
I took it all from him.

10
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:51,967
10, 20, 30, 40, 50.
I'm sure you need the change.

11
00:02:52,967 --> 00:02:56,666
If you have a 100 bill, I'll give
you 50, and 50, 100, in change.

12
00:02:58,466 --> 00:02:59,666
Yes.

13
00:03:11,361 --> 00:03:13,361
- Bye, thanks.
- Bye.

14
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:28,258
- Bye.
- Bye.

15
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:01,449
- Hi.
- Hi.

16
00:04:10,147 --> 00:04:12,647
We'll put it over there.

17
00:04:16,446 --> 00:04:18,045
- He did that to me.
- What?

18
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:22,545
You know, the change.
Be careful, Betina.

19
00:04:22,645 --> 00:04:24,844
He's pulling a trick
to take money from you.

20
00:04:24,944 --> 00:04:27,344
- What the fuck's going on?
- He pulled a trick on me!

21
00:04:27,444 --> 00:04:32,642
- He took money from me!
- Son of a bitch! Call the police!

22
00:04:33,142 --> 00:04:35,340
- That won't be necessary. Don't call.
- Who the hell are you?

23
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,939
You thought I'd forget, right?

24
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:45,438
You think I'm a prick,
just like all the assholes you swindle?

25
00:04:45,538 --> 00:04:46,937
Is that it? You fucking thief!

26
00:04:50,037 --> 00:04:52,536
- Freeze, motherfucker! Don't resist.
- I won't resist.

27
00:04:56,536 --> 00:04:58,035
Stop it, goddamit, look...!

28
00:04:58,135 --> 00:05:00,135
Who the fuck do you think
you are talking to?

29
00:05:00,835 --> 00:05:03,634
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

30
00:05:06,831 --> 00:05:09,731
Is this the money you took from her?
Is this it?

31
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,529
You'll get a call from the precinct.

32
00:05:16,564 --> 00:05:19,329
To file your report
and to return this to you.

33
00:05:23,328 --> 00:05:25,428
Don't move from here.

34
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,420
Do you smoke?

35
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,719
- Smoke these?
- No.

36
00:05:56,219 --> 00:05:58,319
A pity. I no longer smoke.

37
00:06:08,017 --> 00:06:09,516
Crunchy...

38
00:06:11,116 --> 00:06:13,316
made in Greece.

39
00:06:15,015 --> 00:06:17,115
This country is going to hell.

40
00:06:19,914 --> 00:06:21,214
Do you want?

41
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:23,913
I'm such an asshole!

42
00:06:25,713 --> 00:06:27,913
What an asshole!

43
00:06:45,007 --> 00:06:46,207
It's not that bad.

44
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,406
I should know when someone's
pulling a trick on me.

45
00:06:50,606 --> 00:06:52,905
Depends on who's doing it.

46
00:06:54,305 --> 00:06:57,504
- It was the gun that convinced me.
- The gun?

47
00:07:00,304 --> 00:07:01,704
The only thing handy.

48
00:07:05,503 --> 00:07:08,202
Are you mad, kid?

49
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,999
"He pulled a trick on me! "

50
00:07:20,998 --> 00:07:22,697
Why did you help me out?

51
00:07:23,797 --> 00:07:26,696
It was a pity you'd get canned
for 45 lousy bucks.

52
00:07:28,696 --> 00:07:31,695
- How d'you know it's 45?
- I did that trick a million times.

53
00:07:32,295 --> 00:07:34,695
And I know you can't
do it twice at the same store.

54
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,694
You get in, you do it
and you get out... that's it.

55
00:07:38,094 --> 00:07:40,394
Unless you want
to get beaten and canned...

56
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:42,591
not necessarily in that order.

57
00:07:43,591 --> 00:07:45,591
- You are a swindler.
- A dentist.

58
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:50,690
- The professional felt pity for the asshole.
- Beginner.

59
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,688
I hope one day
I'm as good as you, teacher.

60
00:07:55,788 --> 00:07:58,188
Thanks anyway. Goodbye.

61
00:07:59,388 --> 00:08:00,787
Hold it!

62
00:08:04,287 --> 00:08:05,986
What do you want?

63
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:09,386
That's a strange way
of saying thanks.

64
00:08:09,486 --> 00:08:11,385
I said thanks.
What else do you want?

65
00:08:11,485 --> 00:08:12,885
Not me, what do you want?

66
00:08:12,985 --> 00:08:15,484
- What do I want?
- Survive, I guess.

67
00:08:17,184 --> 00:08:21,883
- I can teach you a couple of tricks.
- Why?

68
00:08:22,183 --> 00:08:25,682
Because otherwise...
you're headed for trouble.

69
00:08:25,782 --> 00:08:29,382
- Thanks a lot, but I'm doing fine.
- Yeah, I can see that.

70
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:32,681
I'm not the smartest
but I'm street-wise...

71
00:08:32,716 --> 00:08:35,380
and I know that nobody gives
you anything for free...

72
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,880
especially someone like you.

73
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,880
- What d'you want?
- I already told you.

74
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,879
Try telling me the truth.

75
00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:50,775
I work with another guy,
a partner, Turco.

76
00:08:52,975 --> 00:08:56,574
He disappeared a week ago, completely.

77
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:01,873
The thing is, I need a partner.

78
00:09:03,173 --> 00:09:05,172
I don't know how
to work on my own, I can't.

79
00:09:05,872 --> 00:09:08,371
I saw you at the gas station
and I thought...

80
00:09:10,371 --> 00:09:11,971
perhaps...

81
00:09:13,568 --> 00:09:15,368
Why me?

82
00:09:16,668 --> 00:09:18,367
Why not?

83
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:25,966
No, look... I work alone,
and besides, I don't know you.

84
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,965
I'm Marcos... and you are...?

85
00:09:30,765 --> 00:09:32,265
Juan.

86
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:34,464
Juan. But you've
always wanted to be called...

87
00:09:37,263 --> 00:09:38,763
Sebastian.

88
00:09:38,863 --> 00:09:41,463
Guys called Juan
always want another name.

89
00:09:41,563 --> 00:09:42,862
Let's do business, Sebastian?

90
00:09:42,962 --> 00:09:45,160
- Juan.
- Juan.

91
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,159
Just for today, one day only.
Then you can decide.

92
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,458
- No, thanks.
- It's up to you to do it.

93
00:09:55,493 --> 00:09:58,357
If you want to keep on
playing in the little leagues.

94
00:10:02,456 --> 00:10:05,056
Here, kid.
Don't lose your money.

95
00:10:09,455 --> 00:10:11,954
Hey... Marcos...

96
00:10:15,254 --> 00:10:16,253
Just for today.

97
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:19,553
- Who is it?
- Auntie?

98
00:10:19,588 --> 00:10:21,052
- Who is it?
- Auntie?

99
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,352
- No, who is it?
- I'm sorry.

100
00:10:23,952 --> 00:10:25,352
- Who is it?
- Auntie?

101
00:10:25,452 --> 00:10:26,751
- No. What auntie?
- Excuse me.

102
00:10:28,851 --> 00:10:30,450
- Hello?
- Auntie?

103
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,150
- No, wrong floor.
- Excuse me.

104
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,649
- Who is it?
- Auntie?

105
00:10:36,749 --> 00:10:38,249
Who is it?

106
00:10:46,247 --> 00:10:47,645
Wait, wait...

107
00:10:48,845 --> 00:10:50,344
Hang on.

108
00:11:00,842 --> 00:11:02,742
- Do you have kids?
- No.

109
00:11:02,777 --> 00:11:05,541
- And that?
- It's for me.

110
00:11:05,576 --> 00:11:08,741
I had one like it when I was a kid.
A bit larger than this one.

111
00:11:08,841 --> 00:11:10,940
It belonged to my father.

112
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,340
When there was
a game on TV...

113
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,739
it was one of the few
days Dad stayed at home.

114
00:11:15,774 --> 00:11:20,236
I'd set my wooden racetrack
and play with the car.

115
00:11:20,336 --> 00:11:23,236
Mum would listen
to her favorite record by Rita Pavone.

116
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:26,135
- Rita Pavone?
- Yes.

117
00:11:26,235 --> 00:11:29,534
A real fan. She wouldn't
acknowledge she was outdated.

118
00:11:30,634 --> 00:11:33,134
When we were together
at home we listened...

119
00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:36,933
to Rita Pavone. "II Ballo
del Mattone." Know the song?

120
00:11:37,033 --> 00:11:38,332
- Who is it?
- Auntie?

121
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:40,532
- No, wrong floor.
- Excuse me.

122
00:11:40,732 --> 00:11:43,531
It was very popular.
They used the song for a movie...

123
00:11:43,566 --> 00:11:46,331
Mom told me.
It went...

124
00:11:52,727 --> 00:11:54,727
- Who is it?
- I see.

125
00:11:54,762 --> 00:11:57,826
- Auntie?
- Yes. Who is it?

126
00:11:58,126 --> 00:12:00,526
You can't recognize
your favorite nephew?

127
00:12:00,626 --> 00:12:03,325
- Fabin, is that you?
- Yes, Auntie, it's Fabin.

128
00:12:03,425 --> 00:12:06,425
It's been a long time, dear.
What a miracle!

129
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:10,824
You got a cold? I can't hear you well.
I hardly recognize you.

130
00:12:11,124 --> 00:12:12,523
You came to visit me?

131
00:12:12,623 --> 00:12:15,523
No, you'll be mad at me.
I'm with a friend...

132
00:12:15,623 --> 00:12:20,622
We came to visit someone
near here and my car broke down.

133
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:21,821
The car?

134
00:12:21,921 --> 00:12:23,921
- Yes.
- You bought a car?

135
00:12:24,021 --> 00:12:26,720
You didn't know?
You gotta see it. You'll love it.

136
00:12:26,755 --> 00:12:30,520
- Guess what color it is.
- What color? Don't tell me.

137
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,519
Turquoise.

138
00:12:32,554 --> 00:12:36,318
No, I wanted turquoise
but I got a blue one.

139
00:12:36,418 --> 00:12:40,118
The thing is, they're about
to tow it to the garage...

140
00:12:40,153 --> 00:12:43,417
...and after checking my wallet
I realized I got no money.

141
00:12:43,517 --> 00:12:45,417
It was then I noticed
I was close to your place...

142
00:12:45,517 --> 00:12:49,016
How could you?
You have to check before going out.

143
00:12:49,116 --> 00:12:51,113
Don't give me a hard time.

144
00:12:51,213 --> 00:12:55,912
Could you lend me some money?
Say 50, 60 pesos.

145
00:12:56,012 --> 00:12:58,912
I'll go to the garage,
get the cash and bring it back to you.

146
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:02,911
You needn't do it so fast.
But we could have a coffee.

147
00:13:03,011 --> 00:13:06,110
I promise, auntie.
We'll have a coffee together.

148
00:13:06,145 --> 00:13:08,810
Look, I don't want
to leave the car alone.

149
00:13:08,845 --> 00:13:11,109
My friend's staying here,
give him the money.

150
00:13:11,144 --> 00:13:13,009
Don't worry.

151
00:13:13,109 --> 00:13:15,308
I'm coming down.
Your friend can be trusted?

152
00:13:32,003 --> 00:13:33,803
She gave me a hundred.

153
00:13:35,502 --> 00:13:38,302
- Nice old lady.
- She sends her love to your mother.

154
00:13:39,501 --> 00:13:42,501
I'd have to go to the cemetery,
too much trouble.

155
00:13:42,536 --> 00:13:44,900
And she gave me this
to give back to her.

156
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,899
- Why didn't you keep it?
- I'm not a crook.

157
00:13:52,197 --> 00:13:53,896
- What is it?
- Nothing.

158
00:13:54,496 --> 00:13:56,696
- You want the ring?
- No, it's not that.

159
00:13:56,796 --> 00:13:58,995
- What is it?
- The old lady...

160
00:13:59,895 --> 00:14:02,395
Let me get this straight:
gas station clerks, it's okay...

161
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,694
trusting old ladies, never.

162
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,794
It's not that. She told me
I looked like her grandson.

163
00:14:07,894 --> 00:14:11,893
Give her back the money
and set up a grocery store.

164
00:14:11,993 --> 00:14:13,792
What's wrong with you?

165
00:14:13,892 --> 00:14:16,692
How can you work the streets
with such a conscience?

166
00:14:16,727 --> 00:14:20,591
- That's my problem.
- No, that's our problem. For today.

167
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,289
Hang on. Since we are here...

168
00:14:35,588 --> 00:14:37,887
Go in, order a coffee...

169
00:14:40,287 --> 00:14:42,986
pay with this, and get out.

170
00:14:43,086 --> 00:14:44,786
You don't know me.

171
00:15:25,773 --> 00:15:27,973
I need money.

172
00:15:28,673 --> 00:15:30,572
That's original.

173
00:15:30,672 --> 00:15:32,772
No, I need money, now...

174
00:15:33,772 --> 00:15:36,471
Lots of it.
That's why I'm on the streets.

175
00:15:36,571 --> 00:15:38,571
You feel ambitious today?

176
00:15:39,971 --> 00:15:42,170
No, it's my father.
I'm gathering money for him.

177
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,370
- How much?
- A lot.

178
00:15:44,405 --> 00:15:46,169
Come on, how much?

179
00:15:47,869 --> 00:15:49,668
Seventy grand.

180
00:15:49,703 --> 00:15:51,668
Holy shit!
What is it with your father?

181
00:15:53,468 --> 00:15:56,665
- He's in trouble.
- And you solve your dad's problems?

182
00:15:58,465 --> 00:16:03,264
Yes, we get along fine.
He taught me the tricks for working.

183
00:16:03,364 --> 00:16:05,263
When I was a kid, as a game.

184
00:16:05,863 --> 00:16:08,763
- "Mosqueta", "Toco Mocho"...
- The basics...

185
00:16:10,462 --> 00:16:12,962
Then something happened,
I don't know what.

186
00:16:13,462 --> 00:16:16,561
He regretted having taught me.
He said it was wrong.

187
00:16:18,361 --> 00:16:21,660
He told me not to screw up
my life like he had screwed his.

188
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,159
He told me to do
something else. Anything.

189
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:28,259
I did as he said.
I did something.

190
00:16:28,358 --> 00:16:31,258
- And it didn't work.
- Everything I did was a failure.

191
00:16:33,857 --> 00:16:36,457
What did you say when asked
what you wanted to be?

192
00:16:36,557 --> 00:16:39,456
- Left wing.
- I wanted to be an accomplice.

193
00:16:42,955 --> 00:16:44,755
I heard it a lot at home...

194
00:16:45,355 --> 00:16:48,054
and what can you do
for a living with such a vocation?

195
00:16:48,154 --> 00:16:49,054
Minister?

196
00:16:49,154 --> 00:16:53,053
Now that my Dad needs
the money the only way...

197
00:16:53,653 --> 00:16:56,153
to get it is to use
the tricks he taught me.

198
00:16:56,753 --> 00:17:00,550
I try hard to remember each phrase,
and each flick of the hands.

199
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,649
I sold my apartment to start...

200
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:05,849
an import business that
didn't even get off the ground.

201
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:10,648
Well, the 70 grand is still there,
like the carrot...

202
00:17:10,748 --> 00:17:14,147
I'm an asshole, the 50 grand
I scraped are good for nothing.

203
00:17:21,645 --> 00:17:23,345
You were saying?

204
00:17:30,442 --> 00:17:33,441
- My change, please. I've got to go.
- What change, Sir?

205
00:17:33,476 --> 00:17:35,841
The change for the $100
I gave you ten minutes ago.

206
00:17:35,941 --> 00:17:39,340
- No, you gave me nothing.
- Come on, I'm in a hurry.

207
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,439
- You didn't pay me.
- Are you serving too many tables?

208
00:17:43,739 --> 00:17:45,039
Shall I help you? Manager!

209
00:17:45,139 --> 00:17:49,338
- You didn't pay. Don't shout.
- Don't tell me what to do.

210
00:17:49,373 --> 00:17:50,338
- Manager!
- What is it?

211
00:17:50,373 --> 00:17:52,237
This gentleman says
he paid me but it's not true.

212
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:55,436
- Are you calling me a liar?
- No, sir. There must be a confusion.

213
00:17:55,536 --> 00:17:58,236
No. I had a coffee and paid
with a $100 bill.

214
00:17:58,336 --> 00:18:00,234
I had two,
now I've got one.

215
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,433
Check.
Maybe you got confused.

216
00:18:02,468 --> 00:18:05,832
Don't insist with the confusion bit.
There's no confusion. Look.

217
00:18:05,932 --> 00:18:10,031
I had two bills, now I have one.
Look, that's it.

218
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:12,931
The tip is cut off.
The bill I paid with is missing the tip.

219
00:18:13,031 --> 00:18:16,030
Check in your register box
if there's a bill with a missing tip.

220
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,930
Cut it, I'm in a hurry.

221
00:18:17,965 --> 00:18:19,530
- Come.
- I'm not going anywhere.

222
00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:23,729
Go get my change.
I'm not going anywhere. Are you nuts?

223
00:18:25,628 --> 00:18:27,028
What is it?

224
00:18:29,927 --> 00:18:32,227
Your cut. Like it?

225
00:18:32,427 --> 00:18:34,226
- I knew this trick.
- You do it?

226
00:18:34,326 --> 00:18:35,626
- No.
- Why?

227
00:18:35,726 --> 00:18:37,726
Too many people around.
You have to make a scandal.

228
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:41,225
- It's not my style.
- But that's the point, pal.

229
00:18:41,525 --> 00:18:44,824
They are not prepared to get
into a scandal. What's the key?

230
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:47,024
The more offended you are,
the less suspicious you look.

231
00:18:47,124 --> 00:18:49,623
If things get tough,
you accuse the rest of them.

232
00:18:49,658 --> 00:18:50,923
Not my style.

233
00:18:51,023 --> 00:18:53,822
- What part?
- The exposure, I don't like it.

234
00:18:54,022 --> 00:18:56,222
The risk of something going wrong.

235
00:18:56,322 --> 00:18:59,221
- Lf the going gets rough, I can't do it.
- You chose the wrong job.

236
00:19:00,121 --> 00:19:01,719
I didn't choose.

237
00:19:09,017 --> 00:19:12,317
D'you have some small change?
I have to make a call.

238
00:19:17,216 --> 00:19:19,715
It's private... you know...

239
00:19:29,813 --> 00:19:31,013
Arrange it. Bye.

240
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:37,109
Who were you talking to?

241
00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:42,508
With my lawyer.
I still have some outstanding business.

242
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:52,606
- Who was it?
- A friend.

243
00:19:55,006 --> 00:19:56,805
Okay, what's next?

244
00:19:57,605 --> 00:19:59,305
I don't know.

245
00:19:59,805 --> 00:20:04,202
In fact I've been thinking...
I don't know if it's worth it.

246
00:20:04,502 --> 00:20:08,901
All this... perhaps it's best
that you go on with your stuff.

247
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,800
Turco must be coming
back soon and...

248
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,400
if he finds out I've replaced him,
he'll get mad.

249
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,399
Turco is a bit jealous.

250
00:20:19,199 --> 00:20:20,898
No, wait, what is it?

251
00:20:21,698 --> 00:20:27,097
Nothing... this is not for you.
You're not into it.

252
00:20:27,897 --> 00:20:30,396
- You could fuck up, and if that happens...
- What could I fuck up?

253
00:20:30,431 --> 00:20:32,996
What kind of an idiot d'you think I am?

254
00:20:33,096 --> 00:20:35,595
- The kind who thinks too much.
- Is that a liability?

255
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:36,995
- It's a liability.
- Why?

256
00:20:37,095 --> 00:20:40,594
If you think too much,
you won't do some things.

257
00:20:42,094 --> 00:20:44,494
Look, I need the money.

258
00:20:44,594 --> 00:20:48,293
Splitting 50% with you, I'll make more
than 100% if I were on my own.

259
00:20:48,328 --> 00:20:50,792
This is not about learning
a couple of tricks.

260
00:20:50,892 --> 00:20:54,691
Any asshole knows it.
You need something else for this job.

261
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,291
Talent...

262
00:20:57,191 --> 00:20:58,691
and you've got it.

263
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,290
Otherwise, I wouldn't be alive.

264
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:04,489
Are you that good?
Can you achieve anything you set out for?

265
00:21:04,589 --> 00:21:05,887
Anything.

266
00:21:10,986 --> 00:21:13,586
Can you get that purse
in less than two minutes?

267
00:21:14,385 --> 00:21:17,385
- She has to voluntarily hand me her purse?
- In two minutes.

268
00:21:18,385 --> 00:21:19,784
No, not that.

269
00:21:19,819 --> 00:21:22,984
- I can.
- No, you can't.

270
00:21:23,084 --> 00:21:24,883
I bet you the ring.

271
00:21:42,178 --> 00:21:44,177
- Hi.
- Hi.

272
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:52,376
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.

273
00:21:54,975 --> 00:21:56,475
- What floor, madam?
- Fourth.

274
00:21:56,575 --> 00:21:58,874
- And you?
- The penthouse.

275
00:22:12,769 --> 00:22:15,969
- What is it?
- I don't know.

276
00:22:17,068 --> 00:22:20,868
These old elevators,
they break down, they fall down.

277
00:22:21,068 --> 00:22:24,567
- Please, don't say that.
- It happens all the time.

278
00:22:37,664 --> 00:22:39,364
Holy shit!

279
00:22:40,464 --> 00:22:43,463
- Let's get help.
- Makes sense.

280
00:22:43,498 --> 00:22:46,962
No, we'll do something else.

281
00:22:49,462 --> 00:22:52,461
- We're going out and we'll use the stairs.
- That way?

282
00:22:54,561 --> 00:22:56,360
Let me help you.

283
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,659
Your purse,
I'll place it here.

284
00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:04,859
Shall I hold it for you?

285
00:23:12,155 --> 00:23:15,754
- I didn't know that one.
- Neither did I.

286
00:23:16,754 --> 00:23:18,554
- You improvised?
- Yes.

287
00:23:20,153 --> 00:23:22,153
- Really?
- Yes.

288
00:23:22,253 --> 00:23:24,253
That was fast.

289
00:23:28,952 --> 00:23:31,651
And you have another asset
that'll make your life easier.

290
00:23:31,751 --> 00:23:35,450
Something money can't buy.
You look like a nice guy.

291
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:40,149
Incredible! Once again you've
sent me the wrong paper!

292
00:23:40,249 --> 00:23:42,147
I'm sick and tired of
coming myself to get it!

293
00:23:42,247 --> 00:23:45,346
- What's your address?
- Viamonte 1242, 2nd. "B".

294
00:23:53,844 --> 00:23:56,844
- You're so cheap. Can't you buy it?
- Don't call me cheap.

295
00:23:57,744 --> 00:23:59,943
Are you upset?

296
00:24:00,543 --> 00:24:03,142
Of course I can buy it,
but I can also not buy it.

297
00:24:03,177 --> 00:24:05,442
As everybody else would do if they could.

298
00:24:05,542 --> 00:24:09,141
- D'you think everybody is like you?
- Like me? Most.

299
00:24:09,241 --> 00:24:12,938
- The thing is they don't have enough balls.
- At least it's most.

300
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:15,538
Then there's the decent folk,
and then there's you...

301
00:24:15,638 --> 00:24:18,137
and you would be... what?

302
00:24:18,237 --> 00:24:19,837
What's up, man?

303
00:24:21,137 --> 00:24:23,736
You wouldn't have gotten her out
of the elevator, would you?

304
00:24:24,436 --> 00:24:26,436
- What are you talking about?
- The purse.

305
00:24:26,636 --> 00:24:29,935
- You would have walked away with it.
- What do you mean?

306
00:24:31,235 --> 00:24:33,634
You think I'm a thief?

307
00:24:34,234 --> 00:24:37,833
I don't kill people.
I don't use a piece. Anyone can do that.

308
00:24:37,933 --> 00:24:40,533
Do you want to see thieves?
Come.

309
00:24:41,733 --> 00:24:43,032
Those two are...

310
00:24:43,067 --> 00:24:46,232
waiting for someone
with a briefcase on the street side.

311
00:24:47,831 --> 00:24:51,630
That one,
sizing up loaded victims.

312
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:54,630
They are there,
but you can't see them.

313
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:57,529
That's what it's all about.
They're there, but they aren't.

314
00:24:57,629 --> 00:25:00,929
So mind your briefcase,
your case, your door...

315
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:05,428
your window, your car,
your savings.

316
00:25:05,528 --> 00:25:09,227
Mind your ass. Because they're
there and they'll always be.

317
00:25:09,262 --> 00:25:13,226
- Thieves.
- No... that's what everybody calls them.

318
00:25:13,324 --> 00:25:18,523
They are spitters, breakers,
skin workers, blind fronts...

319
00:25:18,623 --> 00:25:24,222
hoisters, hooks, stalls, petermans,
night raiders, spitters...

320
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:31,120
mustard chuckers, fences,
operators, swindlers...

321
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,919
I'm hungry.
Let's go to my office to get a meal.

322
00:25:41,518 --> 00:25:43,018
What is it?

323
00:26:02,712 --> 00:26:05,011
Sit there, wait for me.

324
00:26:05,111 --> 00:26:08,711
- Anibal, could you clear my desk?
- Your sister called.

325
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:11,110
How d'you know it was my sister?

326
00:26:11,145 --> 00:26:13,310
She said she was
your sister, Valeria.

327
00:26:13,345 --> 00:26:15,009
I didn't know you had a sister.

328
00:26:15,044 --> 00:26:17,907
- Yes, I got a sister.
- What time did she call?

329
00:26:18,007 --> 00:26:21,406
- About an hour ago.
- Did she say what she wanted?

330
00:26:21,506 --> 00:26:24,405
Get an office with a secretary
and stop busting my balls.

331
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,505
Get me something to eat,
something tasty.

332
00:26:30,504 --> 00:26:33,103
If you don't mind,
I'll choose the meal next time.

333
00:26:33,203 --> 00:26:35,303
You're a pain in the ass, kid.

334
00:26:35,403 --> 00:26:37,703
- When?
- This morning.

335
00:26:37,803 --> 00:26:41,102
- What did you say?
- That you were hospitalized.

336
00:26:44,201 --> 00:26:46,801
- Why were you hospitalized?
- No...

337
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,600
I think I'm running out of credit.

338
00:26:54,499 --> 00:26:57,798
I'm a mess with money.
It's hard for me to...

339
00:26:59,098 --> 00:27:02,397
- A mess?
- Your sister.

340
00:27:04,297 --> 00:27:05,397
Hello.

341
00:27:05,797 --> 00:27:10,396
Either we never get to talk
or we speak twice the same day.

342
00:27:11,795 --> 00:27:14,295
No, I can't now.

343
00:27:15,395 --> 00:27:17,492
And why should it concern me?

344
00:27:17,692 --> 00:27:19,692
If you're fucking with me
to get me to go and talk about...

345
00:27:19,792 --> 00:27:21,791
our grandparents' estate

346
00:27:22,091 --> 00:27:24,891
Wait. Wait a minute!

347
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,690
Alright, I'm on my way.
Yes!

348
00:27:32,489 --> 00:27:36,288
- Problems?
- I don't know. Maybe.

349
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:39,488
I'm going to see my sister.

350
00:27:39,588 --> 00:27:41,187
And what shall I do?

351
00:27:43,087 --> 00:27:45,287
Come along.
You never know with my sister.

352
00:27:45,387 --> 00:27:48,284
Maybe I might need a witness.
Pay for this. I'll pay you later.

353
00:27:56,082 --> 00:27:58,482
- Your sister works here?
- Yes.

354
00:27:58,982 --> 00:28:01,781
- Does she...?
- No.

355
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:04,581
My sister is a responsible person.

356
00:28:57,768 --> 00:29:02,467
- A miracle. I called and you came.
- I'm fine, thanks. And you?

357
00:29:02,502 --> 00:29:05,366
Fine, we are fine.
Thanks for your concern.

358
00:29:05,466 --> 00:29:06,966
You called to give me shit?

359
00:29:07,001 --> 00:29:09,165
I'm trying to keep the party going,
to be polite.

360
00:29:09,265 --> 00:29:11,665
I wish it was a party.
You needn't be polite.

361
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,564
It'd be enough if you just
carried out your responsibilities.

362
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:16,564
I heard that song before.
I think it was your mother singing it.

363
00:29:16,664 --> 00:29:19,863
- You're a bastard!
- Watch your mouth.

364
00:29:19,898 --> 00:29:23,460
Be careful your bosses might listen.
How many are they? Ten, twenty?

365
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,660
Never seen a woman
with as many bosses as she has.

366
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:29,359
- Who is this?
- Juan, a friend.

367
00:29:29,859 --> 00:29:32,458
- I called you.
- And I came with him. What d'you want?

368
00:29:32,758 --> 00:29:34,058
Come here.

369
00:29:38,357 --> 00:29:40,957
How many times did I ask you
not to meddle with the hotel...

370
00:29:41,057 --> 00:29:42,956
and its guests, that you do
your business elsewhere?

371
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:43,956
Too many.

372
00:29:44,056 --> 00:29:46,156
I was at the lobby and
that partner of yours, the old man...

373
00:29:46,256 --> 00:29:47,355
what was his name?

374
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:49,155
- Sandler?
- That's it.

375
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:51,055
- I thought he had died.
- Don't fuck with me.

376
00:29:51,155 --> 00:29:53,052
I'm not. I haven't seen him
in six or seven years.

377
00:29:53,152 --> 00:29:55,552
Besides, he wasn't my partner.
He does something else.

378
00:29:55,652 --> 00:29:59,351
He was at the lobby insisting
on seeing a guest.

379
00:29:59,451 --> 00:30:01,550
I thought it was one of your affairs.

380
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:02,750
You're wrong.

381
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:06,549
I had you called, they didn't find you,
and I had him sent out.

382
00:30:06,649 --> 00:30:08,249
You've become a snitch?

383
00:30:08,284 --> 00:30:13,448
This is my job and I work my ass off
12 hours a day to keep it.

384
00:30:14,448 --> 00:30:16,647
I hope you don't
mean it literally.

385
00:30:20,746 --> 00:30:23,744
When the old man was being
thrown out, he had a seizure...

386
00:30:23,844 --> 00:30:25,343
He fainted.

387
00:30:25,443 --> 00:30:27,343
The house doctor
has already seen him...

388
00:30:28,443 --> 00:30:30,043
and they'll call an ambulance shortly.

389
00:30:30,142 --> 00:30:32,042
What does all this have
to do with me?

390
00:30:32,142 --> 00:30:36,241
The old man recognized me and
asked me, begged me to call you...

391
00:30:36,341 --> 00:30:38,741
that it was urgent,
he needed to talk to you.

392
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,839
My life is quite a mess as it is.

393
00:30:45,339 --> 00:30:48,139
Make sure he doesn't come back.
Neither do you.

394
00:30:48,174 --> 00:30:50,338
- You called me.
- He did.

395
00:30:50,638 --> 00:30:52,438
Whatever you have to settle,
do it and go away.

396
00:30:52,538 --> 00:30:54,337
It makes me nervous
to see you here.

397
00:30:54,372 --> 00:30:56,937
You're as loving as always.

398
00:30:57,137 --> 00:31:00,536
By the way, are you dating someone,
did you get married?

399
00:31:02,336 --> 00:31:04,835
I'm dating.
It will be one year tomorrow.

400
00:31:05,535 --> 00:31:09,834
- Congratulations. I know him?
- I don't think so. He's decent.

401
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:17,433
Nice ass, right?

402
00:31:24,631 --> 00:31:27,929
Marquitos, you came.

403
00:31:28,528 --> 00:31:32,728
- You called me, Sandler.
- I thought... you know...

404
00:31:34,027 --> 00:31:35,427
And him?

405
00:31:35,462 --> 00:31:38,326
He's with me. If you want to
I can ask him to leave.

406
00:31:41,826 --> 00:31:43,325
Juan?

407
00:31:53,423 --> 00:31:56,021
Aren't you Juan, Ramiro's kid?

408
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,120
I worked with
your father many years ago.

409
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,619
I would forge the papers for him,
and he pushed them.

410
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,018
- Sandler is an artist.
- Yes, an artist.

411
00:32:11,817 --> 00:32:14,417
- I made you make big money.
- Those were other times.

412
00:32:16,117 --> 00:32:19,116
- You don't remember me?
- No.

413
00:32:20,916 --> 00:32:23,415
You were a little kid then.

414
00:32:24,615 --> 00:32:27,412
Perhaps ten, twelve.

415
00:32:30,012 --> 00:32:33,311
- Good memory.
- He was a smart kid.

416
00:32:34,511 --> 00:32:38,410
This is all very touching
but why did you have me called?

417
00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:45,309
Hand me the briefcase.

418
00:32:48,808 --> 00:32:55,806
Esteban Vidal Gandolfo is
a guest at this hotel.

419
00:32:56,106 --> 00:32:57,706
Do you know him?

420
00:33:02,505 --> 00:33:04,805
DEPORTATION
OF VI DAL GANDOLFO

421
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:08,704
"Owns a holding."

422
00:33:10,303 --> 00:33:12,803
"Must leave the country in a hurry."

423
00:33:13,203 --> 00:33:16,602
"Parliamentary investigation.
Deportation to Venezuela."

424
00:33:19,002 --> 00:33:21,201
Five hundred million dollars?

425
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,800
Whatever it is, it's too big for you.

426
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,600
He's got a hobby.
He's worth 500 million...

427
00:33:29,297 --> 00:33:31,197
and he's got a hobby.

428
00:33:31,997 --> 00:33:34,296
- Which one?
- Stamps.

429
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:45,294
- Didn't you have a...?
- Brother-in-law. A stamp collector.

430
00:33:45,394 --> 00:33:48,693
A very good one.
The husband of my sister, Berta.

431
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:51,693
- The one who lives at the Kavanagh.
- My rich sister.

432
00:33:51,793 --> 00:33:55,892
He died eight, nine years ago,
and left her the whole collection...

433
00:33:55,927 --> 00:33:58,391
including the "Nine Queens".

434
00:33:58,491 --> 00:33:59,491
Nine Queens?

435
00:34:00,389 --> 00:34:04,288
The Nine Queens is a sheet
of stamps from the Weimar Republic.

436
00:34:04,788 --> 00:34:09,487
- Defective, rare and very valuable.
- How much?

437
00:34:10,287 --> 00:34:12,886
I don't know.
I didn't have time to establish a price.

438
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:16,186
You wanted to sell them
to Vidal Gandolfo?

439
00:34:16,286 --> 00:34:20,685
My sister's stamps? No, not hers.

440
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,984
She wouldn't sell them.

441
00:34:23,084 --> 00:34:27,084
She says they remind her
of her husband. No.

442
00:34:28,183 --> 00:34:29,783
So?

443
00:34:30,383 --> 00:34:32,880
But I got to see them.

444
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,380
I studied them.
I took photographs.

445
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:40,779
- You copied them.
- My best work ever.

446
00:34:42,178 --> 00:34:46,278
Original paper.
1920.

447
00:34:47,077 --> 00:34:49,777
Hand-cut.
One perforation at a time.

448
00:34:49,877 --> 00:34:54,176
This is one of your photos?

449
00:34:55,776 --> 00:34:58,075
The trick is the time.

450
00:34:58,475 --> 00:35:00,675
I know they wouldn't pass a lab test.

451
00:35:02,274 --> 00:35:06,073
But they're taking the guy
to the airport tomorrow.

452
00:35:06,673 --> 00:35:09,673
He doesn't have the time
to check them thoroughly.

453
00:35:10,173 --> 00:35:12,172
That's why they must be sold today.

454
00:35:12,872 --> 00:35:18,271
He'll go for it.
He must believe it's now or never.

455
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:24,170
Please, take me to the toilet.

456
00:35:30,568 --> 00:35:32,168
Easy.

457
00:35:39,964 --> 00:35:43,964
- Do you know this Spaniard?
- I read something about him.

458
00:35:44,164 --> 00:35:45,763
Then he exists.

459
00:35:47,163 --> 00:35:49,263
Yes, of course he exists.

460
00:35:52,462 --> 00:35:54,761
Let me get this straight.

461
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:57,461
You came to the hotel
asking for the Spaniard.

462
00:35:57,561 --> 00:35:59,660
When you couldn't get through,
you got nervous...

463
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,960
because you thought you'd blown it.
Is that so?

464
00:36:03,458 --> 00:36:05,757
It was then that you blew your fuse.

465
00:36:12,556 --> 00:36:16,555
So you need someone
to sell the goods for you...

466
00:36:16,755 --> 00:36:17,755
today.

467
00:36:19,254 --> 00:36:20,754
Why me, of all people?

468
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:24,753
When I fell ill I saw
your sister and I thought...

469
00:36:25,453 --> 00:36:29,052
Why not?
It's been a long time.

470
00:36:31,352 --> 00:36:35,649
You didn't expect this, did you?
Here I am, trusting you again.

471
00:36:35,684 --> 00:36:40,148
You're desperate.
You had no one else to call.

472
00:36:41,848 --> 00:36:44,047
I can give you 20%.

473
00:36:45,147 --> 00:36:45,947
No.

474
00:36:48,446 --> 00:36:50,146
No, look...

475
00:36:51,046 --> 00:36:53,845
Let me tell you what the situation is...

476
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:57,144
You don't set the percentages, I do.

477
00:36:57,244 --> 00:36:59,444
Because if I leave now...

478
00:36:59,479 --> 00:37:02,743
all you'll get will be
an enema at a public hospital.

479
00:37:02,943 --> 00:37:05,843
Listen, I'm 73.

480
00:37:06,243 --> 00:37:08,342
I don't have many opportunities left...

481
00:37:08,377 --> 00:37:11,042
and this one is mine, rightfully.

482
00:37:11,342 --> 00:37:14,941
Don't fuck with me, Marcos.
I can call someone else.

483
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:18,440
If you could call someone else,
you'd have already done so.

484
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,740
How much do you want?

485
00:37:22,339 --> 00:37:23,939
90%.

486
00:37:25,139 --> 00:37:26,938
You are crazy.

487
00:37:27,938 --> 00:37:30,938
No, the thing is I got you by the balls.

488
00:37:31,637 --> 00:37:35,037
- Let's do it 50-50.
- I'm not negotiating.

489
00:37:35,237 --> 00:37:38,434
I'm making you
the only offer you'll ever get.

490
00:37:38,634 --> 00:37:40,933
10% for you...

491
00:37:41,033 --> 00:37:42,933
or nothing, zip.

492
00:37:43,533 --> 00:37:45,433
I didn't come to you, Sandler.

493
00:37:46,132 --> 00:37:48,932
It was the other way round.

494
00:37:49,632 --> 00:37:52,431
I never learn.

495
00:37:52,831 --> 00:37:55,430
- I'm an asshole.
- You're not an asshole. You are fucked up.

496
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:01,229
Well?

497
00:38:30,321 --> 00:38:33,121
The wife has the stamps at their place.

498
00:38:33,156 --> 00:38:35,320
If I tell her he sends me,
she'll give them to me.

499
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:38,120
He asked me not to mention the hospital.
He doesn't want to scare her.

500
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,117
D'you know anything
about stamps?

501
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:42,417
They're small square papers
you stick on envelopes.

502
00:38:42,452 --> 00:38:44,916
- You'll go ahead with it?
- Sure!

503
00:38:45,016 --> 00:38:46,616
- What?
- Nothing.

504
00:38:46,651 --> 00:38:48,715
- I find it a bit strange.
- Which part?

505
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:52,015
- All of it.
- Strange? You find it strange?

506
00:38:52,315 --> 00:38:55,114
Kid, I've sold barbed wire seeds
and got thanked for it.

507
00:38:55,214 --> 00:38:58,014
D'you think I can get scared
with some stamps?

508
00:38:58,113 --> 00:39:03,212
What can I lose? I risk nothing.
If I sell, I keep everything.

509
00:39:03,247 --> 00:39:05,612
And if the cops get involved?

510
00:39:06,712 --> 00:39:08,411
No, kid.
This is something else.

511
00:39:08,511 --> 00:39:11,911
This is something you can wait for your
entire life and could never happen.

512
00:39:11,946 --> 00:39:14,110
One in a million.

513
00:39:14,145 --> 00:39:16,010
The old man is a good artist.

514
00:39:16,045 --> 00:39:20,409
He's the best.
And I can sell those stamps.

515
00:39:20,444 --> 00:39:25,308
- I can probably get... thirty grand.
- Thirty grand?

516
00:39:26,308 --> 00:39:29,107
- More, you think?
- Come.

517
00:39:32,506 --> 00:39:35,806
What is it?
What do you want?

518
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:38,405
- I want in.
- In where?

519
00:39:38,505 --> 00:39:41,503
The deal. I need the cash.
I want a part.

520
00:39:41,603 --> 00:39:43,602
A part? Are you crazy?

521
00:39:43,702 --> 00:39:46,002
I don't mean much.
Just a percentage.

522
00:39:46,102 --> 00:39:47,601
We're together for the day.

523
00:39:47,701 --> 00:39:50,101
Why should I give you a percentage?

524
00:39:50,201 --> 00:39:53,700
This reached me through my sister.

525
00:39:53,735 --> 00:39:56,100
- Who the fuck d'you think you are?
- Well, I was there.

526
00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:58,699
Fuck that! You don't even
know Sandler's address.

527
00:40:01,598 --> 00:40:04,298
I'll need help. Stay with me
for a lump sum... a grand.

528
00:40:04,398 --> 00:40:06,997
- Three.
- One and a half.

529
00:40:07,032 --> 00:40:09,397
- Two and a half.
- Okay, two.

530
00:40:09,497 --> 00:40:11,594
- Two and a half.
- Alright!

531
00:40:12,194 --> 00:40:14,294
Only if we pull it off.

532
00:40:54,983 --> 00:40:57,383
- What was the name of the guy?
- None of your business.

533
00:40:57,483 --> 00:41:00,082
- Vidal Garafalo?
- Gandolfo.

534
00:41:00,282 --> 00:41:02,182
Gandolfo. He likes you.

535
00:41:02,282 --> 00:41:05,181
I'd like to talk to you about...
Why do you ask?

536
00:41:05,216 --> 00:41:06,781
It's nothing.

537
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,680
- Don't mess with that guy...
- I'll be back.

538
00:41:22,878 --> 00:41:26,777
D'you remember a song by R. Pavone,
II Ballo del Mattone?

539
00:41:37,475 --> 00:41:39,574
That's it, let's go.
We won't bother you again.

540
00:41:39,674 --> 00:41:42,274
What about
our grandparent's estate?

541
00:41:42,309 --> 00:41:44,171
Not again.
Talk to your lawyer.

542
00:41:44,271 --> 00:41:46,471
Don't fuck with me,
your lawyer's delaying it.

543
00:41:46,506 --> 00:41:49,370
- That's what lawyers are for.
- Do it for Federico.

544
00:41:49,405 --> 00:41:51,870
- What does he have to do?
- You're screwing him too.

545
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:54,269
- The third part is his.
- I'm not screwing anybody.

546
00:41:54,369 --> 00:41:57,968
You wanted to sue me? You did.
D'you want my blood now?

547
00:41:58,003 --> 00:41:59,968
Look at the victim.
You're a bastard!

548
00:42:00,068 --> 00:42:03,167
Don't insult me.
And leave the boy out of this.

549
00:42:03,267 --> 00:42:05,567
He is not staying out.
You explain it to him.

550
00:42:06,766 --> 00:42:08,366
- How are you?
- What's up, boy?

551
00:42:08,466 --> 00:42:09,866
- Fine?
- How are you?

552
00:42:09,966 --> 00:42:12,265
Didn't you say he never came,
he didn't care? How are you?

553
00:42:12,365 --> 00:42:14,865
- Fine. And you?
- Okay.

554
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:18,862
Finally your sister got to have you
working with her all dressed up.

555
00:42:18,962 --> 00:42:22,261
Yes, we need the money.
We still have debts.

556
00:42:22,361 --> 00:42:25,061
You don't have to explain.
You shouldn't feel ashamed.

557
00:42:25,161 --> 00:42:27,760
Explain to him why he can't
collect his grandparents' money.

558
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:30,060
- Valeria, cut it out.
- Yes.

559
00:42:30,095 --> 00:42:33,659
- Don't be naive, Federico.
- Don't involve me in this mess.

560
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:36,058
He's already explained what
happened with the inheritance.

561
00:42:36,093 --> 00:42:38,758
- You believe him?
- Of course, he's my brother.

562
00:42:38,793 --> 00:42:40,757
Do what you have to do,
sue him. I don't care.

563
00:42:40,857 --> 00:42:42,457
But don't bust my balls.

564
00:42:43,657 --> 00:42:47,054
- I have to go back to work. See you.
- Okay.

565
00:42:52,453 --> 00:42:53,853
Bye.

566
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,750
- Good afternoon.
- What d'you want?

567
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:12,649
Your husband sent us to pick
up an envelope he left for us.

568
00:43:12,749 --> 00:43:15,148
It's a yellow,
large envelope on the shelf...

569
00:43:15,183 --> 00:43:17,848
in the living room
under the Chinese jar.

570
00:43:17,883 --> 00:43:19,747
- My husband is not in.
- Yes, I know.

571
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,547
He said that
even if he wasn't home...

572
00:43:21,647 --> 00:43:23,347
we could come by
to pick up the envelope.

573
00:43:23,382 --> 00:43:26,746
He's not in!
Come back later.

574
00:43:26,781 --> 00:43:28,946
We'd love to, but we can't.

575
00:43:29,045 --> 00:43:32,445
- Sandler, Mr. Sandler said that...
- He's not in!

576
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,744
He's not in!
My husband is not in!

577
00:43:37,344 --> 00:43:40,443
Who are you?
What do you want from me?

578
00:43:40,543 --> 00:43:45,042
- Nothing, it's just...
- Go away or I'll call the police.

579
00:43:45,142 --> 00:43:47,940
- Madam, please...
- Go away!

580
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:53,338
I know your kind. You take
advantage of old ladies like me.

581
00:43:53,438 --> 00:43:54,838
But I won't allow it.

582
00:43:54,938 --> 00:43:57,638
That's why I don't open
my door to anyone.

583
00:43:57,738 --> 00:43:59,637
Let's go, the lady's right.
There's no point.

584
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:01,637
Your mother will understand.
It's not that bad.

585
00:44:01,737 --> 00:44:04,136
If we ever visit her again,
we'll take her the photos...

586
00:44:04,236 --> 00:44:06,236
otherwise we won't.

587
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:10,435
Bye.
Forgive us, madam.

588
00:44:10,535 --> 00:44:13,534
My brother gets all worked up
when he's going to visit mother.

589
00:44:13,634 --> 00:44:16,034
And she was looking forward
to seeing these photos...

590
00:44:16,334 --> 00:44:17,933
but never mind.

591
00:44:18,033 --> 00:44:19,931
We'll fix it somehow.
Goodbye.

592
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:27,030
Listen...

593
00:44:29,229 --> 00:44:32,628
No, not you. You stay there.
Come here.

594
00:44:37,627 --> 00:44:38,427
Yes?

595
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:41,527
In that envelope there
are photos for your Mum?

596
00:44:41,626 --> 00:44:44,126
Some old photos of my Uncle Liver
and his family in Poland.

597
00:44:44,926 --> 00:44:48,125
Your husband promised us
some copies of the originals.

598
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,322
We wanted to give them to
Mum now that we'll visit her.

599
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:54,122
- Where does your mother live?
- In Entre Ríos.

600
00:44:56,022 --> 00:44:57,521
Entre Ríos!

601
00:44:57,621 --> 00:45:01,620
Entre Ríos.
Would you wait a minute?

602
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,519
- Okay, twenty percent.
- 50-50.

603
00:45:07,554 --> 00:45:09,319
No fucking way, I'd kill you first.
Twenty-five percent.

604
00:45:09,419 --> 00:45:10,818
You can't do it without me.

605
00:45:10,918 --> 00:45:13,718
I'm not Sandler and
you really need the dough.

606
00:45:13,818 --> 00:45:16,817
Thirty percent.
That's it, minus expenses.

607
00:45:21,516 --> 00:45:25,715
Do you know Entre Ríos?
Mom would never leave there.

608
00:45:25,815 --> 00:45:27,115
She always says...

609
00:45:27,215 --> 00:45:29,915
"A Meckler stays in the land
where he was born."

610
00:45:30,014 --> 00:45:31,214
Meckler?

611
00:45:31,314 --> 00:45:34,214
Is she related to Rabbi Meckler,
of Basavilbaso?

612
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:37,113
Her cousin.
I'm his nephew.

613
00:45:44,012 --> 00:45:47,711
Vidal Gandolfo will be at the hotel
the whole afternoon.

614
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:53,208
- They ordered drinks for 3:30 p.m.
- How will you approach him?

615
00:45:55,807 --> 00:45:57,607
I don't know.

616
00:45:58,907 --> 00:46:01,306
- We must think of something.
- Think fast.

617
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:03,606
He's leaving tomorrow.
You don't have much time.

618
00:46:03,706 --> 00:46:07,405
We, I mean, you could
contribute 30% of an idea.

619
00:46:07,505 --> 00:46:10,204
How are you, dear Marcos?

620
00:46:10,404 --> 00:46:13,703
I'm sorry, Washington.
We're busy.

621
00:46:13,738 --> 00:46:16,903
It'll take you longer to dismiss
me than to check my goods.

622
00:46:18,203 --> 00:46:20,902
You're right.
What do you have?

623
00:46:22,202 --> 00:46:23,799
Whatever you want.

624
00:46:25,499 --> 00:46:28,098
National, Buenos Aires,
Córdoba, Cooperative...

625
00:46:28,198 --> 00:46:29,798
- Third parties?
- And blank checks.

626
00:46:29,833 --> 00:46:31,698
I have some
complete check books.

627
00:46:32,698 --> 00:46:36,397
- I want for you to leave.
- Don't you wanna make a gift?

628
00:46:36,497 --> 00:46:38,196
You could impress your loved ones.

629
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:41,996
Nothing better than
a Paraguayan Rolex to do that.

630
00:46:42,096 --> 00:46:45,595
And you, young man?
Anything else?

631
00:46:45,795 --> 00:46:48,694
Perfumes, clothing, imported sneakers?

632
00:46:49,094 --> 00:46:53,293
Computer software, paintings,
electronic devices?

633
00:46:54,091 --> 00:46:57,190
I have an excellent Japanese
bike, with minor damages.

634
00:46:57,225 --> 00:46:58,890
- What damages?
- A hole in the tank.

635
00:46:58,925 --> 00:47:01,889
- A perforation?
- Small caliber.

636
00:47:01,989 --> 00:47:04,289
That's it, I need a gun
but something large.

637
00:47:04,389 --> 00:47:05,789
D'you have a .357?

638
00:47:06,589 --> 00:47:08,188
Marcos...

639
00:47:08,288 --> 00:47:10,488
I'm not a crook.

640
00:47:12,587 --> 00:47:14,087
Have a nice day.

641
00:47:16,087 --> 00:47:18,986
Excuse me,
do you have cell phones?

642
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:20,886
Any make in particular?

643
00:47:23,085 --> 00:47:24,385
An idea?

644
00:47:36,882 --> 00:47:39,382
Easy, he'll go.

645
00:48:26,868 --> 00:48:28,168
Hello...

646
00:48:28,768 --> 00:48:30,967
Yes, it's me.

647
00:48:31,067 --> 00:48:35,466
What's up? It's not a good time.
I'm about to take a leak.

648
00:48:36,066 --> 00:48:38,266
At the hotel.

649
00:48:38,466 --> 00:48:40,465
I came because
I was given a tip...

650
00:48:40,565 --> 00:48:42,765
but I doubt it'll work out.

651
00:48:44,064 --> 00:48:47,164
No, no, I'm going
to Montevideo on Saturday.

652
00:48:47,264 --> 00:48:50,963
I'll try to sell them there. Yes.

653
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:56,662
The thing is not when but how much.

654
00:48:58,659 --> 00:49:02,359
Are you crazy?
For the "Nine Queens"?

655
00:49:04,658 --> 00:49:05,958
I tell you what.

656
00:49:06,058 --> 00:49:08,457
For that amount go
to the post office and...

657
00:49:08,557 --> 00:49:10,257
get as many stamps as you like.

658
00:49:10,357 --> 00:49:12,257
Not even close.
Forget it.

659
00:49:16,956 --> 00:49:19,355
Now, that's better.

660
00:49:22,354 --> 00:49:25,054
- What the fuck are you doing here?!
- Talking on the phone.

661
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:27,753
Don't fuck with me!

662
00:49:28,553 --> 00:49:30,553
It's the second time today
I see you around.

663
00:49:30,588 --> 00:49:32,052
You and that prick.

664
00:49:32,152 --> 00:49:33,552
What d'you want?

665
00:49:33,652 --> 00:49:36,252
I do the asking, you just answer.
What're you doing here?

666
00:49:36,352 --> 00:49:39,151
- What's the trick this time?
- I have something to sell.

667
00:49:39,186 --> 00:49:41,950
- It's legal, no strings attached.
- In the hotel restroom?

668
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:44,650
Don't fuck with me!
D'you want me to get really mad?

669
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:50,149
We're all here now.
Look at the face of this guy.

670
00:49:50,249 --> 00:49:52,248
Where did you find him?

671
00:49:52,548 --> 00:49:54,948
The people at the hotel
are worried.

672
00:49:54,983 --> 00:49:56,947
Come and explain everything to me.

673
00:49:56,982 --> 00:49:58,747
That won't be necessary.

674
00:49:58,782 --> 00:50:02,044
I'm sure you won't mind
showing me your I D.

675
00:50:05,743 --> 00:50:08,243
- Put the gun down.
- And who are you?

676
00:50:09,143 --> 00:50:10,542
A guest at the hotel.

677
00:50:10,642 --> 00:50:12,442
These gentlemen
are here because...

678
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:14,242
- I called them.
- You called them?

679
00:50:16,641 --> 00:50:18,741
Please, put the gun away.

680
00:50:18,841 --> 00:50:23,440
You might be a guest here,
the king of Spain, but I don't

681
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:28,139
You come with me.
And you, wait for me.

682
00:50:35,835 --> 00:50:40,434
- You bastard!
- You liked it! You liked it!

683
00:50:40,469 --> 00:50:42,534
Fucking asshole!
Who said you had to hit me?

684
00:50:42,634 --> 00:50:45,233
I should go to Hollywood.
He bought it!

685
00:50:45,433 --> 00:50:49,532
- I should do this for a living.
- We must go back.

686
00:50:49,632 --> 00:50:52,132
Take whatever he gives you
and consider yourself paid.

687
00:50:52,232 --> 00:50:55,531
No, you have to give me
your part. You owe me 200.

688
00:50:55,631 --> 00:50:58,231
- I'll give you a hundred now...
- Two hundred.

689
00:51:12,426 --> 00:51:14,225
My pleasure.

690
00:51:15,825 --> 00:51:18,324
I'd like to have a word
with you. Follow me.

691
00:51:18,424 --> 00:51:21,124
My partners are waiting for me.

692
00:51:22,124 --> 00:51:23,723
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

693
00:51:23,823 --> 00:51:25,823
Where did your friend get the I D?

694
00:51:25,923 --> 00:51:28,422
He gets it at his job,
together with the gun.

695
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:40,520
Let's not waste time.

696
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:42,120
Let's not waste time.

697
00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:45,419
You told the cop
you have something to sell.

698
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:48,518
A legal deal, as you said.

699
00:51:49,418 --> 00:51:52,018
And from what I heard of
your phone conversation...

700
00:51:52,118 --> 00:51:55,117
- I might be interested.
- Who are you?

701
00:51:55,217 --> 00:51:57,616
If what you have to offer
is what I believe it is...

702
00:51:57,716 --> 00:51:59,216
Excuse me.
Who are you?

703
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:02,215
The person you were tipped off
about. The one you came to see.

704
00:52:03,215 --> 00:52:05,813
I've nothing to sell
nor did I ask any favor.

705
00:52:05,848 --> 00:52:07,312
We're here to be polite.

706
00:52:07,412 --> 00:52:10,612
You helped us out in the
restroom, a misunderstanding.

707
00:52:10,712 --> 00:52:12,711
But the truth is
I don't know who you are.

708
00:52:12,746 --> 00:52:15,911
- What d'you say?
- My partner speaks for me too.

709
00:52:16,211 --> 00:52:21,909
Professionals. D'you see, idiots,
how these things are handled?

710
00:52:22,109 --> 00:52:25,609
If you had something to sell to
me you'd knock on my door...

711
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:28,408
...just like a book peddler.

712
00:52:29,908 --> 00:52:32,507
But if you were a smart Argentinean...

713
00:52:33,507 --> 00:52:35,804
...you'd try to interest me.

714
00:52:36,504 --> 00:52:38,904
You'd find a way
to have me look for you...

715
00:52:39,004 --> 00:52:40,903
and not the other way round.

716
00:52:41,203 --> 00:52:44,003
You could, for example, have
a telephone conversation...

717
00:52:44,103 --> 00:52:49,002
with an alleged buyer
and make sure I'd listen to it.

718
00:52:49,602 --> 00:52:52,501
But you have to be subtle.

719
00:52:53,701 --> 00:52:55,500
You shouldn't say anything like...

720
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:59,400
"What? For the Nine Queens?
You are crazy! "

721
00:53:00,399 --> 00:53:03,999
And then the cop, "Please,
don't hit me. I've something to sell.

722
00:53:04,034 --> 00:53:09,196
But it's legal. I promise."
Do you understand?

723
00:53:09,496 --> 00:53:11,295
It was so ridiculous!

724
00:53:15,994 --> 00:53:18,594
I don't know
what you are talking about.

725
00:53:18,694 --> 00:53:21,393
Look, man. There's no point
in insisting on that.

726
00:53:23,893 --> 00:53:26,492
It is true that if you had
approached me directly...

727
00:53:26,592 --> 00:53:28,792
I would've never talked with you.

728
00:53:28,891 --> 00:53:31,891
I don't care
that you did it this way.

729
00:53:31,991 --> 00:53:34,190
As long as what you have
is good and interests me.

730
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:36,790
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

731
00:53:36,825 --> 00:53:39,289
Man, cut it out!
The show is over!

732
00:53:39,389 --> 00:53:41,389
You're here
and I'm listening.

733
00:53:41,424 --> 00:53:44,688
If you have something
to offer me, do it or fuck off.

734
00:53:44,723 --> 00:53:46,988
I have little time left and much to do.

735
00:54:06,684 --> 00:54:08,481
Do you have this?

736
00:54:09,981 --> 00:54:11,881
And where did you get it?

737
00:54:11,981 --> 00:54:14,680
My grandfather gave them
to me shortly before he died...

738
00:54:14,715 --> 00:54:16,180
a few months ago.

739
00:54:16,215 --> 00:54:18,579
He got them from a German
guy he met on a ship.

740
00:54:18,679 --> 00:54:21,779
- He paid seven pesos for them.
- Seven pesos...

741
00:54:21,879 --> 00:54:25,678
I told my cousin. He suggested
I should sell them to a collector.

742
00:54:25,778 --> 00:54:28,177
- Are you interested?
- Don't push me.

743
00:54:28,277 --> 00:54:30,877
I mean, as you have
so little time left and so much to do...

744
00:54:32,776 --> 00:54:34,676
I might want to buy them.

745
00:54:36,176 --> 00:54:40,973
- That would be good, for all of us.
- Come back, in an hour.

746
00:54:41,273 --> 00:54:43,472
I want to see the stamps
and then we'll talk about money.

747
00:54:43,572 --> 00:54:46,471
- Today.
- Today, yes.

748
00:54:46,571 --> 00:54:48,371
I don't have much time.

749
00:54:48,471 --> 00:54:51,870
Unfortunately, I have to leave
your city tomorrow morning.

750
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:55,570
- You didn't know that?
- I didn't know.

751
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:59,869
That's the way it is.
And believe me, I'll miss this country.

752
00:54:59,904 --> 00:55:03,368
I've never seen such good will
for doing business.

753
00:55:04,168 --> 00:55:05,967
In my room, at 4 o'clock.

754
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:12,764
Let go of that phone!
Goddamit!

755
00:55:22,662 --> 00:55:24,762
I told you not to fuck
around in the hotel.

756
00:55:24,862 --> 00:55:27,561
- Don't worry.
- Stay out of this.

757
00:55:27,596 --> 00:55:29,161
Really, it has nothing to do...

758
00:55:29,261 --> 00:55:30,660
What is it with you, asshole?

759
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,660
D'you know how
my brother's partners end up?

760
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,560
You believe you'll
get money out of him?

761
00:55:34,595 --> 00:55:36,359
- Don't come back.
- We'll be back.

762
00:55:36,459 --> 00:55:39,159
- I'll call the police.
- Call them. What will you say?

763
00:55:48,357 --> 00:55:49,856
Excuse me.

764
00:55:49,956 --> 00:55:51,856
By any chance,
do you remember a song...

765
00:55:52,056 --> 00:55:54,655
by Rita Pavone,
"II Ballo del Mattone"?

766
00:56:03,054 --> 00:56:05,853
Come on... let's go.

767
00:56:09,652 --> 00:56:13,250
- What did your sister mean?
- About what?

768
00:56:13,649 --> 00:56:15,649
- How your partners end up.
- How could I know?

769
00:56:16,549 --> 00:56:19,348
- Why did you stop working with Sandler?
- It's not your business.

770
00:56:19,448 --> 00:56:22,648
For this day, I'm your partner.
It's my business.

771
00:56:23,447 --> 00:56:27,547
Technically we could say
I unilaterally readjusted dividends.

772
00:56:27,847 --> 00:56:31,046
- You fucked your partner.
- "You fucked your partner."

773
00:56:31,546 --> 00:56:33,445
Sandler was always an asshole.

774
00:56:33,545 --> 00:56:36,045
It couldn't have been that bad
if he called me again.

775
00:56:36,145 --> 00:56:37,944
Don't worry. I won't fuck you.

776
00:56:38,044 --> 00:56:39,144
Why not?

777
00:56:39,244 --> 00:56:41,244
I'm getting old,
I'm sure you run faster than I do.

778
00:56:41,279 --> 00:56:44,141
- I'm not convinced.
- Doesn't bother me.

779
00:56:57,638 --> 00:57:00,038
No, goddamit, no.

780
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:07,636
Because I won't maintain
an unfavorable position.

781
00:57:11,535 --> 00:57:13,333
How much?

782
00:57:14,533 --> 00:57:16,432
That's better.

783
00:57:16,532 --> 00:57:20,232
Offer an option at 19,000
and freeze.

784
00:57:23,431 --> 00:57:27,830
Yes, we'd only be losing...
Let me see...

785
00:57:32,929 --> 00:57:35,229
...two and a half,
three million.

786
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:38,528
That's better.

787
00:57:42,927 --> 00:57:46,726
I'll call you later.

788
00:57:49,326 --> 00:57:50,725
Alright.

789
00:57:59,923 --> 00:58:00,823
Give me that.

790
00:58:21,917 --> 00:58:22,917
Do your stuff.

791
00:58:24,416 --> 00:58:27,916
Mr. Vidal, I must insist.
These are not the right conditions.

792
00:58:28,016 --> 00:58:32,015
We should run lab tests
on the ink and a spectrography.

793
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,914
I don't have time, goddamit!

794
00:58:34,014 --> 00:58:37,514
You're supposed to be the best,
at least I'm paying you as if you were.

795
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:42,013
Cut it out and tell me
if they're good or not.

796
00:58:42,048 --> 00:58:44,712
Should I pay for them
or is someone with a lot of guts...

797
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:45,910
trying to screw me?

798
00:58:50,209 --> 00:58:54,408
Go ahead, do whatever is necessary.
The stamps are good.

799
00:59:49,195 --> 00:59:51,494
Excuse me, do any of you
remember a song by...

800
01:00:05,392 --> 01:00:06,691
How's the game going?

801
01:00:30,384 --> 01:00:32,384
A sheet of stamps
of the Weimar Republic...

802
01:00:32,419 --> 01:00:34,284
with a rare distribution of the edges.

803
01:00:34,883 --> 01:00:36,083
You're right, Mr. Vidal.

804
01:00:36,183 --> 01:00:39,283
No more tests are necessary.
These are the Nine Queens.

805
01:00:44,981 --> 01:00:46,681
You, pay him.

806
01:00:50,278 --> 01:00:52,978
Let's talk about money.

807
01:00:55,777 --> 01:01:00,176
- What I had thought...
- Don't think. You just listen.

808
01:01:00,276 --> 01:01:03,276
I don't know what you do
for a living and I don't care.

809
01:01:03,376 --> 01:01:06,075
One thing is for sure,
you don't sell stamps for a living.

810
01:01:06,110 --> 01:01:08,275
These stamps
were dropped on your lap...

811
01:01:08,375 --> 01:01:10,674
and whatever you get for them
is like a gift from heaven.

812
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:15,473
- Am I wrong?
- No, it's true.

813
01:01:16,173 --> 01:01:18,872
We don't know much about stamps.

814
01:01:19,272 --> 01:01:20,770
Nevertheless...

815
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:24,769
we'd rather sell them here,
now, without any further delays.

816
01:01:24,804 --> 01:01:28,268
But I could also get financing
or go to the States.

817
01:01:28,368 --> 01:01:32,268
I can auction them.
I mean, we won't give them away.

818
01:01:32,368 --> 01:01:35,667
- Lf we check the catalogues...
- Fuck the catalogues!

819
01:01:35,767 --> 01:01:39,066
What is it? You've turned
into an expert all of a sudden?

820
01:01:39,166 --> 01:01:44,065
It's me who's gonna buy those stamps.
The rest is bullshit.

821
01:01:44,165 --> 01:01:45,765
I tell you the price and you accept it.

822
01:01:51,264 --> 01:01:53,863
I won't give you a cent more than...

823
01:01:54,963 --> 01:01:57,662
three hundred thousand.

824
01:02:02,261 --> 01:02:06,061
This is not what we had agreed.
I will not be robbed.

825
01:02:06,161 --> 01:02:09,460
My grandfather kept
these stamps all his life...

826
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:12,059
and I won't give them away
to the first one who comes along.

827
01:02:12,159 --> 01:02:13,059
Listen...

828
01:02:13,159 --> 01:02:16,159
You listen. We have
an agreement, but I decide.

829
01:02:16,258 --> 01:02:18,158
I won't blow them and that's final.

830
01:02:18,258 --> 01:02:19,758
Well, well, well...

831
01:02:19,858 --> 01:02:22,755
What amount would
please your grandfather?

832
01:02:40,052 --> 01:02:42,651
- Four hundred and fifty grand.
- What?

833
01:02:42,686 --> 01:02:45,350
This guy is going
to buy the stamps from us.

834
01:02:45,450 --> 01:02:49,550
We deliver them at ten and
he'll pay us $450,000.

835
01:02:50,749 --> 01:02:54,047
Ten percent for Sandler,
and thirty percent of the balance is mine.

836
01:02:54,147 --> 01:02:57,546
- Minus expenses.
- Where's the trick?

837
01:02:57,946 --> 01:03:01,145
- What?
- You're screwing me.

838
01:03:01,245 --> 01:03:02,845
This is a trick.
You're pulling a trick.

839
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:05,544
- You think I'm screwing you? How?
- I don't know.

840
01:03:05,644 --> 01:03:09,743
I can't understand it
and it makes me mad.

841
01:03:09,843 --> 01:03:13,943
- This is not real.
- It's not real? Give me that.

842
01:03:13,978 --> 01:03:17,542
This is as real as it gets,
asshole. It's 450 grand.

843
01:03:17,577 --> 01:03:20,841
It's more real than you and I.
What is it, kid?

844
01:03:21,541 --> 01:03:25,338
Something keeps you from enjoying life?
Do you need assurances?

845
01:03:25,373 --> 01:03:31,637
Look, you can be sure I'll kill you
if I lose this deal because of you.

846
01:03:31,737 --> 01:03:35,536
Does it look suspicious?
Okay. You're out. That's it.

847
01:03:35,636 --> 01:03:38,136
Get out.
Leave me alone. Bye.

848
01:03:38,236 --> 01:03:40,335
Get out, come on.

849
01:03:40,635 --> 01:03:44,034
Have a good life.
Why would I need you?

850
01:03:53,732 --> 01:03:57,232
- I should get rid of you now.
- You are starting to love me.

851
01:03:58,931 --> 01:04:00,531
What do you want?

852
01:04:02,031 --> 01:04:04,430
How did it go?

853
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:07,330
- How did what go? What do you want?
- Did he buy them?

854
01:04:08,129 --> 01:04:10,329
- What is he talking about?
- I don't know.

855
01:04:10,364 --> 01:04:13,028
- What do you want?
- My cut. What you owe me.

856
01:04:13,128 --> 01:04:15,928
What the fuck are you talking about?

857
01:04:16,328 --> 01:04:20,027
Look, you know very well
those stamps are worth nothing.

858
01:04:20,127 --> 01:04:23,626
The originals, yes,
but what you're trying to sell to Vidal...

859
01:04:23,726 --> 01:04:26,424
They are not bad.
They are well done.

860
01:04:26,459 --> 01:04:28,723
- You want your cut?
- Yes.

861
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:30,223
How much?

862
01:04:30,323 --> 01:04:34,622
- Well... 15%. I rendered a service to you.
- I didn't ask for it.

863
01:04:34,722 --> 01:04:36,721
I'll tell him.
I'll go and tell them they're fake.

864
01:04:36,821 --> 01:04:39,321
If you tell him,
I'll pull your liver out of your ass...

865
01:04:39,421 --> 01:04:41,720
and make you swallow it.

866
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:43,520
Who d'you think you're talking to?

867
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:46,319
- 10%.
- 2%.

868
01:04:46,419 --> 01:04:48,619
- 7.5%.
- 5%. Alright?

869
01:04:48,719 --> 01:04:50,719
- Alright?
- Yes.

870
01:04:52,218 --> 01:04:54,318
Give me an address
and a phone number.

871
01:04:54,418 --> 01:04:56,517
- I'll get in touch with you.
- How do I know you'll call?

872
01:04:56,552 --> 01:04:57,815
D'you want me to sign an IOU?

873
01:04:57,850 --> 01:05:00,714
Among thieves, this is the way
it's done. It's based on trust.

874
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:02,514
I'm no thief.

875
01:05:02,614 --> 01:05:04,914
Sure. I'm sorry.
Come on.

876
01:05:06,313 --> 01:05:08,613
- I'm at this number in the mornings.
- At what time?

877
01:05:08,648 --> 01:05:13,112
- Eight to eleven. Except Wednesdays.
- Go. I'll call you.

878
01:05:15,012 --> 01:05:20,310
Goddamit! Is it this way everywhere?
We are fucked.

879
01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:23,210
You are handing out too many shares.

880
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:26,409
I mean, 10% for one guy,
5% for another...

881
01:05:30,206 --> 01:05:31,506
No!

882
01:06:43,589 --> 01:06:45,489
What a mess.

883
01:06:45,789 --> 01:06:47,388
It lasted...

884
01:06:48,888 --> 01:06:50,688
four hours.

885
01:06:50,788 --> 01:06:53,187
- Dreams don't last that long.
- It wasn't a dream.

886
01:06:53,287 --> 01:06:56,687
- It is now.
- What is it? Everyday you lose a fortune?

887
01:06:56,787 --> 01:06:59,886
No, but... there's nothing
we can do, it's over.

888
01:06:59,986 --> 01:07:02,383
These stamps are fucked up,
the others...

889
01:07:06,482 --> 01:07:09,782
- What is it?
- The others, the originals...

890
01:07:10,582 --> 01:07:13,081
Sandler's sister has them
at the Kavanagh.

891
01:07:13,116 --> 01:07:16,380
- Yes, but Sandler said...
- Sandler's an asshole.

892
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:18,880
We offer her a share.

893
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:20,680
We tell them they are already sold...

894
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:22,879
...and that we only need
to deliver them and collect.

895
01:07:22,979 --> 01:07:25,479
- And if she doesn't want to?
- She'll want.

896
01:07:25,978 --> 01:07:27,478
The old bag will do it.

897
01:07:27,578 --> 01:07:29,978
If not, you can do
your crone seducer part. Come.

898
01:07:33,575 --> 01:07:35,275
So...

899
01:07:36,174 --> 01:07:38,074
the Nine Queens.

900
01:07:38,174 --> 01:07:39,774
Exactly.

901
01:07:41,673 --> 01:07:43,873
And what did my brother tell you?

902
01:07:43,973 --> 01:07:49,572
He suggested that you were
very fond of the collection...

903
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:52,571
and that it was a memory to you.

904
01:07:52,671 --> 01:07:54,870
Of my husband, of course.

905
01:07:54,905 --> 01:07:58,470
It's true. The stamps
remind me of my husband.

906
01:07:58,570 --> 01:08:02,169
Square, sticky.

907
01:08:02,669 --> 01:08:06,768
Anyway, we dared to come
because we thought that...

908
01:08:06,803 --> 01:08:09,667
the possibility
of an immediate operation

909
01:08:09,767 --> 01:08:14,666
My brother thinks
I'd never sell those fucking stamps?

910
01:08:14,766 --> 01:08:16,766
What an asshole!
I wouldn't give them to him.

911
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:21,265
It doesn't mean I wouldn't sell them
if I needed the money.

912
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:39,459
I've been thinking of turning
them into something useful.

913
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:43,858
I'm running expenses...

914
01:08:45,358 --> 01:08:47,858
- Your commission is...?
- 15%.

915
01:08:47,958 --> 01:08:50,357
We would do the operation today.

916
01:08:51,057 --> 01:08:54,456
How convenient.
What is the price?

917
01:08:54,556 --> 01:08:56,456
Fifty thousand, cash.

918
01:09:11,751 --> 01:09:14,050
Who do you take me for, stooge?

919
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:17,949
- Excuse me, honestly I don't...
- Cut the acting with me.

920
01:09:18,049 --> 01:09:20,949
You think I don't know
those stamps are valuable?

921
01:09:21,749 --> 01:09:24,948
What's your line of work,
swindling old ladies?

922
01:09:25,048 --> 01:09:28,247
I don't know the exact value,
and I don't care.

923
01:09:28,747 --> 01:09:31,846
Let me explain it to you.
I set a price that makes me happy.

924
01:09:31,946 --> 01:09:35,646
Whoever wants the stamps
gives me that amount...

925
01:09:35,746 --> 01:09:37,643
and he can take them.

926
01:09:37,678 --> 01:09:38,743
That's all.

927
01:09:38,843 --> 01:09:42,342
No percentages,
no down payments, no consignments.

928
01:09:42,442 --> 01:09:44,942
Whoever wants them,
pays for them and takes them.

929
01:09:46,141 --> 01:09:48,341
And what is the figure to get happiness?

930
01:09:49,341 --> 01:09:51,240
He speaks...

931
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:53,840
- Beautiful virtue.
- How much?

932
01:09:56,839 --> 01:09:59,839
Let's say... 500,000 dollars.

933
01:10:02,138 --> 01:10:03,438
Sit down.

934
01:10:10,336 --> 01:10:11,836
Look...

935
01:10:12,736 --> 01:10:14,936
That amount is too high.

936
01:10:15,535 --> 01:10:17,535
- The stamps are not worth that much.
- No?

937
01:10:17,635 --> 01:10:21,334
No. Listen...

938
01:10:22,634 --> 01:10:26,933
- I think we could reach 75,000.
- No way.

939
01:10:26,968 --> 01:10:28,933
- 450.
- 100,000.

940
01:10:29,033 --> 01:10:32,432
- 400.
- 150.

941
01:10:32,532 --> 01:10:35,831
- We should go.
- 350,000.

942
01:10:36,531 --> 01:10:38,529
- 200,000 perhaps.
- Let's go now.

943
01:10:39,728 --> 01:10:43,228
250,000 dollars.
That's final.

944
01:10:46,127 --> 01:10:48,827
If we were to bring the money today...

945
01:10:48,862 --> 01:10:51,326
would the stamps be available?

946
01:10:51,526 --> 01:10:52,726
Sure.

947
01:10:52,826 --> 01:10:56,025
- You have them here?
- That's none of your business.

948
01:10:56,125 --> 01:10:58,325
If you pay today,
you have them today.

949
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:16,719
- What is it?
- We are fucked, aren't we? This is it.

950
01:11:16,819 --> 01:11:19,718
We must go on. It'd be crazy to let go.
We must go on.

951
01:11:19,818 --> 01:11:22,318
- What d'you mean?
- Buying the stamps from the old bitch.

952
01:11:22,353 --> 01:11:27,617
- Are you nuts?
- No, she wants 250 grand.

953
01:11:27,716 --> 01:11:29,816
They are sold for 450 grand.

954
01:11:29,916 --> 01:11:32,416
One day of work,
200 grand profit.

955
01:11:32,451 --> 01:11:35,015
Where are you going to get 250 grand?

956
01:11:36,815 --> 01:11:40,412
I have some money.
I could use it.

957
01:11:41,312 --> 01:11:43,911
- 250 grand.
- No, less.

958
01:11:44,811 --> 01:11:48,510
Ah, your sister's... that thing.

959
01:11:48,910 --> 01:11:50,910
I saw an opportunity
and I grabbed it.

960
01:11:51,010 --> 01:11:52,909
I was swifter than she was, that's all.

961
01:11:52,944 --> 01:11:55,609
- Otherwise she would've done it to you.
- No doubt.

962
01:11:55,909 --> 01:11:58,408
I planned not to use it
for a year or so until...

963
01:11:58,508 --> 01:12:01,308
the whole thing calmed down,
the lawsuit forgotten.

964
01:12:01,508 --> 01:12:03,707
Then we are saved.

965
01:12:03,807 --> 01:12:08,406
We buy, we sell,
200 grand profit like you say.

966
01:12:08,506 --> 01:12:10,406
30% for me without risking a cent.

967
01:12:10,506 --> 01:12:12,305
But I don't have all the money.

968
01:12:12,805 --> 01:12:14,205
I have...

969
01:12:14,305 --> 01:12:18,204
the inheritance plus something
I can get from the lawyer...

970
01:12:18,504 --> 01:12:22,403
plus my money totals...

971
01:12:23,103 --> 01:12:24,703
200 grand.

972
01:12:26,202 --> 01:12:28,302
Where will we get the rest?

973
01:12:31,401 --> 01:12:35,001
- Well, you have 50 grand for your old man...
- You said it.

974
01:12:35,036 --> 01:12:37,000
- You are a bastard!
- Stop it!

975
01:12:37,035 --> 01:12:39,000
Son of a bitch!
D'you think I'm an asshole?

976
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:41,699
That I'll give you 50 grand,
everything I have for my dad...

977
01:12:41,797 --> 01:12:43,797
that I'll give it to you?

978
01:12:43,897 --> 01:12:46,096
For you to do business! Fuck off!

979
01:12:46,131 --> 01:12:48,796
You're nuts!
I wouldn't try to fuck you with money.

980
01:12:48,896 --> 01:12:51,395
Would I show you the way
I do business, how I work?

981
01:12:51,495 --> 01:12:55,094
- What kind of an idiot would that make me?
- A smart one.

982
01:12:55,129 --> 01:12:58,594
You arranged it with the old girl?
What does she get, 30%?

983
01:12:58,694 --> 01:13:01,393
How much does Sandler get,
less? 15%, 20%?

984
01:13:01,493 --> 01:13:03,393
- How much d'you give him?
- You're an idiot.

985
01:13:03,428 --> 01:13:05,392
You have an opportunity
and you can't see it.

986
01:13:05,492 --> 01:13:07,392
You have 200 grand!

987
01:13:07,427 --> 01:13:09,791
I have 50!
The lady wants 250!

988
01:13:09,891 --> 01:13:14,288
- Fuck you!
- Exactly, shithead. Listen. Listen.

989
01:13:14,323 --> 01:13:17,288
Nobody could invent something
like this unless it's true.

990
01:13:18,987 --> 01:13:21,087
These things happen, man.

991
01:13:21,187 --> 01:13:24,386
It's a one in a million chance.
Once in a lifetime.

992
01:13:24,421 --> 01:13:28,586
It's happening to you and me,
here and now. One in a million.

993
01:13:31,385 --> 01:13:33,285
Fuck you, asshole!

994
01:13:33,385 --> 01:13:36,584
I'll give you 50%,
whatever amount you contribute.

995
01:13:36,684 --> 01:13:37,884
Fucking hell!

996
01:14:13,674 --> 01:14:14,074
Thanks for the cigars.
You didn't forget my favorite.

997
01:14:14,109 --> 01:14:16,974
Thanks for the cigars.
You didn't forget my favorite.

998
01:14:42,668 --> 01:14:44,668
- How are you?
- Fine.

999
01:14:45,666 --> 01:14:48,265
Although I think I'd be better at home.

1000
01:14:50,964 --> 01:14:53,364
This place is full of crooks.

1001
01:14:54,064 --> 01:14:56,663
- What about the money?
- Tough.

1002
01:14:57,263 --> 01:14:59,363
I no longer have two or three months.

1003
01:15:00,063 --> 01:15:03,062
- What happened?
- Vizcardi will be inhibited...

1004
01:15:03,097 --> 01:15:05,461
an issue of venues.

1005
01:15:05,561 --> 01:15:08,061
The case will be drawn again
and anyone could be the judge.

1006
01:15:08,096 --> 01:15:10,161
Not anyone accepts a bribe.

1007
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:14,360
If I don't get the money
in ten days...

1008
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:17,057
I lose the train.

1009
01:15:17,157 --> 01:15:18,857
Only ten days?

1010
01:15:20,456 --> 01:15:24,855
Ten days... three months...
What difference does it make?

1011
01:15:26,055 --> 01:15:28,555
Where am I going to get 70,000?

1012
01:15:29,754 --> 01:15:32,454
You can't stay here, Dad.

1013
01:15:32,854 --> 01:15:34,853
- I could...
- Don't even think about it.

1014
01:15:45,151 --> 01:15:46,651
Am I losing it?

1015
01:15:49,548 --> 01:15:51,848
- Why?
- Why, what?

1016
01:15:51,948 --> 01:15:55,747
- Why can't I try to help you?
- Not the way you're thinking.

1017
01:15:57,047 --> 01:15:59,146
- Listen...
- No, you listen.

1018
01:15:59,246 --> 01:16:01,246
I told you a thousand times.

1019
01:16:01,346 --> 01:16:04,345
I've already made those mistakes.
Don't you do it again.

1020
01:16:05,745 --> 01:16:07,645
Do you think it's a game?

1021
01:16:08,344 --> 01:16:11,144
Do you think the guys
who do this are easy?

1022
01:16:12,044 --> 01:16:16,643
I got fucked a thousand times,
and you didn't see what I saw.

1023
01:16:17,743 --> 01:16:21,042
I mean it, don't be stupid.

1024
01:16:22,142 --> 01:16:24,241
Don't do anything that could land you here.

1025
01:16:43,937 --> 01:16:45,937
You wouldn't survive.

1026
01:18:34,708 --> 01:18:36,808
What must I do for you to understand?

1027
01:18:36,843 --> 01:18:41,007
If you give me a hard time,
it'll take me longer to finish my business.

1028
01:18:41,107 --> 01:18:43,206
That's it.
I'll call the police.

1029
01:18:43,241 --> 01:18:46,106
I don't know what I'll say,
but you won't stay in my hotel.

1030
01:18:46,506 --> 01:18:47,906
Your hotel?

1031
01:18:48,005 --> 01:18:50,705
Is this your hotel?
You'll call the police?

1032
01:18:50,740 --> 01:18:52,705
Wasn't it enough
to bust my balls all my life...

1033
01:18:52,804 --> 01:18:54,502
taking Mom's place
as soon as she died...

1034
01:18:54,602 --> 01:18:56,202
and now you want
to fuck me with this?

1035
01:18:56,302 --> 01:18:59,501
I'm only going to say it once. Once.

1036
01:18:59,536 --> 01:19:02,401
I'm not fucking around in your hotel.

1037
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:06,100
My hard luck is that the guy
is staying here. That's it.

1038
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:07,899
If you interfere in any way...

1039
01:19:07,934 --> 01:19:11,299
If, because of you, this falls
through, I promise I'll kill you.

1040
01:19:11,334 --> 01:19:13,898
- You don't kill people.
- You don't know me.

1041
01:19:16,997 --> 01:19:19,597
- What are you doing?
- Ah, friends!

1042
01:19:19,997 --> 01:19:23,696
You are here already.
And in good company.

1043
01:19:23,996 --> 01:19:25,994
The best in the hotel.

1044
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:30,593
- Have you met?
- We've known each other for a long time.

1045
01:19:30,628 --> 01:19:36,092
- The lady is my sister.
- Really? How interesting!

1046
01:19:36,192 --> 01:19:40,891
I'm about to close a fantastic
deal with your brother.

1047
01:19:40,926 --> 01:19:44,590
- I'm going to make you rich.
- Him, I'm sure not me.

1048
01:19:44,690 --> 01:19:47,789
Shit! I seem to notice
some tension in the air.

1049
01:19:47,824 --> 01:19:52,288
The best would be for us to go
to your room and finish our business.

1050
01:19:52,388 --> 01:19:53,788
Let us.

1051
01:19:53,888 --> 01:19:56,285
Let's finish our business, yes.

1052
01:19:58,985 --> 01:20:02,284
- You okay? Did he hurt you?
- No, he didn't hurt me. I'm okay.

1053
01:20:06,283 --> 01:20:10,482
I've just made a change
in our agreement. An addition.

1054
01:20:10,517 --> 01:20:13,382
- In the price?
- No, in the package.

1055
01:20:13,482 --> 01:20:16,581
- I want to include her.
- Valeria?

1056
01:20:16,681 --> 01:20:21,380
Valeria, yes. Knowing she's
your sister makes me hornier.

1057
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:25,879
Man, it's only one night. Tonight.

1058
01:20:26,579 --> 01:20:30,678
I've been wanting to fuck her
since I got here but I couldn't.

1059
01:20:30,713 --> 01:20:34,178
And now I can.
Do you want the money?

1060
01:20:34,278 --> 01:20:37,277
- Convince her.
- Lf she doesn't want?

1061
01:20:37,377 --> 01:20:39,077
Then the deal is off.

1062
01:20:39,177 --> 01:20:41,776
You are willing to give up
the stamps for a piece of ass?

1063
01:20:41,876 --> 01:20:44,775
More than you are willing
to give up the money.

1064
01:20:44,875 --> 01:20:48,475
Have her bring me the stamps.
But it's got to be her.

1065
01:20:48,575 --> 01:20:50,874
I won't receive anyone else.

1066
01:21:02,570 --> 01:21:04,169
What happened?

1067
01:21:13,567 --> 01:21:17,467
If it were any other woman,
I'd have 50 ways to convince her.

1068
01:21:17,667 --> 01:21:19,366
And all good.

1069
01:21:20,066 --> 01:21:23,365
But not her.
It's different with her.

1070
01:21:24,565 --> 01:21:27,664
- Valeria won't go for it.
- How do you know?

1071
01:21:28,762 --> 01:21:31,062
From what I've seen so far...

1072
01:21:31,862 --> 01:21:33,861
You like her, shithead.

1073
01:21:33,961 --> 01:21:38,560
I saw you looking at her.
You must believe she's a saint.

1074
01:21:39,460 --> 01:21:41,360
Can't you see the way
she swings her ass?

1075
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:43,159
There are no saints.

1076
01:21:47,158 --> 01:21:49,858
There are different tariffs.

1077
01:21:51,258 --> 01:21:53,257
Do you like men?

1078
01:21:55,057 --> 01:21:58,156
- Would you fuck a guy?
- No.

1079
01:22:02,153 --> 01:22:07,252
- You wouldn't fuck a guy for 10,000?
- No.

1080
01:22:07,352 --> 01:22:09,252
10,000, it's a lot of money.

1081
01:22:10,052 --> 01:22:11,551
No.

1082
01:22:12,351 --> 01:22:14,851
If I gave you 20,000?

1083
01:22:15,051 --> 01:22:17,250
- Real money. All for you.
- No.

1084
01:22:18,950 --> 01:22:21,549
- 50,000 dollars.
- No.

1085
01:22:26,348 --> 01:22:28,148
500,000.

1086
01:22:30,547 --> 01:22:32,447
You see?

1087
01:22:32,747 --> 01:22:35,746
We are not lacking pillow biters,
just financiers.

1088
01:22:42,245 --> 01:22:45,044
- Have you seen Valeria?
- Over there.

1089
01:22:54,443 --> 01:22:55,642
Valeria.

1090
01:22:55,742 --> 01:22:57,742
- I don't want to talk to you.
- Give me a minute.

1091
01:22:57,842 --> 01:23:01,239
- I don't want to listen.
- It's about our grandparents' money.

1092
01:23:03,039 --> 01:23:06,038
Chito, go get Federico.
Tell him to come.

1093
01:23:06,138 --> 01:23:09,138
- No need to bring in the kid.
- Why not? We share expenses.

1094
01:23:09,237 --> 01:23:11,537
We are roommates.
He's got a right to know.

1095
01:23:11,572 --> 01:23:13,037
To know what?

1096
01:23:13,072 --> 01:23:17,436
Whatever it is you are going
to propose. I know you.

1097
01:23:17,536 --> 01:23:20,335
What do I have that interests you?

1098
01:23:23,734 --> 01:23:25,934
I have a big deal going on
with Vidal Gandolfo.

1099
01:23:42,629 --> 01:23:45,128
What is it? You again?
What happened?

1100
01:23:45,228 --> 01:23:46,728
How are you?

1101
01:23:46,828 --> 01:23:48,927
You tell him or shall I?

1102
01:23:50,427 --> 01:23:53,626
Your brother wants me to sleep with a guy,
so that he can make a deal.

1103
01:23:53,726 --> 01:23:55,826
He wants to give me money for it.

1104
01:23:55,926 --> 01:23:57,825
- Some of the money he stole from us.
- It's not true.

1105
01:23:57,925 --> 01:24:01,625
Bastard! What do you need
to tell the truth just once?

1106
01:24:01,725 --> 01:24:05,722
- Not again. Why did you call?
- Listen to your brother's proposal.

1107
01:24:05,822 --> 01:24:07,721
This is between you and I.
Leave him out of it.

1108
01:24:07,756 --> 01:24:10,821
- He's right. Bye.
- Fede, Fede!

1109
01:24:22,618 --> 01:24:26,318
Tell him the truth.
I'll win the lawsuit.

1110
01:24:26,353 --> 01:24:29,517
I don't want money,
I want you to tell him the truth.

1111
01:24:29,617 --> 01:24:31,916
He'll decide the rest.

1112
01:24:36,415 --> 01:24:40,315
If I tell him the truth,
you'll go with Vidal?

1113
01:24:41,114 --> 01:24:42,114
Yes.

1114
01:24:44,214 --> 01:24:46,613
And how do I know you'll do your part?

1115
01:24:48,013 --> 01:24:50,413
Give me your word.

1116
01:24:50,812 --> 01:24:53,212
That has always been your weak spot.

1117
01:24:53,912 --> 01:24:56,411
I give you my word.

1118
01:25:04,908 --> 01:25:06,707
Fede, come!

1119
01:25:12,406 --> 01:25:14,006
Now what?

1120
01:25:14,906 --> 01:25:18,405
Are you sure?
The truth can hurt.

1121
01:25:22,204 --> 01:25:24,803
It's a complicated matter.

1122
01:25:24,903 --> 01:25:27,703
Your sister is right
about our grandparent's estate.

1123
01:25:28,803 --> 01:25:32,002
My lawyer blocked the estate in Italy...

1124
01:25:32,102 --> 01:25:34,801
and submitted me as the only heir.

1125
01:25:35,101 --> 01:25:37,599
We bribed some officers...

1126
01:25:38,499 --> 01:25:40,698
and split the money.

1127
01:25:40,898 --> 01:25:42,298
Don't give me that.

1128
01:25:47,297 --> 01:25:48,996
Tell me it's not true.

1129
01:25:49,896 --> 01:25:52,096
I'd love to but I can't.

1130
01:25:53,795 --> 01:25:57,095
That thing about the middle man
in Italy stealing the money, the taxes?

1131
01:25:57,195 --> 01:25:58,594
I didn't want you to find out...

1132
01:25:58,694 --> 01:26:01,394
That my big brother robbed me
and lied to me.

1133
01:26:01,794 --> 01:26:03,593
It was a lot of money.

1134
01:26:03,893 --> 01:26:06,293
What's that about screwing a guy?

1135
01:26:06,328 --> 01:26:08,290
She's a grown-up,
she knows what she's doing, Fede.

1136
01:26:08,325 --> 01:26:09,590
Don't call me Fede.

1137
01:26:10,390 --> 01:26:12,290
Don't call me anything.

1138
01:26:19,288 --> 01:26:21,388
That's it then.

1139
01:26:21,488 --> 01:26:22,987
Go to Vidal's.
Remember...

1140
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:09,276
Make sure the money is good.

1141
01:27:09,476 --> 01:27:13,475
And count it.
I don't want to be screwed.

1142
01:27:14,075 --> 01:27:16,274
Then put it here.

1143
01:27:45,066 --> 01:27:47,966
Let's go downstairs.
What can we do here?

1144
01:28:31,355 --> 01:28:32,955
Hey, hey!

1145
01:28:52,950 --> 01:28:55,250
- Is she out?
- No.

1146
01:28:56,750 --> 01:28:58,649
- Did you sleep at all?
- No.

1147
01:28:58,749 --> 01:29:01,249
Not everybody is so lucky
to have a clean conscience.

1148
01:29:01,349 --> 01:29:02,648
What?

1149
01:29:45,336 --> 01:29:47,835
- Watch it, man.
- Vidal... Vidal!

1150
01:29:47,870 --> 01:29:51,334
My dear friend, you came
to say goodbye. Nice gesture.

1151
01:29:51,434 --> 01:29:55,733
- The money...
- The girl's got it like I told you.

1152
01:29:55,833 --> 01:29:58,233
By the way, I don't know
what her cut is in this...

1153
01:29:58,268 --> 01:30:00,532
but whatever it is, it's not enough.

1154
01:30:00,632 --> 01:30:03,632
- What a woman!
- Mr. Vidal...

1155
01:30:04,132 --> 01:30:06,331
No, he can't leave.
She hasn't come down yet...

1156
01:30:06,431 --> 01:30:08,031
- Hear that?
- Vidal...

1157
01:30:08,131 --> 01:30:10,031
This is fun. I can't leave!

1158
01:30:10,130 --> 01:30:13,130
"The girl hasn't come down yet."
I can't leave?

1159
01:30:37,223 --> 01:30:39,023
A check?

1160
01:30:45,321 --> 01:30:48,820
A check? You are such
an asshole! What is it?

1161
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:51,320
The guy is hung like a horse?
How can you take a check?

1162
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:53,320
A registered check.

1163
01:30:53,420 --> 01:30:56,719
A check certified by the bank.
It's the same as cash.

1164
01:30:56,819 --> 01:30:59,618
I know what a certified check is.
He didn't have time to do it.

1165
01:30:59,653 --> 01:31:01,618
He fixed the price yesterday afternoon.

1166
01:31:01,653 --> 01:31:04,317
He had several
checks with different figures.

1167
01:31:04,352 --> 01:31:06,817
He must have fixed yours
considering the checks he had.

1168
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:11,816
He had one for 600 and another for 650.

1169
01:31:12,516 --> 01:31:15,915
- You came out cheap.
- How do you know that?

1170
01:31:15,950 --> 01:31:18,812
The hotel has
an executive assistance service.

1171
01:31:19,012 --> 01:31:22,911
- We did it for him.
- The same as cash.

1172
01:31:34,409 --> 01:31:36,709
It's 45 minutes before the bank opens.

1173
01:31:36,809 --> 01:31:39,408
Have a drink.
I have to make a couple of calls.

1174
01:31:47,106 --> 01:31:51,104
- It's over.
- This will never be over.

1175
01:31:51,903 --> 01:31:55,403
- No, I referred to this business.
- Me too.

1176
01:31:57,502 --> 01:32:01,401
- How is Federico?
- He'll be fine.

1177
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:13,699
- It's the Banco Sudamericano de Crédito.
- I've noticed.

1178
01:32:13,799 --> 01:32:16,098
A friend of mine works there.
Not a friend.

1179
01:32:16,133 --> 01:32:19,696
A guy I once did a favor to.
I put him into business.

1180
01:32:19,796 --> 01:32:24,195
I wanted to say something.
I wanted to apologize.

1181
01:32:25,594 --> 01:32:28,094
- Why?
- Because I didn't trust you.

1182
01:32:28,294 --> 01:32:30,693
The truth is I thought you were fucking me.

1183
01:32:46,090 --> 01:32:47,790
I wanted...

1184
01:32:49,590 --> 01:32:51,789
to thank you.

1185
01:32:52,589 --> 01:32:54,489
After all...

1186
01:32:58,188 --> 01:33:00,387
You're welcome.

1187
01:33:25,580 --> 01:33:28,180
I forgot the cigarettes.
Wait.

1188
01:33:38,177 --> 01:33:39,777
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

1189
01:33:52,373 --> 01:33:53,872
Let's go.

1190
01:33:57,072 --> 01:34:00,971
- I thought the bank was nearby.
- It's not that bad.

1191
01:34:01,471 --> 01:34:04,470
Turco, son of a bitch.
It serves him right for disappearing.

1192
01:34:04,570 --> 01:34:06,670
He'll want to die when he finds out.

1193
01:34:07,469 --> 01:34:10,469
- We're a good pair, you and I.
- Yes, but no.

1194
01:34:10,869 --> 01:34:14,268
- We settle the numbers, collect and that's it.
- Really?

1195
01:34:14,368 --> 01:34:18,467
Yes, sir. It's over.
We split the cash and that's it.

1196
01:34:18,567 --> 01:34:20,667
You're offended because
I made you make a fortune?

1197
01:34:20,767 --> 01:34:23,264
- You and I are different, Marcos.
- Different?

1198
01:34:23,864 --> 01:34:26,264
Of course we are.
You know what the difference is?

1199
01:34:26,364 --> 01:34:30,063
I can handle what I do.
You're afraid of being singled out.

1200
01:34:30,763 --> 01:34:32,962
Do you think you are better than I am?

1201
01:34:32,997 --> 01:34:35,462
You are the worst kind.
You are a coward.

1202
01:34:35,497 --> 01:34:37,361
You want the money but you
don't want to get your hands dirty.

1203
01:34:37,461 --> 01:34:38,961
Do you know the difference?

1204
01:34:39,061 --> 01:34:40,961
To be a bastard
you need guts.

1205
01:34:41,060 --> 01:34:43,660
To be a real bastard...

1206
01:34:45,660 --> 01:34:49,259
No, wait, Castrito,
let me explain. Please!

1207
01:34:49,859 --> 01:34:51,958
Over there.
Come!

1208
01:34:52,058 --> 01:34:53,458
Get in there!

1209
01:34:55,358 --> 01:34:59,357
Let me explain! I was going
to pay you! My mother got sick.

1210
01:34:59,392 --> 01:35:01,956
- Your mother is dead!
- Right, she got sick and died...

1211
01:35:02,056 --> 01:35:03,756
Shut up! Piece of shit!

1212
01:35:03,856 --> 01:35:06,055
For a year you've been giving me
the same old story!

1213
01:35:06,155 --> 01:35:08,155
I want my money, now!
Or I'll fuck you up!

1214
01:35:08,255 --> 01:35:11,954
- Please, I beg you!
- Stop begging! I want my money now.

1215
01:35:12,054 --> 01:35:14,154
Or I'll kill you like a dog.

1216
01:35:16,453 --> 01:35:17,753
Kid...

1217
01:35:30,348 --> 01:35:31,948
Are you kidding?

1218
01:35:32,448 --> 01:35:34,847
You want to get killed for a fucking check?

1219
01:35:34,947 --> 01:35:37,547
The thing is...
What did you do with the money?

1220
01:35:39,546 --> 01:35:43,446
I hid it. I didn't want
to risk being robbed again.

1221
01:35:44,445 --> 01:35:47,745
- Give it to me.
- No, if you kill me, there's no money.

1222
01:35:49,144 --> 01:35:51,344
- Then I'll kill him.
- Go ahead.

1223
01:35:51,444 --> 01:35:54,543
- Please!
- I'll kill him.

1224
01:35:56,141 --> 01:35:57,941
- Shit happens.
- Juan!

1225
01:35:58,241 --> 01:35:59,740
- No.
- No?

1226
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:01,940
- No.
- Why?

1227
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:04,939
- Because he said "fucking check".
- What?

1228
01:36:05,039 --> 01:36:08,138
- You said "check" instead of dough".
- I didn't say check.

1229
01:36:08,238 --> 01:36:11,138
- Yes, you did.
- I didn't say check.

1230
01:36:11,238 --> 01:36:15,237
Yes, you said check.
Goddamn you!

1231
01:36:15,937 --> 01:36:18,536
You called me on short notice.
I had no time to prepare.

1232
01:36:18,636 --> 01:36:22,336
Fuck off, nitwit!
You are an asshole, get out!

1233
01:36:22,735 --> 01:36:25,235
And my fifty?
I need fifty to pay for the gun.

1234
01:36:25,335 --> 01:36:29,932
Shove that gun up your ass.
Fucking shithead!

1235
01:36:30,932 --> 01:36:33,331
Do you understand why I need you?

1236
01:36:45,929 --> 01:36:48,628
Why do you give me that
raped virgin's look? What is it?

1237
01:36:48,928 --> 01:36:51,228
You know my business.
What did you expect?

1238
01:36:51,528 --> 01:36:53,427
A miracle.

1239
01:37:03,025 --> 01:37:05,325
Let's go.
The bank is already open.

1240
01:37:05,425 --> 01:37:08,524
- I carry the check.
- No... the deal is mine.

1241
01:37:08,624 --> 01:37:11,423
Give me the check.

1242
01:38:08,408 --> 01:38:10,707
Cárdenas! Cárdenas!

1243
01:38:20,905 --> 01:38:23,505
- What happened, Cárdenas?
- What are you doing here?

1244
01:38:23,604 --> 01:38:24,904
You're lucky.

1245
01:38:24,939 --> 01:38:27,004
At any other time I'd have gone out
and beaten the hell out of you.

1246
01:38:27,104 --> 01:38:29,403
I'll give it back to you. A problem
with my accountant. What happened?

1247
01:38:30,201 --> 01:38:35,100
We were all royally screwed.
We found out this morning.

1248
01:38:35,300 --> 01:38:38,000
They held as long as possible,
and when the going got rough...

1249
01:38:38,099 --> 01:38:40,199
they sold all the assets and took off.

1250
01:38:40,234 --> 01:38:41,299
- Who?
- The Board.

1251
01:38:41,399 --> 01:38:44,498
All eleven.
They took 135 million.

1252
01:38:46,598 --> 01:38:49,997
The Central Bank did know
but they only took part today.

1253
01:38:50,797 --> 01:38:53,396
- I've got to go.
- Wait... Come. This is good?

1254
01:38:56,196 --> 01:38:59,295
- Wow! What are you into?
- Cárdenas! Is it good or not?

1255
01:39:00,495 --> 01:39:03,394
Maybe. But what difference
does it make?

1256
01:39:05,094 --> 01:39:07,293
Wait...
This is for you?

1257
01:39:13,892 --> 01:39:16,392
You were going to cash this?

1258
01:39:18,591 --> 01:39:21,191
You'll have to shove it
up your ass, Marquitos.

1259
01:42:07,346 --> 01:42:08,846
Hey...

1260
01:42:57,034 --> 01:43:00,133
- How many?
- Give me two.

1261
01:43:00,233 --> 01:43:03,033
- None for me.
- Who said you could use my chips?

1262
01:43:03,133 --> 01:43:05,832
- NI NE QUEENS
- Not yours, your father's.

1263
01:43:05,932 --> 01:43:09,731
- Don't interrupt.
- Are you tired, Sebastian, or in a bad mood?

1264
01:43:09,831 --> 01:43:12,331
Boris, at the theatre
do you also drink that much?

1265
01:43:12,631 --> 01:43:16,630
Know what? I do a better
Spaniard when drunk.

1266
01:43:18,230 --> 01:43:21,929
The guy from the bank called,
the one who tipped you about the closing.

1267
01:43:22,029 --> 01:43:23,429
Cárdenas?

1268
01:43:24,228 --> 01:43:28,128
Yes, he says he'll come
to collect later today.

1269
01:43:28,927 --> 01:43:31,527
- What about Turco?
- He also called.

1270
01:43:31,562 --> 01:43:34,926
He wants to know if he can stay
another week with your cousin.

1271
01:43:45,422 --> 01:43:48,021
What are you staring at?

1272
01:43:54,420 --> 01:43:56,820
You were scared, kid.

1273
01:43:58,119 --> 01:43:59,819
Never.

1274
01:44:00,119 --> 01:44:02,918
By any chance,
do you remember a song by...

1275
01:44:02,953 --> 01:44:07,717
Rita Pavone, a song they used
for a film a long time ago?

1276
01:44:10,415 --> 01:44:12,414
Come on, Berta.

1277
01:44:31,810 --> 01:44:34,510
Nice kiss you gave me
at the hotel.

1278
01:44:35,310 --> 01:44:37,309
I couldn't help it.

1279
01:44:44,006 --> 01:44:46,805
- Happy first anniversary.
- Isn't it too much?

1280
01:44:46,905 --> 01:44:49,005
- It's yours.
- And yours.

1281
01:44:49,105 --> 01:44:51,704
- Minus expenses?
- What?

1282
01:44:53,204 --> 01:44:55,104
Nothing, nothing...

1283
01:44:57,003 --> 01:44:58,803
And this?

1284
01:45:00,902 --> 01:45:02,902
It belonged to my mother.

1285
01:45:02,937 --> 01:45:05,101
My grandmother gave it to her.

1286
01:45:05,136 --> 01:45:07,301
It's been in the family for...

1287
01:45:07,501 --> 01:45:09,801
a hundred years.

1288
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:12,200
I remembered!

1289
01:45:12,300 --> 01:45:13,200
I remembered it!
