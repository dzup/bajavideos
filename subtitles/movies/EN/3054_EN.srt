4
00:00:41,915 --> 00:00:45,315
Want to dance?
May I join you?

5
00:00:46,816 --> 00:00:50,550
That's pretty sexy.
-- I love it.

6
00:00:51,821 --> 00:00:55,189
You could also as a must have.
Little weight on the shoulders, ladies.

7
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,296
Try more.
Feels good, right?

8
00:01:02,717 --> 00:01:06,798
Follow me to the checkout ladies.

9
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:09,436
You look like you're smoking weed.

10
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:12,181
You can smoke it or buy one of these TVs.
Philips is well ...

11
00:01:12,282 --> 00:01:17,645
You are high, feeling good, Samsung
fashioned Megafox, that's an explosion.

12
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:22,764
So stoned that you will feel good.
If you want small, I have this.

13
00:01:22,765 --> 00:01:27,170
Watch this one.
Hi, Joan, what are you doing?

14
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:30,248
I do not know, how are you?
-- I'm great.

15
00:01:38,062 --> 00:01:41,337
You're so bad.

16
00:01:53,105 --> 00:01:56,473
Grab my ticket but.

17
00:01:58,483 --> 00:02:01,318
Grab my ticket but.

18
00:02:12,462 --> 00:02:15,306
Sorry, Joan.

19
00:02:18,191 --> 00:02:21,933
Press them.
Harder.

20
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,999
What are you doing?
-- Feel that once.

21
00:02:29,624 --> 00:02:32,250
We can not do.
Jerry is out there.

22
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:34,899
Then he can watch.

23
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,987
What makes you so damn sexy.

24
00:02:42,464 --> 00:02:47,105
You have no more than 80 watts
for a living.

25
00:02:47,504 --> 00:02:50,457
Sorry.

26
00:02:53,451 --> 00:02:56,915
Harder.

27
00:02:58,939 --> 00:03:04,023
Fucking asshole.
Christy, what ails you?

28
00:03:04,024 --> 00:03:07,014
How can I ever trust you?
-- I do not know. I'm sorry.

29
00:03:07,339 --> 00:03:10,618
Fujitsu makes the same
for $ 40 cheaper.

30
00:03:10,619 --> 00:03:13,655
Really?
-- They sell them here.

31
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:16,287
I can get him for you,
if you want.

32
00:03:16,603 --> 00:03:20,118
Is everything okay with you?

33
00:03:22,422 --> 00:03:25,027
Give me your number I'll let you know
when I got him.

34
00:03:25,028 --> 00:03:28,468
What's your name?
You have beautiful eyes.

35
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:33,271
Never come here anymore.

36
00:03:33,272 --> 00:03:36,350
You owe me commission of
$ 54,000 for second ...

37
00:03:36,351 --> 00:03:40,076
counterfeit, gray market, fake brand,
to expensive equipment, asshole.

38
00:03:40,077 --> 00:03:44,528
I'll kill you bastard.
-- Send it. Christy knows the address.

39
00:03:45,231 --> 00:03:48,640
Amber.
4346603.

40
00:03:52,336 --> 00:03:55,587
Tell Daddy at how a hospital
Chicago really is.

41
00:03:55,588 --> 00:03:59,743
A patient brought in with chills
nausea, asemia, clearly in shock.

42
00:03:59,744 --> 00:04:03,299
Did you complete blood count done?
-- Our protocols did not exist ...

43
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,573
when you studied medicine.
-- 30 years I've been under a rock.

44
00:04:07,707 --> 00:04:10,568
How do you intubations subcutaneous
personally done?

45
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:16,606
I teach, I touch patients anymore.
-- Patient touch?

46
00:04:16,782 --> 00:04:20,062
Why would anyone want to do?
-- You must not participate in this conversation.

47
00:04:20,063 --> 00:04:22,703
I've had more patients than you ever
'll have.

48
00:04:22,704 --> 00:04:25,918
Can I drink thrown over your head?
-- What's wrong with rich?

49
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,264
That will no longer medicine.
-- There he right.

50
00:04:29,265 --> 00:04:33,140
Help is not to justify his laziness.
-- I myself have done ...

51
00:04:33,141 --> 00:04:36,723
and that called for $ 35,000,000
my first trip to the fair.

52
00:04:36,724 --> 00:04:39,709
Jamie, help me.
-- He's a geek who got lucky.

53
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,843
A geek and always will be.
-- The geek takes your shares back.

54
00:04:44,344 --> 00:04:47,375
I do not blame you. The action
was ruined when they allowed women.

55
00:04:47,376 --> 00:04:49,969
I'll kill you both.
-- I'll kill you all ...

56
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:54,140
if you do not go in and sit down.
-- And we should all shares.

57
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:10,953
Josh on the sale of his company.
Whatever it may do.

58
00:05:10,954 --> 00:05:16,313
Long live Medical Software.
-- And to all, stopping too early, students.

59
00:05:16,314 --> 00:05:18,998
You better give away some money.
-- Will not happen.

60
00:05:18,999 --> 00:05:24,357
What are you doing today, Jamie?
-- Jamie sells high--quality stereo equipment.

61
00:05:26,204 --> 00:05:28,743
Not anymore.

62
00:05:29,476 --> 00:05:34,503
What do you mean?
-- Jamie had a little problem with the pipe.

63
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:43,090
I thought you were in the property Sat
-- I'm looking for other opportunities.

64
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:46,383
We live by the greatest
prosperity phase in the history ...

65
00:05:46,384 --> 00:05:49,253
and my brother decides to resign.

66
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:54,134
Josh had it with me
pharmaceutical sales.

67
00:05:54,135 --> 00:05:57,987
Pharmaceutical sales?

68
00:05:57,988 --> 00:06:02,426
Medicines so that people better.
Timmy Do you remember? My roommate from Brown?

69
00:06:02,427 --> 00:06:04,575
He is a consultant at Pfizer
So I said to Jamie ...

70
00:06:04,576 --> 00:06:07,707
Jamie, if you suck me and I'll make
you an interview.

71
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:11,392
Watch what you say.
-- I said no, Mama.

72
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:17,703
Why a medical representative
want to be?

73
00:06:17,704 --> 00:06:21,930
Because that is the only job in America
you earn $ 100,000 per year.

74
00:06:21,931 --> 00:06:25,961
These people come into our office with their bags
and samples as a door to door salesman.

75
00:06:25,996 --> 00:06:30,165
Indeed they are, only what they sell
They provide 78 trillion per year.

76
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:33,507
And take a decision on drugs
and influence through advertising ...

77
00:06:33,508 --> 00:06:35,846
I sell the patient nothing.

78
00:06:35,847 --> 00:06:39,301
The patients see advertising on TV and requirements
which brand medications ...

79
00:06:39,302 --> 00:06:47,437
the doctors and you must deliver that to them.
-- If you are not barbarians quiet ...

80
00:06:47,438 --> 00:06:53,370
lamb and eat it, no one gets
of you the chocolate cake.

81
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,754
Yes, Mama.

82
00:07:04,429 --> 00:07:08,047
If you could make money by fucking
would you still richer than me.

83
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,919
Pfizer guy who I'll call tomorrow morning.

84
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,694
Let us welcome the class of 1997.

85
00:07:27,668 --> 00:07:32,339
This is not a pill. This is
tens of millions of dollars on research.

86
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,674
This is one thousand hours of hard work.

87
00:07:35,675 --> 00:07:39,190
This, ladies and gentlemen, is software.

88
00:07:39,191 --> 00:07:41,779
Your training will last six weeks.

89
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:45,120
You go away as fully qualified
healthcare professional.

90
00:07:45,445 --> 00:07:49,440
33% of your telephone calls
for four hours, which are 32% less evil ...

91
00:07:49,441 --> 00:07:53,664
Your job will be,
'Fight against the diseases.

92
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:12,759
Income from off--label use
not yet approved by the FDA.

93
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:17,126
You can raise through the sale of
to indicate where it can be used.

94
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,073
If you prescribe Zithromax ...

95
00:08:20,976 --> 00:08:25,427
Hello, Doctor.
Zithromax prescribing ...

96
00:08:26,285 --> 00:08:29,956
Zoloft, a drug approved only
as a treatment for depression.

97
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:35,172
Off--label use, alcoholism, bulimia,
PMS, smoking ...

98
00:08:35,173 --> 00:08:39,179
social phobia.
Is there a question?

99
00:08:41,538 --> 00:08:45,605
Zoloft has been associated with ideas
for teenagers to commit suicide.

100
00:08:45,606 --> 00:08:48,092
Unproven.
-- Proven, but not reported.

101
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,474
Your job will be to this technology
sharing.

102
00:08:52,937 --> 00:08:56,673
It will be your job to life
to make it.

103
00:08:56,888 --> 00:09:00,162
The healthcare industry is today
Worth 2.3 trillion per year.

104
00:09:00,244 --> 00:09:02,880
The top ten pharmaceutical companies
earn more money ...

105
00:09:02,881 --> 00:09:08,019
than all the other 490
Fortune 500 companies combined.

106
00:09:08,055 --> 00:09:11,002
Which is part of Feldene?
-- Non steroids ...

107
00:09:11,038 --> 00:09:14,207
Non--inflammatory drugs and steroids.

108
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:20,518
A better world, why we are here.

109
00:09:23,989 --> 00:09:26,921
Xanax, New England.

110
00:09:27,502 --> 00:09:31,749
And what about you?
-- Zoloft and Zithromax in Ohio.

111
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,845
Welcome to Pfizer.

112
00:09:46,626 --> 00:09:51,425
What are you thinking?
-- Money.

113
00:09:53,831 --> 00:09:58,408
Please note that we do not sell oatmeal cookies
for Girl Guides.

114
00:09:58,409 --> 00:10:01,852
You're not the Avon lady.
Do you understand what I say?

115
00:10:02,426 --> 00:10:05,341
It's hardcore sale
and you have a quotas.

116
00:10:05,342 --> 00:10:07,850
And people in the office to keep quotas.

117
00:10:07,851 --> 00:10:12,444
Your calls, your mileage, your receipts
and how often you masturbate.

118
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,048
What is the quota for masturbation?

119
00:10:15,725 --> 00:10:19,265
But you masturbate as many times as you want,
as long as you make lots of money.

120
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:25,434
Remember, hospitals may not
accept any gifts.

121
00:10:25,435 --> 00:10:29,349
It does not mean we doctors dry
walk from their car can give.

122
00:10:31,345 --> 00:10:34,446
There he is. Only this moment counts.
Keep your head in the game.

123
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,211
Remember, Pfizer makes his life better.
Pfizer makes the patients happier ...

124
00:10:38,212 --> 00:10:41,371
So he deserves more money.
Wait, the pins.

125
00:10:41,372 --> 00:10:45,463
Always let them get away with a pen.
Gifts represent reciprocity.

126
00:10:47,435 --> 00:10:52,226
Jamie Randall Pfizer. How are you?
-- No, thanks.

127
00:10:52,261 --> 00:10:55,468
It's wet outside, I want your immune system
not compromise ...

128
00:10:55,469 --> 00:10:58,503
let's have about Zithromax.
-- What part of 'no thanks' do not you understand?

129
00:10:58,504 --> 00:11:01,279
Do you have a pen?
-- No, thanks.

130
00:11:04,024 --> 00:11:07,829
33% of your calls to four hours
so I want to talk to you about Zithromax.

131
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:12,333
If we give people antibiotics when they sneeze
and that do not work for viruses.

132
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:15,012
What is your name?
What we do ...

133
00:11:15,013 --> 00:11:18,542
What you do is create classes
drug--resistant super germs ...

134
00:11:18,543 --> 00:11:22,379
and that's not good for business.
After you create stronger antibiotics ...

135
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:26,513
and thus you ruin people's immune systems.
Thank you.

136
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:41,118
Models, beauty queens ...

137
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:44,278
Roman princesses.

138
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:47,438
Have not you heard?
They're renting striptease dancers.

139
00:11:47,439 --> 00:11:50,190
I heard that.

140
00:11:53,906 --> 00:11:55,484
Hi, Lisa.

141
00:11:57,882 --> 00:12:00,961
Her name is not Lisa.
-- I know.

142
00:12:00,962 --> 00:12:04,503
But, if I every time "Hello Lisa" say
she'll come to me eventually ...

143
00:12:04,504 --> 00:12:08,102
then she says, "my name's not Lisa"
but Jennifer or something.

144
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:14,581
I offer apologies and say "I thought you
Lisa was the one who is angry because I was not called. "

145
00:12:14,582 --> 00:12:19,638
And then that Jennifer or so I think
was dating a girl who looked like her.

146
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:23,098
Then she unconscious need to get
my approval.

147
00:12:23,099 --> 00:12:26,200
Then it's a cinch.

148
00:12:29,696 --> 00:12:33,221
Etiquette is a drug salesman at a time.
Fuck the etiquette.

149
00:12:33,222 --> 00:12:35,460
Competing medical representatives are
not your friends.

150
00:12:35,461 --> 00:12:38,737
Knight. Where you going?

151
00:12:38,738 --> 00:12:41,792
Knight is the doctor, here is the largest
group in the city ...

152
00:12:41,793 --> 00:12:45,289
fuck up a lot of students Prozac
who should use Zoloft.

153
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:48,341
Take donuts with you always?
-- Selling Drugs similar to dating.

154
00:12:48,342 --> 00:12:51,388
They want you to take them along to dinner
and pretend you expect nothing in return.

155
00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:54,141
No one has sex without investment.
-- Exactly.

156
00:12:54,176 --> 00:12:58,014
Gail, how are you?

157
00:13:05,755 --> 00:13:08,481
People who become ill.

158
00:13:08,482 --> 00:13:14,060
There is a reason that we half test.
Unbelievable.

159
00:13:14,096 --> 00:13:17,277
That's him.
Another time.

160
00:13:19,178 --> 00:13:22,708
If we have not within five minutes
can, we're leaving. Only losers wait.

161
00:13:23,348 --> 00:13:26,018
There he is.
-- Hello, beautiful. How are you?

162
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:31,669
Come here, Trey.
-- Two tickets for La Boheme on the 19th.

163
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:34,710
I hate you. Can not you go
instead of my husband?

164
00:13:34,743 --> 00:13:39,312
Trey Hannigan, Lilly's Prozac drug salesman.
Top ten. The devil.

165
00:13:39,313 --> 00:13:41,555
He is on the phone with Watson.
You can go in there.

166
00:13:41,556 --> 00:13:44,230
He is the reason that our quota
Never take for Zoloft.

167
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:49,224
Will he go in?
-- What a dick.

168
00:13:49,225 --> 00:13:53,345
5% profit every month if we can show
we go to the promised land.

169
00:13:53,537 --> 00:13:56,808
The promised land?
-- Chicago.

170
00:13:56,809 --> 00:14:02,060
Civilization, culture, and not coincidentally,
my wife and children.

171
00:14:02,061 --> 00:14:04,226
Only the greats and near greats
get Chicago.

172
00:14:04,227 --> 00:14:06,849
I feel that you and
you swinging dick ...

173
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:10,417
my card will have to
the honor division.

174
00:14:20,322 --> 00:14:23,775
The doctor sees new medical sales
only if they bring a lunch.

175
00:14:23,776 --> 00:14:27,442
Here is a list of available dates,
the next was about five weeks.

176
00:14:27,443 --> 00:14:31,867
Here is a list of approved food.
No sushi, no salads.

177
00:14:31,868 --> 00:14:34,444
No salads.
-- Give me your samples only.

178
00:14:36,282 --> 00:14:39,735
Five weeks.
-- You will find me like it.

179
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:42,728
Excuse me?
-- Everybody does, sooner or later.

180
00:14:42,729 --> 00:14:46,040
You know why? I do everything
for that to happen.

181
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,908
You can train me well.
What's your name?

182
00:14:48,943 --> 00:14:51,722
Gail. Five weeks.
-- Gail, that's not fair.

183
00:14:51,723 --> 00:14:54,686
I would expose myself, I'll let you
my real vulnerable side.

184
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:57,931
And now you work against me.

185
00:14:57,932 --> 00:15:00,986
That's not fair!
-- Do you feel out here.

186
00:15:01,689 --> 00:15:04,029
Angels of Mercy watch you sometimes.
How do the doctors ...

187
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,520
What do you want?

188
00:15:06,521 --> 00:15:09,083
Sample somewhere that I should resign
where he will see them.

189
00:15:09,084 --> 00:15:12,967
Otherwise you throw them away when I'm gone.

190
00:15:17,621 --> 00:15:21,312
Gail, no sushi no salads.

191
00:15:33,563 --> 00:15:35,746
Who you are embedded?

192
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,557
Do you know that if you prescribe Zithromax
diarrhea caused by an ear infection ...

193
00:15:39,558 --> 00:15:42,627
Do you have a pen?

194
00:15:58,105 --> 00:16:01,658
Well, knight in shining armor,
your time is over.

195
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:06,458
That is a long handle.
-- Want a pen?

196
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:08,835
Thanks.
-- Purple.

197
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:37,045
I got something for you.
There is another one.

198
00:16:37,046 --> 00:16:39,721
For you too.

199
00:16:40,068 --> 00:16:45,503
These pins, which have small buttons ...

200
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,957
and if you press too hard ...

201
00:16:48,261 --> 00:16:51,372
Hello, beautiful.

202
00:16:51,373 --> 00:16:54,326
How beautiful.

203
00:17:12,926 --> 00:17:16,109
This used to work in the past
for you, but I lay it out here ...

204
00:17:16,304 --> 00:17:19,489
I am for one reason
become a medical representative ...

205
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:21,798
doctors to meet.

206
00:17:21,899 --> 00:17:24,887
Befriend doctors,
multiplied by doctors.

207
00:17:26,176 --> 00:17:30,936
If you see me next time
do not ask for a favor, that's embarrassing.

208
00:17:34,151 --> 00:17:38,116
I like Chicago.
This does not happen now.

209
00:17:38,117 --> 00:17:42,579
You're 20% below your quota Z.
and 45% below your quota for Zoloft.

210
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,701
If you want to lose me, there is your answer.

211
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:51,237
By him taking Prozac infants
and dogs ...

212
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:53,836
and stones when they pay cash.

213
00:17:54,233 --> 00:17:58,248
If a doctor for Zoloft should
writing, that the guy next to him.

214
00:17:58,999 --> 00:18:01,555
Knight. Hannigan's buddy.

215
00:18:01,962 --> 00:18:04,639
If he would write,
follow the rest of the doctors.

216
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,117
And, Windy City, here we come.

217
00:18:11,494 --> 00:18:13,739
I'm very late.
-- $ 1,000.

218
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,907
Excuse me?
-- A check for $ 1,000.

219
00:18:16,908 --> 00:18:19,818
What?
-- A Pfizer voucher and ...

220
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,833
your shadow to know your practice
so doctors and better service.

221
00:18:23,552 --> 00:18:26,639
Buy me about?
-- No, Doctor.

222
00:18:26,847 --> 00:18:31,065
It is a special voucher Pfizer,
for me to shadow you.

223
00:18:32,318 --> 00:18:36,473
Is this a joke?
-- If you believe than $ 1,000 a joke?

224
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:41,128
That is 33% of your calls
for four hours.

225
00:18:41,129 --> 00:18:44,494
I would earn much more per year
If I was a paid consultant.

226
00:18:44,495 --> 00:18:46,526
We can talk to them about.

227
00:18:46,527 --> 00:18:49,124
I give five trillion a year
to marketing ...

228
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:54,966
instead of me flying to Cancun
for a conference or other nonsense.

229
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,234
Give me half of that money in cash.

230
00:18:57,335 --> 00:19:00,521
Mrs. Petney is on the phone
her daughter Friday that thing ...

231
00:19:00,522 --> 00:19:03,844
they do 'Bye, bye birdy', she plays Kim, she
asks if you want to give antibiotics.

232
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,879
Of course.
Why not.

233
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,580
This can not be good.

234
00:19:10,581 --> 00:19:12,799
A 26 year--old has Parkinson's medications
Need help?

235
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,819
Beth who has been there between.

236
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:20,900
If the patient asks a question, you are a trainee.
-- Can I take notes?

237
00:19:21,724 --> 00:19:24,333
Of course.
Why not.

238
00:19:25,086 --> 00:19:27,735
I am Dr. Knight.
-- Maggie Murdog.

239
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:32,545
In your case is
'Kind of emergency ".

240
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:37,355
There is yesterday broke into me and they
I have included Parkinson's medications.

241
00:19:37,356 --> 00:19:40,464
But my symptoms are well today ...

242
00:19:40,465 --> 00:19:42,537
it is a kind of emergency.

243
00:19:42,538 --> 00:19:45,493
I know your medical representative, and when Hannigan
Cindy has put me in between.

244
00:19:45,494 --> 00:19:48,908
Yes, Trey is a great guy.
-- I would not say.

245
00:19:52,075 --> 00:19:57,187
Monotherapy?
-- Sinemet CR 50 mg twice a day ...

246
00:19:57,188 --> 00:19:59,930
Domperidone and nausea at the
10 mg three times daily ...

247
00:19:59,985 --> 00:20:03,474
Artane tremor at 2 mg
tablet three times daily a whole ...

248
00:20:03,475 --> 00:20:08,409
Prozac and that I am not really depressed that
I have a degenerative disease in 26 years.

249
00:20:08,557 --> 00:20:10,781
40 mg once in the morning.

250
00:20:10,782 --> 00:20:13,960
Zoloft has fewer side effects.

251
00:20:13,961 --> 00:20:17,379
Who are you?

252
00:20:19,673 --> 00:20:22,417
Trainee.

253
00:20:23,862 --> 00:20:27,548
So early Parkinson's.
That's pretty rare.

254
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:31,412
At first they thought it was a vibration.
When Wilson's disease ...

255
00:20:31,449 --> 00:20:36,449
as Huntington's, when they gave me
the MES test, PSP, syphilis.

256
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,694
I was glad that it was negative.

257
00:20:39,695 --> 00:20:42,909
I would not like to be a slut 19th century.

258
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:47,617
Then there was the brain tumor.
That was very frightening.

259
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:53,302
And six months searching for foreign tissue,
proved to be good old Parkinson.

260
00:20:53,639 --> 00:20:56,993
Exactly.
Do not have a neurologist?

261
00:20:57,776 --> 00:21:00,944
We broke up.

262
00:21:00,945 --> 00:21:05,812
And the insurance?
-- Do I have insurance.

263
00:21:08,698 --> 00:21:12,212
Of course. Why not.
-- Great.

264
00:21:12,213 --> 00:21:15,481
Can I do anything else for you?
-- No.

265
00:21:17,255 --> 00:21:23,248
Basically yes.
I have a strange spot on my chest.

266
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:27,007
I try not to get upset.
-- Let's see.

267
00:21:32,649 --> 00:21:35,385
Do you see that?

268
00:21:35,649 --> 00:21:38,413
This is a spider bite.
-- Is that so?

269
00:21:38,414 --> 00:21:41,233
Yes, that's a spider bite.
-- Great.

270
00:21:42,824 --> 00:21:44,623
Please.
-- Thank you, Dr. Knight.

271
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:47,286
Of course.
You're welcome.

272
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:59,155
You have let me pull my shirt off.

273
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:04,084
Wait, I'm hurt.
Your handle came into my eye.

274
00:22:04,085 --> 00:22:07,240
I'm hurt.
Who said I was a drug salesman?

275
00:22:07,241 --> 00:22:11,364
Check your bag again.
You're not going to the airport?

276
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:15,328
Bid now but your apology.

277
00:22:15,329 --> 00:22:18,360
Nice if someone from the Medical Community
would apologize.

278
00:22:19,117 --> 00:22:23,247
I apologize to
behalf of all those arrogant ...

279
00:22:23,248 --> 00:22:26,541
faceless, closed bastards
of doctors ...

280
00:22:26,542 --> 00:22:30,914
you have treated as a non--existent
person to your chest and peered.

281
00:22:33,012 --> 00:22:35,560
What's your name?

282
00:22:35,561 --> 00:22:38,744
You're good.
Strong eye contact ...

283
00:22:38,745 --> 00:22:41,030
played intimacy,
do you get your quota.

284
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,839
Then come a cup of coffee.

285
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:49,706
What was that for?
-- Bag it in shit. That was that.

286
00:22:49,741 --> 00:22:52,812
Wait.
I better apologize.

287
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:59,829
Because I want to know.

288
00:23:00,535 --> 00:23:06,665
The same white tights that I wear every day.
You're crazy.

289
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:10,032
And nothing on underneath.

290
00:23:10,507 --> 00:23:12,899
You're bad.

291
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,290
I am looking for a number of a patient
he saw yesterday.

292
00:23:17,324 --> 00:23:20,157
One Murdock or something.

293
00:23:20,158 --> 00:23:22,567
Want Maggie Murdock's number?
-- Yes.

294
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:25,528
Because they said six neurologists
and ...

295
00:23:26,186 --> 00:23:29,557
Pfizer comes with Parkinson's disease medications
and I want to contact them ...

296
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:32,779
and I want lots of money.
But, that none of your business.

297
00:23:33,511 --> 00:23:38,576
We can not give telephone numbers.
-- You have given me your number, naughty girl.

298
00:23:38,577 --> 00:23:42,181
Know what your friends are
poor you really are?

299
00:23:42,182 --> 00:23:45,801
If they knew how bad
you actually had ...

300
00:23:46,137 --> 00:23:50,736
I promise you that I omdoe stethoscope
then we play the naughty nurse.

301
00:24:04,953 --> 00:24:07,830
What are you doing here?

302
00:24:08,878 --> 00:24:12,020
I'm the dick.

303
00:24:12,021 --> 00:24:14,366
She kicked me out.
-- No right?

304
00:24:14,401 --> 00:24:18,675
Can you believe it?
I think she fucks with someone else.

305
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:21,139
Why did she kicked you out?
-- I do not know.

306
00:24:21,175 --> 00:24:23,947
She said I was addicted to Internet porn.
-- Are you?

307
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:26,837
Of course.
That is everyone?

308
00:24:27,871 --> 00:24:30,871
I can not breathe.

309
00:24:30,872 --> 00:24:33,983
I have a panic attack.

310
00:24:35,027 --> 00:24:37,370
Do you Ativan?
-- Well Xanax.

311
00:24:37,406 --> 00:24:39,750
Do you have samples of Xanax?

312
00:24:39,751 --> 00:24:44,383
I am now very vulnerable.

313
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:54,193
Come here.
It's okay.

314
00:24:55,955 --> 00:24:59,561
We are not cuddly ass.

315
00:25:01,898 --> 00:25:04,991
Faster, come on.
We can do this.

316
00:25:04,992 --> 00:25:07,856
Josh, put it down.
-- No.

317
00:25:15,964 --> 00:25:20,228
Why did you get that picture taken?
-- Is that the girl with the boobs?

318
00:25:23,325 --> 00:25:25,834
How did you get my number come?

319
00:25:25,835 --> 00:25:28,389
Did you call the office of Knight?

320
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:32,345
How did you get my number?
-- From the reception.

321
00:25:32,982 --> 00:25:35,546
Fuck you.
-- What does she say?

322
00:25:35,547 --> 00:25:38,998
Go drink coffee with me.
-- Why?

323
00:25:38,999 --> 00:25:42,602
I am a medical representative, not a freak.

324
00:25:44,696 --> 00:25:49,056
Same thing.
-- Sorry I was staring at your tits, but ...

325
00:25:49,057 --> 00:25:51,636
they are really beautiful.

326
00:25:57,917 --> 00:26:00,914
I thought you just hung up.

327
00:26:00,915 --> 00:26:04,851
Had I to do?
-- And to miss the opportunity to insult me?

328
00:26:04,886 --> 00:26:09,056
Do you like to be offended?

329
00:26:09,737 --> 00:26:12,301
Wait.

330
00:26:15,729 --> 00:26:18,354
With the right person.

331
00:26:18,355 --> 00:26:21,136
This is a sales pitch.

332
00:26:21,137 --> 00:26:26,545
You stay on the phone until I say yes.
-- I mean everything I say.

333
00:26:29,611 --> 00:26:32,037
Five hours. Lulu's, come on time.

334
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,906
Why do you answer everything with violence?

335
00:26:44,928 --> 00:26:47,997
I said five hours.

336
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:52,207
Very cute.
-- You can have him.

337
00:26:52,208 --> 00:26:55,034
Khaki pants, no thanks.

338
00:26:59,992 --> 00:27:02,795
What's your name?

339
00:27:05,238 --> 00:27:08,223
What's your game?
-- My game?

340
00:27:08,224 --> 00:27:12,800
Now we talk about where we come from
and what we are majoring in high school.

341
00:27:12,801 --> 00:27:17,454
You have beautiful eyes?
-- Can you do any better?

342
00:27:17,455 --> 00:27:19,802
Really, they are wonderful.
-- Thanks.

343
00:27:19,803 --> 00:27:23,725
My childhood?
When I was sick?

344
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:26,859
Are you always so mean?
-- I'm still pretty.

345
00:27:31,528 --> 00:27:34,810
What's your quota this month
Have you already had the first appraisal?

346
00:27:34,811 --> 00:27:37,894
Is that a vibration at rest.
It comes and goes.

347
00:27:38,972 --> 00:27:43,292
That's none of your.
-- That happens when you're nervous.

348
00:27:43,293 --> 00:27:46,529
Mr. Expert, why should I be nervous?
-- Because you're interested.

349
00:27:46,796 --> 00:27:49,394
And why am I nervous?
-- Your mind tells you one ...

350
00:27:49,395 --> 00:27:52,174
and your body says something else.

351
00:27:57,496 --> 00:28:00,537
Let's go.

352
00:28:00,538 --> 00:28:03,475
Excuse me?
-- You still want to fuck?

353
00:28:04,373 --> 00:28:07,179
Now?

354
00:28:07,837 --> 00:28:11,638
So I have to pretend I do not know
whether it is good ...

355
00:28:11,639 --> 00:28:16,205
and then you say that there is no right or wrong.
It's just the moment.

356
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:18,737
And I say that I can not do.

357
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:20,897
I give signals that I can not do.

358
00:28:20,898 --> 00:28:25,698
You do not need because you're not listening
really, this is not about a relationship for you ...

359
00:28:25,699 --> 00:28:29,291
it is not even about sex.
It is about one hour to find ...

360
00:28:29,292 --> 00:28:33,319
rid of the pain to be you.
And I like it because ...

361
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:37,846
I just want the same.

362
00:28:44,397 --> 00:28:47,756
Does that mean I do not tip
to give?

363
00:29:15,144 --> 00:29:19,164
I know what you think.
I will keep five or ten minutes.

364
00:29:19,165 --> 00:29:22,825
And where I tossed my beeper.

365
00:29:23,249 --> 00:29:26,560
I think not.
Lying under the table.

366
00:29:28,774 --> 00:29:31,852
What's that guy again?

367
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:36,690
Bye, Johnnie.

368
00:29:40,263 --> 00:29:45,100
You should get going.
-- I do not leave.

369
00:29:46,407 --> 00:29:49,828
I want you to leave.

370
00:29:56,463 --> 00:29:59,336
It was nice to meet you.

371
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:02,761
Same here.

372
00:30:02,762 --> 00:30:07,498
Maybe we'll meet again.

373
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:12,775
Thanks.

374
00:31:14,353 --> 00:31:18,916
What are you doing here?
-- I know it's late.

375
00:31:23,332 --> 00:31:26,716
I have not seen anything. No glasses.
-- Turn around.

376
00:31:30,434 --> 00:31:33,591
Hi, Josh.
Nice to meet you.

377
00:31:37,367 --> 00:31:40,877
I can of the six causes of
mention amnesia ...

378
00:31:40,878 --> 00:31:43,772
and the four stages of terminal cirrhosis.

379
00:31:43,773 --> 00:31:48,948
And I know how to set up a gut feeling
in an investigation.

380
00:31:49,664 --> 00:31:52,407
Why are you turned away
of your medical studies?

381
00:31:52,408 --> 00:31:55,991
I'm not turned away, I could see the university
early. I could not sit through class.

382
00:31:55,992 --> 00:31:59,454
Ritalin with ten.
-- Eight.

383
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:02,519
Boaster.

384
00:32:03,193 --> 00:32:09,208
I thought you were pretty smart.
-- The prodigal son with ADD.

385
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:12,785
Want to know the truth?

386
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:17,099
I could not give satisfaction to my father.

387
00:32:20,067 --> 00:32:22,995
This usually works for you?

388
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:26,570
What?
-- This.

389
00:32:26,571 --> 00:32:31,756
That whole by dad misunderstood,
I am a sensitive guy thing.

390
00:32:32,071 --> 00:32:35,373
Usually, yes.

391
00:32:36,547 --> 00:32:39,475
It's okay.
-- Thanks.

392
00:32:39,476 --> 00:32:46,699
But somewhere, say the sixth grade,
a girl laughed at you, or ...

393
00:32:47,685 --> 00:32:53,405
there is a lot of girls laughing at you
and, Jamie is still good at something.

394
00:32:54,151 --> 00:32:56,988
That was actually in fifth grade.

395
00:32:58,869 --> 00:33:02,203
Why did you have a boyfriend?

396
00:33:02,835 --> 00:33:05,993
I'm going.

397
00:33:06,821 --> 00:33:10,115
Why?
-- Look.

398
00:33:10,749 --> 00:33:15,548
The thing is, I love it
to have sex ...

399
00:33:15,549 --> 00:33:18,994
and I love having sex with
you have ...

400
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:24,701
let's keep it simple.
-- I can do.

401
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:28,597
Yes, you looks like an asshole,
So it must be good.

402
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:36,432
There are alarms off in my head.
You are not quite what you seem.

403
00:33:36,567 --> 00:33:40,031
No, I'm an asshole.

404
00:33:40,032 --> 00:33:42,298
Believe me.

405
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,628
Good.

406
00:33:47,629 --> 00:33:52,449
Because if it turns out you're not an asshole
that would be bad.

407
00:33:54,972 --> 00:33:59,084
I'm a bastard through and through.

408
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:25,753
How are you?

409
00:34:25,754 --> 00:34:29,369
It's okay.

410
00:34:29,763 --> 00:34:33,014
The injured parts to acid acetonic Fri

411
00:34:33,015 --> 00:34:38,042
Your body converts it to prostaglandin
so you can experience pain.

412
00:34:38,043 --> 00:34:41,129
Do you surrender?
That does not help.

413
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:45,777
It takes one minute until the acid is
and until the natural morphine to work.

414
00:34:45,778 --> 00:34:48,698
You know why I have you beaten?
-- No, I do not know.

415
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:52,009
Prozac has helped millions of people
with intractable mood disorders.

416
00:34:52,042 --> 00:34:53,928
Has made miserable lives livable.

417
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:56,456
It has even helped me
some of my anger problems.

418
00:34:56,457 --> 00:34:59,819
So if someone with my Prozac motherfuckers
then I get upset.

419
00:35:00,335 --> 00:35:04,810
You know what people say about me?
-- That you hear in the national top ten.

420
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:08,753
Why is that do you?
-- On Thurs.

421
00:35:08,754 --> 00:35:12,220
Why do you think that is?
I am an ex Navy man.

422
00:35:12,221 --> 00:35:15,080
I destroy anyone who stands in my way.

423
00:35:23,169 --> 00:35:28,236
I would do on ice as quickly as possible.
If pain persists ... radiographs.

424
00:35:31,632 --> 00:35:34,570
And stay away from Maggie.

425
00:35:38,115 --> 00:35:41,051
Sorry.

426
00:35:43,609 --> 00:35:48,491
That more samples?
-- Go ahead.

427
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,999
Thanks.

428
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,810
I just got a job interview.
-- That's great.

429
00:36:00,171 --> 00:36:02,976
That's great.

430
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:06,824
Hello, ladies.

431
00:36:07,828 --> 00:36:12,279
No samples today.
-- I have great stuff for you.

432
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:15,631
No samples today.
Thanks.

433
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:18,371
She's just a friend.
-- No samples today, sorry.

434
00:36:18,888 --> 00:36:23,193
What's going on?
Trey has talked with you or not?

435
00:36:23,294 --> 00:36:26,055
What has he given you?
-- No samples today. Thanks.

436
00:36:26,155 --> 00:36:29,823
Hawaii.
-- Hawaii?

437
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:33,531
No samples today. Doctors Congress,
beach resort in Honolulu.

438
00:36:46,088 --> 00:36:49,865
I gotta get outta here.
-- You're not going to her?

439
00:36:50,433 --> 00:36:53,575
No.

440
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:16,710
What is that?
-- Food.

441
00:37:17,998 --> 00:37:20,129
To ...
-- Food.

442
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:24,216
That's my noodle.
-- Your face is full of noodles.

443
00:37:24,882 --> 00:37:27,238
Thank God you're so selfish.
You're like my mother.

444
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:31,299
Have you slept with your mother?
What?

445
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:35,847
She's fun, it is available,
you would love her ...

446
00:37:35,848 --> 00:37:39,722
They used all the oxygen in the chamber
wardrobes and all ...

447
00:37:39,723 --> 00:37:42,243
beyond that you are perfect for each other.
-- Is she hotter than you?

448
00:37:42,244 --> 00:37:45,737
I bet she is hotter than you.
-- She has no illness.

449
00:37:45,738 --> 00:37:48,670
Does it work normally for you?
-- What?

450
00:37:48,671 --> 00:37:51,942
Self--pity?
-- You're an asshole.

451
00:38:02,186 --> 00:38:05,450
What?
-- Nothing.

452
00:38:10,506 --> 00:38:13,382
This is fun.

453
00:38:18,659 --> 00:38:21,361
It's time to get your clothes off
and me to jump.

454
00:38:21,362 --> 00:38:25,617
Wait. May I say?
-- I do not know.

455
00:38:25,618 --> 00:38:30,926
First, take your costs and it would
you to sleep ...

456
00:38:30,927 --> 00:38:34,200
then take clean clothes and then
your razor and then it's a relationship.

457
00:38:34,201 --> 00:38:37,625
I do not want a relationship.
-- You can not guarantee.

458
00:38:37,626 --> 00:38:41,815
You may have a latent humanity
you know nothing about.

459
00:38:41,816 --> 00:38:44,094
You may find a nice relationship ...

460
00:38:44,095 --> 00:38:47,230
I said 'this is fun'.
I asked you not to marry.

461
00:38:50,642 --> 00:38:54,190
I do not want to be someone who is sick.

462
00:38:58,567 --> 00:39:03,450
I'm sorry.

463
00:39:03,485 --> 00:39:09,749
I did that before.
And that was not good.

464
00:39:13,443 --> 00:39:18,167
There was with me a diagnosis and ...

465
00:39:18,168 --> 00:39:24,614
He was married and he would help me.
That did not work out so well.

466
00:39:26,437 --> 00:39:29,972
You're talking about Trey Hannigan.

467
00:39:30,495 --> 00:39:34,958
It's Trey Hannigan.

468
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:41,104
Are you in love with him?

469
00:39:41,728 --> 00:39:45,785
No, I'm not in love with Trey Hannigan.

470
00:39:45,786 --> 00:39:50,603
He said he was in love with me ...

471
00:39:55,208 --> 00:39:59,695
There was a problem.

472
00:40:05,563 --> 00:40:08,903
Can we just ...
-- Yes.

473
00:40:13,782 --> 00:40:17,802
You get a special thanks because
've brought your food.

474
00:40:17,803 --> 00:40:21,408
I did.
-- Yes, you did.

475
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,415
You know what?
-- What?

476
00:40:27,843 --> 00:40:32,405
I gotta pee.
I'll be back.

477
00:40:32,505 --> 00:40:35,081
Good.

478
00:40:55,903 --> 00:40:58,654
One moment.
-- Good.

479
00:41:19,931 --> 00:41:22,127
Concentrate.

480
00:41:25,215 --> 00:41:28,153
Should I continue?
-- This never happens.

481
00:41:28,154 --> 00:41:30,944
I see.
-- I really mean it.

482
00:41:30,945 --> 00:41:34,293
It's me.
I bring bad luck.

483
00:41:35,666 --> 00:41:39,447
That really helps. Tell me about all
other guy you've been to bed.

484
00:41:39,548 --> 00:41:41,610
And who could not get up.
He might ...

485
00:41:43,589 --> 00:41:47,163
Take it easy.

486
00:41:47,756 --> 00:41:50,858
Very briefly.

487
00:41:51,214 --> 00:41:54,780
Do not worry about it.
-- I am concerned about it.

488
00:41:56,074 --> 00:42:00,198
Show some kindness again.

489
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:05,186
Please.
-- Lying bastard.

490
00:42:05,187 --> 00:42:08,852
You really latent humanity.
You know what's going on here?

491
00:42:09,414 --> 00:42:14,010
I just want to have sex.
-- Your body tells you something else.

492
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:17,484
What do you mean?

493
00:42:19,663 --> 00:42:23,543
Sit down.
-- I do not sit.

494
00:42:27,102 --> 00:42:30,351
Talk to me.
-- I do not talk.

495
00:42:30,674 --> 00:42:33,675
What would you do differently.
You have sex all of brushed aside.

496
00:42:35,385 --> 00:42:37,719
Tell me how your day has expired.

497
00:42:38,363 --> 00:42:41,293
My day?

498
00:42:41,294 --> 00:42:45,037
So I sneak into my room and I make
of a D B.

499
00:42:45,138 --> 00:42:47,395
I had worked out nicely.
Was nothing to see.

500
00:42:47,396 --> 00:42:51,441
I go to the office and give him paper
and then he pulls that face.

501
00:42:52,421 --> 00:42:55,987
And I say 'what'?

502
00:42:56,414 --> 00:43:01,496
He gets behind his back
copy from the school.

503
00:43:04,141 --> 00:43:06,926
Genius.

504
00:43:08,969 --> 00:43:11,989
You're so ambitious.
-- No.

505
00:43:13,603 --> 00:43:17,518
I said I had a relationship with Trey Hannigan
and you get it no longer holds.

506
00:43:17,619 --> 00:43:20,008
Trey Hannigan I do not give a damn.

507
00:43:20,067 --> 00:43:23,319
You want to just beat him.
-- Bullshit.

508
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:26,473
So prehistoric.
Men spend only about performance.

509
00:43:26,474 --> 00:43:29,843
But their appendix does not, if they
concerned about performance.

510
00:43:32,087 --> 00:43:34,784
You're an expert.

511
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,538
If I am an expert, why
gives your company ...

512
00:43:40,539 --> 00:43:43,004
millions on drugs so that men
to get it up?

513
00:43:43,005 --> 00:43:44,948
I would like.
-- It's true. I have read.

514
00:43:44,949 --> 00:43:47,747
Pfizer is a fucking drug.
-- Where did you read?

515
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:50,720
I do not know what I've read.
Just ask your boys.

516
00:43:50,721 --> 00:43:53,509
I'm a slut medicine,
I read everything.

517
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:57,139
What drug?
-- I do not know. It's hard to believe.

518
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:00,299
That is 'hard' to believe?

519
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,754
It is something big.

520
00:44:02,755 --> 00:44:09,712
When I think of the size of the problem
and the bigger ...

521
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:11,377
Really.
-- Really?

522
00:44:11,378 --> 00:44:16,521
That they have the solution for
the stiffest, hardest ...

523
00:44:16,522 --> 00:44:19,772
Pfizer must be bursting with pride.

524
00:44:19,773 --> 00:44:23,797
Not tickle.
Please.

525
00:44:23,895 --> 00:44:26,813
Not tickle.
You have a weak sense of humor.

526
00:44:42,829 --> 00:44:46,293
Talking.
-- No more talk.

527
00:45:01,135 --> 00:45:03,885
Who are all these old people?

528
00:45:04,495 --> 00:45:07,550
People I work with.

529
00:45:09,476 --> 00:45:12,429
They're beautiful.

530
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:16,125
It looks like a photograph.
When did you make it?

531
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:21,986
When I still could hold a brush.

532
00:45:21,987 --> 00:45:25,081
Here's your breakfast.

533
00:45:26,964 --> 00:45:30,228
Thanks.
-- My pleasure.

534
00:45:32,595 --> 00:45:36,363
I'll call you.

535
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,856
Do not.
-- I'll do that.

536
00:45:38,857 --> 00:45:41,849
I'm not kidding.

537
00:45:44,485 --> 00:45:48,289
I can not do.

538
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:53,432
I have told you.

539
00:46:11,743 --> 00:46:15,833
Your problem is, you're not off.
You should tell the doctors what they need.

540
00:46:15,834 --> 00:46:18,296
If someone says no, the fun begins.
Then you are inside.

541
00:46:18,297 --> 00:46:20,914
My grades are going up.
-- Your Zithromax went up, so what?

542
00:46:20,915 --> 00:46:25,373
We're not going to Chicago by Zithromax.
Depressed people are depressed every day.

543
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:28,438
You must focus on Zoloft.

544
00:46:28,538 --> 00:46:31,165
On Zoloft.
-- Here's some advice ...

545
00:46:31,166 --> 00:46:34,750
do not be a bitch.
I used your language now?

546
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,542
Trial separation.
-- I'm so sorry.

547
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:40,013
I need my feelings on you take it out.

548
00:46:40,014 --> 00:46:44,172
I say it differently. I feel you
not a damn bitch should be.

549
00:46:46,192 --> 00:46:48,914
We are going to release a new sex drug?

550
00:46:48,915 --> 00:46:50,670
What are you talking about?
-- Is it true?

551
00:46:50,671 --> 00:46:53,114
Where did you hear that?
-- I heard.

552
00:46:53,783 --> 00:46:56,880
Sildenafil Citrate.
This is a PDE5 inhibitor.

553
00:46:56,881 --> 00:46:59,492
That they encountered in testing
for blood pressure medicines ...

554
00:46:59,493 --> 00:47:01,892
the boy said, all the time
a huge boner.

555
00:47:01,893 --> 00:47:03,631
Where did you hear that?
-- What is it?

556
00:47:03,632 --> 00:47:05,375
Viagra.
-- I want that.

557
00:47:05,376 --> 00:47:07,388
Everyone wants them.
-- That I can sell.

558
00:47:07,389 --> 00:47:09,742
See if some indigestion tablets
lying in the glove.

559
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:14,696
Bruce, I want that account.

560
00:47:15,845 --> 00:47:18,911
Why should I give to you?
-- Who is a 'pikmedicijn "sell better than me?

561
00:47:20,103 --> 00:47:23,093
Crushing married ten years.

562
00:47:23,221 --> 00:47:26,435
Like the lost ten years.
My God.

563
00:47:26,887 --> 00:47:29,079
I do not even know how
I have girls to decorate.

564
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,480
What are you doing?
-- A PDS. Do you know that?

565
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:33,560
Irritable Bowel Syndrome?
-- Advantage network.

566
00:47:33,561 --> 00:47:35,936
Say who you are, why
and what you can do for them.

567
00:47:36,036 --> 00:47:38,310
And just be yourself.
-- Thanks.

568
00:47:39,409 --> 00:47:41,898
Look who just arrives.

569
00:47:41,979 --> 00:47:45,031
This is your chance.
Let's see what you have.

570
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:50,090
Let me see.

571
00:47:50,125 --> 00:47:52,775
How's your thumb?
-- How is your jaw?

572
00:47:54,187 --> 00:47:58,346
Randall, you know Stan Knight right?
Stan, this is a smart young man from Pfizer.

573
00:47:58,347 --> 00:48:00,311
We've met before.
-- Yeah, how are you?

574
00:48:00,312 --> 00:48:02,133
Fantastic. There is a new study
on Zoloft ...

575
00:48:02,134 --> 00:48:05,450
25% fewer side effects than Prozac.
So, I feel good.

576
00:48:05,728 --> 00:48:07,892
It's better if you sell it
fucked has.

577
00:48:07,893 --> 00:48:09,628
Need someone I can fuck?

578
00:48:09,629 --> 00:48:13,029
Stan is one of the more respected
diagnostiseurs in the city ...

579
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:15,000
but his real job is whore--hopper.

580
00:48:15,001 --> 00:48:17,067
I think your real professional pimp.

581
00:48:17,068 --> 00:48:20,497
You fuck with Maggie Murdock?

582
00:48:21,144 --> 00:48:24,842
You do.
She has great tits.

583
00:48:24,843 --> 00:48:26,649
Not fair.

584
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:30,198
You do not see much in
neurological damned.

585
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:32,004
Damned why?
You are not dying of Parkinson's.

586
00:48:32,005 --> 00:48:34,225
That's not really a life.

587
00:48:34,226 --> 00:48:36,856
Interferon and then, the process is
stopped ...

588
00:48:36,857 --> 00:48:38,946
in most cases.
-- Listen, Mr. doctors visitor.

589
00:48:38,947 --> 00:48:41,461
You're an asshole.
She's a sick girl.

590
00:48:42,137 --> 00:48:44,506
Have you told your wife?
-- None of your business.

591
00:48:44,507 --> 00:48:48,171
Maggie has many needs. I think
as a wimp if you can not take.

592
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:52,531
And a married man is?
-- You want me to beat you again?

593
00:48:52,961 --> 00:48:55,296
Join now not aggressive.

594
00:48:59,118 --> 00:49:02,119
You know what?
-- Calm down.

595
00:49:02,806 --> 00:49:05,540
I'm going home.
You do not.

596
00:49:06,596 --> 00:49:09,172
Put your wife hello.
-- I love watching you.

597
00:49:10,398 --> 00:49:13,105
Since I got the nerves.

598
00:49:13,622 --> 00:49:18,345
Did he really beaten?
-- Yes, I'm afraid he does that again.

599
00:49:18,346 --> 00:49:20,820
He should increase his medication.

600
00:49:20,821 --> 00:49:24,624
Maybe he should take something more impact
By aggressive behavior.

601
00:49:25,259 --> 00:49:30,591
Zoloft with you 30% less explosions
in adult men.

602
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:36,318
And I think that your life changes.

603
00:49:36,895 --> 00:49:39,585
I know those women, all two.
What do you take home?

604
00:49:42,415 --> 00:49:46,577
Here's superstar.
Confidence is key.

605
00:49:48,745 --> 00:49:52,354
What do you think if we tent
blow and then another?

606
00:49:54,104 --> 00:49:56,589
Thanks.

607
00:49:57,868 --> 00:50:00,152
Are you ready?
-- You okay, champ?

608
00:50:00,153 --> 00:50:02,156
No.

609
00:50:05,163 --> 00:50:08,032
What are you doing?
Will you call her?

610
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,926
Did she orally satisfied you?

611
00:50:12,022 --> 00:50:14,722
Farrah looks at my cock
if it is the eye of Sauron.

612
00:50:16,751 --> 00:50:19,782
Hello?
-- Did you call me?

613
00:50:19,843 --> 00:50:23,407
No, I did not call you.
-- I think so.

614
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:27,822
What would I have said?
-- That you want to see me?

615
00:50:28,222 --> 00:50:31,652
That would be nice,
I just do not call.

616
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:33,767
Want to see me?
-- I hang up now.

617
00:50:33,768 --> 00:50:37,405
Wait, do not hang up.

618
00:50:40,393 --> 00:50:42,072
Why?

619
00:50:43,647 --> 00:50:46,472
I like your voice be heard.

620
00:50:52,611 --> 00:50:56,255
Day, Randall.
-- Maggie.

621
00:50:58,841 --> 00:51:01,888
You like to hear her voice?

622
00:51:02,832 --> 00:51:04,451
Shut up.

623
00:51:04,452 --> 00:51:08,017
Do you have a brain tumor?
Whether you're attacked by a panda?

624
00:51:08,018 --> 00:51:10,487
Have you been abducted by Aliens?
You hate women.

625
00:51:10,488 --> 00:51:12,794
Why else fuck you so much?

626
00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:15,542
It's time you take an overdose.

627
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:20,864
She has rejected you.
Why you want her.

628
00:51:20,865 --> 00:51:23,239
The first time in history
that this happens.

629
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,479
I'm slightly.

630
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:28,565
Are you rich?
Why are you sleeping on my couch?

631
00:51:30,519 --> 00:51:32,843
You're my big brother.

632
00:51:36,033 --> 00:51:38,585
Here. For people who never
have gone through puberty.

633
00:51:38,686 --> 00:51:41,899
Take six.

634
00:51:44,607 --> 00:51:47,824
Is everything okay?
-- Can I pay by check?

635
00:51:47,825 --> 00:51:51,540
Sam, I did not say that pharmacies
only accept cash?

636
00:51:54,743 --> 00:51:57,228
Enter the bus but then talk
we are about.

637
00:51:57,229 --> 00:51:59,368
Maggie, I want to talk.

638
00:51:59,578 --> 00:52:02,084
I can not talk now.
I go by bus to Canada.

639
00:52:02,085 --> 00:52:03,986
Canada?
-- Yes, Canada.

640
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:06,097
Those people their medication
not pay.

641
00:52:06,098 --> 00:52:10,693
Maggie, there are bathroom breaks?
-- I told you there was a toilet in the bus.

642
00:52:11,536 --> 00:52:13,710
When you come back?
-- Never.

643
00:52:14,961 --> 00:52:17,514
Tomorrow night, late.
-- What time?

644
00:52:17,549 --> 00:52:20,636
Forget it now.
Please?

645
00:52:31,864 --> 00:52:34,005
What time is it?

646
00:52:34,287 --> 00:52:36,781
I gotta go.
I'll call you later.

647
00:52:59,582 --> 00:53:00,823
Act to know.

648
00:53:00,824 --> 00:53:03,495
Know how large amounts of money
to deal ...

649
00:53:03,496 --> 00:53:05,595
with harmony and love.

650
00:53:05,596 --> 00:53:09,267
And the truth is that you
great ideals have ...

651
00:53:09,268 --> 00:53:12,394
and that you are somebody
with great integrity.

652
00:53:31,384 --> 00:53:34,023
You have all your stuff.

653
00:53:34,024 --> 00:53:37,147
Come home safely.

654
00:54:06,541 --> 00:54:09,399
If you break up, I hate you.

655
00:54:09,442 --> 00:54:13,253
I will be cold and all hurtful
my friends say.

656
00:54:13,621 --> 00:54:16,892
You can not come and live with me.
Or be friends with my friends ...

657
00:54:16,988 --> 00:54:20,253
or to imagine your parents.
This is what it is, whatever it is.

658
00:54:20,254 --> 00:54:23,778
Are you ready?
-- Have you been waiting here all night?

659
00:54:23,813 --> 00:54:25,327
Yes.

660
00:54:35,445 --> 00:54:38,135
Why am I mad at you now?

661
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:19,947
Jamie, with Brucie.
If you want to meet me ...

662
00:55:19,948 --> 00:55:22,217
I very much love
in my trunk for you.

663
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:24,771
Something you'll like, Jamie.

664
00:55:25,872 --> 00:55:28,561
Call me, you'll love me.

665
00:55:33,081 --> 00:55:35,387
Jamie, Bruce.
Where are you?

666
00:55:35,388 --> 00:55:38,400
Who are you?

667
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:42,978
Let the games begin.

668
00:55:55,978 --> 00:55:58,937
Men with diabetes and prostate cancer ...

669
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:02,945
men with big penis injuries,
men with performance anxiety ...

670
00:56:02,946 --> 00:56:06,433
men with any ordinary kind of incompetence
or sexual dysfunction.

671
00:56:06,434 --> 00:56:10,236
Men without erectile function
years to ...

672
00:56:11,041 --> 00:56:13,293
Few side effects,
safe in the long term.

673
00:56:13,294 --> 00:56:16,617
This is not a pill, but a revolution.

674
00:56:16,618 --> 00:56:19,116
Any other questions?
-- Yes, where are the monsters?

675
00:56:19,117 --> 00:56:21,174
Here.

676
00:56:21,203 --> 00:56:23,887
Are you sure you want one?
Who needs two?

677
00:56:23,888 --> 00:56:27,131
Bob Dowle says his
TV commercials for Viagra ...

678
00:56:27,132 --> 00:56:30,491
his wife's campaign for president
no harm.

679
00:56:30,492 --> 00:56:35,493
He also says that the Viagra ads
Heather Locklear campaign to get into bed.

680
00:56:37,322 --> 00:56:41,048
My brother.

681
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:46,805
Viagra, the little pill, to a gold rush
has begun for its manufacturer ...

682
00:56:46,806 --> 00:56:48,567
The drug giant, Pfizer.

683
00:56:52,456 --> 00:56:55,018
Ted Goldstein.
-- How are you?

684
00:56:55,019 --> 00:56:57,539
Well, I have this friend ...

685
00:56:57,540 --> 00:57:00,350
the radiologist, he has a small problem.
I thought maybe ...

686
00:57:00,351 --> 00:57:02,467
Say no more.

687
00:57:04,184 --> 00:57:07,180
Viagra is the first pill
impotence remedy that.

688
00:57:07,181 --> 00:57:10,501
It's easy, effective
and there is now very much in demand.

689
00:57:15,382 --> 00:57:18,993
Al oncologists, psychiatrists, radiologists ...

690
00:57:19,458 --> 00:57:21,536
pediatricians prescribe it for themselves.

691
00:57:21,537 --> 00:57:24,831
Pharmacies can sell 24 hours
and then not meet the demand.

692
00:57:24,832 --> 00:57:28,153
We have 1200 recipes a month.
That's more than my quota for the whole year.

693
00:57:28,765 --> 00:57:31,918
And you can not care.
-- A bunch of old men with a stiff?

694
00:57:31,919 --> 00:57:34,245
No.
-- How can you be so indifferent?

695
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:38,379
Global lead men to shame ...

696
00:57:43,047 --> 00:57:45,603
and frustration ...

697
00:57:51,266 --> 00:57:53,625
You're my little blue pill.

698
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:56,946
Oh, no.

699
00:57:56,947 --> 00:57:58,834
Do you think that is okay?

700
00:57:58,835 --> 00:58:00,835
I do not want to see.

701
00:58:00,836 --> 00:58:03,316
What are you doing?

702
00:58:03,317 --> 00:58:05,809
No, this is too much information.

703
00:58:06,341 --> 00:58:08,046
You take it now?

704
00:58:08,894 --> 00:58:10,975
Even with close ups and stuff?

705
00:58:13,218 --> 00:58:14,805
Those who hold it?

706
00:58:30,363 --> 00:58:32,700
Wake up.

707
00:58:34,352 --> 00:58:36,672
Again?

708
00:58:43,326 --> 00:58:47,146
Come on.
I am an artist. This is work.

709
00:58:49,639 --> 00:58:52,074
Say something.

710
00:58:54,195 --> 00:58:56,355
This is really weird.

711
00:58:59,431 --> 00:59:02,604
Hi, I'm Jamie Randall.

712
00:59:02,605 --> 00:59:06,280
I do report from bed.

713
00:59:06,652 --> 00:59:08,904
I just fucked my girlfriend.

714
00:59:08,905 --> 00:59:10,869
And ...
-- Do not share it.

715
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:15,517
You have it all the fucking time.
-- You fuck your girlfriend.

716
00:59:16,569 --> 00:59:19,454
You are.

717
00:59:21,751 --> 00:59:25,736
Is that me?
-- Yes, you.

718
00:59:27,746 --> 00:59:30,757
I think I am.

719
01:00:49,216 --> 01:00:51,575
No, ma, it's not exciting way.

720
01:00:51,675 --> 01:00:53,401
It dilates blood vessels.

721
01:00:53,501 --> 01:00:57,448
A blood vessel widening drug.
No, ma ...

722
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:04,206
Yes, I have this month
2000 prescriptions sold.

723
01:01:04,212 --> 01:01:07,001
A lot of money. I know.

724
01:01:07,650 --> 01:01:11,557
I can not talk now.
Maggie needs me.

725
01:01:13,546 --> 01:01:16,374
The 1200 regulations were anyway?

726
01:01:17,914 --> 01:01:20,276
That is true.

727
01:01:20,995 --> 01:01:24,056
Why did you say 2000?

728
01:01:24,057 --> 01:01:26,096
Did I say that?

729
01:01:27,707 --> 01:01:30,070
Are you serious?

730
01:01:30,071 --> 01:01:32,723
It sounded better.

731
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:37,001
You lied because it sounded better?

732
01:01:37,422 --> 01:01:40,443
She has no sense of figures ...

733
01:01:40,444 --> 01:01:43,360
Do this with me?

734
01:01:43,361 --> 01:01:45,322
No.
-- Why to her?

735
01:01:45,323 --> 01:01:49,420
She wants me to do it right.
-- And that is true.

736
01:01:49,421 --> 01:01:51,824
Why does it sound even better?

737
01:01:52,572 --> 01:01:56,994
I will call her back
and correct my mistake.

738
01:02:00,741 --> 01:02:03,848
Tell me four good things about yourself.

739
01:02:05,472 --> 01:02:08,804
Pardon?
-- You heard me.

740
01:02:12,097 --> 01:02:15,239
Four good things about myself ...

741
01:02:15,589 --> 01:02:18,927
I can ...

742
01:02:19,664 --> 01:02:23,325
Why are we doing this?
This is so ...

743
01:02:23,326 --> 01:02:26,349
Not even four good things.
-- I can do that.

744
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:29,092
You find yourself generous?

745
01:02:30,207 --> 01:02:32,521
You'll love yourself?

746
01:02:34,345 --> 01:02:37,629
Not really.
-- You think you smart?

747
01:02:42,075 --> 01:02:44,327
You look at that.

748
01:02:46,978 --> 01:02:48,782
You are ...

749
01:02:49,318 --> 01:02:50,481
a talented ...

750
01:02:53,169 --> 01:02:57,965
charming, handsome, skilled, smart man.

751
01:03:03,083 --> 01:03:05,106
Is that so?

752
01:03:06,506 --> 01:03:08,767
Yes.

753
01:03:17,452 --> 01:03:20,004
I Shake.

754
01:03:23,055 --> 01:03:25,578
Does it make it longer?
-- The time or length?

755
01:03:25,579 --> 01:03:27,608
And what if we take it?
-- I can.

756
01:03:27,943 --> 01:03:32,822
So we can be loud?
-- No, there would be an increased lubrication.

757
01:03:34,235 --> 01:03:37,093
When they come inside you,
burn it?

758
01:03:37,094 --> 01:03:39,192
And in your mouth?

759
01:03:40,504 --> 01:03:43,495
We want more Viagra.
-- More!

760
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:52,234
What's going on here?
-- This is Dr Stan Knight.

761
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:55,320
This is ...
-- Cassy.

762
01:03:55,355 --> 01:03:58,125
But my friends call me Lisa.

763
01:03:58,939 --> 01:04:02,418
Lisa wants to "marry a doctor.
Success.

764
01:04:02,783 --> 01:04:05,244
Ladies, the next round of me.

765
01:04:07,302 --> 01:04:09,116
Nice vest, man.

766
01:04:36,211 --> 01:04:39,263
Have you fucked?
-- Yes.

767
01:04:39,719 --> 01:04:41,702
Six times.

768
01:04:42,191 --> 01:04:44,820
I was afraid not.

769
01:04:45,837 --> 01:04:47,629
You're crazy.

770
01:05:05,077 --> 01:05:07,752
Is everything okay?

771
01:05:08,206 --> 01:05:11,481
Honey, your hard knocks very fast.
-- I know.

772
01:05:11,722 --> 01:05:13,849
What is ...

773
01:05:18,596 --> 01:05:20,850
It's okay.
Talk to me.

774
01:05:21,366 --> 01:05:24,093
I ...

775
01:05:25,189 --> 01:05:28,236
Just breathe.
Do not worry about it.

776
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:31,541
It's okay.

777
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:34,571
I ...

778
01:05:35,910 --> 01:05:38,070
I love you.
-- What?

779
01:05:39,649 --> 01:05:42,051
Give me a moment.

780
01:05:43,462 --> 01:05:45,781
Really.

781
01:05:46,224 --> 01:05:48,929
No, you're not.
-- Do not touch me!

782
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:51,779
Want a glass of water?
-- Sorry.

783
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:54,589
It does not matter. What water?
-- Yes.

784
01:05:58,545 --> 01:06:01,046
Please.

785
01:06:09,479 --> 01:06:13,167
I love you.
-- Do not keep saying.

786
01:06:13,168 --> 01:06:15,268
I can not.
I love you.

787
01:06:16,297 --> 01:06:18,172
You do not understand.

788
01:06:18,508 --> 01:06:21,193
I have never said to anyone.

789
01:06:21,994 --> 01:06:24,472
Never say?
-- No.

790
01:06:25,629 --> 01:06:28,504
Never tell your parents?

791
01:06:31,222 --> 01:06:33,296
No.
-- By your brother?

792
01:06:33,784 --> 01:06:36,715
You're even more screwed up than me.

793
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:39,966
I said it once at a cat.

794
01:06:42,044 --> 01:06:45,626
It makes me feel better.
You can hold me now.

795
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:00,436
Joshy?

796
01:07:05,889 --> 01:07:08,214
That's disgusting.

797
01:07:08,215 --> 01:07:11,933
Jamie? I did not know you came home.

798
01:07:19,438 --> 01:07:22,943
It is not what it seems.
Well, some do.

799
01:07:22,944 --> 01:07:25,161
Just do quiet.
-- Quiet?

800
01:07:25,162 --> 01:07:28,707
I thought I just caught my brother
to masturbate while he sees me fuck.

801
01:07:28,708 --> 01:07:31,035
I aimed at her.

802
01:07:31,767 --> 01:07:33,921
Her ... My girlfriend?
-- No.

803
01:07:33,922 --> 01:07:36,272
Sorry.
-- Not her.

804
01:07:36,273 --> 01:07:39,792
Her body parts.
Making things more videos ...

805
01:07:39,793 --> 01:07:42,447
because I did not know her
breasts were so large.

806
01:07:42,448 --> 01:07:46,386
Then I saw you:
Is there a loose Anaconda?

807
01:07:46,487 --> 01:07:48,956
This is so insane.
-- Do you have that big?

808
01:07:49,056 --> 01:07:54,266
That was so when we were kids,
but then you find anything great.

809
01:07:55,696 --> 01:07:58,100
Okay, I'm sorry.

810
01:07:58,101 --> 01:08:02,612
My self--esteem prefer
you do not currently have bigger penis.

811
01:08:06,246 --> 01:08:08,116
Not angry.

812
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:13,817
Walk, Josh. Run.

813
01:08:13,818 --> 01:08:17,620
Calm down, we can talk about it.

814
01:08:17,621 --> 01:08:19,501
You will ruin the tape.

815
01:08:19,986 --> 01:08:23,297
No normal human body
fits the back seat.

816
01:08:23,298 --> 01:08:28,292
That definition is not applicable to you.
-- A Hot Wheel would be even better.

817
01:08:28,327 --> 01:08:31,426
My legs are numb.

818
01:08:32,893 --> 01:08:34,393
Are you okay?
-- No.

819
01:08:34,998 --> 01:08:37,485
I'm not against you.

820
01:08:37,969 --> 01:08:40,430
Are you okay?
-- Yes.

821
01:10:16,328 --> 01:10:18,721
He is waiting for you.
-- How are you?

822
01:10:18,722 --> 01:10:20,949
Good.
And Maggie?

823
01:10:24,761 --> 01:10:26,022
Come inside.

824
01:10:27,342 --> 01:10:29,711
No, come inside.

825
01:10:32,928 --> 01:10:34,680
Testosterone.

826
01:10:34,681 --> 01:10:36,621
Chicago within two days.

827
01:10:36,622 --> 01:10:38,656
I must prepare myself.

828
01:10:39,123 --> 01:10:42,807
It's a fucking orgy, masquerading as
medical conference. You get it?

829
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:46,220
No idea.
-- How's she doing?

830
01:10:46,570 --> 01:10:48,602
Great.
-- With me.

831
01:10:48,603 --> 01:10:51,663
I do need a break.
That job will kill me.

832
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:55,623
I have many women need
hard for me to fall.

833
01:10:55,624 --> 01:10:57,331
Talks about having ...

834
01:10:58,547 --> 01:11:01,100
You are one God.

835
01:11:01,101 --> 01:11:03,681
Do you really not?
-- You can do something for me.

836
01:11:04,150 --> 01:11:05,242
And that is?

837
01:11:05,243 --> 01:11:08,391
No longer prescribe Zoloft
instead of Prozac.

838
01:11:11,212 --> 01:11:14,279
Trey is a friend of mine.

839
01:11:14,818 --> 01:11:16,863
I know.

840
01:11:19,211 --> 01:11:21,989
Of course, Zoloft, why not.

841
01:11:30,859 --> 01:11:34,283
How was your day?
-- Great.

842
01:11:38,348 --> 01:11:41,640
Your day?
-- My day was ...

843
01:11:41,641 --> 01:11:44,303
great.

844
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:47,998
I went to the hospital.

845
01:11:47,999 --> 01:11:50,772
For a recipe ...

846
01:11:51,172 --> 01:11:55,967
and waited three hours in addition
a man 's fork in his head.

847
01:11:55,968 --> 01:11:57,877
What?

848
01:11:57,878 --> 01:12:01,621
And then to the pharmacist ...

849
01:12:01,622 --> 01:12:03,846
the recipe to exchange.

850
01:12:04,418 --> 01:12:06,578
But it was closed.

851
01:12:08,565 --> 01:12:11,052
This was Maggie's story.

852
01:12:18,922 --> 01:12:20,653
Are you okay?

853
01:12:22,627 --> 01:12:25,388
I look bad or something?
-- I did not say.

854
01:12:25,389 --> 01:12:27,997
Not aloud.

855
01:12:37,051 --> 01:12:39,769
Thanks, it would taste.

856
01:12:42,045 --> 01:12:44,154
Sorry.

857
01:12:48,093 --> 01:12:50,337
Do not have enough, do you think?

858
01:12:50,338 --> 01:12:53,860
No. But you do.

859
01:12:53,861 --> 01:12:54,867
Pardon?

860
01:12:55,594 --> 01:12:58,973
Tell me what's so
sexually attractive to me?

861
01:12:58,974 --> 01:13:02,582
There are 600 girls
you like pipe that convention.

862
01:13:02,583 --> 01:13:06,229
I'll not go.
-- Why not?

863
01:13:06,230 --> 01:13:11,146
A sexy, lithe cheerleader
from Alabama to take ...

864
01:13:11,247 --> 01:13:15,174
who longed for sales forecasts
and discuss sales techniques ...

865
01:13:15,209 --> 01:13:20,989
or as a manager who likes horny
bake and you have your head caresses.

866
01:13:21,090 --> 01:13:25,473
while discussing the bad products.
Or a normal person ...

867
01:13:25,474 --> 01:13:28,964
which has energy has
fun things to do.

868
01:13:28,965 --> 01:13:31,842
I would now happen to you.
-- Why?

869
01:13:31,843 --> 01:13:36,505
What are you trying to prove?
That you're not unreliable?

870
01:13:36,506 --> 01:13:40,943
Or are you trying to "something" to remain in your life?

871
01:13:40,944 --> 01:13:45,552
You realize that you are not good
person because you're a sick girl fucks?

872
01:13:58,378 --> 01:14:01,787
I almost went with someone
from the hospital home.

873
01:14:07,161 --> 01:14:09,598
Do not forget your pager.

874
01:14:20,046 --> 01:14:22,875
No.

875
01:14:37,347 --> 01:14:39,846
It's okay.

876
01:14:47,747 --> 01:14:49,860
Go to Chicago.

877
01:14:56,484 --> 01:14:59,170
How you doing, man?
Good to see you.

878
01:14:59,179 --> 01:15:03,654
You okay?
-- I'm going to do something feminine.

879
01:15:04,213 --> 01:15:06,907
How can I reach you?
-- I beep you.

880
01:15:09,182 --> 01:15:11,400
Stage 1?

881
01:15:11,401 --> 01:15:14,451
Excuse me?
-- My son is in stage 3.

882
01:15:14,452 --> 01:15:17,327
It is not.
Do not worry.

883
01:15:17,328 --> 01:15:20,116
We are across the street.

884
01:15:20,117 --> 01:15:24,111
If you are tired of being
and want to know what is really going on ...

885
01:15:24,458 --> 01:15:26,421
Thanks.

886
01:15:36,062 --> 01:15:39,241
To hell with soup
and shoe laces.

887
01:15:39,577 --> 01:15:43,050
To hell with jewels
and brushing teeth.

888
01:15:44,642 --> 01:15:47,340
To hell with your tie knots.

889
01:15:47,341 --> 01:15:51,358
To hell with a shirt unbutton.
-- And with that nonsense meditation.

890
01:15:52,562 --> 01:15:57,500
And who knew that God wanted
we were so good ...

891
01:15:57,501 --> 01:16:01,159
in masturbation.

892
01:16:02,776 --> 01:16:06,985
My husband laughs constantly.

893
01:16:16,851 --> 01:16:19,454
Parkinson's is perhaps ...

894
01:16:19,958 --> 01:16:22,482
sensitive and meevoelender made.

895
01:16:22,483 --> 01:16:25,969
Hopefully I will go long in it.
I feel good ...

896
01:16:26,431 --> 01:16:29,727
and ...
-- It's a constant struggle.

897
01:16:29,728 --> 01:16:36,153
I try to maintain some dignity and grace
and so you live with what you have.

898
01:16:41,865 --> 01:16:44,426
ON THE FRONT OF THE STREET
Join ME

899
01:16:46,371 --> 01:16:50,756
Just hold the child
and he ends up in a tree.

900
01:16:51,072 --> 01:16:55,322
A friend of mine asked
if she had to get something for me ...

901
01:16:55,323 --> 01:16:59,330
and I said, new brains,
nothing special.

902
01:16:59,331 --> 01:17:02,416
She said: My husband
used by him.

903
01:17:03,276 --> 01:17:05,046
Wait.

904
01:17:06,052 --> 01:17:11,220
No, forget it, I thought
I heard a vibration coming cure.

905
01:17:14,504 --> 01:17:18,848
But there are good things.
You must understand ...

906
01:17:18,849 --> 01:17:21,862
you're still yourself.

907
01:17:21,963 --> 01:17:25,740
You're still
and life goes on ...

908
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:29,406
and that life is beautiful.
Thanks.

909
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:38,782
Parkinson, huh?

910
01:17:39,294 --> 01:17:41,686
No.
-- Your wife.

911
01:17:42,266 --> 01:17:44,344
Girlfriend.

912
01:17:45,977 --> 01:17:47,612
Stage 1.

913
01:17:48,111 --> 01:17:51,343
Good days and bad days.
-- Mostly good days.

914
01:17:52,342 --> 01:17:55,469
You?
-- Women, since 1973.

915
01:17:55,908 --> 01:17:57,794
Stage 4.

916
01:17:58,170 --> 01:18:01,611
Any advice?
-- You do not need.

917
01:18:01,612 --> 01:18:03,792
You learn a lot from me.

918
01:18:05,117 --> 01:18:10,507
Go pack your things, leave a note
behind and find a healthy woman.

919
01:18:12,723 --> 01:18:16,854
I love my wife
but I would not do it again.

920
01:18:19,473 --> 01:18:23,155
Nobody tells you that disease takes away all
so you love her.

921
01:18:23,642 --> 01:18:26,030
Her body, smile, memory.

922
01:18:26,912 --> 01:18:29,737
Soon she loses control
on her movements.

923
01:18:30,358 --> 01:18:32,833
Ultimately succeed dress anymore.

924
01:18:33,323 --> 01:18:36,418
Then the fun really begins.
Her mess cleanup.

925
01:18:36,949 --> 01:18:39,753
A stiff face, dementia ...

926
01:18:41,412 --> 01:18:44,180
It is not a disease but a Russian novel.

927
01:18:47,715 --> 01:18:50,815
I'm sorry and I'm not lying.

928
01:18:51,188 --> 01:18:53,280
Take care.

929
01:18:56,717 --> 01:18:59,819
Did you know that other people
who have Parkinson's?

930
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:01,906
How unusual.

931
01:19:01,907 --> 01:19:07,321
Great people.
They even run marathons.

932
01:19:07,322 --> 01:19:13,440
And one diving. They are furious.
So as to be sidelined. They are so cool.

933
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:18,880
I feel so good.
That was so long ago.

934
01:19:18,881 --> 01:19:23,334
And you brought me here.
It was for a convention, but ...

935
01:19:29,403 --> 01:19:34,980
I've been such a bitch.
And you even walked away.

936
01:19:34,981 --> 01:19:37,844
This looks like ...

937
01:19:37,845 --> 01:19:41,790
the first time in my life ...

938
01:19:42,343 --> 01:19:44,886
I do not feel lonely.

939
01:19:44,887 --> 01:19:48,805
That someone for me.
You know what that means?

940
01:19:54,526 --> 01:19:56,946
I love you.

941
01:19:58,210 --> 01:19:59,475
Really.

942
01:20:00,669 --> 01:20:04,501
I love you.

943
01:20:37,306 --> 01:20:39,405
What are you doing?

944
01:20:39,741 --> 01:20:43,731
Nothing.
-- I fell asleep.

945
01:20:48,287 --> 01:20:50,478
A drug for Parkinson?

946
01:20:50,724 --> 01:20:53,720
I ask.
-- I am a general physician.

947
01:20:53,755 --> 01:20:55,758
Twenty universities,
fifteen teaching hospitals ...

948
01:20:55,859 --> 01:20:59,515
every large medical company
working at it.

949
01:20:59,598 --> 01:21:03,409
From the moment they discover
You will adopt the first to sell me.

950
01:21:03,445 --> 01:21:05,699
But meanwhile they get worse.

951
01:21:05,871 --> 01:21:09,034
What is a teaching hospital?
What do you want me to do?

952
01:21:09,225 --> 01:21:10,884
Do you feel bad for Stan.

953
01:21:10,919 --> 01:21:14,291
If I need to know when each patient
I can not help get the day.

954
01:21:14,391 --> 01:21:18,651
What are the latest treatments?
-- No idea. Want a list?

955
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:20,362
Great. Tomorrow.

956
01:21:23,010 --> 01:21:26,912
Pfizer, you're a nice kid.
You're doing well.

957
01:21:27,409 --> 01:21:29,474
Want to make sure?
-- And a list of doctors ...

958
01:21:29,574 --> 01:21:32,851
and someone I can contact in case
The Ministry of Health.

959
01:21:34,395 --> 01:21:36,106
Of course.

960
01:21:57,665 --> 01:22:00,830
Do you see this green area here?
-- Yes.

961
01:22:01,596 --> 01:22:03,344
Excuse me.

962
01:22:15,364 --> 01:22:18,634
Good?

963
01:22:18,669 --> 01:22:20,207
Damn!

964
01:22:28,289 --> 01:22:30,814
I'm sorry Mr. Randall,
The credit card was rejected.

965
01:22:33,778 --> 01:22:37,429
The benefits of chelation are
each toxic metal is removed.

966
01:22:39,212 --> 01:22:43,657
Complete remission in patients
with an invasive cancer ...

967
01:22:43,826 --> 01:22:45,394
multiple sclerosis ...

968
01:22:45,430 --> 01:22:48,073
Damn.
-- Parkinson's, Lupus ...

969
01:22:48,783 --> 01:22:51,461
This therapy is life changing.

970
01:22:51,749 --> 01:22:53,763
He forgot world peace.

971
01:22:54,846 --> 01:22:57,443
So we flew 3000 kilometers ...

972
01:22:57,478 --> 01:23:00,214
to be told that our appointment moved?

973
01:23:01,088 --> 01:23:02,514
For two weeks?

974
01:23:03,251 --> 01:23:05,483
I want to talk with Dr. Rosenblum.

975
01:23:05,873 --> 01:23:07,813
Do I look like as if I care?

976
01:23:08,163 --> 01:23:11,459
I do not care where he is.
I do not understand how ...

977
01:23:13,311 --> 01:23:15,707
Call the head of the hospital.

978
01:23:15,802 --> 01:23:20,353
Our whole schedule is arranged forward
and then ... No, you do not understand!

979
01:23:20,387 --> 01:23:24,800
Two weeks! I want to head to speak.

980
01:23:32,628 --> 01:23:34,172
I am that people are so Sat
-- I want to go home.

981
01:23:34,207 --> 01:23:36,415
We do the test and then we go.
-- Randall ...

982
01:23:37,165 --> 01:23:41,107
All these new protocols ...
-- Try me now nothing to sell.

983
01:23:41,153 --> 01:23:43,627
Good? I'm not cured.
-- This is nonsense.

984
01:23:43,728 --> 01:23:46,632
This is nonsense.
I'm tired and bored.

985
01:23:46,729 --> 01:23:50,848
Why?
-- I have Parkinson's, it's not my life.

986
01:23:50,949 --> 01:23:53,501
Why do I need this project?

987
01:23:53,601 --> 01:23:55,860
Is what lies before me
not bad enough?

988
01:23:55,895 --> 01:23:58,312
Will not you heal?
-- No. That is you.

989
01:23:58,313 --> 01:24:01,278
It is important to you too suddenly.
-- What are you talking about?

990
01:24:01,379 --> 01:24:04,599
Will not you cure it?
-- Yes, despairing. This does not happen.

991
01:24:04,791 --> 01:24:06,922
News Item: There is no cure.

992
01:24:07,735 --> 01:24:11,192
You should know that I heal,
so you can keep me.

993
01:24:11,976 --> 01:24:13,415
That is ridiculous.

994
01:24:23,311 --> 01:24:25,831
Get your stuff out of my apartment.

995
01:24:25,945 --> 01:24:27,508
Why is that?

996
01:24:27,906 --> 01:24:29,686
You're on an express train, Randall.

997
01:24:29,721 --> 01:24:33,871
Chicago, management ...
Next stop: CEO.

998
01:24:34,455 --> 01:24:37,675
That is not a sick man who holds you back.
-- I can do whatever I want.

999
01:24:38,132 --> 01:24:39,928
I know.

1000
01:24:41,786 --> 01:24:43,845
You're a good person.

1001
01:24:44,249 --> 01:24:49,085
Even a great person,
much more than you admit.

1002
01:24:49,992 --> 01:24:52,975
Nobody wants to be the one who runs away.

1003
01:24:53,010 --> 01:24:56,569
I'm not running away.
-- It's not your choice.

1004
01:25:00,609 --> 01:25:04,416
Just go home,
Go even making love ...

1005
01:25:07,559 --> 01:25:09,721
and then you leave.

1006
01:25:23,677 --> 01:25:26,454
It's so crazy.
-- Stop.

1007
01:25:30,952 --> 01:25:33,103
You should not do.

1008
01:25:33,151 --> 01:25:35,034
Goodbye.

1009
01:27:08,630 --> 01:27:11,129
Hello, you speak with Mr. Murdock.

1010
01:27:11,486 --> 01:27:15,211
If I dont pick up,
I do not talk down.

1011
01:27:17,867 --> 01:27:20,191
This is really sad.

1012
01:27:21,309 --> 01:27:25,937
Do you want him in the trash or around it?

1013
01:27:32,449 --> 01:27:37,255
Stan, how are you?
-- That your girlfriend Lisa or Cassie ...

1014
01:27:37,356 --> 01:27:41,205
organized a pajama party tonight
with someone who has.

1015
01:27:41,306 --> 01:27:45,204
A pajama party?
-- Do all girls than pajamas?

1016
01:27:45,289 --> 01:27:49,050
Undress themselves?
-- You may want to take some vitamin V.

1017
01:27:49,116 --> 01:27:51,630
A blue pill.

1018
01:27:51,665 --> 01:27:55,306
I'd love to, but I can not.
-- What are you doing?

1019
01:27:55,441 --> 01:27:59,410
I agree, Jamie.
Yes, I'll be there. Bye.

1020
01:27:59,637 --> 01:28:04,436
We are going to show a pajama party.
Get ready because I have a pajamas.

1021
01:28:04,921 --> 01:28:08,192
I doubt, Jamie. A pajama party
has suffered since the fourth year.

1022
01:28:08,310 --> 01:28:10,082
What if people take off their clothes?

1023
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:13,621
I did not even come. You do.

1024
01:28:13,656 --> 01:28:16,382
People will see me naked. I
not even pee with others nearby.

1025
01:28:16,417 --> 01:28:19,726
You have a beautiful body.
How often do I say?

1026
01:28:19,761 --> 01:28:21,890
That confuses me greatly, as you say.

1027
01:28:25,129 --> 01:28:29,899
Look who's here:
Our working class.

1028
01:28:30,770 --> 01:28:32,484
Come inside.

1029
01:28:48,769 --> 01:28:53,732
How do I fucking a good doctor
with fifty patients per day?

1030
01:28:54,177 --> 01:28:58,750
Plus visit. And every day
phone calls with family.

1031
01:28:58,785 --> 01:29:00,161
The fucking idiots.

1032
01:29:00,196 --> 01:29:04,592
They say you're wrong,
because they've looked on the internet.

1033
01:29:05,965 --> 01:29:10,501
I fight about taxes,
on rules ...

1034
01:29:11,230 --> 01:29:15,808
The insurance are determined not to pay.

1035
01:29:16,806 --> 01:29:20,323
And the big law firms
just wait ...

1036
01:29:20,358 --> 01:29:25,649
Even bet that you
that one big mistake.

1037
01:29:27,124 --> 01:29:31,125
This was a job came calling.

1038
01:29:31,590 --> 01:29:33,940
People's lives improve.

1039
01:29:38,848 --> 01:29:41,124
And look at me ...

1040
01:29:43,590 --> 01:29:45,436
Here you are in God's name.

1041
01:29:45,471 --> 01:29:48,587
Randall, get off the floor.
Come on.

1042
01:29:48,646 --> 01:29:51,737
Come on!

1043
01:29:51,837 --> 01:29:54,073
Are you okay?
-- Go, my son.

1044
01:29:54,163 --> 01:29:56,414
Be fruitful and multiply.

1045
01:29:57,596 --> 01:30:02,410
Software is very unstable.

1046
01:30:02,649 --> 01:30:08,389
You never know how the funding expires.
It changes every six months.

1047
01:30:08,424 --> 01:30:10,762
You never know what these hospitals
want.

1048
01:30:10,797 --> 01:30:14,185
On one day, the peer--to--peer activity.

1049
01:30:14,251 --> 01:30:19,066
The other day it goes down.
Integration into existing infrastructure.

1050
01:30:21,252 --> 01:30:23,470
You can touch them, if you will.

1051
01:30:25,891 --> 01:30:27,224
Thanks.

1052
01:30:29,416 --> 01:30:31,090
No, no.
-- You'll see.

1053
01:30:31,125 --> 01:30:35,005
I do not think we should ...
-- Turn around.

1054
01:30:36,805 --> 01:30:39,133
This is my friend, Khae.

1055
01:30:40,824 --> 01:30:44,227
She comes from Thailand.
And am eager to Thai '...

1056
01:30:52,811 --> 01:30:54,854
It is "eager to Jamie.

1057
01:31:00,625 --> 01:31:02,489
So do I.

1058
01:31:11,809 --> 01:31:14,314
Did I mention that my company
stand on the Stock Exchange?

1059
01:31:14,811 --> 01:31:17,572
Exciting, you work on something for so long ...

1060
01:31:19,932 --> 01:31:24,242
You'll see how it is paying off ...

1061
01:31:24,558 --> 01:31:28,690
I have really mixed feelings about.

1062
01:31:33,202 --> 01:31:38,845
We feel like Jamie.
-- We find Jamie very much.

1063
01:31:42,773 --> 01:31:44,287
What is it?

1064
01:32:03,031 --> 01:32:05,339
Sorry.

1065
01:32:15,697 --> 01:32:18,441
We were just talking.

1066
01:32:19,379 --> 01:32:21,909
We should go.
-- Now?

1067
01:32:22,009 --> 01:32:24,974
Nice to have met.
We keep in touch.

1068
01:32:26,852 --> 01:32:28,977
It feels like an ice lolly.

1069
01:32:29,514 --> 01:32:32,934
I did not even know this could happen.
-- It is very rare.

1070
01:32:33,027 --> 01:32:34,751
But it happens.

1071
01:32:34,852 --> 01:32:37,036
Should I amputate?
-- Shut up and drive on.

1072
01:32:37,171 --> 01:32:39,145
Bad joke.

1073
01:32:39,212 --> 01:32:41,868
Sorry, I wanted to switch.

1074
01:32:43,039 --> 01:32:44,564
It's so fucked.

1075
01:32:44,876 --> 01:32:48,467
It was really the best night of my life.

1076
01:32:49,036 --> 01:32:50,594
That's great.
-- Seriously.

1077
01:32:50,984 --> 01:32:52,938
I'm not kidding.
That I owe to you.

1078
01:32:53,222 --> 01:32:56,449
I never thought I
such an experience would experience.

1079
01:32:56,484 --> 01:33:01,331
This is incredible.
Why I am so happy.

1080
01:33:01,397 --> 01:33:06,551
Because I've fucked that girl.

1081
01:33:06,639 --> 01:33:11,341
I thought to myself, "this feeling".
I feel absolutely nothing.

1082
01:33:11,474 --> 01:33:12,992
That's great, Josh.

1083
01:33:13,027 --> 01:33:15,901
All those years I was so jealous of you
numb that you had sex.

1084
01:33:15,936 --> 01:33:17,791
And now I feel less sex.

1085
01:33:17,826 --> 01:33:20,839
At that moment I realized,
if I had not experienced ...

1086
01:33:20,875 --> 01:33:24,194
I did not know how much I did not want.

1087
01:33:25,936 --> 01:33:28,449
Now I can return home to Farrah ...

1088
01:33:28,484 --> 01:33:34,233
and I can for the first time in my life
feel good.

1089
01:33:34,798 --> 01:33:38,900
All because of you Jamie.
All thanks to my big brother Jamie ..

1090
01:33:38,917 --> 01:33:40,986
with that huge cock that does not want to be weak.

1091
01:33:41,087 --> 01:33:45,473
Thank you, brother.
Sorry, my fault.

1092
01:33:48,767 --> 01:33:52,003
And my shares of Pfizer
are 40%.

1093
01:33:58,644 --> 01:34:02,572
Can I help you?
-- I have a reaction to medication.

1094
01:34:02,672 --> 01:34:05,496
What reaction?

1095
01:34:10,589 --> 01:34:12,985
Sit down.
We'll be with you

1096
01:34:22,052 --> 01:34:24,257
What?

1097
01:34:26,424 --> 01:34:28,864
Chicago.

1098
01:34:29,132 --> 01:34:31,771
I got it.

1099
01:34:32,324 --> 01:34:36,076
Congratulations.
That's incredible.

1100
01:34:36,177 --> 01:34:40,271
Jamie, that's what you've always wanted.
That's incredible.

1101
01:34:40,655 --> 01:34:42,870
I am very proud of you.
I am not surprised.

1102
01:34:42,905 --> 01:34:44,938
But I'm very proud of you.

1103
01:34:45,039 --> 01:34:48,437
Mom and dad are ecstatic.
Jamie Randall made it.

1104
01:34:49,001 --> 01:34:52,578
Unbelievable.
You should be very proud of yourself.

1105
01:34:59,326 --> 01:35:01,545
Boeuf Bourguignon if they serve ...

1106
01:35:01,646 --> 01:35:03,933
they should at least
serve a good Burgundy.

1107
01:35:04,084 --> 01:35:06,827
Or a Pinot.

1108
01:35:19,316 --> 01:35:21,484
This is Jeremy.

1109
01:35:25,672 --> 01:35:29,547
I'm going to the car.
-- Okay, Justin.

1110
01:35:41,218 --> 01:35:44,465
I tried ...

1111
01:35:50,517 --> 01:35:54,532
I tried to call you.
-- I am dating someone.

1112
01:35:54,632 --> 01:35:56,301
I see.

1113
01:36:03,761 --> 01:36:06,454
How are you?

1114
01:36:06,761 --> 01:36:10,971
Good.

1115
01:36:12,477 --> 01:36:16,110
Come on.
-- I gotta go.

1116
01:36:27,250 --> 01:36:30,567
It's nice to see you again.

1117
01:36:34,461 --> 01:36:39,364
You kill me, Randall.
-- There he is.

1118
01:36:39,399 --> 01:36:41,564
Ready to celebrate?

1119
01:36:44,948 --> 01:36:48,809
How are you?
-- What do you celebrate?

1120
01:36:48,844 --> 01:36:51,262
This young rock star is Chicago
take by storm.

1121
01:36:56,555 --> 01:36:58,909
You go to Chicago.

1122
01:37:01,835 --> 01:37:04,419
Congratulations.
Good to see you, Bruce.

1123
01:37:04,455 --> 01:37:06,475
I gotta go.
-- Good to see you, Maggie.

1124
01:37:06,908 --> 01:37:09,474
Peace.

1125
01:37:15,033 --> 01:37:16,801
I knew it.
Did not I tell you?

1126
01:37:17,078 --> 01:37:19,846
Tell him I said so.
-- You should have bet.

1127
01:37:19,898 --> 01:37:21,870
Where do you live?
-- In the center, perhaps.

1128
01:37:22,098 --> 01:37:24,807
Somewhere far away from my family.
-- In the center?

1129
01:37:25,138 --> 01:37:28,695
You have to go to the north.
Pussies.

1130
01:37:29,514 --> 01:37:33,151
Bistros, bars and pussies.

1131
01:37:34,314 --> 01:37:38,675
Or in your area. What outside
the city. We'll drink a beer once ...

1132
01:37:38,776 --> 01:37:42,184
You do not want to do.
-- Why not?

1133
01:37:50,549 --> 01:37:53,822
I get a big salary increase.

1134
01:37:54,328 --> 01:37:56,039
You're kidding.
-- Thanks to you.

1135
01:37:56,643 --> 01:37:58,128
Those bastards.

1136
01:37:58,163 --> 01:38:00,374
I had never had Chicago.

1137
01:38:00,475 --> 01:38:02,483
I'm far too valuable to the front.
-- I do not believe.

1138
01:38:02,518 --> 01:38:04,325
Give me some credit.

1139
01:38:04,426 --> 01:38:09,601
There is need for a trained eye for talent
at such an idiot like you to recognize.

1140
01:38:10,222 --> 01:38:13,258
I do not understand.
-- Not so naive. I did not go to Chicago.

1141
01:38:13,358 --> 01:38:16,078
I wish that you would think so
you would go to Chicago.

1142
01:38:16,191 --> 01:38:17,531
So you get one in the round would work
to get there.

1143
01:38:17,644 --> 01:38:20,379
Bruce, this is unbelievable.
-- I love the street.

1144
01:38:20,414 --> 01:38:25,223
I love stinky motels and country lanes
and small shops.

1145
01:38:25,362 --> 01:38:28,079
I like that.
Why would I want to live in my own house?

1146
01:38:28,179 --> 01:38:30,482
What I pay for. Why should I
want to see my kids play baseball?

1147
01:38:30,517 --> 01:38:33,070
Why in the same bed
if my wife want to sleep?

1148
01:38:33,105 --> 01:38:35,834
Why the hell would I want to do?

1149
01:39:11,573 --> 01:39:14,622
Talk?

1150
01:39:15,694 --> 01:39:18,672
I'm Maggie Murdock.

1151
01:39:18,773 --> 01:39:23,268
So I'll have great sex
with ...

1152
01:39:23,853 --> 01:39:26,717
What's your name?

1153
01:39:26,817 --> 01:39:28,868
Jamie and some more.

1154
01:39:28,903 --> 01:39:34,728
We take it on, so it's always
I know how terribly sexy. Was.

1155
01:39:35,467 --> 01:39:39,679
Children, when you watch this, put it
now in mummy's secret hiding place ...

1156
01:39:39,779 --> 01:39:43,615
or you will regret it.
There will be consequences ...

1157
01:39:43,918 --> 01:39:46,118
What else?

1158
01:39:51,571 --> 01:39:52,945
Just how happy I am.

1159
01:39:54,975 --> 01:39:57,093
Now, at this time.

1160
01:39:59,173 --> 01:40:01,527
How the light illuminates your face ...

1161
01:40:03,813 --> 01:40:06,211
There is a little breeze through the window ...

1162
01:40:08,457 --> 01:40:12,614
it does not matter if I have 10,000 of
get these moments ...

1163
01:40:14,971 --> 01:40:17,494
or just this one but, because ...

1164
01:40:20,406 --> 01:40:22,803
all the same.

1165
01:40:24,342 --> 01:40:27,704
Yes, just that.

1166
01:40:28,651 --> 01:40:31,114
Now, this moment.

1167
01:40:35,653 --> 01:40:38,414
I have this.

1168
01:40:54,619 --> 01:40:57,285
Where is she?

1169
01:41:28,699 --> 01:41:31,455
Come on.

1170
01:42:01,535 --> 01:42:06,125
Want to talk to you.

1171
01:42:28,596 --> 01:42:31,808
Open the door.

1172
01:42:38,087 --> 01:42:39,975
Sorry.

1173
01:42:41,544 --> 01:42:43,790
I need you.
-- Please leave.

1174
01:42:43,825 --> 01:42:47,380
I've driven very long to say.
-- Should I be impressed?

1175
01:42:47,802 --> 01:42:50,044
I do not know.
Yes.

1176
01:42:50,643 --> 01:42:53,853
Get off the bus,
then we can talk.

1177
01:42:53,888 --> 01:42:56,593
Just for a moment.
-- We are on track.

1178
01:42:56,844 --> 01:43:00,055
Five minutes.
Please.

1179
01:43:00,169 --> 01:43:02,457
You do not really like five minutes?

1180
01:43:02,567 --> 01:43:07,238
He's cute.
-- Five minutes.

1181
01:43:07,319 --> 01:43:09,809
Five minutes, I'll let you go.

1182
01:43:18,793 --> 01:43:21,791
I'm an asshole.

1183
01:43:23,059 --> 01:43:27,399
I know I'm an asshole.

1184
01:43:30,116 --> 01:43:34,551
Because ...

1185
01:43:36,585 --> 01:43:43,243
I have never in my life
given to anyone or anything.

1186
01:43:43,515 --> 01:43:47,833
Everyone just accepted that.
Like, "That's Jamie."

1187
01:43:51,320 --> 01:43:55,512
But you ...

1188
01:43:58,218 --> 01:44:01,234
You ...

1189
01:44:05,063 --> 01:44:07,620
You ...

1190
01:44:10,826 --> 01:44:13,858
You saw me like that.

1191
01:44:15,951 --> 01:44:18,900
I never knew someone ...

1192
01:44:19,580 --> 01:44:22,374
who truly believed that I ...

1193
01:44:22,871 --> 01:44:25,345
enough.

1194
01:44:26,175 --> 01:44:28,443
Until I had met.

1195
01:44:35,472 --> 01:44:38,040
And then you let me believe that.

1196
01:44:40,834 --> 01:44:47,002
So, unfortunately I need you.

1197
01:44:48,094 --> 01:44:50,652
And you need me.

1198
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:55,728
False.
-- Welwaar.

1199
01:44:55,734 --> 01:44:58,655
Welwaar.
-- Say no more.

1200
01:44:58,822 --> 01:45:00,232
You need someone who takes care of you.

1201
01:45:00,236 --> 01:45:02,844
False.
-- Everyone needs it.

1202
01:45:11,049 --> 01:45:13,811
I will give you more than you need me.

1203
01:45:15,417 --> 01:45:17,478
That's good.
-- No, that's not good.

1204
01:45:18,530 --> 01:45:21,404
That's not fair.

1205
01:45:22,909 --> 01:45:28,080
I must draw near to places.
-- Since you're going.

1206
01:45:28,745 --> 01:45:31,320
Maybe I'll wear it.

1207
01:45:36,774 --> 01:45:40,700
I can not ask of you.

1208
01:45:41,581 --> 01:45:44,279
You did not do so.

1209
01:45:51,714 --> 01:45:53,779
Let's just say ...

1210
01:45:53,880 --> 01:45:59,239
that in an alternate universe
as a couple, like us.

1211
01:45:59,339 --> 01:46:02,804
Only it is healthy and he's perfect.

1212
01:46:03,155 --> 01:46:07,693
And their world is about how much money
holiday will give them out.

1213
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:12,556
Who has a bad mood that day or they
feel guilty that they have a maid.

1214
01:46:15,403 --> 01:46:18,063
Those people would not be me.

1215
01:46:18,581 --> 01:46:20,994
I want us.

1216
01:46:22,901 --> 01:46:27,998
You, this.

1217
01:46:44,411 --> 01:46:48,821
I was always care about who
I would be if I was an adult.

1218
01:46:50,707 --> 01:46:53,573
How much money I would earn, or ...

1219
01:46:55,154 --> 01:46:58,159
I might ever be something big.

1220
01:46:59,170 --> 01:47:02,356
Sometimes, the things you most want,
that never happen.

1221
01:47:03,356 --> 01:47:08,215
And sometimes it happens the one you
never expected.

1222
01:47:09,257 --> 01:47:13,026
As my job in Chicago to give up
and everything ...

1223
01:47:14,130 --> 01:47:18,243
and the decision to stay.
And medical school applications.

1224
01:47:19,211 --> 01:47:23,244
I do not know.
You meet thousands of people ...

1225
01:47:24,215 --> 01:47:26,358
and none of them really touches you.

1226
01:47:28,795 --> 01:47:31,149
And then you meet a person ...

1227
01:47:32,296 --> 01:47:35,044
and your life has changed.

1228
01:47:35,146 --> 01:47:37,650
Forever.
