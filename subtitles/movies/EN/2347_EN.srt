THE EDUCATION OF A FAIRY

2
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:37,133
He'd been chatting with the giant
the whole evening.

3
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,058
They had danced and talked.

4
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:43,219
The inexperienced fairy was worried.
Her groom was not very smart.

5
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,452
So she decided to ask
the old fairy for help,

6
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,012
but she took forever to come
because she rode

7
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,410
a broomstick
that didn't work too well.

8
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,650
Know what the old fairy did?

9
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,170
-How do fairies fuck?
-What?

10
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,855
Do they fuck like the rest of us?

11
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,698
No more stories today.

12
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,895
Go to sleep.

13
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,778
Fairies have a very
complicated sex life.

14
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:03,335
TWO YEARS EARLIER

15
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,008
Mom.

16
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,815
Yesterday I saw
an American warship.

17
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,413
Grandpa took me.

18
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,379
They land planes like mine on it

19
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,689
at a thousand an hour.

20
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,128
Don't be a nuisance, Raul.

21
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,176
<i>Captain Tordesillas and his crew</i>

22
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,900
<i>welcome you aboard</i>
<i>this McDonald's...</i>

23
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,658
<i>Excuse me...</i>.

24
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,811
<i>...this McDonnell Douglas jet</i>
<i>owned by Air Wing Inc.</i>

25
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,254
<i>en route to Barcelona</i>.

26
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,458
Mom, she said McDonald's!

27
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,015
<i>For safety reasons</i>

28
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,810
<i>and to avoid interference</i>
<i>with our instrumentation...</i>

29
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,769
I shot him.

30
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,530
-Mr. Azpilicueta?
-Follow me, please.

31
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,897
-Have you got a car?
-No, have you?

32
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,616
Let me give you a ride. Please,
it would be a pleasure. This way.

33
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,369
Are you a singer?

34
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,009
No.

35
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,898
-Come on, Mom!
-Where are you headed?

36
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,779
It's okay, I have time.
They'll wait for me.

37
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,772
The head office, sir?

38
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,737
Or shall I stop at the hotel?

39
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,094
No, take us first

40
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,249
to Ferran Agullo St.

41
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,573
It's me, Azpilicueta.
Nobody came to pick me up!

42
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,135
Absolutely not.

43
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,768
No talking on the phone while driving.
Not with me in the car,

44
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,009
especially not with kids.

45
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,412
Has it been a long time...?

46
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,612
Don't feel sorry for me.
We were divorced.

47
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,929
I barely knew him.
He was always on duty.

48
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,734
He died for Italy.

49
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,373
He died for nothing.

50
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,169
I'm single.

51
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,377
Is your father dead too?

52
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,609
Yes, he is.

53
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,498
-Was he a war pilot too?
-No.

54
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,095
Then what was he?

55
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,409
He was a natural father.

56
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,972
What's a natural father?

57
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,415
A father
with a different last name.

58
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,050
His job is to make children for women
who don't want husbands.

59
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,451
Like professional parents.

60
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,019
What are you telling him?

61
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,249
The truth.

62
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,020
They take you to movies,
for strolls, amusement parks...

63
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,011
They're more fun.

64
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,336
Why didn't I have one?

65
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,052
What do you do?

66
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,012
No, please. You first.

67
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,659
I'm an ornithologist.

68
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,608
You know how a carrier pigeon
finds his way home?

69
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,171
He breathes in odors as he flies

70
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,695
and follows them back
in the opposite order.

71
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,772
"The Olfactory Map."

72
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,576
I've proven that
when deprived of smell

73
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,378
they can't find their way back.

74
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,575
What do you do?

75
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,539
I'm into toys.

76
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,009
You make toys?

77
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,449
I used to.

78
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,179
Ever heard
of "Snow White's Mirror"?

79
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,052
"The Smile of the Wolf"?

80
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,928
-"Our World"?
-I have that one.

81
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,853
This morning,
at exactly 10:50 A.M.,

82
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,729
I fell in love.

83
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,933
With two people at once.

84
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,298
Very kind, thank you.

85
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,292
Here's your carrier pigeon.

86
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,579
Did he catch a cold
on the way?

87
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,492
I hope not.
But with all this rain,

88
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,218
his Olfactory Map...

89
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,334
Here's the message.

90
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,936
"Sorry I can't come,
but you don't exist.

91
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,977
You got out while Raul
was still asleep

92
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,495
so he made up the story
that you were an elf

93
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,696
and that you'd vanished.
For my own part,

94
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,569
though I know you're real,
I won't see you because I shouldn't.

95
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,654
I hope you understand."

96
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,094
I'm so sorry you couldn't make it.

97
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,769
I really am.

98
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,251
You may stand.

99
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,689
Ingrid,

100
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:25,250
do you take Nicolas
as your husband?

101
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,853
I do.

102
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,495
Nicolas,

103
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,295
do you take Ingrid

104
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:36,009
as your bride?

105
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,615
I do.

106
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,493
They're very smart.

107
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,939
They like white wine.

108
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,694
But we don't know
if they distinguish colors.

109
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,258
Crows are really great.

110
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,500
Though crows
have their problems too.

111
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,374
That's it!
Now I understand!

112
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,775
It's of no use to them!

113
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,975
What is?

114
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,418
A plastic bottle to crows.

115
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,569
What bottle?

116
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,174
They recognize everything:
the tree, the boy, the nuts...

117
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,093
100% correct on the test.

118
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,855
I show them
any other photo twice

119
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,739
and they peck three times.
Except with the bottle.

120
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,849
Now I know why.

121
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,009
Why?

122
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,499
It's of no use to them.

123
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,494
Great! Of course.
It's of no use to them. Great.

124
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,735
They don't need

125
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,253
the tractor either.

126
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,409
So?

127
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,373
But they recognize it,
dammit.

128
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,819
I love you, sweetheart.

129
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,050
Me too, but that's no explanation.

130
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,695
Maybe the tractor

131
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,373
-bothers them.
-Of course!

132
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,209
Yes!

133
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,177
You're the love of my life.
You deserve a prize.

134
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,375
I do?

135
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,214
Sorry, son.

136
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,173
It's the golf course.

137
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,535
Our dogs eat
the poison they use.

138
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,732
We can't move our property
anywhere else.

139
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,579
And we can't not have dogs...

140
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,211
HERE ALSO LIES CAPTAIN
C. ROCCO DI CASTELGRANDE

141
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,819
I know my father isn't there.

142
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:12,694
Not in Milan, either. They buried
an empty coffin with an Italian flag.

143
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,533
Make no mistake.

144
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,057
He disintegrated.
That's the magic of aviators.

145
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,209
When they die in the air,
they disappear.

146
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,489
The flight shortens

147
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,855
-their trip to heaven.
-They take the plane?

148
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,450
That we don't know for sure.

149
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,974
Opinions vary.

150
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,855
But yours, at least, will have his
favorite smokes and a dog at his side.

151
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,259
Better than nothing.

152
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,815
I've thought it over
and the answer is no.

153
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,738
You don't want me
to adopt you?

154
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,973
Pladevall is a boring name for a kid.
I prefer Rocco di Castelgrande.

155
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,653
Yeah? Why?

156
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,010
It's hard to pronounce. I have
to explain to people it's Italian

157
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,216
and that I can be a viscount,
like Grandpa.

158
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,491
Was your father a viscount
or just natural?

159
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,412
No, he wasn't a viscount.

160
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,332
I have my mother's last name.

161
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,094
Remember natural parents
don't give names.

162
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,889
I like you being natural too.

163
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,573
Okay, that's fine with me.

164
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,454
But I'd like you to hold on
to the papers

165
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,692
because maybe in a few years,
before you get divorced

166
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,897
or become a viscount or
a natural or whatever you decide,

167
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,535
you might change your mind
and want me to adopt you.

168
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,093
I doubt it, but okay.

169
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,254
But Pladevall...

170
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,133
Of the things you've taught me,
which is more important?

171
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,734
Riding a bike
or listening to the trees?

172
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,733
You can do both.
You don't have to choose.

173
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,089
An owl in an incubator learns to sing
like the bird that cares for it.

174
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,609
-So?
-I don't know.

175
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,816
But they won't let Mom prove it

176
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,732
and she's pretty upset.

177
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,938
Isn't Ingrid great?

178
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,258
Murderer! Ogre!

179
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,568
Are you nuts or what?

180
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,968
He eats fairies.

181
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,698
He's picking mushrooms, silly.

182
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,418
You said warlocks disguise themselves
as people picking mushrooms

183
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,817
and eat fairies in omelettes
to get their powers.

184
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,734
Okay, but not all of them.
Only some.

185
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,209
How can I tell the difference,
smart guy?

186
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,848
When you're older
I'll teach you how.

187
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,817
-Fairies too?
-Fairies too.

188
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,689
You see?

189
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,689
This tree was about to fall
and the giants propped it up.

190
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,849
You're right!

191
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,534
Trees propped up by giants
make more miracles

192
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,219
by feeding on their strength.

193
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,093
If you hug them tightly

194
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,454
you can wish
for anything you want.

195
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,814
Anything.

196
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,372
This was our cave.

197
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,654
Girls and adults
were not allowed.

198
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,299
Only extraterrestrials.

199
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,054
The ones on TV,
with their pinkies in the air.

200
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:30,136
We needed the aliens to free us
from those trying to make us study

201
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,256
and wash our hands
and stuff like that.

202
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,969
Nico,

203
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,459
can I call you Dad
in front of my friends?

204
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,940
Okay. But only on even days.

205
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,091
Do birds really think it's an owl?

206
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,491
Yes, of course they do.

207
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,849
They're dumb.

208
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,378
No, they focus on the shape.

209
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,209
Look.

210
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,219
When it flies like this,

211
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,735
the birds see it
and think it's a hawk.

212
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,652
And they hide.

213
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,376
But if it flies the other way,

214
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,169
they think it's a goose
with a long neck

215
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,539
and they pay it no mind.

216
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,729
Excuse me,

217
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,814
sorry to interrupt.

218
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:30,258
I was wondering if my Olfactory Map
comes through here or through here.

219
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,409
I got lost.

220
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,651
TWO YEARS LATER

221
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,014
You snore.

222
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,733
You snore a lot. it's awful.

223
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,734
I've never snored before.

224
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,411
It's unbearable, I swear.

225
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,051
You should sleep in your studio.

226
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,974
Don't be ridiculous.

227
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,209
You're joking...

228
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,533
Want to hear that snoring

229
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,928
that bothered you so much?

230
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,249
I'm turning 40 soon.

231
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,059
I'm sorry to hear that,
but right now you're acting like

232
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,255
a spoiled little girl.

233
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,178
No, it's not that.

234
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,770
I'm glad you still want
to sleep with me,

235
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,573
but I'm afraid someday...

236
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:51,298
It's been beautiful.
Intense, passionate...

237
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,499
I'd rather stop now,
with nice memories.

238
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:59,699
Why do I have to listen to this crap?
What are you talking about?

239
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,533
Why would we stop?
We're happier than ever.

240
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,815
Things are great.

241
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,811
I married you for life.

242
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,369
Nicolas,

243
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,133
we have to separate.

244
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,129
Well...

245
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,298
Need anything
from the supermarket?

246
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,970
Nothing. We don't need anything.

247
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,731
-How are you paying?
-What?

248
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,335
Cash or charge?

249
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,609
Excuse me.

250
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,414
How about stopping by
after your shift, gorgeous?

251
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,569
No, I can't.

252
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,809
It's your loss.

253
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,929
Too bad for me.
Can I go back to work?

254
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,658
This is a serious infraction.

255
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,849
<i>Private conversations</i>

256
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,056
at work are prohibited.

257
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,575
I'll look the other way
this time.

258
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,459
<i>Isn't that nice of me?</i>

259
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,690
You give me such a hard on...

260
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,333
I'm horny as hell.

261
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,494
<i>Is there someone else?</i>

262
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,809
Besides, you can't decide
for the both of us.

263
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,299
There must be someone else.

264
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:57,499
If there is, take your time with him.
I don't care, I'll deal with it.

265
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,457
But I don't want to split up.

266
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,379
We'll have to tell Raul.

267
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:16,691
Don't worry, I'll do it.
I'll find a way.

268
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,571
No, please.
Let me talk to Raul.

269
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,615
My friend Narcis Mompo

270
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,213
says that during wars

271
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,496
journalists matter more
than pilots

272
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,059
because more of them die

273
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,255
and they keep the rest

274
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,409
of us informed.

275
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,258
His father's a journalist,
you know.

276
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,092
Offer yours some sausage.

277
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,852
No, he said no.

278
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,820
Today they bombed hell
and a lot of devils got killed.

279
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,178
He deserves a medal.

280
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,848
Let's see.

281
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,857
By the powers invested in me,
I declare you

282
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,135
Knight of the Air.

283
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,173
Here, put this on.

284
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,329
Me?

285
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:17,298
By the so and so powers I declare
you Knight of the Natural Fathers.

286
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,734
Go wash your hands.

287
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,970
-How was Barcelona?
-Fine. Boring.

288
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,653
Running around all day.

289
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,338
Don't say anything to Raul.

290
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,819
-Let's wait.
-Why?

291
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,529
Just because.

292
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,929
You changed your mind?

293
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,769
No.

294
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,734
I don't know what I want.

295
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:28,896
When will you know?
I need to know approximately

296
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,539
the day, the hour, the second...

297
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,889
I love you.

298
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,933
You're playing with me.

299
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,456
You're leaving me
because you love me?

300
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,533
I'm hurting myself as well.

301
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,137
Why doesn't Dad sleep with you?
Are you angry

302
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,858
-with him?
-No, why?

303
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,769
He snores, that's all.

304
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,408
I snore too.
The men in this house snore.

305
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,729
We like to.

306
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,253
You should snore too.

307
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,494
What does this mean?

308
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,089
"Face the world with ambition,

309
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,933
clear objectives
and never flee conflict."

310
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,969
What?

311
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,096
What does that mean?

312
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,534
Who told you that?

313
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,931
Narcis Mompo's dad wrote it on a sign
and posted it in his bedroom.

314
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,819
They are such buffoons...

315
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,050
-And they say fairies don't exist.
-And irresponsible.

316
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,778
Fairies don't exist?

317
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,290
First of all,
what fairies do you mean?

318
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,729
Which fairies?

319
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,891
The fat, clumsy ones
with magic wands

320
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,539
who turn pumpkins
into carriages?

321
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,209
Of course they don't exist anymore.
But what about the others?

322
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,693
The ones who get up every morning
to go to work or study at school?

323
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,936
Where would mankind be
without fairies?

324
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,857
Fairies are everywhere, but they hide
because they're afraid of Mompo

325
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,817
and all the others out there
like him.

326
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,777
-But Narcis...
-Your friend Narcis

327
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,692
may be great at Nintendo,
but he's absurd being

328
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,259
"with clear objectives"

329
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,899
and ambition and what else?

330
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,379
"Never flee conflict."

331
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,496
Right. I'd like to see that.

332
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,729
That's enough.

333
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,295
We need to find
a fairy quick, Dad.

334
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,498
Just to make sure.

335
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,054
Monica Sanchez.

336
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,574
Come through.

337
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,974
Closer.

338
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,373
I heard you're surprised your boy
doesn't want to see you.

339
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,016
What can I say?
That's life.

340
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,771
He's all right,
if that worries you.

341
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:48,730
Even better than all right.
You get my drift?

342
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,175
He's got another thing going.

343
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,418
He's getting his.

344
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,492
He asked for a different girl.
Straight up.

345
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,449
Hello.

346
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,769
Hello.

347
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,410
-Are you collecting them?
-What?

348
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:04,492
The slippers.
You bought three pairs last week.

349
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,492
You're a physiognomist.

350
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:11,297
I remember the people
who buy odd things.

351
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,409
Weird stuff, huh?

352
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,535
Very weird.

353
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,934
Stuff for loners

354
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,249
and weirdos.

355
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,815
Loners and weirdos.

356
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,899
I can explain.

357
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,453
I don't trust rubber mats,

358
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,576
so I use the slippers
in the shower.

359
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,129
But they get moldy.

360
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,848
They rot in three days.
There you have it.

361
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,057
Of course, Mr. Pladevall.

362
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,255
You know my name?
Oh, you saw it on my card.

363
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,608
Being a cashier
isn't very stimulating.

364
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,613
So I memorize clients' names,
even how many articles.

365
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,409
Yours is unique.

366
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,411
It's Iraqi, Sezar.

367
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,333
But they misspelled it.

368
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,735
It's strange for a woman.

369
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,413
No, it's...

370
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,208
resounding.

371
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,291
Nicolas Pladevall!
It's me, Pere Mompo.

372
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,735
His son and mine
are good friends.

373
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,933
And your son can sure use
someone like Narcis around.

374
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,453
To wake him up.

375
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,974
When can you bring

376
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,698
your wife for dinner?

377
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,976
Get rid of that scooter.

378
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,217
It'll just give you more trouble.

379
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,736
You're lucky I was still there.

380
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,217
It's my wife's car.

381
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,449
She's out with her friends.

382
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,095
They're in Barcelona,
at the theater.

383
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,249
They enjoy that.

384
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,614
Sounds great.

385
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,898
Thanks for giving me a lift.

386
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,528
There was nobody left there.

387
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,656
No, sweetie, thank you.

388
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,012
I'm glad you finally decided

389
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,454
to be a team player.

390
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,689
There is no team.

391
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,138
My scooter broke down,
that's all.

392
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,454
What are you doing?

393
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,372
Easy, honey, I'm not an ogre.

394
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,291
Shall we go back
and start your scooter?

395
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,417
It's in better shape than my balls.

396
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,658
You can't fool me, college girl.

397
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,654
You can't fool me.

398
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,409
I didn't finish school,

399
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,377
little Arab, but I ain't stupid.

400
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,733
Know what that means?

401
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,092
It means I know you're horny

402
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,979
and you made up all that
about your scooter

403
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:41,337
-because you want it.
-Take me home.

404
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,933
Don't fuck around.

405
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,579
You can't leave me hanging.

406
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,653
It wouldn't be fair.

407
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,291
You want me to force you?

408
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,329
Where should I stick it,
you bitch?

409
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,652
Why are you making me do this?

410
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,690
Goddammit! Goddammit!

411
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,817
Why do I have to force things?

412
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,172
I have a wife, a daughter.

413
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,454
Look how hard I am.

414
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:17,018
It's a joyous occasion,
take a look.

415
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,848
Are they stupid?

416
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,248
I'll kill them.

417
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,489
You wanna see?

418
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,769
Stop! He's crazy.

419
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,095
Come here.

420
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:33,375
-What are you doing?
-Have you no shame?

421
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,178
-Shame for what?
-For being a whore!

422
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,093
Were you gonna fuck him?

423
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,375
Fucking your boss!

424
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,609
No, I wasn't!

425
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,415
You'll kill her!

426
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,295
That's for Kateb.

427
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:59,859
You'll kill me over
that scumbag Kateb?

428
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,690
SIX MONTHS EARLIER

429
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,495
May I?

430
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,809
Good news?

431
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,574
Hopefully.

432
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,849
Where are you from?

433
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,449
I'm Algerian.

434
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,619
I'm from all over the world.

435
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:26,973
Any city with cash to be made.
And girls.

436
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,575
Girls like you.

437
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,214
Or even less attractive.

438
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,809
Why are you in Spain?

439
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,215
I'm going to Paris.

440
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:36,334
I'm passing through. My grandparents
were Spanish. Republicans.

441
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,976
There aren't any left.
There's a king.

442
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,689
But there were.

443
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,659
You know a lot.

444
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:43,975
You're smart.

445
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,129
You like my singing?

446
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,449
Three months...

447
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,333
four months tops.

448
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:18,090
You know I can't stay any longer.

449
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,209
You'll stay

450
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,615
as long

451
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,809
as I say.

452
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,619
-Police!
-What's going on?

453
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:51,929
Kateb!

454
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,129
And no laughing.

455
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,009
Laughing, sneezing, coughing,

456
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,579
lifting weights and running

457
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,535
are all really bad
for broken ribs.

458
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,692
And you have three.

459
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:11,214
If you can keep from laughing
and sneezing and all that,

460
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:14,178
they'll heal themselves.
What's your profession?

461
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,375
Cashier.

462
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,294
There's no danger.

463
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,488
I don't laugh much,

464
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:22,857
but I have to pass heavy cases
of bottled water

465
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,375
across the bar code reader.

466
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,774
That hadn't occurred to me.

467
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,935
Well, don't worry.

468
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:33,012
I'll sign an injury leave
and fax it to your work.

469
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,615
Thank you very much.

470
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,089
Do you live alone?

471
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,898
My partner is away.

472
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:45,059
Well, I'm leaving too.

473
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,808
Or do you want to talk?

474
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,539
What really happened?

475
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,898
I fell down the stairs.

476
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,017
I advise you
to quit fooling around

477
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,249
and file a complaint.

478
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:59,895
Thanks for the advice.

479
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,255
In case you change your mind...

480
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:09,091
Send the fax
to Mr. Matarredona,

481
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,454
the store manager.

482
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,215
I will.

483
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,974
-Hello?
<i>-Franz?</i>

484
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:41,216
It's Nicolas, Ingrid's husband.

485
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,812
Nicolas Pladevall, the toy man!

486
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:47,816
I'm planning a surprise party
for Ingrid's birthday.

487
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,893
Luisa, what are you doing here?

488
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,176
Preparing your party, of course!

489
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,409
What's wrong?

490
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,698
I had no idea.

491
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,856
-Can I help?
-No, thanks.

492
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,374
Entertain your friends.

493
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,059
Was bringing them a good idea?

494
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,134
It was a great idea.

495
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:54,452
Tonight's story isn't a fairy tale,
it's really happening.

496
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:59,019
I fell in love with you and your mom
on that plane, that will never change,

497
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:02,378
even if Ingrid meets someone,
even if you spend

498
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,417
all your time with Narcis Mompo

499
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:06,889
and lose interest
in my fairy tales.

500
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:12,531
I'll always be your second Father,

501
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:15,011
even if your mom finds a third.

502
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:18,340
And we'll see each other
whenever you want,

503
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,820
as long as you want me
to keep being...

504
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,693
your natural father.

505
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:58,569
-Going to the supermarket?
-How do you know?

506
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:02,093
You always have that expression
when you do.

507
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:03,769
You want me to stay?

508
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:09,294
Bring raspberry vinegar
to braise the meat.

509
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,530
You're the love of my life,
bird lady.

510
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,488
What?

511
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:33,219
If they're out,

512
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:34,893
get the cider-flavored.

513
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:36,854
Sure you want me to go?

514
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:43,250
You want a piece?
It looks good.

515
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:44,615
Too much fat.

516
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:48,170
Children need to grow,
not get fat like pigs.

517
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:54,016
Okay, let's begin the story.

518
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:56,695
-Plug in the mosquito-killer.
-Right, okay.

519
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:04,489
So...

520
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:07,411
Once upon a time at sea,

521
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:10,936
near Corsica, a family
of dolphins named Alcaraz...

522
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,453
Like the pharmaceutical?

523
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:15,575
Yeah. Well, we don't know.

524
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:18,379
Dolphins name themselves
after ships that pass.

525
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:22,178
Do you mind me talking
while you read?

526
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,978
No, it's all right.

527
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:27,132
Okay, once upon a time
there was Mrs. Alcaraz,

528
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:29,291
Mr. Alcaraz and Alcaraz Junior.

529
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:31,337
Mrs. Alcaraz told her husband,

530
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:34,658
"Honey, dolphins don't all sleep
at the same time.

531
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:39,257
Someone has to stand guard. We need
a new family member. Another father...

532
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:41,735
I'm not a kid anymore.
How do you recognize them?

533
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:43,729
Who?

534
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,618
Fairies.
How do you recognize them?

535
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:50,215
It depends.

536
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:52,450
-On what?
-On the person.

537
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,011
Every girl you know
could be a fairy.

538
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:56,329
How can I tell?

539
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,576
Do I need to ask them
for three wishes?

540
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:00,775
For example.

541
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:03,090
If it doesn't work,
I'll look fucking lame.

542
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:05,455
Not as fucking lame
as when you cuss

543
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:06,814
like Narcis.

544
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:09,579
What age do girls start

545
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:12,015
-being fairies?
-Eighteen, twenty...

546
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:13,415
Have you met many?

547
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:15,014
Well, I don't know.

548
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:17,854
They don't go around
telling people "I'm a fairy."

549
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,533
Why not?

550
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:21,292
-Is that a problem?
-No.

551
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:23,894
A lot of girls
don't know they're fairies.

552
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,136
None of them know
most of the time.

553
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:27,335
It's very hard work.

554
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,297
Once finished
they forget all about it.

555
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,132
They get amnesia.

556
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:34,094
So to be a fairy again
they need your help,

557
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:35,369
by asking them questions.

558
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:36,814
Questions like

559
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:40,097
you get asked at school.
It's called "educating fairies."

560
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,174
Educating fairies?

561
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:44,810
Yeah, the more they learn,
the better.

562
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:46,853
To remind them what to do.

563
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:49,056
Okay, I get it.

564
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:51,099
Can you still contact them

565
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,739
by hugging a tree?

566
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,697
Of course, that's crucial.

567
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:56,293
But how do I recognize them?

568
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:58,169
By the scars.

569
00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:59,375
What scars?

570
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:00,609
On their faces.

571
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:04,092
It takes a lot of concentration
to overcome the amnesia.

572
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:06,171
So they scratch their cheeks

573
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:08,451
to the point of
wounding themselves.

574
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:09,609
Fucking lame.

575
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,008
What did I say?

576
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:13,774
Sorry. Let's just say they're...

577
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:18,496
Could I make friends with a fairy
and ask for a wish?

578
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:19,888
Yeah, sure.

579
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:24,292
-What would you ask for?
-None of your business.

580
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:35,134
So one day Alcaraz
said to his son,

581
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,089
"It is done.

582
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:39,214
Your mother has met
another dolphin,

583
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:40,574
but it will be great

584
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:43,652
because this way
you'll always have a dad around

585
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:45,651
when the other sleeps
with Mommy."

586
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:47,734
So Alcaraz Junior...

587
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,219
Can't you see I'm asleep?

588
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:07,094
Happy birthday, Ingrid.

589
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:13,296
Here, happy birthday.

590
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:31,849
Did you tell him?

591
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:35,209
No.

592
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:37,893
I laid the groundwork.

593
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:48,251
Some day I'll explain everything.

594
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:52,055
Right now I can't.

595
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:55,019
I can't take it anymore!

596
00:51:58,020 --> 00:51:59,453
The party,

597
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:02,098
all the people...

598
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:22,695
Good night.

599
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:23,929
You want some?

600
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:27,856
No, I'm tired.
I'm going to bed.

601
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:32,053
Keep me company.
We're leaving tomorrow.

602
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:34,858
No, I'm too tired, really.

603
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:37,656
-See you tomorrow.
-Good night.

604
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:20,808
There's another woman
in my life.

605
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:42,375
I didn't think
you suspected anything,

606
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:43,968
but how long have you known?

607
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:47,819
Since my snoring?

608
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:52,371
We met at my dad's funeral.

609
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:54,890
She was his last companion.

610
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:57,528
We were inseparable the moment
we left the cemetery.

611
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:59,658
She got pregnant right away.

612
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:02,899
But after six months she lost
the baby in a bus accident.

613
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:05,418
Why didn't you tell me?

614
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:08,420
Because I never stopped
loving you.

615
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:12,138
To me she’s just
a beautiful memory,

616
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,449
nothing more.

617
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:18,049
Nicolas, you think she's
the reason we're separating?

618
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:21,217
I can leave her if you want.

619
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:24,499
I don't want anything from you.

620
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:27,375
I'm not your prison or obligation.

621
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:30,579
I'm not an excuse.
We're not dependent on you.

622
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:33,571
I want you to fly, to be free.

623
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:34,775
Free?

624
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,331
I too want to be...

625
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:41,135
"a beautiful memory."

626
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:43,689
Trust me, please.

627
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:46,454
Give me another chance.
Forget Beatrice. Forget the future.

628
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:48,929
Whatever has to happen will,
but in due time.

629
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:50,897
Please, forgive me for now.

630
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:54,809
I've nothing to forgive.
Don't think we're even now.

631
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:57,930
Then what do you want?
To hurt me?

632
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:00,335
What about me?

633
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:04,129
Am I made of stone?
Nothing hurts me?

634
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:09,098
What was her name again?

635
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:12,699
Beatrice.

636
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,299
Come.

637
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:29,415
Good morning.

638
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:57,449
Bon appetit.

639
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:27,214
<i>Nicolas, thanks for last night</i>.

640
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:31,779
<i>Your story about Beatrice,</i>
<i>be it a lie driven by love or true,</i>

641
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:35,057
<i>was the nicest thing</i>
<i>you could have offered me.</i>

642
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:39,935
<i>I know Raul gave you</i>
<i>the adoption papers this morning.</i>

643
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:42,338
<i>You'll see I've signed them.</i>

644
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:45,973
<i>Thanks again</i>
<i>for my birthday party.</i>

645
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:49,369
<i>You go out of your way</i>
<i>to surprise me</i>

646
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:51,258
<i>and make me happy and I...</i>

647
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:56,536
<i>Though it may not show,</i>
<i>I love both you and Raul</i>.

648
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:05,768
Three broken ribs.

649
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:08,655
I have no record of it.
Unjustified absence.

650
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:12,337
The doctor sent you a fax.
I'm back two days early.

651
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:15,769
That's news to me.
I never got anything.

652
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:16,929
So take a walk.

653
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:18,169
You saw it happen!

654
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:19,455
I saw what?

655
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:25,933
You've a lot to learn
about the labor market.

656
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:29,209
For example,
our insurance policy

657
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:30,938
doesn't cover broken ribs.

658
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:32,328
For your information.

659
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:35,734
And I'm giving you
8 days' notice.

660
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:37,492
I'm being overly generous.

661
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:42,299
Not that way.
The express checkout lane.

662
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:47,294
Your attention, please.

663
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:52,097
I accuse the store manager,
Mr. Matarredona,

664
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:54,975
standing at checkout line six,

665
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:57,132
of attempted rape,

666
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:00,136
refusing medical assistance
and fleeing the scene of a crime.

667
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:04,134
If a police officer can hear me,
I'd like to file a report.

668
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:05,494
Thank you very much.

669
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:16,138
When do you get off?

670
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:23,969
Right now.

671
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:36,854
Nice car.

672
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:40,569
What's this?

673
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:42,458
So they won't gash it.

674
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:44,810
They lose interest
if someone beats them to it.

675
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:54,534
You bought it used?

676
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:56,855
Almost, almost.

677
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:03,056
On April 13th, 1978,

678
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:06,418
at roughly 6:30 in the afternoon,
my dad made me

679
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:07,729
buy it from him.

680
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:12,978
He gave me 100,000 pesetas
and said, "Sign me a check."

681
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:15,211
"How much?"
"100,000 pesetas."

682
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:18,379
They were seizing it,
so he sold it to me.

683
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:21,138
I never saw him again.

684
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:26,340
Two days later he jumped
from the 5th story of his building

685
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:30,339
as the doorman and police
banged on his door.

686
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:34,098
He'd left a note on the fridge
stuck with a magnet.

687
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:37,977
It said the gas didn't work.

688
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:40,534
What did he do?

689
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:45,138
Whenever I asked my mom that,
she'd say "he plays."

690
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:47,651
How wonderful, I thought.

691
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:49,014
What a great job.

692
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:52,815
But she must not have thought so,
because she put us on a plane

693
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:54,652
and we moved to Argentina.

694
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:57,939
A year later she disappeared.

695
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:00,854
She ran off with a Brazilian
plastic surgeon.

696
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:04,850
My nanny and I stayed in Buenos Aires
until my grandparents here died

697
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:07,017
and I inherited their house.

698
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:09,259
Do you play as well?

699
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:12,052
I make other people play.

700
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:13,529
I invent toys.

701
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:20,652
I have a wife who I adore
and who's about to leave me,

702
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:23,139
I'm crazy about her son

703
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:26,178
and I can't bring myself
to tell him she's leaving.

704
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:30,733
I even made up a story
about me and another woman,

705
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:35,379
which really happened
but it ended 15 years ago

706
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:36,768
when she died...

707
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:39,297
pregnant with our child.

708
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:45,930
That brings us up to date.

709
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:53,972
I have a pretty story too,
don't think you've won.

710
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:57,415
I was born in Algeria,

711
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:00,530
I'm writing my thesis
on Andre Gide

712
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:03,694
and I'm expecting a grant
from the Sorbonne.

713
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:08,457
Meanwhile I came to Spain,
my grandparents were Republicans,

714
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:13,130
I started working as a cashier
to help out a friend in prison

715
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:15,018
who loves someone else.

716
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:19,497
And I just lost my job.

717
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:23,051
That brings us up to date.

718
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:31,334
-Screwing around again?
-He's a cop, you jerk.

719
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,491
Leave me alone
or you'll end up like Kateb,

720
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:35,696
screwing someone else
while I take care of

721
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:36,929
his fucking lizard!

722
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:40,452
Bastards, bastards, bastards...

723
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:49,691
I didn't have time to react.

724
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:53,289
You did the right thing.

725
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:55,969
Those two usually aren't
very nice,

726
01:04:56,140 --> 01:04:58,096
depending on what they're on.

727
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:00,933
How do you know them?

728
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:04,050
My boyfriend's in jail
because of them.

729
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:07,568
They owe him so they're
keeping an eye on me.

730
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:09,089
They gave me a stolen scooter

731
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:11,137
to ride to work
so I wouldn't meet men

732
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:12,415
on the bus.

733
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:19,010
To think
I came to Europe for this...

734
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:30,094
Where do you want to go?

735
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,659
Someplace you like.

736
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:36,294
I had somewhere in mind,
but now,

737
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:38,415
I don't know.

738
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:40,771
You might think it's a trap.

739
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:44,215
At this point I don't even care.

740
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:20,579
To your future, Sezar.

741
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:22,695
Future?

742
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:32,653
Are you hurt?

743
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:36,013
It's okay.
I'll be all right.

744
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:38,851
-What happened?
-I don't know.

745
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:42,659
Three broken ribs.
But I'm used to it.

746
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:45,729
An accident at work?

747
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:48,095
Don't make me laugh.

748
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:49,768
I'm not allowed to.

749
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:52,376
Let's talk about something sad.

750
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:57,092
What are those scars?

751
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:02,810
A little gift from the guy
who raped me back in my village.

752
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:06,813
"Now you'll wear your veil,
you filthy whore."

753
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:10,088
That's awful.

754
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:11,689
Well.

755
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:13,612
It felt good to talk about it.

756
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:15,453
You don't mind, do you?

757
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:16,848
No, of course not.

758
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:19,809
No!

759
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:22,129
Sezar!

760
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:24,769
Sezar!

761
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:26,209
Sezar!

762
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:43,774
Shit.

763
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:45,055
Shit.

764
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:46,855
Shit.

765
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:16,369
Good fairy,

766
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:19,210
I don't care
if you're young or old,

767
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:22,658
whichever of you is nearby
and has less work to do,

768
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:25,051
make my parents
get along again.

769
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:28,338
Whatever the problem is, fix it.

770
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:30,377
If I have to stop snoring,

771
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:32,293
I'll stop.

772
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:35,858
Otherwise we're all
really going to suffer.

773
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:40,373
Don't ignore me
or act like you're too busy.

774
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:43,259
You know we can't flee conflicts.

775
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:38,459
I recognized you right away.

776
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:40,890
-You have the mark.
-What mark?

777
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:43,894
The fairy mark.
From scratching too much.

778
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:47,498
You don't remember because
you have... amnesia...

779
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:48,690
asnemixa...

780
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:49,770
Amnesia?

781
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:51,931
That's it.
You've lost your memory.

782
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:54,088
You have, right?

783
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:56,577
Yeah, I probably have.

784
01:10:56,740 --> 01:10:58,492
-That's normal.
-Normal?

785
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:00,976
You're a fairy,
but you don't remember.

786
01:11:01,420 --> 01:11:02,694
I have to educate you,

787
01:11:02,860 --> 01:11:04,339
start teaching you things.

788
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:08,177
I'm Raul Rocco di Castelgrande

789
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:10,497
and when I grow up I'll be

790
01:11:10,660 --> 01:11:11,649
a viscount.

791
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:16,499
My dad told me about fairies.
Not the one with my name, he's dead.

792
01:11:16,820 --> 01:11:18,219
My real dad.

793
01:11:18,380 --> 01:11:20,098
He makes toys. Santa Claus

794
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:21,454
is a client of his.

795
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:24,019
Want to hear a secret?

796
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:26,453
Santa Claus doesn't exist.

797
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:29,300
He's little Jesus dressed up
as someone bringing gifts

798
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:30,688
to non-believers.

799
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:34,093
Repeat back what I said.

800
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:38,458
Hold on, my mouth is dry.

801
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:42,138
I'll say it back to you
so you see I'm getting it.

802
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:45,169
Your real father

803
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:47,291
makes toys and he isn't dead.

804
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:51,091
Little Jesus wears a costume

805
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:52,893
and you're a future viscount.

806
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:54,129
From Rocco di Castelgrande.

807
01:11:54,980 --> 01:11:56,652
How does your dad know
about fairies?

808
01:11:56,820 --> 01:11:59,573
They give him the ideas
to make his toys.

809
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:01,409
I'll educate you.

810
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:02,569
How?

811
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:03,775
Beats me.

812
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:06,573
Are you good at math?

813
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:09,254
Average.
What's your dad's name?

814
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:10,819
Nicolas Pladevall.

815
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:13,455
He's a great guy,
with brown hair...

816
01:12:14,260 --> 01:12:15,693
But he's in bad shape because

817
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:17,259
Mom doesn't love him anymore.

818
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:20,898
Why do you think I'm a fairy?

819
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:24,213
Because of the mark
and because I summoned you.

820
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:26,491
-You summoned me?
-By praying,

821
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:30,457
hugging trees, on the Internet...

822
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:32,498
Your dad told you
about the marks?

823
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:34,093
He'd have recognized you too.

824
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:35,369
Why?

825
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:36,575
You're like

826
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:39,413
other women,
but you're not like other women.

827
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:41,816
I'm not?
What's special about me?

828
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:43,579
Nothing. But you're nice,

829
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:45,492
not wearing high heels
and you're skinny

830
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:47,019
so people won't notice you.

831
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:51,778
What you have to do now
is grant three wishes.

832
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:53,578
-Why three?
-Because, shit.

833
01:12:53,740 --> 01:12:54,968
Too many questions.

834
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:58,098
Do as I say and your powers
will come back, you'll see.

835
01:12:58,620 --> 01:12:59,689
Do you come here often?

836
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:01,848
When I'm feeling shitty.

837
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:03,858
And to make wishes.

838
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:05,699
I do magic tricks.

839
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:10,818
I hold up small trees, hug giant
chestnut trees, stuff like that.

840
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:12,333
Are you getting all this?

841
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:14,218
-I think so.
-Good.

842
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:15,938
-7 + 5?
-12.

843
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:18,493
-I have to go.
-No way.

844
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:20,890
-You have to hide here.
-Why?

845
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:24,018
I haven't even given you back
half your powers.

846
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:27,372
There are warlocks out there
that eat fairies in omelettes.

847
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:29,337
Warlocks? Omelette?

848
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:32,050
Don't talk about food,
I'm starving.

849
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:34,051
No problem,
I'll take care of that.

850
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,377
But don't go anywhere, okay?
Promise?

851
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:39,852
Do you promise or not?

852
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:41,931
-I promise.
-Be careful, fairy.

853
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:45,570
Be very careful.
If you don't keep your promises,

854
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:46,934
you'll cease to exist.

855
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:49,536
How long do I have to hide here?

856
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:52,778
The time it takes you
to grant my wishes.

857
01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:56,410
What are your wishes?
Because we need to get going.

858
01:13:57,340 --> 01:13:58,739
Number one: to grow.

859
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:03,337
At least to 1,28 m, like Narcis.
Number two:

860
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:04,694
that my Mom falls back

861
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:08,933
in love with my Dad. Number three:
that my Dad meets another woman.

862
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:10,533
What do you mean?

863
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:12,338
So that they'll be even.

864
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:14,850
Mom will continue with
whoever she met,

865
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:18,934
and Dad will have one of his own.
Otherwise it doesn't work.

866
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:22,571
Narcis's mother forced his father
to leave the other woman

867
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:25,692
and now all they do
is fight all day. You see?

868
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:28,291
I have to grant
all three wishes at once?

869
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:29,933
No, the order

870
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:31,135
doesn't matter.

871
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:34,740
-But don't take too long.
-Okay.

872
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:37,854
You can be my dad's other woman
if you want.

873
01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:40,255
That's fine by me,
since we've already met.

874
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:45,251
I'll think about it.

875
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:52,775
Don't leave, all right?
I'll be back in an hour

876
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:55,056
and a half.
Do you like leg of lamb?

877
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:57,609
Kiss.

878
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:21,769
You heard it all?

879
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:23,737
I'm sorry, Sezar.

880
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:27,051
Why? You should be proud.
You have a great kid.

881
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:29,211
No, I mean for
what happened before.

882
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:30,813
What happened before?

883
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:32,294
My amnesia, remember?

884
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:35,128
Sure. We're close.

885
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:36,494
Obviously.

886
01:15:38,740 --> 01:15:40,731
I swear I didn't want to.

887
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:43,091
It was my fault, forget it.

888
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:46,416
My fear has nothing to do
with you.

889
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:49,739
Can you walk all the way
to the crossing at Four Oaks?

890
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:52,172
I'm fine, but I'm staying put.

891
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:54,571
You need an X-ray.
You hit your head.

892
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:56,215
Well,

893
01:15:56,820 --> 01:16:00,017
back at Algiers University,
the police hit me at least 500 times.

894
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:01,169
Don't worry.

895
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:06,092
After you've had your head scanned.
But I couldn't call, my phone's gone.

896
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:10,057
I picked it up, I'm sorry.

897
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:12,779
I'm not going anywhere.

898
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:14,898
I haven't eaten
since this morning

899
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:17,051
and that leg of lamb
was the best idea.

900
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:18,892
-I've ever heard.
-We'll eat,

901
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:20,459
but after your X-ray.

902
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:22,019
What will Raul say?

903
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:26,854
He'll think the warlocks
ate me in an omelette.

904
01:16:27,140 --> 01:16:29,290
<i>This is an emergency number,</i>
<i>not a restaurant</i>.

905
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:31,212
<i>Call back</i>
<i>when you've set the menu.</i>

906
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:33,219
False alarm, thank you.

907
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:36,259
If you want to save a life,

908
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:38,570
go feed Kateb's chameleon.

909
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:39,729
What?

910
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:42,450
Kateb's chameleon, you'll see.

911
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:44,739
What will you do with Raul?

912
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:48,052
Grant his three wishes.

913
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:49,375
What else?

914
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:31,091
Do fairies get their period too?

915
01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:34,129
I guess. it hasn't all
come back to me yet.

916
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:37,574
Is yours the red
or the blue advertisement?

917
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:39,453
I don't remember.

918
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:43,011
You might be getting worse.
What's 8 + 4?

919
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:45,169
Twelve?

920
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:47,371
Better. What's your breakfast?

921
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:50,569
Croissants,

922
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:51,929
scrambled eggs,

923
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:54,409
Chinese tea,

924
01:17:54,780 --> 01:17:56,498
fritters and papaya juice.

925
01:17:56,660 --> 01:17:58,218
Hey, you're the fairy.

926
01:17:58,380 --> 01:17:59,699
Just kidding.

927
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:37,258
<i>Joy is more scarce,</i>

928
01:18:37,660 --> 01:18:40,174
<i>more difficult and more beautiful</i>
<i>than sadness.</i>

929
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:42,731
<i>More than a natural necessity,</i>

930
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:45,209
<i>to me it's become</i>
<i>a moral obligation.</i>

931
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:08,138
The truth is Raul's final wish,

932
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:09,494
for us to be together,

933
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:11,139
is the hardest for me.

934
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:14,610
Meeting him has made me
want children,

935
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:17,178
but without a father,
you know?

936
01:20:17,660 --> 01:20:19,139
Not even a natural father?

937
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:23,535
A true professional who knows
his work, efficient, independent...

938
01:20:25,660 --> 01:20:26,695
Turn around.

939
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:34,295
The last dream
I remember having last night

940
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:37,171
is more like what I have in mind.

941
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:39,019
Not like what you said.

942
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:42,898
I was making love with you...

943
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:44,493
fully dressed...

944
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:46,133
...but I felt nothing.

945
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:53,939
Me neither.

946
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:23,135
Ingrid!

947
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:26,569
Ingrid!

948
01:21:30,940 --> 01:21:31,929
Ingrid!

949
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:23,649
I love you very much.

950
01:22:24,620 --> 01:22:26,133
Enough to leave me again?

951
01:22:28,220 --> 01:22:30,256
Enough to stay and wait.

952
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:32,649
Wait for what?

953
01:22:37,820 --> 01:22:38,809
Just wait.

954
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:47,292
If you're back for the same old crap,
it's not worth it.

955
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:15,894
Did you sleep well?

956
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:19,536
I met a girl at Narcis's house.

957
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:21,019
She plays alone all day.

958
01:23:21,220 --> 01:23:24,018
I told her what you do
and she wants to meet you.

959
01:23:24,180 --> 01:23:27,650
She'll be in the woods
this afternoon at four. Will you go?

960
01:23:27,860 --> 01:23:30,613
-Will you come with me?
-No, I'll leave you two.

961
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:34,017
I'll stay with Ingrid
so the birds won't fly away again.

962
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:37,012
-How are you, sir?
-Fine, and you?

963
01:23:37,660 --> 01:23:38,934
You have the boy's gaze.

964
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:40,294
He's not my father.

965
01:23:40,460 --> 01:23:41,654
You have beautiful eyes.

966
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:43,615
And you're very handsome.

967
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:47,535
My wife came back.

968
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:48,815
Great.

969
01:23:50,940 --> 01:23:53,534
Not quite. Things haven't changed.
I don't know why

970
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:55,372
she came back.
I don't understand anything.

971
01:23:56,420 --> 01:23:58,058
This was in your house.

972
01:24:08,620 --> 01:24:10,292
SORBONNE UNIVERSITY

973
01:24:45,340 --> 01:24:46,568
Can I help you?

974
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:48,978
Can we talk?

975
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:51,688
Of course.

976
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:11,818
I know your husband.

977
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:17,732
But you're not Beatrice.

978
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:20,139
No, Beatrice is dead.

979
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:23,328
Then she existed.

980
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:27,852
She existed but she died
pregnant with Nicolas's child.

981
01:25:35,620 --> 01:25:37,019
You know more than I do.

982
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:42,333
Sometimes it's easier
to tell things to a stranger.

983
01:25:43,820 --> 01:25:46,857
I'm here because I know
he took Raul to the dentist.

984
01:25:47,580 --> 01:25:49,457
How long have you known him?

985
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:53,897
Since you started rejecting him.

986
01:25:55,180 --> 01:25:56,249
He goes to the supermarket

987
01:25:56,420 --> 01:25:58,411
like it's a casino,
to try his luck.

988
01:25:59,020 --> 01:26:00,214
To kill time.

989
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:02,615
So the supermarket

990
01:26:02,780 --> 01:26:03,815
was you.

991
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:07,609
Anyway,

992
01:26:08,260 --> 01:26:09,249
it's all right.

993
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:11,332
No, ma'am.
It's not all right.

994
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:15,173
Your husband's about to kill himself.
It's not all right.

995
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:18,573
It's no way to treat a man
who's in love with you.

996
01:26:18,820 --> 01:26:19,935
You can't break up

997
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:22,295
telling him to wait for you,
offering crumbs,

998
01:26:22,460 --> 01:26:24,894
pushing him to infidelity
so you won't feel guilty

999
01:26:25,660 --> 01:26:28,254
and you can't suddenly reappear
just like that.

1000
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:31,979
You should explain things.
Not make things worse.

1001
01:26:33,660 --> 01:26:34,649
Okay.

1002
01:26:36,620 --> 01:26:37,973
Can I talk now?

1003
01:26:45,580 --> 01:26:47,730
I know this is hell for Nicolas.

1004
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:51,211
My own hell began
one month ago.

1005
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:55,169
A vascular deformation
in the brain.

1006
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:58,649
Cancer?

1007
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:00,938
No, it's not cancer.

1008
01:27:01,420 --> 01:27:03,331
But it's not good, either.
Look, Ingrid.

1009
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:05,968
I could die at any moment
of a brain hemorrhage

1010
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:08,814
or end up paralyzed
or blind or mute.

1011
01:27:09,420 --> 01:27:13,379
That would put me in a wheelchair
with my husband and son

1012
01:27:13,540 --> 01:27:14,734
full of life and energy.

1013
01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:17,853
Right or wrong, I decided

1014
01:27:18,020 --> 01:27:19,817
to leave them
with nice memories.

1015
01:27:21,980 --> 01:27:24,130
This week I had the final tests.

1016
01:27:25,260 --> 01:27:28,332
They can't operate and other
treatments guarantee nothing.

1017
01:27:30,860 --> 01:27:32,896
We're all here temporarily.

1018
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:37,977
I could get hit by a truck
when I leave here.

1019
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:40,934
Dying is one thing,
not wanting to live is another.

1020
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:43,374
I'm here.

1021
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:46,810
I wasn't strong enough
to leave them.

1022
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:49,296
Nor am I strong enough
to tell them.

1023
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:51,018
What matters is you came back.

1024
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:53,175
Yes.

1025
01:27:55,260 --> 01:27:57,057
But I don't know
how we'll manage.

1026
01:27:58,140 --> 01:28:00,290
We were in love like kids.

1027
01:28:00,860 --> 01:28:02,532
Now we've grown up.

1028
01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:04,811
Things will be less beautiful,

1029
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:07,413
but more complete.

1030
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:10,492
You're not going to tell Nicolas?

1031
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:19,973
I'll keep loving him.

1032
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:26,696
Is there anything serious
between you two?

1033
01:28:28,180 --> 01:28:29,169
You.

1034
01:28:33,940 --> 01:28:36,693
Our lives crossed paths
at the worst possible time.

1035
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:39,614
We tried to help each other
but we have different paths

1036
01:28:39,780 --> 01:28:41,771
-to follow.
-Are you sure?

1037
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:45,379
I'm going to the Sorbonne.

1038
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:47,891
It's been my lifelong dream.

1039
01:28:48,300 --> 01:28:50,689
I have a room waiting for me
at the dormitory.

1040
01:29:16,180 --> 01:29:17,295
To life.

1041
01:29:23,940 --> 01:29:25,771
You're not going to die.
I know it.

1042
01:29:25,940 --> 01:29:27,771
Will Nicolas know
how to find you?

1043
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:30,058
Is that a question or a wish?

1044
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:31,809
A wish.

1045
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:33,933
Then don't worry.

1046
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:36,615
Nicolas and Raul will always
know where to find me.

1047
01:30:16,140 --> 01:30:17,129
What?

1048
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:20,417
I've grown half a centimeter
in eight days.

1049
01:30:20,580 --> 01:30:21,615
Congratulations.

1050
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:24,860
I can't take the credit.
Things happen.

1051
01:30:31,660 --> 01:30:33,491
Can I borrow her when I'm older?

1052
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:54,129
<i>Who's leaving?</i>

1053
01:31:55,620 --> 01:31:57,292
<i>Who's staying?</i>

1054
01:31:59,540 --> 01:32:02,054
<i>Who gets more hurt</i>
<i>by loneliness?</i>

1055
01:32:04,980 --> 01:32:07,540
<i>Who gets more hurt</i>
<i>by loneliness?</i>

1056
01:32:08,980 --> 01:32:11,369
<i>Every corner of my life</i>

1057
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:14,931
<i>has something of yours.</i>

1058
01:32:16,020 --> 01:32:17,738
<i>Which is your path?</i>

1059
01:32:18,660 --> 01:32:20,173
<i>Which is mine?</i>

1060
01:32:21,060 --> 01:32:23,369
<i>Where did they meet?</i>.

1061
01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:25,971
<i>Where have they gone?</i>

1062
01:32:26,820 --> 01:32:31,098
<i>Come on, take me along,</i>
<i>this is no time to be alone.</i>

1063
01:32:58,340 --> 01:33:00,570
<i>Time is so short</i>

1064
01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:06,693
<i>Who will pick up</i>
<i>the wasted time?</i>

1065
01:33:10,860 --> 01:33:13,454
<i>Your care is my cure</i>.

1066
01:33:17,660 --> 01:33:21,175
<i>My cure is having you around.</i>

1067
01:33:26,580 --> 01:33:30,493
<i>Let her care for your wings.</i>

1068
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:33,413
<i>Your wings.</i>

1069
01:33:35,020 --> 01:33:38,933
<i>Come on, take me along,</i>
<i>this is no time to be alone.</i>

1070
01:34:04,620 --> 01:34:08,738
<i>My five senses are yours.</i>

1071
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:13,056
<i>My time is yours.</i>

1072
01:34:16,180 --> 01:34:19,331
<i>My hand is yours to hold.</i>

1073
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:26,896
<i>My whole joy is yours to drink</i>.

1074
