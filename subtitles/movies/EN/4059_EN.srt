0
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:10,399
oOo

1
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:38,931
Mom, wish you get well very soon

2
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:52,278
Call the head nurse stay here

3
00:00:55,889 --> 00:01:00,492
Yoko, Yoko

4
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:07,493
Yoko Yoko

5
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:17,103
Hello

6
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:40,933
l'm sorry

7
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:47,934
5:28p.m.

8
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:35,381
l'm going to give this to mom

9
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:29,735
7 years later

10
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:38,611
The big waves run high. Let's go home

11
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:45,023
You haven't got any fish yet, dad?

12
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:51,363
What did you say? l get big fish only

13
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:57,903
l'd rather get pretty woman

14
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:58,604
You'll know that...

15
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,772
when you get older

16
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:07,773
You'll know what love means

17
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:10,182
Hello

18
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,718
l have finished my proposal

19
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,220
l'll hand it to you tomorrow afternoon

20
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:20,292
Yeah...hey, hey

21
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:27,293
See you tomorrow

22
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:47,213
We can't eat up the whole fish
Can we share it with Rie?

23
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:57,462
Not many friends come to you recently

24
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:01,633
Black trouts are male
when they are born

25
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:02,934
What?

26
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:06,672
They'll become bisexual
when they grow to 1 5cm long

27
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:13,445
Then they'll separate into male and female

28
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:17,115
How about this one?

29
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:21,253
We can see its ovary when we cut it up

30
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,755
Right?

31
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:29,294
l don't know what an ovary look likes

32
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:34,266
You look old recently

33
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,101
What?

34
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:43,102
You're listless

35
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:51,010
Ken

36
00:05:57,657 --> 00:06:04,657
Do you think of remarriage, dad?

37
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:07,666
Why you bring it up?

38
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:14,667
l just want to ask you

39
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:39,191
l've finished my dinner

40
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:52,204
lt's your turn to wash the dishes

41
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:27,679
Looks like a religious ritual

42
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,751
Both are lonely guys

43
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:36,254
Happy man won't go to this concert

44
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:43,255
Lonely hearts are everywhere

45
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:47,732
How about you?

46
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:54,339
Are you lonely, sir?

47
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,841
Sir...

48
00:07:55,842 --> 00:08:01,246
Ueno will come to see you
at 3 p.m. tomorrow

49
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:04,182
lt's alright. l'll be here tomorrow

50
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:08,086
l am leaving
l will see Yoshikawa tonight

51
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,588
l won't come back today

52
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:13,425
Alright, l'll call you if necessary

53
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:20,426
Right

54
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:28,540
Hey...

55
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:35,480
l'm going to get married

56
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:41,419
Congratulation

57
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,122
Who is the bridegroom?

58
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:50,562
You haven't met him

59
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:57,563
Anyway, l'm glad to
hear the good news

60
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:15,053
You look very busy

61
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,389
Because we can make money

62
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,560
But the profit is getting less

63
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,129
How about you?

64
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,565
Don't you know that?

65
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,601
The movie industry is blooming

66
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:30,368
Really?

67
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:33,972
Just bullshit

68
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:38,843
The fittest will survive. Everyone just
struggles to keep his business

69
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:39,945
Will it revive?

70
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:42,914
Sooner or later

71
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:47,652
But we don't know how long we hang on

72
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:49,287
Yoshikawa

73
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:52,457
You said it would revive 1 year ago

74
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:59,458
Really?

75
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,368
Bitch

76
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,904
Vulgar, pretentious

77
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:08,473
and brainless

78
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:14,913
Where are those good women?

79
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:19,351
Japan is over

80
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:22,520
l want to...

81
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:26,358
remarry

82
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:30,762
You make up your mind finally

83
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:31,963
Who is the lucky woman?

84
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:35,233
No one. But l'm ready to look for her

85
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:37,068
My son told me that...

86
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:40,739
l look old. l should remarry

87
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,942
ls that all?

88
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:48,747
Old?

89
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:53,918
How to look for her?
Seek help from the matchmaker?

90
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:59,157
l won't do that

91
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:06,158
But l don't know how to find her

92
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,503
What kind of girl do you want?

93
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,906
Young girl?

94
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:18,143
No

95
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:24,149
She must has a job and some skills

96
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,051
Skill?

97
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:32,457
Like playing piano, singing and dancing

98
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:39,458
Like your deceased wife, Yoko

99
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,704
One is confident when she has skills

100
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:52,705
lf she lacks confidence
she will rely on someone, that's not good

101
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,879
Then get marry with a pianist

102
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,148
lt's expensive

103
00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:02,420
l don't want to marry a famous pianist

104
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:05,790
l'm not young anymore

105
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:10,195
l don't want to see failure in my marriage

106
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,931
So l decide to wait

107
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:18,703
and see

108
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:22,674
You want to be picky?

109
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:25,844
What are you laughing at?
Am l too much?

110
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,445
Really too much?

111
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:34,446
No, l'll take care of it

112
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:40,425
l have an idea

113
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,427
Let's hold an audition

114
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,963
To recruit an actress for a movie

115
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:51,964
You had produced a documentary
remember?

116
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:54,806
A triangular love affair between
a showgirl, a customer and a young boy

117
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,341
Right, co-produced with
a German TV station

118
00:12:56,342 --> 00:13:00,145
Do you mind if l adopt your story?

119
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:05,750
No, but do you really hold an audition?

120
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:08,186
l'll take care of it

121
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:11,856
Did l let you down?

122
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:13,124
No...But...

123
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,628
The actress is 20 to 30

124
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,963
Some skills are required

125
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,965
Do you agree that?

126
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:25,103
lt's a deception, isn't it?

127
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:28,573
The auditon is not held for
choosing your wife

128
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,975
lt's also for choosing an actress
for our movie

129
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,645
We'll start shooting
when we have money

130
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,447
And your plot is good

131
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:40,485
But...

132
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:45,557
Am l going to marry the actress?

133
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:48,693
lf the girl is chosen to be an actress

134
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:51,663
she won't be a good wife

135
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:58,203
You should choose one from the losers

136
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,404
What?

137
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:03,842
Choose some girls from the losers

138
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,210
who are pretty

139
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:10,114
kind and have some skills

140
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:13,818
Anyway, she must be good

141
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:17,455
Why don't you choose these good girls
to be actresses?

142
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:23,094
Good girls can be good wives only

143
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:30,095
Only talneted girls can shoot movie

144
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,205
l'm now...

145
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:38,309
working with a FM radio startion

146
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:44,115
We can produce a programme called
''Tomorrow Star''

147
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:46,050
Anyway, l'll take care everything

148
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:52,223
l'm good at holding audition

149
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,826
l'm Yoshikawa. l'm at conference room

150
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:57,295
Coffee?

151
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,364
Do you want some coffee?

152
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:03,268
2 coffee, please

153
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:09,307
There's traffic jam. l may be late

154
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:16,308
Please give this to Mr Kinta

155
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,925
Tomorrow Star

156
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,094
No matter where you are,

157
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,264
if you pluck up your courage,

158
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:37,335
you'll become famous beyond expectation

159
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:41,205
Super stars like...

160
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:44,008
Audery Hurpin, Julia Roberts...

161
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:48,146
were Tomorrow Star
until they became famous

162
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:53,818
You may be one of the tomorrow stars

163
00:15:53,819 --> 00:16:00,819
Perhaps you are the one

164
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:16,735
l'm home

165
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:18,543
Hello

166
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:21,279
You get off earlier today

167
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,549
l come back with the work

168
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,085
Please warm up your dinner first

169
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,253
The big dish is for Shigehiko

170
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:30,855

00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:37,628

174
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:39,364
So you're in a good mood

175
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:40,031

177
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:45,103
Okay

178
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:46,137
Thanks for your help

179
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:53,138
You're welcomed

180
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,388
Hello

181
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:46,057
lt's me

182
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:49,527
l'm reading those resume

183
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:53,397
How's it going? Dazzled?

184
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:57,435
l don't know what to do. l feel like...

185
00:18:57,436 --> 00:19:00,805
Feel like buying a car

186
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,808
Don't put car and woman together

187
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,011
You have to pick 30 candidates...

188
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:09,080
to attend next week's interview

189
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:11,349
30? Right

190
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,518
Alright, l'll tell you
when l finish the selection

191
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,487
Those photos are not reliable

192
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,624
The cover letter is more useful

193
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,558
l know that

194
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,263
Bye Bye

195
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:32,264
Choose 30 candidates

196
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:36,174
Oh, you're back

197
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:40,611
Why don't you knock the door?
Just come back?

198
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:43,047
Did you have your dinner?

199
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:45,616
l'll have it later
You can have it first

200
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,385
Okay

201
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:52,156
My friend will visit me tonight

202
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:54,492
Girlfriend?

203
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:57,295
Let her have my meal

204
00:19:57,296 --> 00:20:04,296
Thank you

205
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:17,008
Damn me

206
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:39,164
Asami Yamazaki

207
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:51,776
Learned ballet for 1 2 years

208
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,757
l'm not confident enough
to be an actress

209
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:03,060
Maybe you won't choose me

210
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:07,131
But l'm drawn to your story

211
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:10,468
l gave up ballet

212
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:16,907
because my waist was hurt at 1 8

213
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:20,344
l was going to London
for further study

214
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:26,017
The biggest hope becomes
the biggest disappointment

215
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:32,023
l feel like a dead person

216
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:36,127
Live or die, is just a thin line
between them

217
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,830
l understand that deeply

218
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:46,831
So l send this application letter

219
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:01,986
What's the age of this dinosaur
come from?

220
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,522
Post cretaceous

221
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:10,695
What does post cretaceous mean?

222
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:14,465
Does it mean sauropods?

223
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:17,168
Which kind of this dinosaur belongs to?

224
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,269
l don't know

225
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:25,270
Want to have a look? Yeah

226
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:32,216
Good evening

227
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:33,684
Good evening

228
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,887

Let me cook you something, alright?

241
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:07,952

Good boy

Remember to see her home, Shigehiko

249
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,174
Alright

250
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:36,781
Let's go

251
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:43,782
Ken, let's go

252
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:58,068
Are you ready?

253
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:02,706
Feel like commiting a crime

254
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:07,077

255
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:09,613

Excuse me

270
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:52,056
Why do you apply for this?

271
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:54,758
Have you slept with man?

272
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:58,562
Are you interested in drug?

273

Show me some facial expression

274

Nen Osugi

287

Excuse me

297
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:33,891
My mother wanted me to be a star

298
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:39,897

302
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:02,152
We're late for 30 minutes

303
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:09,153
Let's take a break for 1 0 minutes Yes

304
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,332
Why do l always ask the question
instead of you?

305
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:19,536
Do you lose interest about that?

306
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:22,673
No

307
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:26,877

That shop just sell adult video

00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,918
Keep her and give her some jobs

315
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:14,919
lt's meaningless
to be a cover queen only

316
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:21,065
This is the wound of first suicide
This is the second time

But l haven't finished my words

322
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:41,118
Why do you want to change your career?

323
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:47,491
l think l'm doing well...

324
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:49,460

333
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:39,009
Someone had asked me
but l never work for them

334
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:41,979
Do you have any manager?

00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:07,832
Mr Shibata
producer of national music division

342
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:15,345
You're unemployed now

343
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:17,214
How can you make a living?

344
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:20,951
Can you tell us?

345
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:24,521
l work for my friend's shop
3 times a week

346
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:26,523
What shop?

347
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:29,193
A small pub at Kinza District

348
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:35,165
The mamasan learned some vocal training
from me

349
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:39,970
l have no problem for my living
if l don't waste my money

350
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:43,874
You don't want to live in
a luxurious life?

351
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:46,543
l don't want to live
in a very poor life

352
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:50,347
But if l have enough money
to buy records and books

353
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:53,917
it's enough for me

354
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:57,387
Can you tell me something about ballet?

355
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:58,822
Yes

356
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:00,858
You mentioned waist injury

357
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:01,892
Yes

358
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:07,931
in your cover letter

359
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:10,601
Yes

360
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:14,137
ln your letter, you said...

361
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:19,376
the biggest hope becomes
the biggest disappointment

362
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:24,448
You feel like a dead person

363
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:29,453
l'm moved indeed

364
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:33,156
Everyone has undertaken suffering once

365
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:37,060
lt is unavoidable

366
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:42,432
The only way to get relieved
is to accept it

367
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:45,903
Life is like this

368
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,472
But l can't believe that...

369
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:50,307
a young girl like you

370
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:55,512
can understand that

371
00:31:55,513 --> 00:32:02,513
l think you have a mature vision
towards life

372
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:20,798
Thank you

373
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:28,412
Have you finished your words?

374
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:30,447
Thanks for your coming

375
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:33,417
We may call you later

376
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:36,887
Okay

377
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:43,888
Bye

378
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:53,236
Can we call the next one?

379
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:56,807
Take a break for 1 5 minutes Yes

380
00:32:56,808 --> 00:33:03,808
Tell Mr lto that l may be late

381
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:10,887
What do you feel about her?

382
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:13,223
She makes me uneasy

383
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:17,527
l want to take a smoke

384
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:20,998
You fancy her before this interview?

385
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:27,270
l like her cover letter
and l like herself more

386
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:31,074
''l think you have a mature vision
towards life''

387
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:34,644
An interviewer
shouldn't speak like this

388
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:41,645
Don't laugh at me. That's my true word

389
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:49,026
She is really graceful

390
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:56,027
She is prettier than the photo
And she is a good girl

391
00:33:56,834 --> 00:34:00,804
But l feel there is something wrong
about her

392
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:03,607
Something wrong?

393
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:06,810
Just by intuition

394
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:13,811
lt's hard to explain

395
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:36,239
Your girlfriend is quite good

396
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,108
Misuzu?

397
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:40,110
Right, no...

398
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:41,778
What?

399
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:44,047
Girls...

400
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:45,949
are unpredictable

401
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:50,821
Why?

402
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:54,224
Thanks for your dinner

403
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:57,394
Dad, if you want to remarry

404
00:34:57,395 --> 00:35:03,366
it'd better to marry a women
who cook better than Rie

405
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,535
Why are you so hurried?

406
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:09,539
Dinosaur fossils were found
in Argentina again

407
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,742
They are more ancient than
Europe dinosaur

408
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:13,510
ls that so?

409
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:17,814
There is a lot of useful information

410
00:35:17,815 --> 00:35:24,815
Don't forget to take a bath

411
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:58,755
Hello

412
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:03,093
l'm sorry to call you
at this time of the day

413
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:06,463
l'm Aoyama, the producer

414
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,798
Thanks for seeing me today

415
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:10,734
Don't mention it...

416
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:17,735
Do you have time to go out?

417
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:24,247
Yes, l love to

418
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:26,183
When?

419
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:29,986
Anytime at daytime

420
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:36,987
Then...

421
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:46,897
Good night

422
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:59,015
Hello, l'm Aoyama

423
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:01,184
lt's me

424
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:03,386
What's up?

425
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:07,290
About Asami Yamasaki

426
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:13,930
l've called Ace Label

427
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:19,302
l don't suspect her
but l worry about you

428
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:22,606
What's going on?

429
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:27,143
There is no national music producer
who is called Shibata

430
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:34,144
He disappeared

431
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:41,625
He vanished one and a half year ago

432
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:48,626
Still unknown up to now

433
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:54,337
l'm nervous

434
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:57,807
Take it easy
l won't question about you

435
00:37:57,808 --> 00:38:04,808
You just invite me for dinner?

436
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:09,352
Yes

437
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:15,425
That's good

438
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:18,862
But let me ask you...

439
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:23,233
about that referee of that label

440
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:27,037
Mr Shibata?

441
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:33,243
l'm sorry. l never meet him

442
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:36,646
They said if l go to interview,

443
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:41,451
even if l don't have any manager
it'd better to...

444
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:45,522
To say you have one

445
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:49,592
Right?

446
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:51,594
l didn't intend to cheat you

447
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:58,595
lt's alright. That's no problem

448
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:03,606
Please eat

449
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:10,413
lt smells delicious

450
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:17,414
Please

451
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:27,263
lt tastes good

452
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:33,903
Great

453
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:37,574
Can you do me a favour?

454
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:44,575
lf Mr Aoyama feels free,

455
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:51,121
can we go out and talk?

456
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:56,993
l don't have any friend

457
00:39:56,994 --> 00:40:00,029
l love to if you want me

458
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:04,467
Really? That's great

459
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:07,604
l won't get you into trouble

460
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:11,641
We can see each other at any place

461
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:14,444
Or give me a call

462
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:18,448
My phone number is on my card

463
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:21,785
Please call me at anytime

464
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:23,987
Thank you

465
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:28,425
Thanks for your dinner

466
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:34,964
Are we going to shoot the movie?

467
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:41,965
lt's up to you
l'm just interested at her

468
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:43,940
Movie is small business

469
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:50,941
But marriage is a big business
Don't be rash

470
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:56,853
You should have a careful observation

471
00:40:56,854 --> 00:41:01,090
What's wrong with her?

472
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:07,630
How come everything is so easy?

473
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:12,135
Pretty, gentle and graceful

474
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:19,136
No boyfriend and take the initiative

475
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:25,515
l've looked into her background
but l didn't get any clue

476
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:30,086
Don't know the name of the pub
that she is doing part-time

477
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:35,058
l can't find out people
who knows her neither

478
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:37,193
l'm not a kid anymore

479
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:39,829
l won't be cheated easily

480
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:43,333
l know my feeling
better than anyone does

481
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:48,938
lf l'm in trouble
l can solve it by myself

482
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:50,640
Okay

483
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:56,646
Thanks for holding this audition

484
00:41:56,647 --> 00:42:03,647
l finally find my perfect partner

485
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,256
Aoyama

486
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:08,558
Promise me

487
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:11,227
Don't call her for the time being

488
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:14,197
l may be over anxious...

489
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,799
But don't be too rash...

490
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:23,800
for marriage

491
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:31,308
Please cool down

492
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:38,782
l understand that. l promise you

493
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:47,123
Are you sick?

494
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:50,593
You seldom take a day off

495
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:54,764
ln fact, this is your first time

496
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:56,799
Yeah...

497
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:02,505
You're too busy
l'm glad that you take a rest

498
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:06,876
Since your wife died
you have been taking care of Shigehiko

499
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:10,847
and business

500
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:15,018
lt's tough for you

501
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:17,320
lf my husband was like you

502
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:24,321
l would live a happy life

503
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:32,029
Are you in love?

504
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:51,754
No wonder

505
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:58,755
Man cannot live without woman

506
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,836
l have to go, bye

507
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:41,370
Bye

508
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:48,371
See you tomorrow

509
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:04,160
Bye

510
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:11,161
Bye

511
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:17,373
What's wrong?

512
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:19,742
No, bye

513
00:46:19,743 --> 00:46:26,743
Bye

514
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:20,296
Hello, l'm Aoyama

515
00:48:20,297 --> 00:48:22,164
That's great

516
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:26,335
l thought you wouldn't call me again

517
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:32,241
Maybe you think that l'm brusk

518
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:37,613
But l look forward to your call

519
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:40,316
l'm sorry

520
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:45,054
How're you?

521
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,790
What's wrong?

522
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:50,326
Why are you laughing?

523
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:53,529
l can't believe that you date me again

524
00:48:53,530 --> 00:49:00,530
l'm very happy

525
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:09,639
Here

526
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:29,932
How's your family?

527
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:31,500
Fine

528
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:33,336
They live in Tokyo?

529
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:38,240
They moved to Chiba last month

530
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:41,544
lt's more convenient for my father
to play golf there

531
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:42,611
Yeah

532
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:46,916
My family is quite harmonious

533
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:48,818
An ordinary family

534
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:51,887
Do you still work for that
part-time job?

535
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:53,556
Yes

536
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:55,124
At Kinza?

537
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:56,192
At the Fourth Street.

538
00:49:56,193 --> 00:49:58,928
The name is strange
lt's called ''Stone's Fish''

539
00:49:58,929 --> 00:50:00,196
''Stone's Fish''?

540
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:02,064
Can l go there and have a drink?

541
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:06,202
Of course, but my boss...

542
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:10,373
is very nosy

543
00:50:10,374 --> 00:50:13,676
l won't go there
if you don't want me to

544
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:16,812
l just want to understand you

545
00:50:16,813 --> 00:50:21,917
l won't cheat you

546
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:23,386
l promise

547
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:30,387
About that movie...

548
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:33,896
Did you choose someone else
for the actress role?

549
00:50:33,897 --> 00:50:40,897
No, there is something wrong
for the script

550
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:45,674
Our sponsor doesn't like that

551
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:52,048
The shooting is delayed

552
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:59,049
Maybe we won't shoot the movie

553
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:01,390
ls that so?

554
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:04,126
Then your effort is in vain

555
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:08,364
No, we let you down instead

556
00:51:08,365 --> 00:51:11,367
As l said in my cover letter

557
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:16,539
l didn't have much expectation

558
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:18,307
lt's alright

559
00:51:18,308 --> 00:51:25,308
l'm glad that l've met you

560
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:29,485
l could see myself from mirror

561
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:35,658
and danced into the world of beauty
That's great

562
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:41,297
l learned hard

563
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:45,568
l took severe training

564
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:52,569
But unfortunately, l had to give up

565
00:52:02,352 --> 00:52:05,688
l suffered a lot

566
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:12,528
But l treasure the value of life

567
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:19,529
We still survive, don't we?

568
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:34,450
Thank you

569
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:37,753
lt's not easy for a woman to live alone

570
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:42,758
Especailly you have nobody
to share your feeling

571
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:45,728
l have friends

572
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:49,632
But this is my first time

573
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:56,633
to meet a gentle and caring friend
like you

574
00:52:58,975 --> 00:53:02,845
Shall we dine again?

575
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:09,846
When? l'm sorry. l'm too impatient

576
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:12,688
l will call you

577
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:19,689
Alright, l look forward to your call

578
00:53:28,572 --> 00:53:30,439
Please get off here

579
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,208
Please stop

580
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:39,209
She has to get off

581
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:42,151
Thank you very much

582
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:48,924
Bye

583
00:53:48,925 --> 00:53:49,758
Good night

584
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:56,759
Good night

585
00:54:01,104 --> 00:54:08,104
Please go to Okuzawa

586
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,602
l want to talk to you,Shigehiko

587
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:40,603
What's the matter?

588
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:42,945
The curtain is dirty

589
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:45,981
What's going on?

590
00:54:45,982 --> 00:54:49,084
Yeah...

591
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:53,722
You fall in love?

592
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:55,691
Right?

593
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:57,793
Right

594
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:04,794
No wonder you look dazed and happy

595
00:55:08,071 --> 00:55:12,408
She is just 24 years old

596
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:14,443
Near my age

597
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:17,846
She must be pretty

598
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:20,282
We like pretty women

599
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:22,318
But don't get deceived

600
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:27,056
l'm experienced than you, idiot

601
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:30,859
Did you propose to her?

602
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:32,828
Not yet

603
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:35,064
l'll take a trip this weekend

604
00:55:35,065 --> 00:55:36,932
Then l'll propose to her

605
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:40,302
Good luck!

606
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:46,775
l'll introduce you to her

607
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:52,047
l'll look over her

608
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:59,048
You're obsessed, dad

609
00:56:59,649 --> 00:57:06,649
What do you want to do before dinner?

610
00:57:07,724 --> 00:57:10,692
There is a resturant here

611
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:14,763
The cook cooks great

612
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:21,764
But he is a big-mouth

613
00:57:24,007 --> 00:57:28,444
A small art museum is in here

614
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:35,445
They are not closed yet
if we go there now

615
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:58,601
lt takes 20 minutes to drive there

616
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:04,847
Then we can go to the port

617
00:58:04,848 --> 00:58:10,385
The port is small. But we can
go to a good coffee shop there

618
00:58:10,386 --> 00:58:14,323
lts cheese cake tastes good

619
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:21,324
Dessert...

620
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:28,958
Come here

621
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:36,799
Please come here

622
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:58,120
Don't take off the shirt now

623
00:59:59,028 --> 01:00:03,298
Look at me first

624
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:10,299
Look at my body

625
01:00:43,506 --> 01:00:50,506
l was burnt when l was a child

626
01:00:53,383 --> 01:01:00,383
l want you to know my life

627
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:21,237
You're beautiful

628
01:01:22,578 --> 01:01:29,117
l want you to love me only

629
01:01:29,118 --> 01:01:33,255
l understand that

630
01:01:33,256 --> 01:01:36,658
Everyone says the same thing

631
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:42,497
Are you different from the other?

632
01:01:42,498 --> 01:01:48,370
Can you love me only?

633
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:50,906
Please

634
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:57,907
Love me only

635
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:56,031
Yes

636
01:03:56,032 --> 01:04:00,435
Are you Mr Aoyama? l'm receptionist

637
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:01,770
Yes

638
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:05,140
l'm sorry to disturb you

639
01:04:05,141 --> 01:04:10,545
But l've called you many times

640
01:04:10,546 --> 01:04:16,484
The girl who is with you has left

641
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:21,857
Can you tell me how many days
would you like to stay?

642
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:28,858
She left?

643
01:04:33,069 --> 01:04:37,205
Do you mean she disappeared?

644
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:44,045
l've called her but no one answer it

645
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:51,046
l don't know where she lives

646
01:04:57,193 --> 01:04:58,793
What happened in hotel?

647
01:04:58,794 --> 01:05:00,228
l've told you that

648
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:07,229
She wouldn't vanish without reason

649
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:11,806
Maybe she misunderstood something

650
01:05:11,807 --> 01:05:17,245
l want to talk to her, face to face

651
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:23,752
Do you have her address?

652
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:25,287
Aoyama

653
01:05:25,288 --> 01:05:28,823
l just have her resume

654
01:05:28,824 --> 01:05:32,661
lmpossible

655
01:05:32,662 --> 01:05:34,362
Aoyama

656
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:35,664
Forget her

657
01:05:35,665 --> 01:05:37,699
l can't

658
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:40,669
How can we break up like this?

659
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:44,105
l know you won't listen to me

660
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:51,106
But l still urge you to forget her

661
01:06:00,256 --> 01:06:06,494
You mean...

662
01:06:06,495 --> 01:06:13,495
l'm an middle-aged man
who obsesses in young girl

663
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:18,773
And l'm deserved to be dumped?

664
01:06:18,774 --> 01:06:23,845
Yes

665
01:06:23,846 --> 01:06:26,514
Can you cool down?

666
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:29,551
You told me you wasn't a kid

667
01:06:29,552 --> 01:06:32,554
You could solve it by yourself
if you were in trouble

668
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:39,555
No, l can't

669
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:44,432
Why?

670
01:06:44,433 --> 01:06:45,967
Forget it

671
01:06:45,968 --> 01:06:47,602
What?

672
01:06:47,603 --> 01:06:53,008
Forget it, l won't beg you

673
01:06:53,009 --> 01:07:00,009
l'm going to look for her

674
01:07:05,388 --> 01:07:07,355
l'm going to look for her

675
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:14,356
Aoyama!

676
01:07:42,024 --> 01:07:49,024
Shimada Ballet School

677
01:08:19,061 --> 01:08:22,697
Excuse me

678
01:08:22,698 --> 01:08:29,698
Excuse me

679
01:10:20,516 --> 01:10:27,516
Excuse...

680
01:10:27,523 --> 01:10:30,291
What?

681
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:35,129
Are you Mr Shimada?

682
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:42,130
l called you this afternoon

683
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:51,112
l want to see Asami Yamasaki

684
01:10:51,113 --> 01:10:58,113
Go

685
01:10:58,687 --> 01:11:03,691
Can you tell me...

686
01:11:03,692 --> 01:11:10,692
Do you have trouble with Asami?

687
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:17,105
l just want to find out her address

688
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:24,106
And where she is

689
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:45,667
Have you seen her?

690
01:11:45,668 --> 01:11:52,668
Yes

691
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:58,479
Hear her voice?

692
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:05,480
Why?

693
01:12:08,357 --> 01:12:13,094
Touch her body?

694
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:17,532
Embrace her?

695
01:12:17,533 --> 01:12:20,501
How do you feel?

696
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:27,502
Feel good?

697
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:34,843
Did you smell her?

698
01:13:02,177 --> 01:13:09,177
Asami

699
01:13:28,003 --> 01:13:35,003
Go

700
01:13:43,886 --> 01:13:49,257
''Stone's Fish'' at Fourth Street

701
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:56,258
''Stone's Fish''

702
01:14:52,187 --> 01:14:59,187
Nobody is here

703
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:03,097
Closed today?

704
01:15:03,098 --> 01:15:07,702
lt shut down a year ago

705
01:15:07,703 --> 01:15:13,608
What?

706
01:15:13,609 --> 01:15:18,412
The mamasan was murdered

707
01:15:18,413 --> 01:15:23,184
Do you know a staff who is called Asami?

708
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:24,619
Asami?

709
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:26,787
l don't know her

710
01:15:26,788 --> 01:15:31,759
The mamasan often worked alone

711
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:36,130
Asami worked 3 times a week
as a part-time worker

712
01:15:36,131 --> 01:15:41,168
You're wrong, aren't you?

713
01:15:41,169 --> 01:15:42,203
Why...

714
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:47,708
was the mamasan murdered?

715
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:52,680
l don't know
They said it's about love affair

716
01:15:52,681 --> 01:15:56,751
Her lover was a record producer

717
01:15:56,752 --> 01:16:01,756
She seemed to be drug addicted

718
01:16:01,757 --> 01:16:04,458
She was killed here?

719
01:16:04,459 --> 01:16:08,129
The body was cut into pieces

720
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:12,033
This is an old, inclined building

721
01:16:12,034 --> 01:16:17,838
Her blood flew from door crack

722
01:16:17,839 --> 01:16:22,743
There is one more strange thing

723
01:16:22,744 --> 01:16:29,350
The police put back the pieces together

724
01:16:29,351 --> 01:16:31,886
They found the body had 3 more fingers
1 more ear

725
01:16:31,887 --> 01:16:38,887
And 1 more tongue

726
01:16:43,632 --> 01:16:50,632
This is a terrible world

727
01:17:12,995 --> 01:17:19,995
Ken, eat

728
01:17:22,771 --> 01:17:29,771
Bye

729
01:18:19,027 --> 01:18:21,696
l'm Shigehiko

730
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:25,466
l will stay at friend's home tonight

731
01:18:25,467 --> 01:18:29,203
Please eat your dinner properly

732
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:32,573
We have yoghurt. Please have it

733
01:18:32,574 --> 01:18:35,476
Ken hides himself

734
01:18:35,477 --> 01:18:39,580
He hides himself under the bed
Please feed him for me

735
01:18:39,581 --> 01:18:46,581
Bye

736
01:20:14,342 --> 01:20:16,744
l'm sorry

737
01:20:16,745 --> 01:20:22,016
How're you?

738
01:20:22,017 --> 01:20:25,719
l can't believe you date me again

739
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:31,258
l'm very happy

740
01:20:31,259 --> 01:20:35,029
How's...

741
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:42,030
your family?

742
01:20:48,643 --> 01:20:53,614
My parents got divorced
when l was a child

743
01:20:53,615 --> 01:20:59,587
l lived in my uncle's home

744
01:20:59,588 --> 01:21:05,559
l can't forget...

745
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:11,198
l was abused there

746
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:16,637
l was abused by my auntie

747
01:21:16,638 --> 01:21:23,638
There are many scars on my body

748
01:21:26,114 --> 01:21:30,985
You don't need to tell me your sad past

749
01:21:30,986 --> 01:21:37,986
lt's alright, l want you to know
everything about me

750
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:45,727
She wanted me to soak into cold water
And l got pneumonia

751
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:49,637
She pushed me off stairs

752
01:21:49,638 --> 01:21:55,276
My shoulder bone was broken

753
01:21:55,277 --> 01:21:58,412
The doctor worried about me

754
01:21:58,413 --> 01:22:05,413
He sent me back to my mother's home

755
01:22:07,188 --> 01:22:10,291
When did that happen?

756
01:22:10,292 --> 01:22:16,163
Grade 1 at primary school

757
01:22:16,164 --> 01:22:23,164
Yeah

758
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:31,645
My mother remarried

759
01:22:31,646 --> 01:22:37,584
l didn't get hurt anymore

760
01:22:37,585 --> 01:22:40,854
But my stepfather...

761
01:22:40,855 --> 01:22:45,926
hated me

762
01:22:45,927 --> 01:22:50,564
He was disabled

763
01:22:50,565 --> 01:22:55,736
And stayed at home all day

764
01:22:55,737 --> 01:23:00,841
When l went back from school

765
01:23:00,842 --> 01:23:03,711
l didn't dare to turn on the light

766
01:23:03,712 --> 01:23:10,584
l waited my mother quietly

767
01:23:10,585 --> 01:23:13,721
l'm sorry

768
01:23:13,722 --> 01:23:20,722
My past is extraordinary, isn't it?

769
01:23:21,062 --> 01:23:27,701
Tell me if you don't like it

770
01:23:27,702 --> 01:23:34,702
l can't believe that
you suffered so much

771
01:23:36,311 --> 01:23:39,013
l lived on ballet

772
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:41,648
You are talented

773
01:23:41,649 --> 01:23:43,751
lt's strange

774
01:23:43,752 --> 01:23:50,752
l was happy when l danced

775
01:23:51,793 --> 01:23:58,793
So l got through it
and didn't kill myself

776
01:24:07,108 --> 01:24:12,780
You're great

777
01:24:12,781 --> 01:24:19,386
You are my perfect partner

778
01:24:19,387 --> 01:24:26,387
Aoyama

779
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:32,866
Yoko

780
01:24:32,867 --> 01:24:36,003
Let me introduce her to you

781
01:24:36,004 --> 01:24:43,004
Miss Asami Yamazaki

782
01:24:48,683 --> 01:24:50,851
No

783
01:24:50,852 --> 01:24:54,922
You can't have her

784
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:56,990
She is a good girl

785
01:24:56,991 --> 01:25:03,991
No, Aoyama

786
01:25:06,734 --> 01:25:08,469

787
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:15,470
l want you now

788
01:25:37,065 --> 01:25:44,065
Asami

789
01:25:53,681 --> 01:25:56,850
There is something wrong

790
01:25:56,851 --> 01:26:02,456
We just slept together once

791
01:26:02,457 --> 01:26:07,294
l fancy you

792
01:26:07,295 --> 01:26:09,863
Am l too stupid?

793
01:26:09,864 --> 01:26:13,767
l'm sorry

794
01:26:13,768 --> 01:26:15,736
Please forgive me

795
01:26:15,737 --> 01:26:21,475
l'll do everything you like

796
01:26:21,476 --> 01:26:25,412
l love to do that

797
01:26:25,413 --> 01:26:32,413
What are you doing? Stop

798
01:26:35,056 --> 01:26:38,325
Look, it's hard

799
01:26:38,326 --> 01:26:45,326
Stop

800
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:06,540
Food, food

801
01:28:43,685 --> 01:28:46,653
3 more fingers, 1 more ear

802
01:28:46,654 --> 01:28:53,654
And 1 more tongue

803
01:29:21,556 --> 01:29:24,191
l just want you to love me only

804
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:31,192
Just love me only

805
01:29:49,684 --> 01:29:55,322
Asami

806
01:29:55,323 --> 01:29:58,158
Asami

807
01:29:58,159 --> 01:30:03,130
Dance to me

808
01:30:03,131 --> 01:30:05,465
Dance

809
01:30:05,466 --> 01:30:07,267
Dance

810
01:30:07,268 --> 01:30:10,070
Dance, bitch

811
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:17,071
Dance to me, or l'll punish you again

812
01:30:20,381 --> 01:30:25,685
Dance, dance to me

813
01:30:25,686 --> 01:30:28,054
Dance to me

814
01:30:28,055 --> 01:30:35,055
Dance

815
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:51,639
Asami, my good girl

816
01:31:03,591 --> 01:31:10,591
Asami

817
01:31:43,664 --> 01:31:50,664
The steel wire is sharp enough
to cut the flesh and bone

818
01:32:08,689 --> 01:32:14,694
You're great

819
01:32:14,695 --> 01:32:19,132
l don't know what is unhappiness

820
01:32:19,133 --> 01:32:26,133
Because l never taste happiness

821
01:32:27,174 --> 01:32:27,941
Asami

822
01:32:27,942 --> 01:32:29,943
No!

823
01:32:29,944 --> 01:32:32,779
No!

824
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:38,318
Men cannot live...

825
01:32:38,319 --> 01:32:40,353
without women

826
01:32:40,354 --> 01:32:47,354
Let us hold an audition

827
01:32:52,667 --> 01:32:59,439
My son told me that l looked old
l should remarry

828
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:06,440
So l decide...

829
01:33:56,664 --> 01:34:03,664
Asami

830
01:34:09,877 --> 01:34:16,877
Asami

831
01:34:20,821 --> 01:34:27,821
You...

832
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:46,146
You cannot move now

833
01:34:46,147 --> 01:34:53,147
You're still awake
when l take care of you

834
01:34:55,256 --> 01:35:02,256
Then you can taste the pain

835
01:36:36,023 --> 01:36:39,826
You liar

836
01:36:39,827 --> 01:36:42,729
You don't really hold an audition

837
01:36:42,730 --> 01:36:45,999
ln fact

838
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,435
You want to cheat the girls

839
01:36:49,436 --> 01:36:56,436
You bastard

840
01:37:52,867 --> 01:37:59,739
Stick in

841
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:03,743
Stick in

842
01:38:03,744 --> 01:38:07,981
ls it hurt?

843
01:38:07,982 --> 01:38:10,617
You can tell lies

844
01:38:10,618 --> 01:38:15,588
But your pain can't

845
01:38:15,589 --> 01:38:20,460
Right?

846
01:38:20,461 --> 01:38:22,896
How to stick in makes it hurt most?

847
01:38:22,897 --> 01:38:27,066
lt takes a lot of learning

848
01:38:27,067 --> 01:38:32,005
Stick in

849
01:38:32,006 --> 01:38:37,744
The stomach is the most painful part

850
01:38:37,745 --> 01:38:43,249
So does here

851
01:38:43,250 --> 01:38:46,419
So does here

852
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:48,154
Right

853
01:38:48,155 --> 01:38:55,155
Stick in

854
01:39:39,406 --> 01:39:46,406
Stick in

855
01:40:10,170 --> 01:40:17,170
Stick in

856
01:40:18,178 --> 01:40:25,178
Your eyeholes are in pain

857
01:40:28,088 --> 01:40:31,290
lf you want to know yourself

858
01:40:31,291 --> 01:40:34,727
then taste the pain

859
01:40:34,728 --> 01:40:41,728
The bigger the pain
the deeper the understanding

860
01:40:47,775 --> 01:40:54,775
Your son is called Shigehiko?

861
01:40:55,482 --> 01:41:02,455
lf he suffers
you will understand yourself better

862
01:41:02,456 --> 01:41:04,590
No!

863
01:41:04,591 --> 01:41:10,129
Don't touch Higeshiko!

864
01:41:10,130 --> 01:41:14,300
You also love your son?

865
01:41:14,301 --> 01:41:19,238
You said you loved me only
lt's a lie

866
01:41:19,239 --> 01:41:22,642
l just have you

867
01:41:22,643 --> 01:41:29,082
But you are a playboy

868
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:36,083
l hate playboy

869
01:41:36,390 --> 01:41:43,390
l give you everything
you return nothing

870
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:47,834
Everyone is bad

871
01:41:47,835 --> 01:41:50,603
Everyone is bad

872
01:41:50,604 --> 01:41:57,604
Everyone is bad

873
01:42:05,752 --> 01:42:12,752
Where can you go without your feet?

874
01:42:17,264 --> 01:42:24,264
lt's sharp enough to cut flesh and bone

875
01:42:28,976 --> 01:42:35,976
Stop!

876
01:44:06,540 --> 01:44:13,540
lt's time to cut your right feet

877
01:44:25,425 --> 01:44:27,059
l'm home

878
01:44:27,060 --> 01:44:34,060
Dad, you haven't sleep yet?

879
01:44:38,272 --> 01:44:42,275
My friend is sick suddenly

880
01:44:42,276 --> 01:44:49,276
He is sent to hospital

881
01:44:55,922 --> 01:45:02,922
Are you sleeping?

882
01:45:09,903 --> 01:45:16,903
What happened, dad?

883
01:46:37,257 --> 01:46:44,257
What's going on?

884
01:46:51,138 --> 01:46:53,606
What's going on?

885
01:46:53,607 --> 01:46:57,510
Are you alright?

886
01:46:57,511 --> 01:47:04,511
Yeah...

887
01:47:11,958 --> 01:47:15,628

888
01:47:15,629 --> 01:47:22,629

889
01:47:23,437 --> 01:47:28,174

01:47:30,644 --> 01:47:37,644
l accept your proposal

892
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:47,520
Proposal?

893
01:47:51,097 --> 01:47:56,035
Like a dream

894
01:47:56,036 --> 01:48:03,036
l'm happy

895
01:48:03,510 --> 01:48:07,847
When l attended the interview

896
01:48:07,848 --> 01:48:12,918
l become...

897
01:48:12,919 --> 01:48:17,389
the most lucky one

898
01:48:17,390 --> 01:48:22,094
Even
l can't be the actress of the movie

899
01:48:22,095 --> 01:48:29,095
but l can be the actress in real life

900
01:48:51,791 --> 01:48:54,693
Stick in

901
01:48:54,694 --> 01:49:01,694
What happened, dad?

902
01:49:02,302 --> 01:49:09,302
Who are you?

903
01:49:09,376 --> 01:49:16,376
Who are you?

904
01:49:21,254 --> 01:49:28,254
What happened?

905
01:50:18,211 --> 01:50:20,813
Dad!

906
01:50:20,814 --> 01:50:23,716
Are you alright?

907
01:50:23,717 --> 01:50:28,287
Dad!

908
01:50:28,288 --> 01:50:32,558
Higeshiko...call the police

909
01:50:32,559 --> 01:50:39,298
Call the police

910
01:50:39,299 --> 01:50:43,936
This is Okuzawa Street
in Sedatani District

911
01:50:43,937 --> 01:50:47,339
Please send the ambulance
as soon as possible

912
01:50:47,340 --> 01:50:50,242
My father is seriously injured

913
01:50:50,243 --> 01:50:54,246
And there is a woman

914
01:50:54,247 --> 01:50:56,148
l don't know what happened

915
01:50:56,149 --> 01:51:03,022
His foot was cut and it's bleeding

916
01:51:03,023 --> 01:51:04,323
My address is 6-20-4, Okuzawa Street

917
01:51:04,324 --> 01:51:09,028
Sedatani District

918
01:51:09,029 --> 01:51:13,666
l thought you're busy

919
01:51:13,667 --> 01:51:17,936
l don't understand your job

920
01:51:17,937 --> 01:51:24,743
Maybe you think that l'm brusk

921
01:51:24,744 --> 01:51:31,744
But l look forward to your call

922
01:51:43,430 --> 01:51:48,634
l can't believe that you date me again

923
01:51:48,635 --> 01:51:54,173
l'm very happy

924
01:51:54,174 --> 01:51:59,445
lt's not easy for a woman to live alone

925
01:51:59,446 --> 01:52:05,784
Especially you have nobody
to share your feeling

926
01:52:05,785 --> 01:52:09,221
But this is my first time

927
01:52:09,222 --> 01:52:15,527
to meet...

928
01:52:15,528 --> 01:52:22,528
a gentle and caring friend like you

929
01:52:25,371 --> 01:52:28,107
l suffered a lot

930
01:52:28,108 --> 01:52:34,313
But l treasures the value of life

931
01:52:34,314 --> 01:52:41,314
We still survive, don't we?
