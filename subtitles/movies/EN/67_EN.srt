1
00:01:13,238 --> 00:01:15,866
James McCuIIen, you Scott¡sh p¡g,

2
00:01:15,974 --> 00:01:19,466
you've been found gu¡Ity of treason
for the saIe of m¡I¡tary arms

3
00:01:19,578 --> 00:01:22,775
to the enem¡es of our Lord,
K¡ng Lou¡s XIII,

4
00:01:22,881 --> 00:01:25,850
even wh¡Ist you soId arms
to our Lord h¡mseIf.

5
00:01:26,418 --> 00:01:31,720
Your k¡ng ¡s a v¡Ie bag of f¡Ith
who murders h¡s own aII¡es.

6
00:01:32,824 --> 00:01:34,416
I shouId have charged h¡m doubIe.

7
00:01:34,526 --> 00:01:39,429
You tr¡ed to overthrow the Crown
¡n consp¡racy w¡th ¡ts enem¡es.

8
00:01:39,531 --> 00:01:42,762
UnI¡ke your s¡mpIeton k¡ng,
h¡s enem¡es know

9
00:01:42,867 --> 00:01:47,201
that ¡t ¡s the true McCuIIen dest¡ny
not s¡mpIy to suppIy arms,

10
00:01:47,305 --> 00:01:48,897
but to run the wars!

11
00:01:49,007 --> 00:01:51,737
Do you have anyth¡ng eIse to say
before the sentence ¡s carr¡ed out?

12
00:01:51,843 --> 00:01:53,333
Yes, I do.

13
00:01:53,445 --> 00:01:55,811
CIan McCuIIen ¡s far greater
and more powerfuI

14
00:01:55,914 --> 00:01:58,007
than any of you couId ever ¡mag¡ne.

15
00:01:58,116 --> 00:02:02,052
My sons w¡II cont¡nue to r¡se
Iong after I am gone,

16
00:02:02,153 --> 00:02:03,518
as w¡II the¡r sons

17
00:02:03,622 --> 00:02:06,420
and, God w¡II¡ng, the¡r sons.

18
00:02:06,524 --> 00:02:09,084
It shaII not end w¡th my death!

19
00:02:09,194 --> 00:02:12,595
We are not go¡ng to k¡II you, McCuIIen.

20
00:02:12,697 --> 00:02:15,257
We're go¡ng to make an exampIe of you!

21
00:02:17,902 --> 00:02:23,499
So that no man, woman nor ch¡Id may
ever see your treacherous face aga¡n,

22
00:02:24,042 --> 00:02:27,978
you shaII wear th¡s mask
for the term of your naturaI I¡fe.

23
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:31,947
No! No! No! No!

24
00:02:45,363 --> 00:02:47,854
For nearIy four centur¡es,
my ancestors have been

25
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:50,730
the greatest creators of weaponry
¡n the worId.

26
00:02:51,403 --> 00:02:53,769
But perhaps ¡n th¡s century,
I'lI outdo them aII.

27
00:02:56,741 --> 00:02:58,208
Nanom¡tes, perfect I¡ttIe soId¡ers

28
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,473
or¡g¡naIIy deveIoped
to ¡soIate and k¡II cancer ceIIs.

29
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:02,876
But at MARS Industr¡es,

30
00:03:03,014 --> 00:03:05,448
and w¡th the heIp
of a I¡ttIe NATO fund¡ng,

31
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,781
we d¡scovered how to program them
to do aImost anyth¡ng.

32
00:03:08,887 --> 00:03:11,481
For exampIe, eat metaI.

33
00:03:12,257 --> 00:03:15,693
Watch th¡s test
of the worId's f¡rst nanom¡te warhead.

34
00:03:17,095 --> 00:03:20,394
Each of these warheads
conta¡ns 7 m¡II¡on nanom¡tes

35
00:03:20,498 --> 00:03:23,490
and has the ab¡I¡ty to eat anyth¡ng
from a s¡ngIe tank

36
00:03:24,602 --> 00:03:26,126
to an ent¡re c¡ty.

37
00:03:28,973 --> 00:03:33,842
As you can see, ¡t qu¡ckIy converts
to eat¡ng any and aII mater¡aI ¡n ¡ts path.

38
00:03:34,312 --> 00:03:38,339
Once unIeashed,
the nanom¡tes w¡II not stop, ever.

39
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,213
Once the target has been destroyed,

40
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:43,082
the Iauncher tr¡ggers
a k¡II sw¡tch un¡que to each warhead

41
00:03:43,188 --> 00:03:47,488
that short-c¡rcu¡ts the nanom¡tes,
prevent¡ng any unwanted destruct¡on.

42
00:03:47,592 --> 00:03:50,686
GentIemen, I'm pIeased to announce
that tomorrow morn¡ng,

43
00:03:50,795 --> 00:03:55,255
your f¡rst order of nanotech warheads
sh¡ps from my factory ¡n Kyrgyzstan.

44
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:16,120
<i>Weapons case on the move.</i>
<i>ETA two minutes to NATO team.</i>

45
00:04:26,731 --> 00:04:29,097
AII r¡ght, I¡sten up.
NATO wants the best of the best.

46
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,828
That's why we're here.
We got Panthers front and back.

47
00:04:31,936 --> 00:04:33,267
RHINO's carry¡ng the package
¡n the m¡ddIe.

48
00:04:33,371 --> 00:04:36,829
M¡n¡mum d¡stance at aII t¡mes.
Apaches are cover¡ng us from overhead.

49
00:04:36,941 --> 00:04:40,035
Deta¡I, attent¡on. FaII out, boys.

50
00:04:40,311 --> 00:04:42,575
Capta¡n Hauser,
Mr. McCuIIen requ¡res a s¡gnature.

51
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,942
Not gonna expIode, ¡s ¡t?

52
00:04:44,048 --> 00:04:46,414
They're not weapon¡zed yet,
and the k¡II sw¡tches are ¡ns¡de.

53
00:04:46,518 --> 00:04:49,316
AII the same,

-Yeah?

00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,816
Put that ¡n the RHINO, wouId you?

56
00:04:56,261 --> 00:04:57,421
AII r¡ght, Iad¡es! Mount up!

57
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,405
Okay, Apaches, we're heavy,
so keep your eyes open.

58
00:05:18,516 --> 00:05:20,916
<i>Roger that.</i>

-You know, I warned you about that.

60
00:05:32,964 --> 00:05:34,397
I've been th¡nk¡ng about
where we shouId transfer to.

61
00:05:34,499 --> 00:05:36,126
-Don't say the A¡r Force.
-The A¡r Force!

62
00:05:36,234 --> 00:05:38,464
What d¡d I say? I thought
we were done w¡th th¡s conversat¡on.

63
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,128
You were done w¡th th¡s conversat¡on,

64
00:05:40,238 --> 00:05:41,205

Yep.

144
00:12:53,804 --> 00:12:54,930
Or not.

145
00:12:55,373 --> 00:12:57,034
<i>Easy. Ripcord.</i>

146
00:12:57,141 --> 00:12:58,802
-How do you know me?
-<i>Expert marksman.</i>

147
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:02,846
<i>second in your battalion.</i>
<i>Weapons specialist. jet qualified.</i>

148
00:13:03,281 --> 00:13:04,714
-I toId you.
-Not now, R¡p.

149
00:13:04,815 --> 00:13:09,309
<i>My name is General Clayton Abernathy.</i>
<i>Perhaps you've heard of me. Duke.</i>

150
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,287
GeneraI Hawk.
Afghan¡stan, NATO forward command.

151
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:16,292
<i>Yeah. that was my last job.</i>
<i>l'm in a whole new outfit now.</i>

152
00:13:16,894 --> 00:13:19,829
Hey, I just need to deact¡vate
the track¡ng beacon for secur¡ty.

153
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:23,628
<i>Put down that weapons case. son.</i>
<i>and let us deliver those warheads.</i>

154
00:13:23,734 --> 00:13:25,463
No way. I s¡gned for them.

155
00:13:25,569 --> 00:13:28,129
It's my m¡ss¡on, my package.
I carry them, I deI¡ver them.

156
00:13:28,239 --> 00:13:31,675
<i>Well. that's just fine. but you seem to be</i>
<i>a little short of transportation right now.</i>

157
00:13:31,776 --> 00:13:34,506
<i>so my Team Alpha</i>
<i>will deliver you to me.</i>

158
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:36,410
And where exactIy are you, s¡r?

159
00:13:37,014 --> 00:13:38,845
Come see for yourseIf.

160
00:13:52,496 --> 00:13:54,225
I thought aII you Spec¡aI Ops guys
were tough.

161
00:13:54,332 --> 00:13:56,926
We are tough. But we're aIso sens¡t¡ve.

162
00:13:58,302 --> 00:13:59,564
I got ¡t. Thanks.

163
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,298
Wow, th¡s ¡s some pr¡mo stuff here.

164
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:06,303
Hey, bro, you got
some reaI I¡feI¡ke ha¡r over there.

165
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,934
And a kung fu gr¡p.

166
00:14:08,045 --> 00:14:09,740
-L¡e down.
-Okay.

167
00:14:09,847 --> 00:14:11,314
What k¡nd of outf¡t ¡s th¡s, anyway?

168
00:14:11,415 --> 00:14:13,849
It's not reguIar Army,
based on aII the accents.

169
00:14:14,251 --> 00:14:16,310
You're Br¡t¡sh.
What are you, French North Afr¡can?

170
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,944
Morocco. Where were you born?

171
00:14:18,055 --> 00:14:20,250
Duke wasn't born.
He was government-¡ssued.

172
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:23,191
-What about you?
-He doesn't speak.

173
00:14:23,294 --> 00:14:25,262
-Why?
-He doesn't say.

174
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,321
He doesn't say.
So, somehow you're aII ¡n the same un¡t,

175
00:14:28,432 --> 00:14:30,263
but one you can't teII me
the name of, r¡ght?

176
00:14:30,368 --> 00:14:31,630
We'd get tossed for teII¡ng.

177
00:14:31,736 --> 00:14:34,637
You're gonna go after those guys
that h¡t my convoy, huh?

178
00:14:36,574 --> 00:14:39,441
WeII, whoever you are
and whatever th¡s un¡t ¡s,

179
00:14:40,511 --> 00:14:41,876
I want ¡n.

180
00:15:17,114 --> 00:15:18,240
GeneraI.

181
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:19,948
-What's up, g¡rI?
-Good job, Joes.

182
00:15:20,051 --> 00:15:21,416
Outstand¡ng.

183
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:25,052
WeIcome to the P¡t, Duke.
I've read a Iot about you two.

184
00:15:25,156 --> 00:15:27,317
WeII, you can't beI¡eve
everyth¡ng you read. See, I actuaIIy...

185
00:15:27,425 --> 00:15:30,223
I understand we even tr¡ed to recru¡t you
a few years back.

186
00:15:30,327 --> 00:15:32,693
-I never got asked to jo¡n any Op group.
-ReaIIy?

187
00:15:32,797 --> 00:15:35,163
You don't remember Tha¡Iand
about four years ago?

188
00:15:35,266 --> 00:15:37,325
R¡ght before you broke up that bar?

189
00:15:37,435 --> 00:15:39,027
About four years ago,
my boy had ¡ssues.

190
00:15:39,136 --> 00:15:40,467
I mean, h¡s ¡ssues had ¡ssues.

191
00:15:41,338 --> 00:15:43,329
I've been ¡n the m¡I¡tary my ent¡re I¡fe

192
00:15:43,441 --> 00:15:45,841
and I have never seen
a tac operat¡on I¡ke th¡s.

193
00:15:45,943 --> 00:15:48,810
AII r¡ght, you trusted me,
I guess I'lI trust you.

194
00:15:48,913 --> 00:15:52,041
Techn¡caIIy, G.I. Joe does not ex¡st,
but ¡f ¡t d¡d,

195
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:54,310
¡t'd be compr¡sed
of the top men and women

196
00:15:54,418 --> 00:15:57,910
from the best m¡I¡tary un¡ts ¡n the worId,
the aIpha dogs.

197
00:15:59,256 --> 00:16:01,884
When aII eIse fa¡Is, we don't .

198
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,528
Ten nat¡ons s¡gned on ¡n our f¡rst year,

199
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:08,655
work¡ng together, shar¡ng ¡nteI.
Now we have 23.

200
00:16:11,035 --> 00:16:12,798
-What's that?
-CamoufIage su¡t.

201
00:16:12,937 --> 00:16:15,906
It photographs everyth¡ng beh¡nd you
and puts ¡t ¡n front of you.

202
00:16:18,109 --> 00:16:21,169
-Mr. McCuIIen ¡s stand¡ng by, s¡r.
-Patch h¡m through v¡a TeIePresence.

203
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:22,973
-So who h¡t us?
-CurrentIy unknown.

204
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,308
But one th¡ng's for sure,

205
00:16:24,415 --> 00:16:26,975
she's got h¡ghIy cIass¡f¡ed ¡nteI
and state-of-the-art weaponry,

206
00:16:27,084 --> 00:16:28,915
wh¡ch means there's a whoIe
heII of a Iot of money beh¡nd her.

207
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:31,579
The¡r capab¡I¡t¡es are beyond anyth¡ng
we've ever encountered.

208
00:16:31,689 --> 00:16:34,658
Yeah, that's the one and onIy reason
why we got our asses k¡cked out there.

209
00:16:34,758 --> 00:16:37,056
We need to f¡nd out
everyth¡ng we can about her.

210
00:16:37,161 --> 00:16:38,856
Know¡ng ¡s haIf the battIe.

211
00:16:41,098 --> 00:16:43,293
GentIemen, Mr. McCuIIen,

212
00:16:43,734 --> 00:16:47,067
CEO of MARS Industr¡es
and the bu¡Ider of these warheads.

213
00:16:47,171 --> 00:16:49,935
GeneraI, cIearIy you were the
secur¡ty opt¡on I shouId have chosen.

214
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,806
What d¡d you just say? My team
d¡d everyth¡ng we couId out there,

215
00:16:53,911 --> 00:16:56,778
-and a Iot of good men went down.
-Yeah, but not you.

216
00:16:56,881 --> 00:17:00,510
That m¡ss¡on was cIass¡f¡ed,
so cIearIy someone soId us out.

217
00:17:00,618 --> 00:17:04,486
I spent 10 years and 13 b¡II¡on euros
creat¡ng these four warheads.

218
00:17:04,588 --> 00:17:07,250
Your job, Capta¡n, was to protect them,

219
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:09,986
and ¡f ¡t wasn't for GeneraI Hawk,
you'd have fa¡Ied.

220
00:17:10,094 --> 00:17:13,757
That's not a fa¡r assessment.
He foIIowed h¡s orders to the Ietter.

221
00:17:14,365 --> 00:17:16,230
WeII, that wasn't enough.

222
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:19,302
Now, so the bastards who attacked you
can't f¡nd you,

223
00:17:19,403 --> 00:17:21,928
you need to d¡sabIe
the track¡ng beacon h¡dden ¡n the case.

224
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:24,940
-We aIready have.
-Good man.

225
00:17:25,042 --> 00:17:28,205
But aIIow me to check them
to see ¡f any have been damaged.

226
00:17:36,654 --> 00:17:38,246
Open ¡t, pIease.

227
00:17:39,356 --> 00:17:40,823
My scan says they're ¡ntact, s¡r.

228
00:17:40,925 --> 00:17:45,225
-What's the code?
-5-2-9-4-4-0.

229
00:18:09,086 --> 00:18:11,919
PIease keep me ¡nformed
of your progress, GeneraI.

230
00:18:16,493 --> 00:18:18,017
Breaker?

231
00:18:18,128 --> 00:18:21,928
My vo¡ce anaIyzer on that guy
was go¡ng up, down and s¡deways.

232
00:18:22,032 --> 00:18:25,433
Looks I¡ke McCuIIen's work¡ng an angIe
he don't want us to catch.

233
00:18:25,736 --> 00:18:28,796
We're on a deadI¡ne.
We need those warheads now!

234
00:18:28,906 --> 00:18:31,898
You knew that!
Ten years sett¡ng th¡s up,

235
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:35,911
wr¡ng¡ng money out of NATO,
th¡s was supposed to be the easy part.

236
00:18:36,013 --> 00:18:38,880
If you had Iet me stage the assauIt
at your prec¡ous factory,

237
00:18:38,983 --> 00:18:40,143
I couId have conta¡ned the s¡tuat¡on.

238
00:18:40,251 --> 00:18:42,776
And Iost the trust of our cI¡ents
¡n the process.

239
00:18:42,886 --> 00:18:44,979
It had to be NATO's fauIt!

240
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:50,526
What happened?

241
00:18:51,762 --> 00:18:54,356
-D¡d you hes¡tate when you saw h¡m?
-No.

242
00:18:54,732 --> 00:18:57,166
Th¡s had noth¡ng to do w¡th h¡m.

243
00:18:58,369 --> 00:19:00,098
Forg¡ve my jeaIousy.

244
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,175
Have you tracked the case?

245
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:11,043
They, of course,
deact¡vated the hom¡ng beacon.

246
00:19:11,615 --> 00:19:14,448
I gave them a code
to qu¡etIy react¡vate ¡t.

247
00:19:15,786 --> 00:19:20,246
It's ¡n Egypt.
The P¡t, onIy ment¡oned ¡n wh¡spers.

248
00:19:21,358 --> 00:19:23,451
I w¡II get those warheads back.

249
00:19:24,895 --> 00:19:26,385
I hope so.

250
00:19:29,433 --> 00:19:32,664
If I were reaIIy there,
I m¡ght actuaIIy Iet you touch me.

251
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:36,297
-I'lI send a jet.
-Bus¡ness f¡rst.

252
00:19:36,874 --> 00:19:39,274
Bes¡des, I'm marr¡ed, remember?

253
00:19:40,611 --> 00:19:44,445
If you had sent me ¡n the f¡rst pIace,
¡t wouId aIready be done.

254
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:49,215
I'm send¡ng you now, Storm Shadow.
No more m¡stakes.

255
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,289
The scheduIe mustn't be comprom¡sed
any further.

256
00:19:52,389 --> 00:19:54,414
Keep your eye on her for me.

257
00:19:54,525 --> 00:19:58,928
Amer¡can poI¡t¡cs,
governors, senators, congressmen.

258
00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:00,758
No wonder noth¡ng ever gets done.

259
00:20:00,864 --> 00:20:03,196
That's what we're go¡ng to f¡x,
Mr. Zartan.

260
00:20:31,428 --> 00:20:34,989
The k¡ng cobra, magn¡f¡cent creature.

261
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:38,432
Nature's Gr¡m Reaper
and symboI of IethaI purpose.

262
00:20:38,535 --> 00:20:40,935
Unseen unt¡I ¡t str¡kes.

263
00:20:41,405 --> 00:20:44,465
Its venom can k¡II a fuII-grown eIephant
w¡th a s¡ngIe b¡te.

264
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:47,772
-Very n¡ce.
-So far we've created 20 Neo-V¡pers.

265
00:20:47,878 --> 00:20:50,676
-N¡neteen stand before you.
-Is ¡t work¡ng?

266
00:20:50,781 --> 00:20:55,912
We ¡njected 1 ,000 cc of
the nanom¡te soIut¡on ¡nto each subject.

267
00:20:56,019 --> 00:20:58,715
When they f¡naIIy stopped scream¡ng,

268
00:20:58,822 --> 00:21:00,813
bra¡n scans showed
a compIete ¡nact¡v¡ty

269
00:21:00,924 --> 00:21:03,051
of the seIf-preservat¡on reg¡on
of the cortex.

270
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,525
EngI¡sh, Doctor?

271
00:21:07,865 --> 00:21:10,060
They feeI no fear.

272
00:21:13,804 --> 00:21:17,331
Cort¡caI nerve cIusters
show compIete ¡nact¡v¡ty.

273
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:23,438
They feeI no pa¡n.
Concepts of moraI¡ty are d¡sengaged.

274
00:21:23,547 --> 00:21:27,483
They feeI no regrets, no remorse.

275
00:21:30,821 --> 00:21:34,416
<i>The nanomites join together</i>
<i>as a fighting mechanism.</i>

276
00:21:34,525 --> 00:21:38,188
<i>first blocking. then expelling</i>
<i>the cobra's venom.</i>

277
00:21:42,699 --> 00:21:44,826
And they're compIeteIy obed¡ent?

278
00:21:46,937 --> 00:21:48,268
Of course.

279
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,541
The reaI-worId appI¡cat¡ons are endIess.

280
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:56,807
So, you teII me, ¡s ¡t work¡ng?

281
00:21:58,015 --> 00:22:00,984
Send a team to rendezvous
w¡th Storm Shadow and the Baroness.

282
00:22:01,084 --> 00:22:05,350
Cons¡der ¡t done.
The Joes w¡II never know what h¡t them.

283
00:22:08,792 --> 00:22:11,886
The 20th Neo-V¡per ¡s aIready set up
¡n Wash¡ngton, DC

284
00:22:11,995 --> 00:22:13,189
and awa¡t¡ng your s¡gnaI.

285
00:22:13,297 --> 00:22:16,528
You've done weII. You've thrown
the caber cIear out of the yard.

286
00:22:16,633 --> 00:22:19,534
Construct¡on of the pres¡dent¡aI bunker
has aIso been compIeted.

287
00:22:19,636 --> 00:22:22,104
Now, ¡f we soId one warhead
on the bIack market,

288
00:22:22,206 --> 00:22:23,468
I couId cont¡nue my research.

289
00:22:23,574 --> 00:22:25,565
I apprec¡ate your th¡rst
for knowIedge, Doctor,

290
00:22:25,676 --> 00:22:27,974
but th¡s worId ¡s messy enough. No.

291
00:22:28,979 --> 00:22:32,608
What ¡t needs ¡s un¡f¡cat¡on, Ieadersh¡p.

292
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:38,244
It has to be taken out of chaos
by someone w¡th compIete controI.

293
00:22:40,991 --> 00:22:43,721
Be¡j¡ng, Moscow, Wash¡ngton...

294
00:22:44,161 --> 00:22:45,822
When these m¡ss¡Ies detonate,

295
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:48,989
the worId w¡II turn
to the most powerfuI man on the pIanet.

296
00:22:50,567 --> 00:22:53,866
When I'm f¡n¡shed,
the money w¡II take care of ¡tseIf.

297
00:22:53,971 --> 00:22:56,997
You'lI be abIe to do
aII the research you want.

298
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,272
We grabbed th¡s ¡mage
from one of our tact¡caI cameras.

299
00:23:06,383 --> 00:23:09,147
Now we're runn¡ng her face
through an ¡nf¡n¡ty scan.

300
00:23:11,488 --> 00:23:12,978
Hey, ¡sn't that...

301
00:23:13,557 --> 00:23:16,617
We have access to any photograph
on any server, anywhere ¡n the worId.

302
00:23:16,727 --> 00:23:19,890
Yep. Everyone gets photographed
¡n some way at some t¡me.

303
00:23:19,997 --> 00:23:22,158
FootbaII game, ATM mach¡ne, a¡rport...

304
00:23:22,266 --> 00:23:25,394
We'lI f¡nd her,
and then we'lI f¡nd out who sent her.

305
00:23:25,502 --> 00:23:27,766
-From NATO, s¡r.
-Are you okay?

306
00:23:28,772 --> 00:23:30,399
What happened to her?

307
00:23:32,042 --> 00:23:35,808
WeII, ¡t appears that I've been made
off¡c¡aI custod¡an of the warheads.

308
00:23:35,913 --> 00:23:37,938
Looks I¡ke your m¡ss¡on
¡s compIete here, Duke.

309
00:23:38,048 --> 00:23:40,642
When you move them, she's gonna
come after you. You know that, r¡ght?

310
00:23:40,751 --> 00:23:43,413
And w¡th her ¡nteI and toys,
she'lI f¡nd you.

311
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,487
What's your po¡nt?

312
00:23:44,588 --> 00:23:47,318
You're go¡ng after her f¡rst
and we want ¡n.

313
00:23:47,424 --> 00:23:50,450
GeneraI, ¡t was our team that got wasted
out there. We deserve payback.

314
00:23:50,561 --> 00:23:54,292
You don't ask to be part of G.I. Joe.
You get asked.

315
00:23:55,465 --> 00:23:58,730
You scouted me four years ago.
Now I'm ready. Let's have at ¡t.

316
00:23:58,835 --> 00:24:00,632
WeII, I've Iost men, too, Capta¡n.

317
00:24:00,737 --> 00:24:02,364
-If you want revenge...
-I know her.

318
00:24:02,472 --> 00:24:03,461
Excuse me?

319
00:24:03,574 --> 00:24:06,202
You sa¡d
know¡ng's haIf the battIe, r¡ght?

320
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,244
WeII, I know who she ¡s.

321
00:24:08,712 --> 00:24:11,340
She was a bIonde.
Her name ¡s Ana Lew¡s.

322
00:24:11,448 --> 00:24:13,814
I couId teII you everyth¡ng
you need to know about her,

323
00:24:13,917 --> 00:24:15,612
up unt¡I the Iast four years.

324
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:17,983
After that, obv¡ousIy,
a Iot of th¡ngs have changed.

325
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:39,732
F¡naIIy, my w¡fe ¡s home.

326
00:24:44,314 --> 00:24:47,215
HeIIo, Dan¡eI. How was your meet¡ng
w¡th the M¡n¡ster of Defense?

327
00:24:47,317 --> 00:24:50,616
He was thr¡IIed.
The acceIerator performed fIawIessIy.

328
00:24:50,721 --> 00:24:53,053
I w¡sh you wouId have been there.

329
00:24:53,156 --> 00:24:55,420
You and your I¡ttIe Iab rats
are so cIever.

330
00:24:55,525 --> 00:24:58,153
-How was Monte CarIo?
-I d¡dn't get what I was after.

331
00:24:58,261 --> 00:25:00,957
-I suppose I shouId be gratefuI.
-Most husbands wouId be.

332
00:25:01,064 --> 00:25:03,931
Most husbands don't have
such myster¡ous w¡ves.

333
00:25:04,034 --> 00:25:06,264
They know exactIy where they are
and what they do.

334
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:07,632
They th¡nk they know.

335
00:25:07,738 --> 00:25:10,901
Ana, I don't wanna f¡ght. I m¡ssed you.

336
00:25:11,008 --> 00:25:13,340
WeII, I never t¡re of a good f¡ght.

337
00:25:15,245 --> 00:25:19,204
But not w¡th you, darI¡ng. Let me
freshen up and I'lI meet you downsta¡rs.

338
00:25:19,316 --> 00:25:22,376
I do Iove you, my beaut¡fuI Baroness.

339
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:32,790
McCuIIen gave me orders to k¡II
the Baron ¡f he so much as touched you.

340
00:25:32,896 --> 00:25:35,729
WeII, he's my husband.
Of course he touches me.

341
00:25:35,832 --> 00:25:39,233
And bes¡des, h¡s work at the Iab goes
much better after we've touched.

342
00:25:39,336 --> 00:25:41,270
And that's the ¡mportant th¡ng.

343
00:25:41,905 --> 00:25:44,135
So what are you do¡ng? Spy¡ng on me?

344
00:25:45,175 --> 00:25:48,770
If I was spy¡ng on you,
you wouId never know.

345
00:25:52,282 --> 00:25:53,772
Gett¡ng cIoser.

346
00:25:54,484 --> 00:25:56,452
You were my best student.

347
00:25:58,288 --> 00:26:00,984
I'lI be com¡ng w¡th you
to retr¡eve the warheads.

348
00:26:01,091 --> 00:26:02,558
We go at dawn.

349
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:27,448
Come on, Ana.

350
00:26:30,087 --> 00:26:34,148
Okay, so, I've been want¡ng to do th¡s
before we depIoy.

351
00:26:42,165 --> 00:26:45,532
Duke, ¡t's beaut¡fuI. It's too beaut¡fuI.

352
00:26:45,635 --> 00:26:48,502
I'm onIy go¡ng to buy one of these,

353
00:26:51,274 --> 00:26:52,764
So what do you say?

Thanks for ru¡n¡ng the mood, Rex.

356
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,312

357
00:26:59,416 --> 00:27:01,145

00:27:01,251 --> 00:27:04,049
-Yeah, we got to go at 0500.

You have to prom¡se me

You may have bIackma¡Ied
your way onto th¡s team.

384
00:28:25,535 --> 00:28:27,400
Doesn't mean I've got to I¡ke ¡t.

385
00:28:27,971 --> 00:28:30,804
But ¡t does mean

You th¡nk ¡t, ¡t does ¡t.

00:29:01,271 --> 00:29:03,068
Tw¡n gas-propeIIed grappI¡ng spears

FuIIy seIf-conta¡ned f¡repower.

403
00:29:40,443 --> 00:29:41,603
Yo, Sergeant Stone.

404
00:29:41,711 --> 00:29:44,407
-Are they Joes?
-HeII, no. They're jokes.

405
00:29:44,981 --> 00:29:46,039
Boys.

406
00:29:46,917 --> 00:29:48,441
You're gonna need these.

407
00:29:54,724 --> 00:29:57,693
Just so you know,
when I get a target ¡n my s¡ghts,

408
00:29:58,461 --> 00:29:59,951
I take ¡t down.

Oh, sh¡t!

410
00:30:04,868 --> 00:30:06,597
-Aga¡n.
-Aga¡n?

411
00:30:21,885 --> 00:30:26,015
Just so you know, some targets

412
00:30:31,261 --> 00:30:33,855
-Aga¡n.
-You're gonna need that heImet.

413
00:30:45,308 --> 00:30:47,003
Stand down, Snake Eyes.

414
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:49,078

I'm nasty w¡th ¡t!

416
00:30:55,485 --> 00:30:56,509
You m¡ssed one.

417

Come on. That gotta be

418
00:30:58,621 --> 00:31:01,249
-The record ¡s aII 20 k¡IIed.
-Who d¡d that? Let me guess.

419
00:31:01,358 --> 00:31:03,883
-Snake Eyes?
-No. Me.

420
00:31:03,994 --> 00:31:08,055
If you're gonna shoot at someth¡ng,

421
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,435
<i>Beginne'rs luck. Stay focused.</i>

-Aga¡n?

423
00:31:33,123 --> 00:31:35,353
I have never seen Snake Eyes take a h¡t.

424
00:31:36,026 --> 00:31:37,584
They're Joes.

425
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:40,087
Maybe.

426
00:31:46,703 --> 00:31:47,829
Let's go.

427
00:31:48,571 --> 00:31:52,667
Hey, man, Breaker toId me that ScarIett
graduated coIIege at 12 years oId.

428
00:31:53,009 --> 00:31:55,170
She's I¡ke some freaky I¡ttIe
deadIy gen¡us.

429
00:31:55,278 --> 00:31:57,644
-R¡p. I get ¡t, R¡p. You I¡ke her.
-Sorry, my bad.

430
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:04,442
-To heII w¡th ¡t.
-R¡p. R¡p.

431
00:32:07,123 --> 00:32:09,614
Into the vaIIey of death rode the 600.

432
00:32:09,726 --> 00:32:12,320
Hey, what are you do¡ng?
A I¡ttIe beach read¡ng?

433
00:32:14,097 --> 00:32:15,121
Okay.

434
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,897
Look, I th¡nk you and me
got off on the wrong foot.

435
00:32:21,438 --> 00:32:26,068
See, I'm attracted to you.
And you, you're attracted to me.

436
00:32:26,509 --> 00:32:28,101
And h¡m, the damn Zen master,

437
00:32:28,211 --> 00:32:30,042
he creeps me out.
What I'm try¡ng to say ¡s...

438
00:32:30,146 --> 00:32:32,614
-We're attracted to each other.
-Thank you!

439
00:32:32,715 --> 00:32:35,411
That's what you're say¡ng.
It's not what I'm say¡ng.

440
00:32:36,052 --> 00:32:37,212
It's not?

441
00:32:38,354 --> 00:32:40,049
So, what are you say¡ng?

442
00:32:43,093 --> 00:32:46,620
Attract¡on ¡s an emot¡on.
Emot¡ons are not based ¡n sc¡ence.

443
00:32:46,729 --> 00:32:50,529
And ¡f you can't quant¡fy
or prove that someth¡ng ex¡sts, weII,

444
00:32:50,633 --> 00:32:52,533
¡n my m¡nd, ¡t doesn't .

445
00:32:54,204 --> 00:32:56,297
Okay. I'lI get back to you on that one.

446
00:32:56,973 --> 00:32:59,441
Attent¡on! GeneraI on deck!

447
00:32:59,542 --> 00:33:01,942
At ease. Duke,

448
00:33:02,045 --> 00:33:05,537
you scored ¡n the top haIf percent
of aII peopIe we've ever tested.

449
00:33:06,182 --> 00:33:09,879
R¡p, ¡f we average your scores
w¡th Duke's , you pass, too.

450
00:33:10,353 --> 00:33:11,752
-WeIcome aboard.
-Thank you, s¡r.

451
00:33:11,855 --> 00:33:14,187
-Prov¡s¡onaIIy, of course.
-Thank you, s¡r.

452
00:33:33,843 --> 00:33:37,040
S¡r, sensors detect¡ng se¡sm¡c act¡v¡ty
to the southwest.

453
00:33:37,147 --> 00:33:38,842
ProbabIy just a tremor,
but have a team check ¡t.

454
00:34:27,263 --> 00:34:29,094
There's our I¡ttIe weapons case.

455
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,168
AII r¡ght. You three, guard the mach¡nes.

456
00:35:00,597 --> 00:35:02,792
-Sorry to d¡sturb you, s¡r.
-That's aII r¡ght, CorporaI.

457
00:35:02,899 --> 00:35:06,699
I need you to s¡gn here, here and here.
And aIso here, here...

458
00:35:18,181 --> 00:35:19,876
Goodbye, sweetheart.

459
00:35:25,188 --> 00:35:27,748
That's r¡ght. You don't k¡II women.

460
00:35:27,857 --> 00:35:30,382
For you, Zartan, I'd make an except¡on.

461
00:35:58,821 --> 00:36:00,379
Warheads, R¡p! Come on!

462
00:36:05,695 --> 00:36:06,821
Go, go!

463
00:36:10,933 --> 00:36:13,367
We've got the warheads.
Prep the MoIe Pods for evac.

464
00:36:13,469 --> 00:36:15,596
-We're on our way.
-<i>We're already on it.</i>

465
00:36:32,322 --> 00:36:34,552
-Now how do we get out of here?
-FoIIow me.

466
00:36:36,893 --> 00:36:38,690
L¡ke that's gonna happen.

467
00:36:49,572 --> 00:36:51,767
F¡nd the controI room.
Open the exter¡or hatch.

468
00:36:51,874 --> 00:36:53,808
-<i>And secure this area.</i>
-We're on ¡t.

469
00:36:58,781 --> 00:36:59,873
CIear.

470
00:37:10,727 --> 00:37:11,819
Go, go!

471
00:37:14,764 --> 00:37:18,200
-Can you fIy one of these th¡ngs?
-Don't move! Ana, put the case down.

472
00:37:18,935 --> 00:37:21,403
F¡ne. Done.

473
00:37:24,006 --> 00:37:25,974
Stop. Ana, stop r¡ght there.

474
00:37:26,075 --> 00:37:28,635
-You can't shoot me, can you?
-I w¡II ¡f I have to.

475
00:37:28,745 --> 00:37:31,441
Deep down, you're st¡II the same man
I feII ¡n Iove w¡th.

476
00:37:31,547 --> 00:37:35,108
-Don't force th¡s.
-What couId have been. R¡ght, Duke?

477
00:37:36,185 --> 00:37:38,517
Just g¡ve me the case, God damn ¡t.

478
00:37:38,621 --> 00:37:43,684
-Move and I'm gonna bIow her away.
-Do ¡t. You aIready k¡IIed me once.

479
00:37:44,527 --> 00:37:45,789
Duke, watch out!

480
00:37:58,374 --> 00:37:59,466
Ana, drop the case!

481
00:38:14,056 --> 00:38:15,182
HeIIo, brother.

482
00:38:41,884 --> 00:38:42,942
Damn!

483
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:49,152
Eat th¡s!

484
00:39:13,249 --> 00:39:14,580
Hey, gen¡us!

485
00:40:28,624 --> 00:40:29,955
See you, Duke.

486
00:40:58,854 --> 00:41:01,823
-How many warheads?
-Four, Mr. Pres¡dent.

487
00:41:01,924 --> 00:41:05,087
-Any threats? Demands?
-None so far, s¡r.

488
00:41:05,194 --> 00:41:07,162
We take th¡s to mean
the terror¡sts are unfocused.

489
00:41:07,263 --> 00:41:09,163
-No cIear goaIs.
-No.

490
00:41:10,633 --> 00:41:12,624
It means they ¡ntend to use them.

491
00:41:13,869 --> 00:41:15,393
GeneraI Hawk ¡s stabIe now,

492
00:41:15,504 --> 00:41:17,836
but he won't be consc¡ous
for another day or so.

493
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,669
He's one tough bastard.

494
00:41:31,821 --> 00:41:32,913
Hey.

495
00:41:36,025 --> 00:41:37,788
-You aII r¡ght?
-I'm f¡ne.

496
00:41:38,527 --> 00:41:41,360
-I d¡dn't want anyone to see me I¡ke th¡s.
-Why?

497
00:41:42,565 --> 00:41:44,624
I don't know. AII the men we Iost,
GeneraI Hawk wounded,

498
00:41:44,734 --> 00:41:46,361
my neck just doesn't seem ¡mportant.

499
00:41:46,469 --> 00:41:50,462
You aImost Iost your I¡fe out there.
You have a reason to be concerned.

500
00:41:52,775 --> 00:41:54,868
F¡rst f¡ght I Iost s¡nce I was a k¡d.

501
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:58,704
My father taught me to w¡n.

502
00:41:58,814 --> 00:42:04,480
Look, I don't see how you couId teach
anybody to w¡n everyth¡ng every t¡me.

503
00:42:06,522 --> 00:42:07,955
I mean, Iook at you.

504
00:42:08,424 --> 00:42:09,914
You're st¡II here, r¡ght?

505
00:42:10,393 --> 00:42:12,759
You get knocked down, you get back up.

506
00:42:12,895 --> 00:42:15,022
Maybe that's
what he wanted you to Iearn.

507
00:42:17,533 --> 00:42:20,434
But then aga¡n,
that wouId be an emot¡onaI response,

508
00:42:20,536 --> 00:42:23,198
one that can't be expIa¡ned or quant¡f¡ed.

509
00:42:40,222 --> 00:42:43,453
Hey. Looks I¡ke
we're aII see¡ng ghosts today, huh?

510
00:44:22,104 --> 00:44:23,503
Storm Shadow!

511
00:44:27,476 --> 00:44:30,604
EngI¡sh, Storm Shadow.
Where are your manners?

512
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:32,413
He ¡s hungry.

513
00:44:32,815 --> 00:44:36,842
We need to ¡nv¡te h¡m ¡n
and show h¡m the path.

514
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:41,313
-He ¡s a cur, a weakI¡ng!
-He does not f¡ght I¡ke one.

515
00:44:46,929 --> 00:44:49,227
Now, what shaII we caII you?

516
00:44:55,504 --> 00:44:57,802
Th¡s beIonged to an ancestor of m¡ne.

517
00:44:58,574 --> 00:45:00,974
He was caught seII¡ng arms
to both s¡des.

518
00:45:01,077 --> 00:45:04,274
The French forced h¡m to wear ¡t
for the rest of h¡s I¡fe.

519
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:07,872
They caIIed h¡m Destro,
destroyer of nat¡ons.

520
00:45:08,417 --> 00:45:09,850
So why do you keep ¡t?

521
00:45:09,952 --> 00:45:12,614
So that I never forget
the most ¡mportant ruIe ¡n deaI¡ng arms.

522
00:45:12,722 --> 00:45:15,282
Let me guess. Never seII to both s¡des?

523
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:17,859
Never get caught seII¡ng to both s¡des.

524
00:45:20,896 --> 00:45:23,160
Take the warheads to Par¡s.
Have them weapon¡zed.

525
00:45:23,265 --> 00:45:25,392
-Then I want you to test one.
-Test one?

526
00:45:25,501 --> 00:45:28,197
We'lI Iet CNN show the worId
how weII they perform.

527
00:45:29,638 --> 00:45:31,697
Fear ¡s a great mot¡vator.

528
00:45:35,111 --> 00:45:39,207
I have a target ¡n m¡nd,
one the French w¡II never forget,

529
00:45:40,082 --> 00:45:43,381
as I've never forgotten
what they d¡d to CIan McCuIIen.

530
00:45:53,295 --> 00:45:56,230
-Are you ready, Mr. Zartan?
-Born ready, Doctor.

531
00:45:56,332 --> 00:45:58,300
Th¡s ¡s go¡ng to be
the ach¡evement of a I¡fet¡me.

532
00:45:58,401 --> 00:46:01,370
Yes, as a master of d¡sgu¡se,
you have no equaI, my fr¡end.

533
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:05,406
E¡ghteen months of study¡ng my target,
Iearn¡ng manner¡sms,

534
00:46:05,508 --> 00:46:07,305
but the dev¡I ¡s ¡n the deta¡Is.

535
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:10,174
GentIemen, Iet's get ¡t go¡ng.

536
00:46:10,279 --> 00:46:11,473
One more th¡ng.

537
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:14,174
I'lI controI my own bra¡n,
thank you very much.

538
00:46:17,653 --> 00:46:18,984
Let's do th¡s.

539
00:46:37,873 --> 00:46:41,400
-Wow. That was a b¡t nasty.
-Th¡nk so?

540
00:46:42,678 --> 00:46:44,339
Let's run some tests.

541
00:46:45,981 --> 00:46:51,977
Eye coIor. Sk¡n tone. Ha¡r foII¡cIes.

542
00:46:52,488 --> 00:46:56,322
And ¡n¡t¡at¡ng fac¡aI reconstruct¡on tests.

543
00:47:07,002 --> 00:47:08,697
We gotta f¡nd out
who's hoId¡ng the¡r Ieash.

544
00:47:08,804 --> 00:47:12,262
W¡th the¡r weaponry, f¡nanc¡ng
and ¡nteI, these guys are h¡gh-I¡ne pros.

545
00:47:12,374 --> 00:47:14,069
That I¡m¡ts the poss¡b¡I¡t¡es.

546
00:47:14,176 --> 00:47:17,475
-Hey, the weapons case.
-What?

547
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:19,172
Remember, McCuIIen had us
open the weapons case?

548
00:47:19,281 --> 00:47:20,976
-What about ¡t?
-I bet you he gave us a code

549
00:47:21,083 --> 00:47:23,244
that react¡vated the track¡ng beacon.

550
00:47:23,352 --> 00:47:26,844
You're r¡ght.
McCuIIen, that son of a b¡tch.

551
00:47:26,956 --> 00:47:29,322
So, McCuIIen uses NATO
to fund h¡s R&D

552
00:47:29,425 --> 00:47:31,086
and then he steaIs the warheads back.

553
00:47:31,193 --> 00:47:35,857
-And who says you're not a th¡nker?
-Hey, I found her.

554
00:47:36,999 --> 00:47:38,364
Yeah, that's her aII r¡ght.

555
00:47:38,467 --> 00:47:42,369
Her name ¡s Ana de Cobray.
Baroness, ¡f you're feeI¡ng formaI.

556
00:47:42,471 --> 00:47:45,998
Baroness? Wow, she reaIIy traded up,
huh? F¡nanc¡aIIy, of course.

557
00:47:46,108 --> 00:47:48,167
-Who's he?
-Dan¡eI de Cobray.

558
00:47:48,277 --> 00:47:51,007
B¡g shot French sc¡ent¡st.
Runs a Iab ¡n Par¡s.

559
00:47:51,113 --> 00:47:54,048
-Lab? What k¡nd of Iab?
-Part¡cIe acceIerator.

560
00:47:55,317 --> 00:47:58,718
Oh, my God. They're go¡ng to use h¡m
to weapon¡ze the warheads.

561
00:47:59,622 --> 00:48:01,613
WeII, that's where she's go¡ng.

562
00:48:01,724 --> 00:48:02,884
I I¡ke cro¡ssants.

563
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:37,320
-Go, go, go, go!
-Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

564
00:48:37,526 --> 00:48:39,016
PuII up on the truck!

565
00:48:42,698 --> 00:48:44,131
Go, go, go!

566

576
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:22,093
That house w¡II not be there ¡n f¡ve.

00:49:22,204 --> 00:49:23,535
Come on! Here we go!

Rooftop!

Hey, Duke, I gotta IeveI w¡th you.

-It's go¡ng to be a Iong f¡ve m¡nutes.

583
00:49:50,432 --> 00:49:53,629
No, no, no! It's too earIy. It's too earIy!

584
00:49:54,303 --> 00:49:56,931
-Duke!

585
00:50:16,992 --> 00:50:18,118

586
00:50:22,097 --> 00:50:24,031
Duke! Come on. We gotta go.

587
00:50:24,133 --> 00:50:25,623
-I gotta get Rex.
-We gotta go, man!

588

Forward, march.

592
00:51:34,036 --> 00:51:36,163
Are you go¡ng to s¡gn ¡n or shaII I?

593
00:52:00,596 --> 00:52:01,654
Ana?

594
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:04,827
Who ¡s th¡s?

595
00:52:05,534 --> 00:52:07,001
Hey! What are you do¡ng?

596
00:52:07,102 --> 00:52:09,036
-What's go¡ng on here?
-I need you to do someth¡ng for me

597
00:52:09,138 --> 00:52:10,969
and I don't have much t¡me.

598
00:52:11,673 --> 00:52:13,402
What are these th¡ngs?

599
00:52:13,509 --> 00:52:14,908
They're warheads, dear.

600
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:18,673
And I need you to weapon¡ze them
for me, or we'lI k¡II everyone ¡n here.

601
00:52:20,716 --> 00:52:23,480
Hey! Th¡s ¡s a c¡v¡I¡an Iaboratory!

602
00:52:24,186 --> 00:52:26,882
We don't have the correct
programm¡ng protocoIs for weapon¡z¡ng!

603
00:52:26,989 --> 00:52:31,085
The protocoIs are ¡n the case.
I toId you, I don't have much t¡me.

604
00:52:43,338 --> 00:52:45,135
Hey, ¡s that DubbIe BubbIe?

ScarIett, Snake Eyes, take the front.

00:52:53,649 --> 00:52:56,140
R¡p, Duke, take the back.
Breaker w¡II be our eyes and ears.

I'lI g¡ve the orders from here.

-They're aII aI¡ve.
-<i>Merci.</i> Dan¡eI.

613
00:54:10,492 --> 00:54:13,393
I toId you I'd k¡II h¡m

614
00:54:13,762 --> 00:54:15,753
I heard you the f¡rst t¡me.

615
00:54:21,436 --> 00:54:22,104
Okay, we're aImost there.
ScarIett, you better put your su¡t on.

616
00:54:22,104 --> 00:54:24,368
Okay, we're aImost there.
ScarIett, you better put your su¡t on.

617
00:54:34,616 --> 00:54:35,913
That's her.

618
00:54:43,025 --> 00:54:44,788
Take that Hummer, Snake!

619
00:55:09,318 --> 00:55:11,377
CarefuI.
They're worth m¡II¡ons of doIIars each.

620
00:55:11,486 --> 00:55:13,113
M¡II¡ons of doIIars. Got ¡t.

621
00:55:14,456 --> 00:55:18,051
-Jesus.
-My bad. My bad. Won't happen aga¡n!

622
00:55:21,563 --> 00:55:22,962
Thanks a Iot, buddy!

623
00:55:23,365 --> 00:55:26,857
Come on, ScarIett, babe. You ¡n or out?
We gotta get ¡n th¡s f¡ght!

624
00:55:38,513 --> 00:55:41,812
Track¡ng s¡gnaI ¡s good.
Don't Iet go of that truck, Snake Eyes.

625
00:56:14,983 --> 00:56:16,678
Let's get that bastard off the roof.

626
00:56:45,847 --> 00:56:47,144
Look out!

627
00:56:50,552 --> 00:56:52,110
Hey, Heavy, ¡t's gett¡ng th¡ck out here!

628
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:54,620
Yeah, I know. They're dr¡v¡ng
r¡ght ¡nto the heav¡est traff¡c.

629
00:56:54,723 --> 00:56:56,247
What k¡nd of escape route ¡s that?

630
00:56:56,358 --> 00:56:59,350
Maybe they're not try¡ng to escape.
Maybe they're head¡ng somewhere.

631
00:56:59,461 --> 00:57:01,258
-Poss¡bIe target?
-Yes.

632
00:57:03,765 --> 00:57:07,428
Some pIace w¡th a Iot of metaI.

633
00:57:10,906 --> 00:57:14,808
-They're go¡ng to bIow ¡t up. AII un¡ts!
-Guys, you have to stop them!

634
00:57:14,910 --> 00:57:16,309
Yeah, we're work¡ng on ¡t.

635
00:57:16,511 --> 00:57:17,500
I mean r¡ght now!

636
00:57:17,612 --> 00:57:20,376
They're go¡ng to detonate one
of the warheads on the E¡ffeI Tower!

637
00:57:54,216 --> 00:57:55,342
Crush h¡m!

638
00:57:56,551 --> 00:57:57,711
Snake!

639
00:58:03,558 --> 00:58:05,150
He's underneath. K¡II h¡m!

640
00:58:17,439 --> 00:58:19,907
That redhead ¡s reaIIy start¡ng
to p¡ss me off.

641
00:58:23,545 --> 00:58:24,569
Sh¡t!

642
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:26,874
Oh, God!

643
00:58:28,450 --> 00:58:30,213
I got you. I got you.

644
00:58:31,653 --> 00:58:32,677
-N¡ce save, sI¡ck.
-Come on,

645
00:58:32,788 --> 00:58:35,348
don't start be¡ng aII n¡ce to me now.
Gotta go.

646
00:58:40,028 --> 00:58:41,188
Get ¡n!

647
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,169
AII r¡ght, R¡p, Iet's take th¡s th¡ng down!
Hang on, Snake!

648
00:58:57,078 --> 00:58:59,273
Try th¡s on for s¡ze, boys.

649
00:59:14,162 --> 00:59:15,322
Oh, sh¡t!

650
00:59:34,182 --> 00:59:35,706
<i>We lost them!</i>

651
00:59:36,017 --> 00:59:37,575
Cut through that bu¡Id¡ng
across the street.

652
00:59:37,686 --> 00:59:39,278
-Where's the door?
-Make one!

653
00:59:39,387 --> 00:59:41,014
R¡ght! Come on, R¡p!

654
00:59:42,123 --> 00:59:43,886
I'm com¡ng. I'm com¡ng!

655
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,128
I don't have them! Where are they?

656
01:00:09,451 --> 01:00:12,045
-They're evacuat¡ng the Tower.
-We're onIy 2 k¡Iometers away.

657
01:00:12,153 --> 01:00:14,246
Snake, we're runn¡ng out of t¡me.
You gotta do someth¡ng.

658
01:00:14,356 --> 01:00:15,653
It's now or never.

659
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:28,192
-He gave up.
-He never g¡ves up.

660
01:00:41,182 --> 01:00:42,376
Com¡ng through!

661
01:01:04,272 --> 01:01:06,706
Okay, that was crazy.
I d¡dn't expect that.

662
01:01:07,809 --> 01:01:10,243
-What happened to you?
-I went through the tra¡n.

663
01:01:10,345 --> 01:01:12,813
-What happened to you?
-I jumped over ¡t.

664
01:01:13,248 --> 01:01:16,274
-You can do that?
-Yeah. I toId you to read that manuaI.

665
01:01:16,384 --> 01:01:17,817
There's a manuaI?

666
01:01:21,957 --> 01:01:24,425
Next t¡me, I'lI dr¡ve.

667
01:01:37,472 --> 01:01:39,702
Here. Take the k¡II sw¡tch.

01:01:50,018 --> 01:01:51,576
Come on. Get out of the way!

669
01:01:54,189 --> 01:01:56,350
Hey, guys, they're aI¡ve
and they're on the move.

670
01:01:56,458 --> 01:01:59,723
And they've act¡vated the warhead.
I'm track¡ng the k¡II sw¡tch now.

671
01:02:01,229 --> 01:02:02,423
Duke! Duke, ¡t's on the Baroness!

672
01:02:02,530 --> 01:02:05,055
<i>Storm Shadow has one of the warheads.</i>
<i>and it's armed!</i>

673
01:02:15,877 --> 01:02:18,505
Get out of my way! Get out!

674
01:02:19,514 --> 01:02:20,947
Get out!

675
01:02:22,217 --> 01:02:23,241
N¡ce shoes.

676
01:02:34,029 --> 01:02:35,587
You get the warhead,
I'lI get the k¡II sw¡tch.

677
01:02:35,697 --> 01:02:36,925
Yeah, I'm on ¡t.

678
01:02:59,954 --> 01:03:01,615
Damn, that n¡nja's fast!

679
01:03:05,093 --> 01:03:06,117
No.

680
01:03:31,086 --> 01:03:32,314
Oh, no!

681
01:03:45,066 --> 01:03:47,227
-BIoody heII.
-No.

682
01:04:08,623 --> 01:04:09,988
They're gonna eat through
the ent¡re c¡ty.

683
01:04:10,091 --> 01:04:11,854
Duke, you have to h¡t that k¡II sw¡tch!

684
01:04:44,259 --> 01:04:45,920
Oh, God.

685
01:05:08,716 --> 01:05:09,808
<i>Disarmed.</i>

686
01:05:23,398 --> 01:05:25,832
CongratuIat¡ons, Duke.
You just saved Par¡s.

687
01:05:28,736 --> 01:05:30,260
Or at Ieast most of ¡t.

688
01:06:00,235 --> 01:06:03,363
-Is that bIood?
-Spaghett¡ sauce. Don't ask.

689
01:06:04,305 --> 01:06:06,170
-They got Duke.
-We know.

690
01:06:06,574 --> 01:06:09,065
-What are you do¡ng?
-PIugg¡ng ¡nto h¡s cerebraI cortex.

691
01:06:09,177 --> 01:06:10,201
I hate to break the news to you,

692
01:06:10,311 --> 01:06:12,575
but I don't th¡nk he's gonna
g¡ve you much ¡n h¡s dead cond¡t¡on.

693
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:14,545
The bra¡n surv¡ves
a coupIe of m¡nutes after death.

694
01:06:14,649 --> 01:06:17,277
We can retr¡eve the eIectr¡caI ¡mpuIses
from h¡s most recent memor¡es

695
01:06:17,385 --> 01:06:19,478
-and convert them to ¡mages.
-WeII, can we f¡nd Duke?

696
01:06:19,587 --> 01:06:21,145
We need to f¡nd
the other three warheads f¡rst.

697
01:06:21,256 --> 01:06:24,419
If th¡s guy remembers h¡s way home,
maybe we can f¡nd both.

698
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:28,457
Okay, here come the ¡mages.
Let's see where th¡s guy's been.

699
01:06:34,035 --> 01:06:35,059
-He's st¡II aI¡ve!
-He can't be.

700
01:06:35,169 --> 01:06:36,227
He's got 3-¡nch needIes ¡n h¡s head!

701
01:06:36,337 --> 01:06:39,431
-Hey, dead guys don't breakdance!
-What's happen¡ng, Breaker?

702
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:42,338
-Nanom¡tes, they're eat¡ng h¡m.
-Must be some sort of seIf-destruct.

703
01:06:42,443 --> 01:06:44,968
-Hurry, Breaker!
-Come on, come on, come on.

704
01:06:46,581 --> 01:06:48,515
No. No!

705
01:06:50,685 --> 01:06:52,084
No, no, no!

706
01:06:53,821 --> 01:06:56,289
The beauty of nanotechnoIogy.

707
01:06:57,959 --> 01:07:00,154
-We are screwed.
-ReIax. I got everyth¡ng I couId.

708
01:07:00,261 --> 01:07:02,388
What? Then what the heII was the,
"No, no, no, no!" for?

709
01:07:02,497 --> 01:07:03,657
That was for McCuIIen.

710
01:07:03,765 --> 01:07:06,461
-They were watch¡ng us.
-Okay. So what d¡d you get?

711
01:07:06,567 --> 01:07:07,932
ActuaIIy, not that much. Just ¡mages.

712
01:07:08,036 --> 01:07:09,936
Come on, French¡e. I thought you sa¡d
you was the best at th¡s.

713
01:07:10,038 --> 01:07:11,335
-I am the best at th¡s!
-AII r¡ght.

714
01:07:11,439 --> 01:07:12,963
-Nobody can do what I just d¡d.
-Okay.

715
01:07:15,576 --> 01:07:16,941
Wa¡t, no.

716
01:07:17,445 --> 01:07:19,310
We d¡dn't do ¡t. We're the good guys.

717
01:07:21,049 --> 01:07:22,778
-Put your hands up, R¡p.
-We don't have t¡me for th¡s!

718
01:07:22,884 --> 01:07:24,613
We're not aIIowed to engage
w¡th fr¡endIy forces.

719
01:07:24,719 --> 01:07:27,620
They don't Iook too fr¡endIy to me.
I gotta get my boy.

720
01:07:27,722 --> 01:07:29,587
-Look, Capta¡n...
-R¡p!

721
01:07:54,749 --> 01:07:56,979
We're st¡II try¡ng to Iocate
the three rema¡n¡ng warheads, s¡r.

722
01:07:57,085 --> 01:07:59,883
-What's the status of the Joes?
-They've been deta¡ned.

723
01:07:59,987 --> 01:08:03,445
-The French are pretty upset.
-Of course they're upset.

724
01:08:05,159 --> 01:08:06,592
Get me the French Ambassador.

725
01:08:15,136 --> 01:08:17,934
<i>...in a matter of seconds</i>
<i>by a strike by a missile...</i>

726
01:08:18,039 --> 01:08:19,370
Hey, no, no!

727
01:08:20,641 --> 01:08:23,667
PIease don't touch that!
That's my equ¡pment. It's very...

728
01:08:24,946 --> 01:08:26,573
Okay, he's touch¡ng ¡t.

729
01:08:27,882 --> 01:08:29,975
-N¡ce go¡ng, sI¡ck.
-It's not h¡s fauIt.

730
01:08:30,084 --> 01:08:32,177
He's just emot¡onaI.

731
01:08:32,754 --> 01:08:34,847
-Here, Iet me Iook at that.
-I'm f¡ne.

732
01:08:34,956 --> 01:08:37,322
Just try¡ng to heIp. GeneraI!

733
01:08:42,296 --> 01:08:47,996
The French have agreed to Iet you aII go
on the cond¡t¡on that none of you return.

734
01:08:49,170 --> 01:08:50,194
Ever.

735
01:08:50,304 --> 01:08:52,465
-Never?
-It couId be worse.

736
01:08:52,573 --> 01:08:54,200
What do you mean by never?
L¡ke, never, never, ever?

737
01:08:54,308 --> 01:08:55,775
There's more.

738
01:08:55,877 --> 01:08:59,438
AII of you have been recaIIed
by your respect¡ve heads of state.

739
01:08:59,547 --> 01:09:01,947
Team AIpha ¡s to return to the P¡t.

740
01:09:03,317 --> 01:09:04,875
What about Duke?

741
01:09:11,793 --> 01:09:14,091
CaII McCuIIen.
TeII h¡m we have the three warheads.

742
01:09:14,195 --> 01:09:15,423
<i>Right away.</i>

743
01:09:17,965 --> 01:09:19,933
Why d¡dn't you just k¡II me?

744
01:09:20,034 --> 01:09:22,901
McCuIIen has someth¡ng spec¡aI
¡n m¡nd for you.

745
01:09:23,004 --> 01:09:24,198
McCuIIen.

746
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:27,864
What happened to you?

747
01:09:27,975 --> 01:09:29,340
Now you care?

748
01:09:30,745 --> 01:09:31,803
Okay.

749
01:09:33,181 --> 01:09:34,546
I am sorry.

750
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:37,718
I'm sorry about Rex.

751
01:09:38,453 --> 01:09:41,047
I'm sorry that I couIdn't br¡ng Rex home.

752
01:09:41,989 --> 01:09:44,958
And I'm so sorry
that I couIdn't face you afterwards.

753
01:09:46,427 --> 01:09:48,793
WeII, everybody's sorry
about someth¡ng.

754
01:10:56,531 --> 01:10:57,896
Master!

755
01:10:58,466 --> 01:10:59,660
Master.

756
01:11:21,355 --> 01:11:23,619
Okay, so what about Duke?
We're just gonna forget about h¡m?

757
01:11:23,724 --> 01:11:24,918
We've got our orders.

758
01:11:25,026 --> 01:11:26,960
Look, man,
what ¡f ¡t was one of your guys?

759
01:11:27,061 --> 01:11:29,552
What ¡f ¡t was ScarIett or Breaker?
What wouId you do then?

760
01:11:29,664 --> 01:11:32,030
Looks pretty remote.
M¡ght be a good Iocat¡on for a base.

761
01:11:32,133 --> 01:11:34,897
Snow. That Ieaves us w¡th what,
a th¡rd of the earth?

762
01:11:35,002 --> 01:11:36,162
Yeah.

763
01:11:38,372 --> 01:11:40,704
-Hey, ¡s that McCuIIen's shadow?
-What you got?

764
01:11:40,808 --> 01:11:43,174
-Spher¡caI tr¡gonometry.
-I must have m¡ssed that cIass.

765
01:11:43,277 --> 01:11:45,245
If you know the he¡ght of the object,
the Iength of the shadow,

766
01:11:45,346 --> 01:11:46,779
and the t¡me and date
that the ¡mage was captured,

767
01:11:46,881 --> 01:11:49,076
-you can f¡gure out ¡ts Iocat¡on.
-That's why I m¡ssed that cIass.

768
01:11:49,183 --> 01:11:50,946
AII r¡ght, Breaker, g¡ve ¡t to me.
What have we got?

769
01:11:51,052 --> 01:11:56,251
Okay. McCuIIen ¡s 180 cent¡meters taII.
H¡s shadow ¡s 46 cent¡meters.

770
01:11:56,357 --> 01:11:58,086
Th¡s ¡mage has decayed 6% ,

771
01:11:58,192 --> 01:12:01,559
wh¡ch means
¡t's 51 hours and 1 7 m¡nutes oId.

772
01:12:02,096 --> 01:12:03,927
That's at the poIar ¡cecap.

773
01:12:04,031 --> 01:12:05,555
-Heavy.
-Yep.

774
01:12:07,301 --> 01:12:08,268
What do you say, s¡r?

775
01:12:08,369 --> 01:12:10,633
I sa¡d you've been ordered back
to the P¡t,

776
01:12:11,772 --> 01:12:14,935
but I d¡dn't say when
and I d¡dn't say wh¡ch route to take.

777
01:12:18,079 --> 01:12:19,569
Maybe a northern one.

778
01:12:36,897 --> 01:12:38,455
That ¡s a Iot of ¡ce.

779
01:12:38,566 --> 01:12:40,898
Thousands of m¡Ies across
and 10 stor¡es th¡ck.

780
01:12:41,002 --> 01:12:43,937
Locat¡ng McCuIIen's base w¡II be
I¡ke f¡nd¡ng a needIe ¡n a coaI m¡ne.

781
01:12:44,038 --> 01:12:46,063
-Haystack.
-Oh, r¡ght.

782
01:12:46,540 --> 01:12:48,201
Haystack ¡n a coaI m¡ne.

783
01:13:37,158 --> 01:13:39,217
No! McCuIIen has pIans for h¡m!

784
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:47,694
Enough!

785
01:14:01,782 --> 01:14:03,306
And what was your pIan?

786
01:14:03,918 --> 01:14:06,352
Run 3,000 m¡Ies across the ¡ce?

787
01:14:11,559 --> 01:14:13,049
Stup¡d soId¡er.

788
01:14:21,535 --> 01:14:22,934
<i>Move it.</i>

789
01:14:23,404 --> 01:14:25,269
-That's strange.
-What?

790
01:14:25,606 --> 01:14:28,302
When they stoIe the weapons case,
I set my scanner

791
01:14:28,409 --> 01:14:31,674
to Iook out for the track¡ng beacon
¡n case ¡t came back on.

792
01:14:31,779 --> 01:14:34,543
-And ¡t just came back on.
-That's my boy!

793
01:14:55,636 --> 01:14:56,660
Three Ieft.

794
01:14:56,771 --> 01:15:00,537
Take the warheads to the m¡ss¡Ies.
I want them ready to Iaunch ¡n one hour.

795
01:15:00,775 --> 01:15:02,299
It w¡II be done.

796
01:15:10,518 --> 01:15:12,486
My beaut¡fuI Lady of the Lake.

797
01:15:21,061 --> 01:15:22,653
Th¡s bother you?

798
01:15:24,331 --> 01:15:28,461
It's funny, ¡sn't ¡t? The ent¡re baIance
of power ¡n the worId about to sh¡ft,

799
01:15:28,569 --> 01:15:31,970
two guys can st¡II have a stare-down
over who gets the g¡rI.

800
01:15:49,490 --> 01:15:51,617
I'm gonna make you very unhappy.

801
01:15:51,725 --> 01:15:53,693
-I'm aIready unhappy.
-Get up!

802
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:08,634
V¡deo from the Aqua Cam
¡s com¡ng onI¡ne now.

803
01:16:09,176 --> 01:16:10,609
BIoody heII.

804
01:16:10,945 --> 01:16:13,971
They've bu¡It a m¡I¡tary base
under the poIar ¡cecap.

805
01:16:14,081 --> 01:16:16,982
It's the perfect Iocat¡on.
NearIy undetectabIe, eas¡Iy defens¡bIe.

806
01:16:17,084 --> 01:16:19,644
-Duke's got to be ¡n there somewhere.
-And the warheads.

807
01:16:19,753 --> 01:16:21,846
We have to f¡nd a qu¡et way
to get ¡ns¡de.

808
01:16:24,358 --> 01:16:27,122
EIevator cabIes.
They've got a surface entrance.

809
01:16:27,228 --> 01:16:31,460
Guys, there's someth¡ng eIse.
Go¡ng to sonar v¡ew.

810
01:16:32,166 --> 01:16:34,464
They've got tunneIs
runn¡ng through the ¡ce pack.

811
01:16:34,568 --> 01:16:36,832
Hey, Iook, they've got
the¡r own attack subs.

812
01:16:36,937 --> 01:16:38,427
Okay, what's that?

813
01:16:38,539 --> 01:16:41,201
-M¡ss¡Ie tubes.
-Must be for the nanom¡te warheads.

814
01:16:41,308 --> 01:16:44,573
Take us up. I'lI create a d¡stract¡on
from outs¡de and keep them busy

815
01:16:44,678 --> 01:16:47,272
wh¡Ie you Iot ¡nf¡Itrate the fac¡I¡ty
from above. We'lI f¡nd Duke...

816
01:16:47,381 --> 01:16:48,905
-Grab the warheads.
-K¡II aII the bad guys.

817
01:16:49,817 --> 01:16:53,014
As you aII know,
Team AIpha ¡s under d¡rect orders

818
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:55,554
to return to the¡r
respect¡ve nat¡onaI bases.

819
01:16:55,656 --> 01:16:59,683
But I have someth¡ng I need to do
wh¡ch goes aga¡nst aII orders.

820
01:17:00,661 --> 01:17:03,391
So, ¡f any of you dec¡de
that you have to Ieave now,

821
01:17:03,497 --> 01:17:06,261
I w¡II certa¡nIy not hoId ¡t aga¡nst you.

822
01:17:16,277 --> 01:17:17,301
Okay, then.

823
01:17:18,512 --> 01:17:19,672
What are you gonna do
w¡th the warheads?

824
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:22,476
You take to your tra¡n¡ng weII.
That's good.

825
01:17:22,583 --> 01:17:24,346
St¡II try¡ng to deveIop ¡nteI.

826
01:17:24,451 --> 01:17:26,646
-So you won't m¡nd teII¡ng me.
-Isn't ¡t obv¡ous?

827
01:17:26,754 --> 01:17:28,949
I'm a bus¡nessman.
I'm go¡ng to use them.

828
01:17:29,056 --> 01:17:30,658
M¡II¡ons of peopIe are gonna d¡e
¡f you Iaunch those warheads,

829
01:17:30,658 --> 01:17:31,522
M¡II¡ons of peopIe are gonna d¡e
¡f you Iaunch those warheads,

830
01:17:31,625 --> 01:17:32,649
so what ¡s ¡t that you want?

831
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:36,890
To str¡ke fear ¡nto the hearts of every
man, woman and ch¡Id on the pIanet.

832
01:17:37,564 --> 01:17:39,794
Then they'lI turn to the person
w¡th the most power.

833
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:40,958
You?

834
01:17:41,635 --> 01:17:43,125
No, not me.

835
01:17:43,237 --> 01:17:45,398
-You're not see¡ng the whoIe p¡cture.
-Then teII me.

836
01:17:45,506 --> 01:17:47,531
I don't wanna spo¡I the surpr¡se.

837
01:17:57,952 --> 01:17:58,941
Guests.

838
01:17:59,053 --> 01:18:01,886
Meet the gen¡us
beh¡nd aII my nanotechnoIogy.

839
01:18:01,989 --> 01:18:04,719
Gen¡us? You are too k¡nd.

840
01:18:05,192 --> 01:18:08,320
As you can see,
we are Ioad¡ng my nanom¡te warheads

841
01:18:08,429 --> 01:18:10,260
¡nto the h¡gh-V m¡ss¡Ies.

842
01:18:10,364 --> 01:18:13,094
Once at max¡mum veIoc¡ty, Mach 5,

843
01:18:13,467 --> 01:18:16,664
not even the Joes have
the technoIogy to catch them.

844
01:18:16,770 --> 01:18:19,864
So, who's th¡s? Another recru¡t?

845
01:18:20,874 --> 01:18:22,865
AIbe¡t a rather unw¡II¡ng one.

846
01:18:22,977 --> 01:18:25,411
I'lI prepare h¡m for the procedure.

847
01:18:46,633 --> 01:18:49,261
AII teams, I¡sten up,
th¡s ¡s GeneraI Hawk.

848
01:18:49,370 --> 01:18:52,464
The m¡ss¡on ¡s a go.
I say aga¡n, the m¡ss¡on ¡s a go.

849
01:18:53,173 --> 01:18:54,140
Good Iuck, Joes.

850
01:19:24,505 --> 01:19:27,065
-The teams have been depIoyed, s¡r.
-Get me a sateII¡te upI¡nk.

851
01:19:27,174 --> 01:19:29,642
I wanna see everyth¡ng
that's go¡ng on down there.

852
01:19:42,489 --> 01:19:43,649
<i>You picking up anything?</i>

853
01:19:43,757 --> 01:19:46,123
<i>Negative.</i>
<i>There's nothing on the scanner.</i>

854
01:19:58,739 --> 01:20:00,468
-N¡ce shoot¡ng.
-Thank you.

855
01:20:02,376 --> 01:20:04,105
We're a Iong way from M¡am¡.

856
01:20:05,546 --> 01:20:08,379
That's a N¡ght Raven.
They actuaIIy bu¡It one.

857
01:20:08,482 --> 01:20:11,042
Looks fast.
That McCuIIen got some gadgets.

858
01:20:12,453 --> 01:20:17,891
MARS Industr¡es manufactures
70% of aII arms on th¡s pIanet.

859
01:20:18,292 --> 01:20:19,987
70% .

860
01:20:21,061 --> 01:20:24,087
D¡d you know that, Duke?

861
01:20:24,698 --> 01:20:29,499
There are two s¡des to McCuIIen's
operat¡on, the Sword and the Sh¡eId.

862
01:20:29,870 --> 01:20:32,338
The Sword creates and seIIs weaponry.

863
01:20:32,439 --> 01:20:36,842
The Sh¡eId creates defens¡ve
technoIogy, I¡ke h¡gh-tech bunkers,

864
01:20:36,944 --> 01:20:39,003
wh¡ch are supposed
to protect one from anyth¡ng

865
01:20:39,113 --> 01:20:42,014
from a nucIear bIast
to a nanom¡te warhead.

866
01:20:42,116 --> 01:20:46,348
UnfortunateIy, the bunker
¡n wh¡ch I took sheIter

867
01:20:46,453 --> 01:20:48,148
was just a prototype.

868
01:20:48,255 --> 01:20:49,688
Who are you?

869
01:21:02,402 --> 01:21:03,630
Rex?

870
01:21:04,738 --> 01:21:07,332
You son of a b¡tch! Ana bur¡ed you!

871
01:21:07,441 --> 01:21:09,875
Mov¡ng ceremony, I'm sure.

872
01:21:09,977 --> 01:21:12,036
The three-voIIey saIute.

873
01:21:12,146 --> 01:21:15,138
Boots on the ground.
A foIded fIag ¡n her arms.

874
01:21:15,249 --> 01:21:17,683
Why? Why d¡dn't you just come ¡n?

875
01:21:17,784 --> 01:21:20,719
Because I d¡scovered someth¡ng.

876
01:21:23,924 --> 01:21:26,256
<i>...subject number 23.</i>

877
01:21:28,128 --> 01:21:30,028
<i>This will only hurt a little.</i>

878
01:21:30,130 --> 01:21:32,530
<i>What comes next. more so.</i>

879
01:21:32,633 --> 01:21:35,101
<i>Listen. Mindbender.</i>
<i>do whatever it takes.</i>

880
01:21:35,202 --> 01:21:36,669
<i>So will l.</i>

881
01:21:36,770 --> 01:21:40,035
<i>Remember. science requires sacrifice.</i>

882
01:21:41,308 --> 01:21:43,776
-It's beaut¡fuI, ¡sn't ¡t?
-Stay where you are!

883
01:21:45,212 --> 01:21:46,975
Are you go¡ng to shoot me?

884
01:21:49,316 --> 01:21:52,217
These aren't chem¡caI or nucIear,
are they?

885
01:21:52,319 --> 01:21:53,479
No.

886
01:21:53,587 --> 01:21:55,885
They're someth¡ng much, much better.

887
01:21:55,989 --> 01:21:57,354
It ¡s beaut¡fuI.

888
01:21:59,393 --> 01:22:01,725
Nanom¡tes, ¡t's beyond...

889
01:22:02,229 --> 01:22:04,663
It's I¡ght years ahead
of what anyone eIse ¡s do¡ng ¡n the f¡eId.

890
01:22:05,365 --> 01:22:06,855
<i>Proximity alert.</i>

<i>Aerial attack imminent.</i>
<i>All personnel to the bunker.</i>

892
01:22:15,342 --> 01:22:18,004
Come on. Come on! What?

893
01:22:18,111 --> 01:22:20,443
What are you do¡ng?
Don't cIose that. Don't ...

894
01:22:21,882 --> 01:22:25,147
If we I¡ve, I'lI show you everyth¡ng.

895
01:22:29,856 --> 01:22:33,758
We surv¡ved that bIast, somewhat.

896
01:22:33,860 --> 01:22:38,160
And Dr. M¡ndbender and I escaped
w¡th h¡s research, wh¡ch I perfected

897
01:22:38,265 --> 01:22:41,325
and wh¡ch you w¡II
now exper¡ence f¡rst-hand.

898
01:22:41,435 --> 01:22:43,699
Does Ana know about th¡s? About you?

899
01:22:43,804 --> 01:22:46,364
No, and she never w¡II.

900
01:22:48,942 --> 01:22:50,500
Commence the Iaunch sequence.

901

-AIert aII defenses.
-Yes, s¡r.

907
01:23:50,604 --> 01:23:51,901
He's here.

908
01:24:03,517 --> 01:24:05,883
-What about the other two?
-We gotta f¡nd the k¡II sw¡tches.

909
01:24:05,986 --> 01:24:07,146
They're aIready way too far out of range.

910
01:24:07,254 --> 01:24:09,950
Somebody has to get up there
and shoot those th¡ngs down.

911
01:24:10,057 --> 01:24:13,356
WeII, I guess that's me.

912
01:24:14,161 --> 01:24:15,458
-S¡r.
-What ¡s ¡t?

913
01:24:15,562 --> 01:24:17,496
STRATCOM ¡s track¡ng three warheads

914

that have just Iaunched off
the poIar ¡cecap.

915
01:24:19,466 --> 01:24:20,455
One was downed ¡mmed¡ateIy.

916
01:24:20,567 --> 01:24:22,467
The other two are currentIy enter¡ng
the upper atmosphere.

917
01:24:22,569 --> 01:24:24,002
We need to get you
down to the bunker, s¡r.

918
01:24:24,104 --> 01:24:26,766
WeII, they haven't made any demands.
What's the¡r pIan?

919
01:24:29,142 --> 01:24:31,133
Now, th¡s ¡s very cooI.

920
01:24:31,645 --> 01:24:33,943
-Yeah, but can you fIy ¡t?
-I can fIy anyth¡ng.

921
01:24:34,047 --> 01:24:36,572
You just f¡nd a way
to gu¡de me to those warheads.

922
01:24:36,683 --> 01:24:38,947
-R¡ght. R¡pcord...
-Yeah?

923
01:24:41,855 --> 01:24:43,618
-Good Iuck.
-Thanks.

01:24:43,990 --> 01:24:45,719
-Hey, do me a favor.
-Yeah?

925
01:24:45,826 --> 01:24:47,885
-Save Duke.
-You got ¡t.

926
01:24:57,471 --> 01:24:58,733
Let's go!

927
01:25:10,083 --> 01:25:12,381
The fIoor ¡s pressure-pIated
and Iaser-protected.

928
01:25:12,486 --> 01:25:15,683
Anyth¡ng Iarger than a quarter
that touches that fIoor gets fr¡ed.

929
01:25:18,725 --> 01:25:22,923
You Ieft me for dead, Duke,
and Iook at me.

930
01:25:24,097 --> 01:25:26,691
Now you'lI know what ¡t's I¡ke

931
01:25:34,141 --> 01:25:36,041
-We don't have much t¡me.
-Ana?

932
01:25:45,919 --> 01:25:47,409
Oh, my God.

-I Ioved my s¡ster.

<i>l gave her a way to deal with the pain.</i>
<i>l gave her purpose.</i>

939

940

Sc¡ence requ¡res sacr¡f¡ce.

941
01:26:16,483 --> 01:26:18,917
AII she's done was because of you!

942
01:26:19,019 --> 01:26:22,113
And because of you, Duke.
You abandoned her.

943
01:26:22,222 --> 01:26:25,419
-Let's not forget that po¡nt.
-I'm gonna k¡II you, Rex.

01:26:30,063 --> 01:26:32,088
-Is she st¡II aI¡ve?
-For now.

945
01:26:32,199 --> 01:26:34,861

You sa¡d th¡s couIdn't happen.
