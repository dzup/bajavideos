1
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,518
Accio!

2
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,794
<i>The day I left for the seminary</i>
<i>just my brother saw me off.</i>

3
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,996
My brother is an only child

4
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,275
Ulixes, Diomedes, Tessander.

5
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,589
The Achaeans wanted to conquer Troy.

6
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,793
Epeius built a wooden horse,

7
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,873
then inside hid Menelaus, Ulysses...

8
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,555
Excellent!

9
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,479
<i>Manrico came to visit sometimes,</i>
<i>but he was the only one!</i>

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,753
A photo of my girlfriend.

11
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,354
- Maybe she'll work a miracle!
- What miracle?

12
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,995
The miracle to make you normal.

13
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,393
Religion, it's all false.

14
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,076
Jesus was a revolutionary
who pissed off the Romans.

15
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,516
The Bible? Adam created from clay?

16
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,198
- No?
- Bullshit, we come from monkeys!

17
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,636
Get out of here while you can.

18
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,753
That's what I think,
but it's up to you.

19
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,514
He gave me a photo of his girlfriend

20
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,469
and it made me commit a sin.

21
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,394
This is an actress.

22
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,755
Marisa Allasio.

23
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,918
I'm in mortal sin, what should I do?

24
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,196
Is this your first impure act?

25
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,391
Six Hail Marys and six Salve Reginas.

26
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,352
You absolve me?

27
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,309
- It'll happen again.
- Oh, come on!

28
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,433
It's not certain.

29
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,639
It is! I don't want to be absolved.

30
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,754
You're a little upset,
we'll discuss it tomorrow.

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,197
Purity is everything for a priest,
punish me!

32
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,591
To sin can happen,

33
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,910
we'll discuss it in a few days.

34
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,635
In Cuba,
on the other side of the ocean,

35
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,519
the Soviet Union is sending ships

36
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,233
with nuclear missiles

37
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,074
to be aimed at the USA.

38
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,880
A third World War could break out,
let us pray.

39
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,033
- How can they be Communists?
- Benassi, join in prayer.

40
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,431
- Don't they realize?
- Don't question, pray.

41
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,830
God, let me die of pneumonia,

42
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,719
but convert Khrushchev,

43
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,155
convert the Communists.

44
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,036
You touched yourself?

45
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,032
So?

46
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,589
Next time let me do it for you.

47
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,068
If they ask who broke your nose

48
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,993
say Antonio Benassi, a.k.a. Accio.

49
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,110
I'm having a conscience crisis,
what should I do?

50
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,757
Open to strangers like that?
Stark naked!

51
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,037
- You're a stranger?
- Did you know it was me?

52
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,236
- You're so boring!
- Mom?

53
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,836
All we needed was
this great decision of yours.

54
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,832
Give me a kiss.

55
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,038
What's this thingamajig?

56
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,669
Serves to make ends meet.

57
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,869
With your father's salary
after mid-month

58
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,078
all I can give you is bread,
water and sugar!

59
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,590
Marisa Allasio worked a miracle.

60
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,230
- Did Mom buy you this?
- It's borrowed, try it.

61
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,749
Know where you can put those sticks?

62
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,318
- What are you doing on my bed?
- I sleep here now.

63
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,711
- And me?
- In the hall for now.

64
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,799
On the pull-out couch.

65
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,112
- Yeah, sure!
- Am I the ugly duckling?

66
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,797
I want to sleep in Manrico's room,
hear me, Pop?

67
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,398
There he is!
Nowwhat do we do with you?

68
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,238
Hi, Pop.

69
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,754
A priest in the family
could have been handy.

70
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,230
I'll take the exam and
go to Classical High School.

71
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,355
- I was tops in Latin.
- Go to Technical so you'll get a job.

72
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,034
- I don't wanna.
- Why not?

73
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,638
I can't get numbers into my head.

74
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,799
If you get a B+ average,
you can go to Classical,

75
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,996
otherwise, Technical.

76
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,555
Let me get changed.

77
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,237
What if I forget school
and come work with you?

78
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,236
The factory? Are you nuts?

79
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,040
- So I'll be on your side.
- Whose side?

80
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,352
- The woeful masses.
- Get lost, off to Mom!

81
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,469
What a homecoming!

82
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,313
Cool it!

83
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,158
<i>That's how it was at home,</i>
<i>luckily there was Mario.</i>

84
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,358
- What was that?
- The American Military Cemetery.

85
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,273
- Soldiers who died at Anzio.
- Poor guys.

86
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,995
Poor guys?
They should have stayed home,

87
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,071
not be pains in the ass to Fascism!

88
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,676
Till 200 years ago they were bushmen,
now they teach us democracy?

89
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,310
What can they do
besides skyscrapers? Nothing.

90
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,911
Fascism, in the middle of the desert,
built Asmara and Tripoli.

91
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,190
If you went around Asmara,
it seemed like Rome.

92
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,269
- I'd like to go.
- To Asmara?

93
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,116
Rome, because it's an eternal city
and I like eternal things.

94
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,749
Hey baby, come here a sec'!

95
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,716
- They're not eternal.
- Yeah, I see that.

96
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,950
Promoted with a B+ average.

97
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,598
Good, that's 50% of your duty.

98
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,070
Now register me at Classical.

99
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,075
Your father made that promise.

100
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,312
You knew it too.

101
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,439
By law, the decisions made
by only one parent aren't valid.

102
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,593
- What the hell law is that?
- Watch your mouth! Come here!

103
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,196
Use proper language.

104
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,473
- Come here.
- You'll smack me.

105
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,190
- I sure will!
- How come she can and I can't?

106
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,796
She's a girl, she'll marry
and her husband will support her.

107
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,110
- No way!
- Yeah...

108
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,591
- See? She won't marry.
- She'll be a concert musician.

109
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,956
Can't I become a "Latiner"?

110
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,432
Manrico isn't going to University,
so why should you?

111
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,636
How come Violetta goes to Classical?

112
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,111
Enough!
Concerts pay, Latin doesn't.

113
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,320
It doesn't, use your head!

114
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,114
- You done?
- Outta the way!

115
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,318
Can hear you for miles around,
take Mom's bags!

116
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,432
Get a load of him!

117
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,273
What's it to you?

118
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,390
There's been no peace
since he came home.

119
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,915
- Go home.
- Get lost.

120
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,677
- Get home so I can knock you around.
- Get lost, I said!

121
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,153
I'll knock you around!

122
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,958
You suck on that bike!

123
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,918
- Still talkin'?
- Shut up.

124
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,710
<i>I couldn't stay in that house</i>
<i>a minute longer.</i>

125
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,430
<i>You see, my mother had voted</i>
<i>for the "houses party".</i>

126
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,069
<i>Our house was falling apart,</i>

127
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,472
<i>she'd seen a house on the ballot</i>

128
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,917
<i>and hoped</i>
<i>they might give us a new one.</i>

129
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,676
The road for Genoa ends here?

130
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,956
Where the hell do I go?

131
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,556
<i>I wanted to follow</i>
<i>the coast road for Genoa</i>

132
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,555
<i>and from there set sail for Africa,</i>
<i>or elsewhere, to help the masses.</i>

133
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,953
<i>No one told me</i>
<i>that the coast road for Genoa</i>

134
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,033
<i>ended at Ostia, 500 kms before.</i>

135
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,468
I told you
they'd release him right away.

136
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,837
<i>The Carabinieri brought me home.</i>

137
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,956
Try to get along.

138
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,555
I've great patience and great hope.

139
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,873
- What did we do to you?

140
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,036
- Injustices.

141
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,038
What injustices?

142
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,792
- You could have told your mother.
- She's the first to do them.

143
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,430
Don't you dare speak of
your mother like that.

144
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,436
She'd give her soul for you.

145
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,715
She would for them, not for me.

146
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,916
Whose son are you?

147
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,230
We're not supposed
to say anything to him!

148
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,071
I want to know what we did to him.

149
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,951
I'd like to know some things too,
we're not to say anything!

150
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,711
Knock it off,
you're making her cry.

151
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,116
She makes me cry too, doesn't she?

152
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,794
- You're pissin' me off.
- Don't touch me.

153
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,998
- The little prince's back.
- I'll be leavin' again.

154
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,195
So go!

155
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,357
Accio's got the devil in him,
our son is possessed.

156
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,994
Come and see, ladies,
beautiful tablecloths and sheets.

157
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,512
Embroidered with our colors

158
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,513
reminding us that honor
and country... look how lovely...

159
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,558
aren't stains to be washed away.

160
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,956
Like them, ma'm?

161
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,833
I'm over here.

162
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,953
Feel the cloth,
it's Terital, not cotton,

163
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,478
they don't wrinkle, need no ironing,
just don't smoke in bed.

164
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,910
Do you smoke?
Your husband? Not even after?

165
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,752
These are yours.

166
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,718
Your husband smokes though.

167
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,516
Can I ask something?

168
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,638
If the Italians liked him so much,

169
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,235
why did they let him
end up like this?

170
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,752
Never mind...

171
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,757
Take your foot off the clutch,
look in the mirror.

172
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,554
The first rule is honor,

173
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,395
meaning: Don't betray a friend,
your country or the Idea.

174
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,114
Shift!

175
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,516
Slow down, now into second.

176
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,039
- Know why you never betray the Idea?
- Why?

177
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,557
Because the Idea is the Idea.

178
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,953
Clear?

179
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,912
Hello, Maria.

180
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,998
Aren't you hungry?

181
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,149
- You remember Accio?
- Sure!

182
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,439
A handshake? Give me a kiss.

183
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,839
Handsome!

184
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,071
- He's eating with us.
- No, thank you.

185
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,833
He'll just watch.

186
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,116
Good thing you weren't hungry!

187
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,915
It's delicious,
I'm really enjoying it.

188
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,790
How many in your family?

189
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,631
Me, my brother, my sister,
all raised the old-fashioned way.

190
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,840
- Meaning?
- The belt, spankings.

191
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,878
Nowadays no one
raises kids like that.

192
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,356
That's why we grew up so well.

193
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,876
- But they call you "Accio".
- 'Cause I'd beat up everyone.

194
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,992
There's a Fascist in you.

195
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,194
You were born a Fascist,
a real thug.

196
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,078
You have to join the party.

197
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,599
Il Duce invented rational
architecture, know what that means?

198
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,999
- That he was always right.
- Good.

199
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,992
Look up there.

200
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,998
How many days did it take
to build Sabaudia?

201
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,996
It says 253 days.

202
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,230
Eight and a half months, it takes
nine to make a human being.

203
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,436
Human... maybe!

204
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,799
If he comes out a fruit,
what do you do?

205
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,192
Look, see that?

206
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,719
He gave his speech from that balcony,
I can almost hear him.

207
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,475
Crowds of people cheering,
waving flags.

208
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,708
Then, in 1944, the Americans came
and the Fascists disappeared.

209
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,509
- All of them, vanished!
- Pieces of shit!

210
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,718
Italians like to help
the guy who wins.

211
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,875
Tell me who's ever done
what Il Duce did!

212
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,351
He took from the rich
and gave to the poor.

213
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,239
Who did that? Only Il Duce.

214
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,355
- Sure?
- Sure.

215
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,349
Duce!

216
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,910
<i>Suddenly I realized</i>
<i>Latina wasn't so bad,</i>

217
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,158
<i>and also Aprilia, Ardea, Pomezia.</i>

218
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,749
<i>Gratitude sprang up in me</i>
<i>for the man who'd built them.</i>

219
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,513
Is it true you're a Communist?

220
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,596
Look at you.

221
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,154
<i>My family was what it was...</i>

222
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,039
<i>but I felt that from that moment</i>
<i>I'd never be alone again.</i>

223
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,795
- What brought you here?
- A bus.

224
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,473
Funny kid.

225
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,718
- Who sent you here?
- I want to join.

226
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,115
I don't believe you,
Fascists don't grow on trees.

227
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,678
I worked with Mario Nastri,
the tablecloth seller.

228
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,472
- You could have said so.
- Didn't know it was important.

229
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,038
Fill this out.

230
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:25,915
We're the best, <i>oi aristoi...</i>
Listen.

231
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,472
We have to be wary.

232
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,959
Fascism in Italy crumbled
because of the traitors.

233
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,595
Millions of Italian traitors.

234
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,996
I know, but what can I do?

235
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,075
Give me your personal reasons.

236
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,069
Listen, Secretary Bombacci...
or Section Chief?

237
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,069
Secretary.

238
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,471
I want to redeem
the lost honor of this country.

239
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,349
- Well, will you register me?
- With reserve.

240
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,358
I'll keep my eye on you.

241
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,513
Now what do I do?
An action or something...

242
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,116
What action?
Go play with my nephew.

243
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,148
I'm prepared to do certain things.

244
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,752
Then go play.

245
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,513
I obey.

246
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,516
Hey, I've been ordered to play.

247
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,189
- Passes with or without goal-kicks?
- Without.

248
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,396
- I've done that all afternoon.
- And I care?

249
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,518
<i>Since faith is life</i>

250
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,272
<i>and those who have not</i>
<i>the courage to profess a faith</i>

251
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,996
<i>and live it,</i>

252
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,034
<i>show blatant...</i>

253
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,560
- Where did I put my keys?
- Hear him?

254
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,596
He's listening to Fascist speeches,
even joined the movement.

255
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,798
- I'm busy, got to see a girl.
- Just talk to him.

256
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,554
- I'll end up beating him up.
- So!

257
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,879
What do you want?

258
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,799
We'll make him reason, if not then...

259
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,309
- You're such an ass!
- What did I do?

260
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,915
- Give me the card.
- It's my choice.

261
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,835
Great choice!
Know why they call it MSI?

262
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,798
Mussolini, Sun Immortal.

263
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,868
Know where we'd be
if it weren't for him?

264
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,078
With a load of people alive,
not dead in war.

265
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,396
Forget politics, understood?

266
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,473
Are you the only ones who can have
a political conscience?

267
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,075
Who's "you"?
Talk to me directly.

268
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,788
And Stalin, the Communist crimes?

269
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,589
You don't know shit,
Exterminator of Jews.

270
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,149
The extermination of the Jews
isn't true.

271
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,915
Do you know
what the fuck you're saying?

272
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,549
Know how quick the Americans
can shoot a fake film?

273
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,510
Get out, or I'll kill him myself.

274
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,758
You piece of shit!

275
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,671
I'll get these fucking ideas
of yours out of your head.

276
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,199
I'll wash 'em out.

277
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,433
Enough?

278
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,359
Well?

279
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,433
You're a jerk!

280
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,111
I've told you a thousand times
it bothers my nose.

281
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,353
- Wash this.
- Do it yourself.

282
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,032
Thanks a lot!

283
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,035
- Do the Benassis live here?
- Yes.

284
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,913
Looking for Violetta?

285
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,520
No, I'm one of Manrico's
party comrades.

286
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,318
He's not here.

287
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,916
Can I wait for him?

288
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,399
Sure...

289
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,432
- Can I wait inside?
- Yeah.

290
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,999
- I have to pick up some flyers.
- Flyers?

291
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,988
Sure, of course.

292
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,359
- Is that his bed?
- It's mine, the chair opens...

293
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,958
He and my sister sleep in there.

294
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,479
I'm better off because
it's a little more private.

295
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,351
- Who plays the cello?
- My sister.

296
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,673
Don't touch it,
she'll get pissed off.

297
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,796
- They're not here?
- No.

298
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:28,034
I knewit, my brother
told you as an excuse.

299
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,358
You fell for it...

300
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,836
I guess I like falling for it.

301
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,718
It's nice here.

302
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,553
I think it stinks.

303
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,112
Your brother told me
all you like is Latin.

304
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,595
Then why are you in Technical?

305
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,352
Good question.

306
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,998
Here he is.

307
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,397
There's a friend of yours
who's looking for flyers.

308
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,070
- Let's go out?
- Sure.

309
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,798
- Mom?
- She's not here.

310
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,037
When'll she be back?

311
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,595
Why don't we stay here?

312
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,757
I'll pour you a vermouth,
even better, some coffee.

313
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,116
Accio, make us some coffee?

314
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,838
Listen...

315
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,078
I have an important
interview at the factory,

316
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,276
if it goes right, they'll hire me.

317
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,635
Since we still
have things to discuss,

318
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,473
stay with her,
I'll be back in half an hour.

319
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,678
- No, I'm busy.
- Come on, half an hour.

320
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,275
Does it show she wore me out?

321
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,956
What a drag!

322
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,313
I just remembered
I have an appointment,

323
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,278
be back in half an hour.

324
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,875
- I'll come with you.
- No, stay here.

325
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,078
- To do what?
- Stay with Accio.

326
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,719
Half hour.

327
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,590
- You're not from Latina.
- No, I'm half French.

328
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,159
You're kidding!

329
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,876
My mother is from the north too...
of Italy, though.

330
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,838
How come you're in Latina?

331
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,318
My father's an engineer
at the electric plant.

332
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,075
Are you active in politics too?

333
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,949
Look, I'm on the other side.

334
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,953
- Meaning?
- What's your guess?

335
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,952
That I'm a Fascist.

336
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,876
Yeah, I'm not as original as Manrico.

337
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,958
No way!

338
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,916
I'll show you my card.

339
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,916
Believe me now?

340
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,839
Antonio Benassi, a.k.a. Accio
for reasons I'm not getting into now.

341
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,516
You Communists feel the weight
of the supremacy you've...

342
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,792
Never mind.

343
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:43,079
You say you're French,
say something.

344
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,358
You are the magnificent magistrate,

345
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,830
you have the right to life and death,
every power, every freedom...

346
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,116
Really French.

347
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,476
And you're really Fascist.

348
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,597
And proud of it.

349
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,319
Good for you.

350
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,077
You've never been
in one of our divisions,

351
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,638
we have discussions...

352
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,395
Anyway... are you French for real?

353
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,719
We'd better go out,
if Mom finds you here...

354
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,191
it's in your best interest.

355
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,275
- Anyway we'll just end up arguing.
- I think so.

356
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,672
Ma, yeah...

357
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,878
Is Manrico back? No, nothing.

358
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,876
He's still not back.

359
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,392
Your brother's really...
Is he always like this?

360
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,760
- Meaning?
- You can't depend on him.

361
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,399
Worse than that.

362
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,870
I don't mean show up, but anything...

363
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,871
Caring for him is a joke.

364
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,673
I must be crazy.

365
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,596
Where are you going? Francesca!

366
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,518
You're an idiot to think about him,
Know how many I've seen like you?

367
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,069
They call youAccio
because you're mean.

368
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,595
I'm leaving.

369
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,752
See if I care!

370
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,029
<i>Manrico got hired at the factory:</i>

371
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,555
<i>Day one he bought overalls,</i>

372
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,110
<i>day two, he got indebted for life</i>
<i>buying himself a car.</i>

373
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,596
Did you finish the assignment?

374
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,838
- Let me see?
- Why? You don't have a clue.

375
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,156
You're such a good kid!

376
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,398
I'll beat you up!

377
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,678
- Jeez!
- I did it for Francesca, not you.

378
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,354
I'm going back to work.

379
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,156
Did I take the keys?

380
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,436
I did your translation.

381
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,516
It was a piece of cake.

382
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:30,038
Sounds like a passage on Manrico:

383
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,395
"Devious, fickle, passionate,
abundant eloquence, little wisdom."

384
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,596
Virtually my brother.

385
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,756
See how a Fascist behaves?

386
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,958
How many of our men
did you kill after the war?

387
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,269
This again?

388
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,080
They were a bunch of innocent people.

389
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:54,269
- A bunch of murderers!
- Wasn't it peacetime?

390
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,438
First there was war,
you started it and dictatorship too.

391
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,990
You guys don't have
the courage for dictatorship.

392
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,798
Let's drop it.

393
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,913
Convenient, first kill,
torture and then...

394
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:11,352
Do you know what Decima MAS was?
The dungeon in Via Tasso?

395
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,038
I like this.

396
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,313
You, dancing?

397
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,992
I'm a complete man!

398
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,316
I'm moving to Turin next month.

399
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,878
I'm moving to Turin,
my father's being transferred.

400
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,718
Where?

401
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:43,069
- What does Manrico say?
- He'll come up on weekends.

402
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,676
What do you say?

403
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,835
If he doesn't, I will.

404
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,030
I wanted all of us, men and women

405
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,636
to come up here

406
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:10,510
to say how it feels to work
50 hours a week in a factory.

407
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,314
They want to make us become machines,

408
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,632
we need to talk, communicate,

409
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,839
we need a human relationship,

410
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,999
a real one!

411
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,198
Mothers, I turn to you,

412
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,678
tell your children
that the factory is a bad place,

413
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,515
that it hurts you,
we shouldn't tolerate it.

414
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,836
We have to break free.

415
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,751
They treat us like slaves,
freedom from the master!

416
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,032
<i>Manrico was courageous,</i>
<i>it came natural to him.</i>

417
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,796
<i>Like making people fall in love.</i>

418
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,713
<i>That day,</i>
<i>in the middle of all that racket</i>

419
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,509
<i>looking at those women, you knew</i>
<i>they loved him, one especially.</i>

420
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,672
We should be anti-American,
they were our enemies.

421
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,515
Means nothing,
we have to go man by man.

422
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,877
Go man by man, understand?

423
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,077
Meantime we get fucked.

424
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,709
What's with the kid, he seems sad.

425
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,354
- He is, in fact.
- Some girl making him suffer?

426
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,314
The opposite, that's why he's sad.

427
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,759
- Don't be disrespectful!
- Is it my fault the door is low?

428
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:51,150
Do you understand
the magnitude of this motto?

429
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,314
"Eia eia alala",
Know what it means?

430
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,154
Nothing, and everyone behind him.

431
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,792
Great!

432
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,795
Doesn't even say goodbye?

433
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,836
You're going and
who knows when he'll see you.

434
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:16,551
Why not look around,
maybe you'd see somebody else.

435
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,792
Hitting on your brother's girl?

436
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,758
You crazy?

437
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,515
You don't like me 'cause I'm Fascist,
you like him 'cause he's Communist?

438
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,517
I like Manrico because he's Manrico.

439
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,432
See what he's like?

440
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,636
You can't depend on him.

441
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,629
And it's not true I don't like you.

442
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,996
I love arguing with you.

443
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,272
Is that your father?

444
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,114
Long live Italy!

445
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,200
The working class will win!

446
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,228
Freedom for Russia!

447
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,432
What the fuck are you doing?

448
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,438
Think a night in jail scared me?

449
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,629
It's an honor,
because I served the Idea.

450
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,793
Fuck off, Benassi,
isn't one pain in the ass enough?

451
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,996
What a fuckin' family!

452
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:08,629
"We don't give a damn about jail,
to the black shirts, all hail."

453
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,438
See what a fucking country,

454
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,989
can't even yell
"Freedom for Russia"...

455
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,878
Don't you dare go on strike
at school again.

456
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,678
You crazy?

457
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,432
Clear?

458
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,035
Manrico's strikes are okay,
mine aren't?

459
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,278
His are good, yours aren't.

460
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,511
Real democratic!

461
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,469
"Princess Ruspoli European
Trapshooting Champion."

462
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,957
The Borgheses, the Torlonias,
the Ruspolis...

463
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,953
Why the fuck is this our paper?

464
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,156
Because we're aristocrats.

465
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,676
Have you looked at yourself?

466
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,400
"Sweet black face peering,
hope and wait..."

467
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,798
<i>Sometimes we'd go to Rome</i>
<i>to express our Ideas</i>

468
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,076
<i>at some Leftist conference.</i>

469
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,834
<i>The Roman division</i>
<i>had the strategic leadership.</i>

470
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,038
- Quartasponda.
- Accio, we've been here 2 hours.

471
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:15,718
We had to get the stuff,
eggs, paint, bags of shit,

472
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,790
to treat these assholes royally.

473
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,837
- The clowns!
- They're coming out!

474
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,870
Europe, Nation, Socialization!

475
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,117
They must be big shots!

476
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,878
Who are they?

477
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:55,430
Writers, journalists,
film people, a bunch of fags.

478
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,636
Let's treat them right.

479
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,313
Stop, we're far enough.

480
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,471
But where are our leaders?

481
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:16,436
When we do certain things,
the leaders don't come.

482
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,638
Have fun?
Let's get a cappuccino.

483
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,273
Violetta, it's Accio.

484
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,437
I'm in Rome,
I didn't come home last night.

485
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,751
We noticed.

486
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,639
<i>I'll be here another few days.</i>

487
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,593
I'm starting a civil war.

488
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,877
You're making civil war, I get it.

489
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:45,109
I'll have to talk to some big shot,
Michelini, Almirante.

490
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,274
Hello?

491
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,913
Bye!

492
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,717
You're talking to a guy
who set up the Social Republic.

493
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,714
I don't give a fuck what you did!

494
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,589
I want to see a real head,
someone in the executive.

495
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,796
Who's the real head?

496
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,350
Did you guys bring this moron?

497
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,353
He's been here a week,
wants to see someone.

498
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,309
- Simmer down.
- You sound like a Mobster.

499
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,471
Be respectful.

500
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,280
- Take him in there.
- Let's leave.

501
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,435
Anyway, you sounded like a Mobster.

502
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,633
Mobster!

503
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,313
Knock it off!

504
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,438
What's going on?

505
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,158
What the fuck you doin'?

506
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,588
Discussion's over, Benassi.

507
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,390
Wake up, we're almost there.

508
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,949
- Know your problem?
- I don't want to know.

509
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,994
I'll tell you anyway:
You gotta get laid!

510
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,112
You'd think it's easy.

511
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,595
I come home,
everyone's happy, kisses, hugs...

512
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:33,037
What's to be happy about?
Living in this rat-hole

513
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,033
Or you cracking people's heads?

514
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,475
This time they were cracking yours.

515
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,917
- The world's full of injustice.
- Sure!

516
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,790
In fact, I fight it.

517
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:49,028
With action, not with a lotta yap
like Manrico and Violetta.

518
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:54,118
- I have a favor to ask.
- To mind my own business?

519
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:58,069
A real favor,
beat up Peppe di Bari.

520
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:04,313
<i>What had he done to her?</i>
<i>Who knows, just so she did.</i>

521
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,119
Are you Peppe di Bari?

522
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,672
<i>A Fascist in the family</i>
<i>is always handy...</i>

523
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,959
<i>like a doctor!</i>

524
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,715
Don't go around saying
I beat you up as a Fascist,

525
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,791
I did it as a brother.

526
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,319
<i>Several months later,</i>
<i>in my sister's purse,</i>

527
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,437
<i>Mom found a mysterious object,</i>

528
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,638
<i>a kind of plunger</i>
<i>used against pregnancy.</i>

529
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,598
<i>A serious thing.</i>

530
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,874
"I love my boyfriend."

531
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,636
This is all we needed.

532
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,437
Look, he's my age.

533
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,718
Who'd guess Violetta...

534
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,030
I have to talk to this scum.

535
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:53,832
Just imagine if the masses
had access to culture.

536
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,673
Yes.

537
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:01,110
Do you think that by giving culture
to the lower classes

538
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,551
there would be more well-being?

539
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,477
Sure, but the social model
would have to change,

540
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,558
substituting Parliament with...

541
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,679
- the Assembly of Corporations.
- That's a Fascist concept.

542
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,276
Don't listen to him,
he's a black-shirt thug.

543
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,634
I asked a question
so I could understand.

544
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,074
Is that the professor?

545
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,032
Whole family's here?

546
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,919
How come Mom's not here too?

547
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,720
She's home crying, come with us.

548
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,554
- I'm not coming.
- You're coming home with me.

549
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,953
I'm going to Rome, think I'm going
to die in this shit hole?

550
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,918
Calm down!

551
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:45,637
- Have something to say?
- Step outside!

552
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:49,990
- Hands off!
- Your father will handle this.

553
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,151
I'm armed.

554
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,156
And here's my weapon.

555
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,759
- This.
- Fuckin' embarrassing.

556
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:09,398
Think of your parents,
they're decent people.

557
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,314
Put yourselves in his shoes!

558
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,992
Getting out here?

559
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,312
How does it open?

560
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,835
Your friends
are going to burn my car.

561
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,312
Who said?

562
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,671
The Celestini woman at the Union.

563
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,958
You doing stuff with her?

564
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,472
You do stuff only within your party?

565
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:46,871
I'm thinking about Francesca,
she still writes you.

566
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,636
Did you hear me?

567
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,996
You're thinking about Francesca?

568
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,878
Think about me!

569
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,269
Know who organized it?

570
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,830
Nastri, the tablecloth guy.

571
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:03,038
What? He'd have told me.

572
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,952
What would you have done?

573
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,556
Would you have told me or not?

574
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:14,029
- I'd have told you.
- Why?

575
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,237
What do you mean... you joking?

576
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,878
'Cause you're my brother.

577
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,716
And?

578
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,236
Who the fuck did you take after?

579
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,713
Glad they're doing it.

580
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,597
- Don't slam it!
- They're burning it anyway!

581
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,393
So it's true,
you're burning my brother's car.

582
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:03,030
It's a demonstrative action,
your brother's gone too far!

583
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,953
- He's a worker.
- He's no worker!

584
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,873
Workers work their asses off,
he's a fanatic.

585
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,872
He's still paying for it.

586
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:14,836
Who gets it, gets it,
that's democracy.

587
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,116
Since when do we give a fuck
about democracy?

588
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,510
Since when have you
become democratic?

589
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,998
You laying your hands
on the Youth Secretary?

590
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,595
Okay, but don't touch
Manrico's car.

591
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,716
Okay, but we burn the others.

592
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,832
Not the others either.

593
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,158
You deciding everything now?

594
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,919
Get outta here.

595
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,716
Good thing you're an old man,

596
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,520
I don't beat up old men.

597
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:19,272
<i>That night Mario</i>
<i>got stopped by the police,</i>

598
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:24,150
<i>they found stuff in the trunk</i>
<i>and arrested him.</i>

599
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,758
The police showed up
and he got arrested.

600
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,353
Miracle you didn't get caught.

601
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:45,350
What kind of man did I marry?

602
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,556
What's in his head?

603
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:54,669
You know I fell in love
out of compassion?

604
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:58,549
He said he'd had pleurisy
during the war.

605
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,636
The car was full of weapons.

606
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,591
Who knows how it'll end up.

607
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:12,519
I'll throw out all that stuff
he keeps in my mother's cellar.

608
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:16,629
The building might go sky-high
with the poor old thing inside.

609
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,758
What stuff?

610
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,558
Nothing.

611
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,038
Why are you so sweaty?

612
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,394
Come here, I'll give you a T-shirt.

613
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,678
No need, Bella.

614
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,836
Take your pants off too.

615
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,952
I grew up with men around, think
I'm shocked by a pair of underwear?

616
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:51,398
It's not that, they're dry.

617
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,798
Embarrassed to be in underwear
in front of a woman?

618
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,553
What embarrassed?

619
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,994
You look like my father, you know?

620
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,276
I'll show you a photo.

621
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,358
His forehead.

622
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,156
He loved me so much.

623
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,595
Lie on the bed and rest.

624
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,752
Why are you shivering?
Are you cold or afraid?

625
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,549
- I'm not shivering.
- I'll warm you.

626
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,519
Okay?

627
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,638
- Why are you laughing?
- Nothing, I'm happy.

628
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,594
Congratulations,
Mr High School Graduate.

629
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,912
This car?

630
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,910
- Want to drive it?
- Whose is it?

631
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,754
Yours, I bought it in installments.

632
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,838
Like it?

633
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:05,078
- Remember to double-clutch.
- Not with this model.

634
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:32,511
<i>Intuition told me</i>
<i>the things Bella taught me</i>

635
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:36,116

<i>even after the '60s.</i>

636
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:59,308
<i>In May of '68, the great</i>
<i>revolutionary wave had swept Paris.</i>

637
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:02,711
<i>By July, China,</i>
<i>in August, Czechoslovakia,</i>

638
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,791
<i>In Latina it never came.</i>

639
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,474
<i>I think I spent that year</i>
<i>in the kitchen</i>

640
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:10,439
<i>eating my mother's soup.</i>

641
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,636
<i>Then Violetta invited us to Rome</i>

642
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,838
<i>for her first concert</i>
<i>at the occupied Conservatory.</i>

643
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:19,231
We thank the comrades
at the Rome Conservatory.

644
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,116
- How are you?
- Fine.

645
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,752
Let's look at you.

646
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:29,353
- What do you think?
- You look a little worse.

647
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,875
I'm in great shape!
You've put on weight.

648
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,558
Tell the truth, a little...

649
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:40,079
Where is he?

650
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,316
They're all buddies of yours, huh?

651
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:46,550
This concert is art and solidarity.

652
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,873
Art by itself is masturbation,

653
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:53,990
solidarity by itself is charity.

654
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:58,032
Art, uprooted from the people,

655
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,040
is a huge two-fisted jerk-off.

656
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,112
The comrades will play Beethoven

657
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,878
to demonstrate that even he,
great as he is,

658
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,594
is immortal, but not unchangeable.

659
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:25,757
Comrade Montagna and I...

660
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:35,388
have de-fascistized
the text for Ode to Joy.

661
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:41,831
Allow me
a slightly sentimental aside.

662
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:48,160
A word about Comrade Benassi...

663
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:01,475
She's my sister and when,
as a kid, I'd hear her play, I'd cry.

664
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:09,919
Now, over to the great, deaf,
handicapped genius, Beethoven.

665
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:01,032
"Mao,

666
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:06,753
Mao Tse-Tung, Marx, Lenin, Stalin,

667
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,395
are marching proudly

668
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:14,632
towards the dawning sun.

669
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:18,237
Rise, Oh dawning sun...

670
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:49,996
Forward all peoples, to the revolt,

671
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,916
Oh red flag, Oh red flag..."

672
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,878
- Don't touch the immortal.
- Fucking clowns!

673
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,714
Leave Beethoven alone,
or we'll bust your ass.

674
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,712
Duce!

675
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,316
What the fuck are you doing?

676
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,033
What the fuck do you want?

677
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,236
What the fuck are you doing?

678
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:53,198
When did you ever
give a shit about Beethoven?

679
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:02,715
When the fuck did you ever care?

680
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,515
This won't ever happen again, right?

681
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:41,519
What?

682
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,553
This.

683
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:52,078
Swear to me.

684
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,876
No, I won't.

685
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:57,758
Why not?

686
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:00,432
Don't bullshit me.

687
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:03,240
I'm not the one bullshitting you.

688
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,758
It's true I've put on weight,
know why?

689
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:16,072
I'm pregnant.

690
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:29,638
Did you hear me? I'm pregnant!

691
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,594
- How far along?
- Three months.

692
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:41,308
Then a guy gets pissed off...
Three months!

693
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:44,677
- We write, you could have...
- I found out yesterday.

694
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:50,798
- And Manrico?
- I told him yesterday.

695
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:52,798
He doesn't want it.

696
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:00,832
I'm keeping it anyway.

697
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:08,798
What are you doing?

698
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,876
Put your shoes back on.

699
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:16,551
Put them on, you're pregnant,
you'll catch something.

700
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,958
The flu...

701
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,031
Why don't you take yours off too?

702
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:26,069
Thankfully, I have sound principles
that my mother taught me,

703
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:29,312
like wear an undershirt
or I might get the flu.

704
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,392
Do I have to get sick too?

705
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:39,393
Great!

706
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:45,074
I fight in the revolution
and you guys tan.

707
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,438
What?

708
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:55,036
Why are you looking at me like that?

709
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,276
I'm so happy.

710
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,594
I always knew you weren't a Fascist,

711
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:15,796
you were the only one who didn't.

712
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:19,836
I did what I did for the music.

713
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,113
Anyway...

714
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:27,355
But, if I had to sit and look at that
moron with the cue cards...

715
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,198
I know.

716
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:35,154
Those are the contradictions
within the people.

717
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:39,996
You love the people, even though
you know there are tons of jerks.

718
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:49,079
We have to celebrate
you're not a Fascist any more.

719
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:53,559
I have to make a bone pile?

720
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:56,758
- Make what?
- A bone pile.

721
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,958
Then you have to remember
how the bones were laid out.

722
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,710
No rough-housing with her.

723
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:24,510
We have to protect the future.

724
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:37,034
You don't know
how you've made me cry.

725
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:41,154
We used to see each other everyday,

726
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:43,516
then suddenly you disappear.

727
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,194
Bella...

728
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:57,271
I've changed.

729
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:00,758
I know you left the Fascists,
but I don't care about politics.

730
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,956
It's not just that.

731
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,236
You too, what did you expect?

732
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:10,672
You're married...

733
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:15,310
I'm in love with someone else.

734
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,592
Where are you going?

735
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:26,798
What's the matter?

736
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:36,036
You've started smoking?

737
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:39,516
One, after dinner.

738
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,476
Right, and you just had dinner?

739
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,916
How's Mario?

740
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,956
He's out of jail,

741
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:01,796
and I told him everything.

742
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,758
About us?

743
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:10,117
How did he take it?

744
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:15,118
He says if he sees you,
he'll kill you.

745
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:23,039
That girl you love,
does she love you?

746
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:28,316
Does she love me...

747
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:36,150
Accio, Bella called.

748
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:41,428
Nastri's wife called again.

749
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:45,836
She said she saw you in town
and you didn't say hello.

750
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:48,033
What's she want from you?

751
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:59,791
What are you looking at?

752
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:05,630
- In order.
- What's in order?

753
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:08,678
- Benassi, everything's in order.
- Wait a minute!

754
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:11,832
You put it there, it gets buried
and that's the end of it.

755
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:15,436
- Teaching me my job?
- We've been waiting for ages.

756
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:19,470
Know what 'ages' means?

757
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:22,508
Here's my husband's pay slip,

758
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:26,350
it's in small print, but it says

759
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:29,280
that every month they take out money

760
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:32,671
because the government's
building houses with it.

761
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:37,159
For 25 years the money's been
taken out, but where are the houses?

762
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:42,398
The keys to our homes are there.

763
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:48,629
- Where's the key for Benassi?
- There's been no assigning.

764
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,279
Why not?

765
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:53,717
- Takes time to decide.
- We're dying inside there.

766
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:58,796
The only time I voted,
I voted for the houses party.

767
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,470
Tell him, help me.

768
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,713
Taking it out on me?
You could have called Manrico.

769
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:08,235
Calm down! Quiet!

770
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,474
I've decided, I want a party card.

771
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,591
We don't issue membership cards.

772
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:21,153
- Why not?
- This isn't a party.

773
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:23,949
- What is it?
- A movement.

774
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:29,112
Then write:
"Benassi in the movement..."

775
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:32,033
No need, you told me, that's enough.

776
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:34,316
- Can I sit here?
- Right over there.

777
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:37,120
I'll do some reading.

778
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,192
Is here okay?

779
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,312
Almost done.

780
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,919
I've studied, read tons of books.

781
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:54,156
I know, you did good.

782
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:59,719
I like this idea where no one
tells you to do things,

783
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:02,076
decisions are made together.

784
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:05,599
This is the biggest difference
in fact,

785
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:09,196
we're all equals here,
a guy stands up, has his say,

786
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:11,192
if his idea's good...

787
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:14,193
- Everybody's the same!
- Sure!

788
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:39,952
Democratically, raise your hands,
all in favor of an action?

789
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,233
I'm in favor.

790
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:44,835
- In favor?
- In favor.

791
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,916
"The struggle is tough
and we can't get enough!"

792
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:12,953
- I'll do it.
- Know how many I've done?

793
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:15,675
- Show me?
- Trust me!

794
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,876
Who gave you that?

795
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:20,076
Have it explode in your hand!

796
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:22,834
- His friends gave it to him.
- Ex-friends.

797
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,115
Then each his own way.

798
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:32,596
How'll you light it?

799
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,593
The matches...

800
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,320
Comrades, let's have a game.

801
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,279
- Get moving.
- Not a soul around.

802
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,956
Cover your ears.

803
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:58,276
Where are you?

804
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:24,235
- How's it goin'?
- Fine, you?

805
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:27,553
Don't run off,
I got things to say.

806
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:30,075
- I got nothing to tell you.
- But I do!

807
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,754
I'm still paying for your car.

808
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:42,198
This is for what I taught you.

809
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:46,156
This, is for fucking my wife.

810
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,198
And this...

811
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,269
is for my treating you like a son.

812
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:54,988
In fact, you are a son,
a son of a whore.

813
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:43,676
Quit joking.

814
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,356
Don't be an asshole.

815
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:53,996
I didn't even touch you.

816
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:06,716
God dammit, Mario!

817
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:27,038
<i>It was the worst night of my life,</i>

818
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:30,950
<i>I ran so far I reached the beach.</i>

819
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:50,516
I knew you were here.

820
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:58,832
Did you hear?

821
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,916
I didn't kill him.

822
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,674
He was out of his mind, we fought.

823
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:26,315
More like, he beat me.

824
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:34,236
Then he just...

825
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:38,438
Don't know how...

826
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:51,632
Poor Mario.

827
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:02,278
Come on!

828
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:05,116
Don't let it get you.

829
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:15,156
You're shaking!

830
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:20,157
Why are you shaking?

831
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:24,389
<i>Manrico's head was somewhere else.</i>

832
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:27,198
What's up?

833
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:47,313
Sir?

834
01:15:56,360 --> 01:16:00,319
They shot Marotti,
the head of the factory.

835
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:03,916
What the fuck are you saying?

836
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:07,158
- Did they kill him?
- No.

837
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:12,117
Shot in the legs,
his briefcase was full of money.

838
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:22,758
I have to get out of here.

839
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:30,954
You too, why hang around?

840
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:34,954
Waiting for them to come for you?

841
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:41,274
Where do I go? I don't know a soul.

842
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:44,955
To friends of mine, I'll send you.

843
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,954
I'll give you some money
from petty cash.

844
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:55,316
What petty cash?

845
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:59,396
What are you into?

846
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,958
Are you guys involved
in this thing at the factory?

847
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:09,076
You shot him?

848
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,032
What are you saying?

849
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:15,839
What are you saying!

850
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:20,073
You can stay as long as you want,
you're safe here.

851
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:25,078
Fabio,
Manrico's brother is here.

852
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:29,438
Come in.

853
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:56,594
<i>My exile in Piedmont</i>
<i>lasted almost a year.</i>

854
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:10,279
<i>I'd taken myself too seriously</i>
<i>as a fugitive too,</i>

855
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:13,637
<i>Nastri had had a heart attack, the</i>
<i>Prosecutor had dismissed the case,</i>

856
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:15,916
<i>no one was looking for me,</i>

857
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:18,754
<i>but Manrico</i>
<i>had forgotten to tell me.</i>

858
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,195
<i>Then he remembered</i>
<i>and sent somebody.</i>

859
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:23,798
Uncle Accio.

860
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,596
Not "Accio uncle".

861
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:31,038
Daddy's brother, looks like me too.

862
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:33,316
Doesn't he look like me?

863
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,796
We broke up a few months ago

864
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:41,676
and then got back together again.

865
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:47,553
I'd like to tell him
to stay away, but I can't.

866
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:49,518
I see him and it starts over.

867
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:54,510
What's Manrico doing now? Is he
in some radical political group?

868
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:56,398
I don't know...

869
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:01,469
- He was reported for robbery.
- Making a career!

870
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:05,280
I'm cut off from my parents,
they hate me,

871
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:10,956
they hate Amedeo, can't stand
the idea he's the son of a worker.

872
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,756
You can stay with me a while,
if you want.

873
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:23,039
In Turin?

874
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:27,192
The last place I should be staying
is with you.

875
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,956
His father's never there...

876
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,953
- Who gives a shit!
- What's the matter?

877
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:38,797
Take me to the station,
I'm already fed up with you.

878
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:43,559
I told him you'd take him
on the merry-go-round.

879
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:46,076
You told him what?

880
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,633
Come on!

881
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:52,793
For the merry-go-round
he's got Mommy and Daddy,

882
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,919
Uncle Accio has his own life,

883
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:58,116
even though it's shit.

884
01:19:58,360 --> 01:19:59,395
You'll scare him.

885
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:02,116
Let me out.

886
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:30,759
<i>They say we get better with age,</i>
<i>I was just plain aging.</i>

887
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:40,239
<i>Manrico had been in the north</i>
<i>2 years, organizing the revolution.</i>

888
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:43,393
<i>Then one day...</i>

889
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:48,871
<i>It's Manrico.</i>

890
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:54,110
How are you? It's been ages!

891
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:58,836
<i>On my wardrobe</i>
<i>there's a bag with money.</i>

892
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:03,396
<i>Take what you need to get to Turin</i>
<i>and bring it to me.</i>

893
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,433
Who's this?

894
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:37,468
Accio, don't you recognize me?
I'm here.

895
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,797
- Where?
- In Turin!

896
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:43,191
- Didn't Manrico tell you anything?
- Haven't seen him for two years.

897
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:45,596
You two fighting again?

898
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:06,069
Me again, he hasn't seen
the kid in two years?

899
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,713
- Leave it alone!
- <i>When I see him, I'll talk to him.</i>

900
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:12,151
He had me come here to Bar del Peso.

901
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:18,752
These two are really in love.

902
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:27,678
The bag?

903
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:38,118
I took money for the train,

904
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:41,036
a sandwich and coffee.

905
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:44,992
How are Mom and Pop?

906
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:56,278
What?

907
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:03,629
I need this money to buy a house

908
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:06,829
for me, Francesca and the baby.

909
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:11,712
All together?

910
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:16,398
What's so funny? I'm not joking.

911
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:24,990
Why tell me all this?
Do what you want with it.

912
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:27,636
Make this revolution, finally.

913
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:31,795
But do you really think
the working class will follow you?

914
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:33,871
Guys like Pop are the working class.

915
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:37,110
Can you see Pop with a gun?

916
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:41,391
It's your business.

917
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:45,509
In fact, you're right,
we should make a joke of life,

918
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:48,149
I'm always so serious...

919
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:52,757
- What the hell are you sayin'?
- What the hell do I know?

920
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:59,793
All the beatings I gave you
weren't enough?

921
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:06,076
I'd give you one right here.

922
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:11,548
You jerk, don't you dare.

923
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,672
Be respectful.

924
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:16,876
Lowerthose hands!

925
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:21,036
You're a bastard.

926
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:28,198
Damned bastard!

927
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:31,116
I missed you.

928
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:37,596
- What?
- It's Francesca.

929
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,558
Where is she?

930
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:43,755
- Did you call her?
- I told her we were here.

931
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:46,879
What is it?

932
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:57,756
Gotta go.

933
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:05,316
Freeze, police!

934
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:51,270
<i>Francesca was arrested</i>
<i>as a suspected accomplice,</i>

935
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:54,678
<i>I was released a few days later.</i>

936
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:21,756
We're here.

937
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:24,558
Are you okay?

938
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:29,271
Look, Grandma and Grandpa's house
is all broken.

939
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:03,879
I was scared
you'd been killed with Manrico.

940
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:16,958
Come on!

941
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,956
Here we are with Grandma.

942
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:41,628
We'll go to the kitchen

943
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:44,155
to see if there's
a cookie for Amedeo.

944
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:48,909
He's like his father.

945
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:52,352
Let's hope not.

946
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:54,397
And like you too.

947
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:56,631
Even worse.

948
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:03,111
What a bastard!

949
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:14,518
Violetta...

950
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:18,119
Come on!

951
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:20,873
That's enough.

952
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:34,596
Is this Mrs Biancopane?

953
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:39,917
Sorry for the hour, I'm calling
from the Home Assignment Office.

954
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:41,798
You've been waiting...

955
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:45,510
Sorry for the hour, the homes are
ready and we're going to take them.

956
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:47,988
They're ready.

957
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:51,551
Mr Perotti, there are papers here
for us who've been waiting...

958
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:54,917
There are surnames,
they were assigned months ago.

959
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:57,316
What, you dreamed it?

960
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:00,798
See? But now though...

961
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:05,555
Wake up the kids,
grandparents, everybody,

962
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:08,519
we all have to go together
and occupy the homes.

963
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:11,752
We have the keys, but if we all
go in, they won't kick us out.

964
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:14,714
Violetta, how's Mom?

965
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:20,318
Wake her up and put her on the phone,
I have good news.

966
01:31:38,440 --> 01:31:40,954
Relax, there's a place for everyone.

967
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:44,716
This is our home!

968
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:25,874
I never had a balcony.

969
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:30,916
I'd put the flowers in the tub.

970
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:40,629
If Manrico were here,
he'd be bringing you roses.

971
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:44,232
