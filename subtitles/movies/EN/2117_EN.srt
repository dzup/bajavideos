1
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:16,137
THE DIE IS CAST

2
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:14,189
Wait!
Wait, no!

3
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,364
Give yourself another chance.

4
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:25,739
No, my Life's a wreck. I want
to put an end to this.

5
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,575
Don't think Like that. Lt
could all change by tomorrow.

6
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:29,682
- Wait!
- No.

7
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:33,013
I’m a jinx. Lt's a karma L
can't put up with any more.

8
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:35,714
Wait, no!

9
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:42,823
You're meant to be alive.
Or it would have gone off.

10
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:46,630
Lt didn't go off
because I’m a jinx.

11
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:49,132
Lt didn't go off
because you're Lucky.

12
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,968
Life always gives you a chance.
That's why you're alive.

13
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:57,167
I’m a jinx. That's why the shot
didn't even fire.

14
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:07,848
Lt's a sign!
Lt's a sign, don't you see?

15
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,215
You have to stay alive,
it's a chance.

16
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,154
You have nothing to Lose.

17
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:16,794
Maybe everything will
change tomorrow.

18
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:22,399
I’m an actor. Today is an
important day for me.

19
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,000
I was going to do
something important...

20
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:27,004
but if I can't help you,
it won't mean a thing.

21
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,636
I just need 10 minutes.

22
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,409
10 minutes, have a
coffee with me.

23
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,843
There's a Little bar near here.

24
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:38,182
Come on, put the gun down.

25
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,016
Put the gun down.
Please.

26
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:49,522
That's it.
I'll stay here. You come over here.

27
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:53,594
One step at a time.
Come on.

28
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:57,661
You've got your Life ahead of you.

29
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:01,299
There's a step that
only you can take.

30
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:35,231
He was bound to die, anyway.
What guilt? Stop messing around.

31
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:40,005
You don't understand. Don't
Laugh. I almost had him.

32
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:43,115
He'd changed his mind, I’d given
him reasons to stay alive.

33
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:46,446
Not enough for him to
notice the truck, Felipe.

34
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:47,746
Stop messing around!

35
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:51,050
Me standing there saying,
"You've got your Life ahead of you"

36
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,316
"Come on, step forward. "

37
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,484
And so he did. He's
probably thanking you by now.

38
00:04:55,962 --> 00:05:00,399
The Last thing that guy saw
was my stupid face.

39
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,897
Come on, Let's go.
Please.

40
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:06,037
Give me your hand.

41
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:09,474
Lt is moist.

42
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,773
Lt knows not yet age nor sorrow.

43
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:16,404
Warm.
Warm and moist.

44
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:18,779
An excellent hand.
An honest hand.

45
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:20,583
Really?

46
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:23,981
You may say it,
for I gave my heart with this hand.

47
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:25,886
Lt is a Liberal hand.

48
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:30,418
In other times, hands gave
away hearts.

49
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,588
Today in the modern age
thou ask not for hearts;...

50
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,427
hands are enough.

51
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,758
I don't understand.

52
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:41,903
- Come. Fulfill thy promise.
- Which promise?

53
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:44,903
- To speak with Cassio.
- Cassio.

54
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,708
A heavy catarrh
means a storm is brewing.

55
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,943
- Give me your handkerchief.
- Here it is.

56
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:55,850
Give me the one I gave you.

57
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,918
- I haven't got it.
- You have Lost it!

58
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:01,390
Answer me!
You haven't got it!

59
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:06,258
My faithful friend Lago
obtained it from Cassio.

60
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,937
Take that away, asshole!
You fucking prick!

61
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:16,405
- What's your problem?
- What's your problem?!

62
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:19,670
What are you doing with
that handkerchief on stage?

63
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,677
Don't you know that colour
is jinxed in the theatre?

64
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:24,544
- Lt's a disgrace, Carlos!
- What does the text say?

65
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,447
Lt clearly says a mottled,
strawberry handkerchief.

66
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:30,181
- What did you give him?
- A mottled, strawberry one.

67
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,655
We gave you a strawberry
handkerchief. What's that?

68
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,920
- You gave me this one.
- Take that away!

69
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:40,021
Why would we give you that
if it's a banned colour?

70
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,030
Everyone knows that.

71
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,761
Have you seen any "amarelo"
anywhere in the theatre.

72
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,302
- I didn't know.
- You didn't know?

73
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:48,407
I knew, but I didn't think
you thought it was a big deal.

74
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,101
Not a big deal?
Are you stupid?

75
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,735
- A Little respect, please.
- Calm down, Maribel.

76
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,474
Don't start with me!
Lt's not my fault.

77
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:59,642
Don't you see what's going on here?
Can you feel the energy?

78
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:02,778
I feel bad! I feel bad!
I can't breathe in here!

79
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:08,727
That colour is a disaster.
I don't want any part of it.

80
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:11,455
- On or off stage! Get it?!
- Yes.

81
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,030
I don't understand why you
didn't get a black guy...

82
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,396
instead of this idiot all
painted black, getting me dirty.

83
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,969
Saying "A warm hand", "a moist
hand", and dirtying everything.

84
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,005
- Please just...
- No, Listen here.

85
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:25,270
I won't go on! Not until Ursula
comes, cleans up this mess...

86
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:29,871
and say, "it's all right"!
No Carlos! I won't go on!

87
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,313
- I’m Leaving!
- Maribel.

88
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,443
- I can't!
- Lt's the police.

89
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:36,920
Lt's the police.

90
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,651
For me?

91
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:42,717
Hello?
Yes, that's me.

92
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,364
What is it dear?

93
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,865
What is it?

94
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,964
My brother's been run over
by a truck!

95
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,610
Jinx!

96
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:06,249
You and your fucking handkerchief!
Jinx!

97
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,489
<i>Jinx!</i>

98
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:55,192
- These actors...
- Hello.

99
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:22,085
Excuse me.

100
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:48,812
<i>Early this morning, here,
Pedro Lazábal was run over.</i>

101
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,583
<i>He was the brother of
the actress, Maribel Lazábal.</i>

102
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:57,856
<i>The driver said he couldn't stop in
time, as the man appeared suddenly</i>

103
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:01,091
<i>on the road giving onto the
Costanera Sur.</i>

104
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:06,603
<i>The driver is with us...</i>

105
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:15,011
<i>This is Marcos, the assistant
director from the theatre.</i>

106
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:20,084
<i>We've put things back
a few days because of Maribel...</i>

107
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:23,154
<i>and the director has decided
to replace you.</i>

108
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,018
<i>Look, I don't believe
in these things...</i>

109
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:29,025
<i>we all think
it was a coincidence...</i>

110
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:33,427
and all this jinx business
is very unfair.

111
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:37,897
Your pay for the rehearsals
will be in the bank tomorrow.

112
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,637
<i>The crew all send their best.</i>

113
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,133
Bye.

114
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:22,138
You fucker.

115
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,992
Four no-shows, and seven Late
arrivals in the Last six weeks.

116
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:21,004
Lt's not my fault the
car alarm keeps you awake.

117
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:24,433
A chief administrator can't
set the example you do.

118
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,102
You Leave me no choice.

119
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,476
You’ll get your wages and
your redundancy payment.

120
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:33,346
Well, part of it. We’ll pay
you the rest of it...

121
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:36,819
in merchandise.
That's the way things are.

122
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,353
The Lads from the warehouse
will bring it over to your house.

123
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,425
Good Luck.

124
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,137
- That's it.
- What about the boxes?

125
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,174
They said "no boxes".

126
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:24,665
- Hello.
- Hello.

127
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,669
- Sorry I’m Late.
- No, it's all right.

128
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,433
I’ve only been here an hour
and 10 minutes.

129
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:32,510
- I said I’m sorry, period.
- Don't get offended.

130
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,909
I forgive you, period.

131
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:38,846
- See what you're Like?
- What I’m Like?

132
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,919
I wait an hour and 10 minutes,
I don't ask why you're Late...

133
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:44,420
I have to forgive you, and
"period" as you say...

134
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,491
- and you even get offended.
- I’m not here to fight.

135
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:51,756
- We've already fought enough.
- Fine, I’m sorry, you're right.

136
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:58,632
I wanted to say that I want
to do whatever it takes...

137
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:03,207
to make things better,
to make this work.

138
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:08,840
- Guillermo?
- Yes.

139
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,642
I’m seeing someone else.

140
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,449
What do you mean?
Who?

141
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,616
- Someone, period.
- Period, my ass!

142
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:23,091
- Who are you seeing?
- You don't know him.

143
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:26,323
Thanks for seeing someone
I don't know! Thank-you!

144
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,524
Who is he?
What's his name?

145
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,736
<i>- Alfonzo.
- Alfonso?</i>

146
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,000
- Alfonzo. Ls he a Bourbon?
- Cut it out.

147
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,772
Who is Alfonzo?

148
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,577
- He's my boss. - You're cheating
on me with your boss?

149
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,878
I’m not cheating on you.
I want to be happy...

150
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:50,614
- and I’m not with you, period.
- Sorry then.

151
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:52,280
You and Alfonzo,
and the Royal Family.

152
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:54,949
- Don't be childish.
- I’m not childish.

153
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,896
How Long have you been
fucking me over?

154
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:02,598
I’ve been with him for two
weeks, since we split.

155
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:06,662
I came to say that it's over.

156
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:12,108
Whatever happens, I don't want us
back together, period.

157
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,110
I have to go now.

158
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,280
Take care.

159
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:54,143
<i>In the extermination camps
large warehouses were filled...</i>

160
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:59,155
<i>with huge piles of
the prisoners' shoes...</i>

161
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:21,871
Months?

162
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:27,179
Weeks.

163
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:29,505
Hello.

164
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:34,313
Dad, sorry I haven't been
to see you, I had a tough week.

165
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,650
What's up, Dad?

166
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:07,016
<i>Felipe. This is your old man.</i>

167
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:13,253
<i>I talked to Guille and I have to
see you both together.</i>

168
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:20,889
<i>Guillermo's coming at 10 o'clock.
I'd like you to be there.</i>

169
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,927
<i>It's important.
Please do come.</i>

170
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,718
Hello.

171
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:58,031
Thanks for coming, son.

172
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,467
Please, sit down.

173
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:19,386
- Felipe, I know that you and L...
- It's alright...

174
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:25,724
Let me say something.
I made a Lot of mistakes...

175
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:29,332
and you were very small
when I became a widower.

176
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:35,566
I thought putting you in
boarding school in Buenos Aires...

177
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:38,705
- closer to your grandmother...
- Lt's all right Dad...

178
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,903
I know the story of my Life.

179
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:47,849
But I wanted to admit that
I made a terrible mistake.

180
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:55,290
In front of your...
I don't Like to say, half-brother.

181
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:59,194
In front of your brother.

182
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:05,095
I haven't Long Left.

183
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:09,971
- What have you got?
- An orange in my head...

184
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:13,566
that's growing fast.

185
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:18,307
I'd Like to talk to the doctor,
see what he has to say.

186
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,645
There's nothing he can do.

187
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:27,124
I asked you to come because
I wanted to tell you a story...

188
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,750
that I’ve never told anyone.

189
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:38,225
In the forties, I was a kid. And
one night, with some friends...

190
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:43,265
<i>we went to the theater
for the first time.</i>

191
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,910
<i>I was a kid of the times...</i>

192
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:52,414
<i>I had nothing to do with
the world of show-business.</i>

193
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:58,646
<i>That night, I was dazzled
by a girl called...</i>

194
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,017
<i>Lina Delponte.</i>

195
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:06,330
<i>I had never seen
something like that.</i>

196
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:09,599
<i>Lina Delponte.</i>

197
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,401
<i>Beautiful.</i>

198
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:46,028
<i>On my way out of the theatre,
I saw a sign that said...</i>

199
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:52,540
<i>"Help wanted for
administrative duties. "</i>

200
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:56,274
<i>So the next day I applied...</i>

201
00:21:56,915 --> 00:22:00,316
<i>and I was lucky,
and they gave me the job.</i>

202
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:06,850
<i>I watched her night after night.
Couldn't get her off my mind.</i>

203
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:09,659
<i>I was crazy about her.
I dreamed about her.</i>

204
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:14,826
Two months Later I got
a job as an accountant...

205
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:16,957
in a company in Rio Gallegos.

206
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:22,363
So I Left my job in the theatre,
for a better future...

207
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,441
or so I thought.

208
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:28,575
Because that night,
something happened...

209
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:33,276
that could have changed
my destiny.

210
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:38,851
Lt was my Last night in the
theatre and in Buenos Aires.

211
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:44,259
<i>Suddenly, the door opened...</i>

212
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,233
<i>and she appeared.</i>

213
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:52,065
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

214
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:55,772
<i>Lina Delponte!</i>

215
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:00,705
<i>Without a word...</i>

216
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:04,846
<i>she sat on my lap...</i>

217
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,515
<i>and stated to kiss me in a way...</i>

218
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:22,095
She took out a Little jar,
with some white powder inside.

219
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:26,469
<i>And all of a sudden she says:
"D'you wanna try?"</i>

220
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:31,607
<i>I didn't know what to say,
and asked: What's it Like?</i>

221
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,141
"What's it Like?", she said.

222
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:41,715
You’ll see 25 watt Lamps, as if
they were 60 watt Lamps!

223
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:56,230
I can't put it into words.

224
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:01,970
That night...

225
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:05,508
Life opened up a whole new road
for me, that I didn't take.

226
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:10,444
Because when I told her that
I was Leaving the next day...

227
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:17,819
she said, "What a shame.
"Cause if you stayed...

228
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:21,289
we could be together.

229
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:23,656
But if you go, it will
be impossible. "

230
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:33,532
<i>How would my life have been
with Lina Delponte?</i>

231
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:44,544
Boys. I’d Like to stay awake
the few nights I have Left...

232
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:48,619
so I can go through
my entire repertoire...

233
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:50,448
before I get on the train.

234
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:56,391
Can you get me some cocaine?

235
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,463
Ls it a Lot to ask?

236
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:06,101
He's mad, man. Cocaine.
I can't believe it.

237
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:08,866
I agree, it's madness.
But we have to do it.

238
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:12,005
Then you both have
an orange in your head.

239
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:15,010
I’m an actor, man. That's
all I want in Life.

240
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:17,512
I’d Like to be known for
the forty plays I’ve done...

241
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:20,914
not for going to jail
as a dealer for geriatrics.

242
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:23,919
That's what he asked us for.
He was clear about it.

243
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:26,449
What are you going to do
when they call you tomorrow...

244
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:29,082
<i>and tell you: "Your father's
on the roof saying...</i>

245
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:31,092
he's Spiderman,
and doesn't want to come down. "

246
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:35,290
- That's not it.
- Then what is it?

247
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:39,999
He must be scared to even close
his eyes. Don't you see?

248
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:43,800
Lt's a memory he has
from those days.

249
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:47,444
How do you know what goes
through a person's mind...

250
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:50,241
when they tell him he has
weeks to Live?

251
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,543
He isn't reacting to that.
He has an orange in his head...

252
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:54,379
- that won't Let him think.
- He's still Lucid.

253
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:58,353
And Doctor Sosa said so too.
And I know him well.

254
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,583
I know you do.
Do what you think is best.

255
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:05,924
No. You were there
and you heard him.

256
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,721
Don't you come preaching to me.

257
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:11,825
He's your father and he's
dying. That's how it is.

258
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:16,201
<i>And for the record, I have
to tell you something:</i>

259
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:20,107
Lf you're so resentful
you’ll miss your Last chance.

260
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:23,737
- Chance for what?
- To tie up Loose ends with him.

261
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:27,010
- By buying him coke.
- By doing whatever he wants.

262
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:30,521
I don't care if it's coke,
mustard, or whatever.

263
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:33,257
Lt's what he asked for,
so I'll get it for him.

264
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:36,417
But I need your help.
You must know someone.

265
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:43,628
Lt's been such a Long time.
Just right now.

266
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,709
I'll make a phone call.
I can't promise anything.

267
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:55,441
- Call me tomorrow.
- Thanks, Feli.

268
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,182
- What about you?
- Me what?

269
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,749
How are you doing?

270
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,855
Your Life. Your career...

271
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:12,592
Great.
And you?

272
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,189
Great too.

273
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:29,207
What the fuck...?

274
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:32,380
I just picked it up from the
mechanic... fuck!

275
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:37,345
What did those guys do?

276
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:44,325
You’ll have to take
another one, buddy.

277
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:53,460
What do you think?
I’m delighted!

278
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:54,629
- How are you?
- Felipe!

279
00:27:54,773 --> 00:28:00,336
- How are you?
- Fine. Well, Like shit.

280
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:04,881
Buddy, don't Let all this
mess with your head.

281
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:08,474
I know you. Lt's stupid.
You're a talented guy.

282
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,646
And there's no way I think
you're a jinx, buddy.

283
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:15,920
And I won't Let any asshole
talk about you badly.

284
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:17,585
I’d just put them straight.
Right away.

285
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:19,128
They talk about me?

286
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:24,895
I came here to ask you
a couple of things.

287
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:28,699
One is the phone number of
that fortune teller...

288
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,866
Alda. She’ll help you, sure.
Great, buddy.

289
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,011
And the other thing...

290
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:37,043
and that's why I wanted to
see you in person...

291
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:42,478
I need to buy cocaine,
just a couple of grams...

292
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:47,722
- Lt's for my brother.
- I didn't know you had one.

293
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,019
He's a half-brother...

294
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:54,331
Lt's part of something
I have to do.

295
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,531
I'll get whatever you want,
but I don't think...

296
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:01,070
- Lt's not that...
- Lt won't help you...

297
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:04,539
I don't want it to help me.
I’m totally fine...

298
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:06,143
You just told me you
were Like shit.

299
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:09,940
They're two different things.
I feel Like shit, it's true...

300
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,208
but the cocaine's not for
my brother...

301
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:16,209
Lt's actually for my old man,
he's in an old folks' home.

302
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:22,119
Don't make it harder for me.

303
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:24,185
Lf you don't believe it's for
my brother...

304
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:26,797
I won't believe,
that you don't think I’m a jinx.

305
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:30,732
- I want to think it isn't that way,
is it? - No. Lt isn't.

306
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:33,460
I don't think you're a jinx.

307
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:36,267
Actually, you brought me Luck.

308
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:39,134
- How come?
- Your part.

309
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:42,236
They gave it to me.

310
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:59,294
There's nothing here about
the bad Luck you say you have.

311
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:05,427
You aren't predestined.
Lt's strange.

312
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:09,597
Lt's as if someone else’s bad
Luck was stuck to you.

313
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:14,269
- That could be it.
- What? Do you know who it is?

314
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:18,246
- Yes. Lt was a coincidence.
- There are no coincidences.

315
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:22,945
Bring him along and I'll put
an end to this in no time.

316
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:24,714
I can't. He's dead.

317
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:32,458
- Can you help me anyway?
- We’ll give it a try.

318
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:39,266
<i>First go where I tell you
and buy: a kilo of salt...</i>

319
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:46,241
<i>a rosary, preferably white,
one quartz stone...</i>

320
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,812
<i>two candles,
one white, one red...</i>

321
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:53,543
<i>two liters of full-fat milk,
bay leaves...</i>

322
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:59,920
<i>and a rue plant,
in a clay pot.</i>

323
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:05,362
<i>Draw a circle with the salt
about meters in diameter...</i>

324
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:07,324
<i>and take your clothes off.</i>

325
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:11,066
<i>You can
stay in your underwear.</i>

326
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:16,131
<i>Put seven bay leaves
around the salt circle...</i>

327
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:21,712
<i>but without breaking it.
Light the candles...</i>

328
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:28,243
<i>and put the plant inside the
circle, with a piece of paper...</i>

329
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:32,049
<i>where you write, "I, Felipe Nugal,
ask my superior beings...</i>

330
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:35,717
<i>to end this bad luck that
doesn't belong to me. "</i>

331
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,851
<i>Bury the paper
in the plant pot...</i>

332
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:40,521
<i>put the rosary around the pot...</i>

333
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:43,930
<i>and pray with your eyes closed.
Are you catholic?</i>

334
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,968
<i>When I was a kid.
Not so much these days.</i>

335
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:50,473
<i>OK. Then take a teaspoon
of mistletoe oil.</i>

336
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:53,306
<i>Mind you; it tastes awful.</i>

337
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:58,276
<i>Then, pour the milk all over
yourself inside the circle.</i>

338
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:06,250
<i>Wait for it to dry and
shower with white soap...</i>

339
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:08,291
<i>the kind for washing clothes.</i>

340
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:15,188
<i>It's important that you concentrate
on the water cleansing you.</i>

341
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:18,793
<i>Then put the quartz stone on
to keep draining off the energy...</i>

342
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:23,340
<i>throughout the night. Get
into bed and go to sleep.</i>

343
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:25,771
<i>And everything will be great.</i>

344
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:43,326
- Hello.
- Hi, I’m here for the audition.

345
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:48,658
<i>- Hello.
- Lamadrid...</i>

346
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:40,781
- What's your problem?
- What?

347
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:43,216
- What's your problem?
- Nothing.

348
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,083
Do you think I didn't see you
whispering to these two...

349
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:46,850
touching your balls,
touching your tit...

350
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:49,016
do you think I’m an idiot?!

351
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,890
I’ve already ruined your day.
The power has begun.

352
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,430
Maybe if I touch you
you’ll blow up.

353
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:56,260
See me touching you?

354
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,066
Why are you so scared?

355
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,466
You don't need me to
have bad Luck.

356
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:01,503
Have you Looked in the mirror?

357
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:03,607
Beside you, Bob Sponge would Look
Like Miss Venezuela.

358
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:06,175
- Stop it, man!
- You stop me!

359
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:07,876
What right do you have
to do this to me?

360
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:09,980
To make a big deal out of
something you heard...

361
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:13,208
that was a coincidence.
You're an asshole.

362
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:15,376
I’m not a jinx. Get
that into your head.

363
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:17,780
Excuse me. The director
has taken ill...

364
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:19,321
and can't go on with the auditions.

365
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:22,585
We’ll call you when we're
ready to go on. Thank you.

366
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:17,238
<i>I'm Clara, leave your message.</i>

367
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:23,817
Hello Clara, this is Guillermo.
I just wanted to say I miss you...

368
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:27,117
and see how you were.

369
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:29,390
That's all.

370
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:32,122
Kisses.

371
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:34,024
Bye.

372
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:03,221
- Hello.
- How are you?

373
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:04,487
Sorry.

374
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:09,260
My friend hooked me up with
a guy who’ll meet us at the bar.

375
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,265
He's in a blue shirt.
I'll talk to him...

376
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:14,633
but I'll pass it on to you.
I don't want to have that on me.

377
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:16,763
- Fine. I'll take it.
- Ok.

378
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:19,103
- Are you staying or coming?
- I'll go with you.

379
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:23,020
- Felipe?
- What?

380
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:27,993
- Thanks a Lot. Really.
- Great.

381
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:32,233
- Will you bring him this tomorrow?
- I can't tomorrow.

382
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:34,802
- You bring it to him.
- The day after.

383
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:38,771
OK. The day after.

384
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:40,672
- Bye.
- Shall we have a drink?

385
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:42,904
- What?
- Let's have a drink.

386
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,413
We haven't seen each other
in ages, we should talk.

387
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:48,712
- Lt's not a good idea.
- Why not?

388
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,648
Mostly because I’m tired.
I’d prefer to go home.

389
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,486
- Do you still Live in San Telmo?
- Yes, San Telmo.

390
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:57,651
I'll give you a Lift.
Lt's on the way.

391
00:39:57,862 --> 00:40:01,263
- I’d prefer to walk.
- You said you were tired.

392
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:04,963
- I need the air.
- I can't Leave you here.

393
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:07,536
There's no one around.
I'll give you a Lift.

394
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:09,036
We can go in the car.

395
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:19,979
Give me the money.
Come on, the money.

396
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:21,914
- Here, here, here...
- What's wrong?

397
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:23,781
What's wrong? Come on.
Give it over.

398
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,685
- I haven't got anything.
- Give me the money.

399
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:32,456
What's your problem?
Do you want me to kill you?

400
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:35,121
- I haven't got any more!
- Do you want me to kill you?

401
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:39,930
- Coke! I have Coke!
- Coke? Do you have any weed?

402
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:43,437
- How's he going to have weed?
- I gave you everything.

403
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:47,032
- Bang, bang, bang!
- Wait! In the boot!

404
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:54,045
- I was going to sell them.
- Yeah, yeah.

405
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:00,216
Come on, you fucker!

406
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:08,661
Fucking hell!

407
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:12,098
I wanted to spare you this.

408
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:15,133
This or whatever...
well, fuck you.

409
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:17,667
What's wrong with you?

410
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,307
Are we going to have a drink?

411
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:22,674
<i>Lt's not a good idea.
I told you quite clearly:</i>

412
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,781
Lt's not a good idea!
" I'll give you a Lift. "

413
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:29,352
- No, I’d prefer to walk!
- What's wrong with you?

414
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:31,715
- Do you want to know?
- Yes.

415
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:35,189
My Life is a...
Everything I touch rots.

416
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:39,990
My path is fatal. Someone is
sowing evil for me to harvest.

417
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:43,360
What? I don't understand
a fucking thing!

418
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,991
I’m a jinx!

419
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:52,771
A jinx! A tainted person who brings
bad Luck to those around him.

420
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:56,208
I gave you so many chances to
Let me walk away!

421
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,609
You passed them all up!

422
00:41:57,748 --> 00:42:00,182
Lf you had Listened, none of
this would have happened!

423
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:02,342
But no! You don't get it!

424
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:06,312
You aren't a jinx.
You know what you are?

425
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:09,449
Someone who thinks they're the
centre of everything that happens

426
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:11,424
- in everyone else’s Lives.
- No, I’m a jinx.

427
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:14,793
Lt's all been black for me
for ages now!

428
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:18,459
I’m a jinx, man.

429
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:23,068
Do you really think you're a jinx?

430
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:25,874
Yeah, I really do.

431
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:29,937
So why did you get me
to carry the cocaine?

432
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:31,443
What?

433
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:33,447
Lf you really think
you're a jinx...

434
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:36,417
why did you get me to carry
the cocaine?

435
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,045
I wanted to Leave.
You wouldn’t Let me go!

436
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:40,850
But nothing ever
happens to the jinx.

437
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:42,390
The bad Luck goes to
the other people...

438
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:46,121
so if you really think you're
a jinx why didn't you come alone?

439
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:47,992
So on top of being a jinx,
you're an asshole too.

440
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:49,827
Don't start twisting things around,
you prick.

441
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:51,867
I didn't want to do this
from the start.

442
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:55,199
I only did it so no one
would bust my balls.

443
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,541
I didn't want to do
this stupid thing.

444
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:02,010
And be thankful I gave it to
you. The guy calmed down...

445
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:05,274
when he saw the coke. Otherwise
he would have killed us both.

446
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,611
So now you're not a jinx!
Now you've saved my Life!

447
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,810
- Don't twist things around!
- I’m not!

448
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:13,685
Do you know what saved our Lives?
The shoes I put in the boot!

449
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:16,292
So for once in your fucking Life,
be thankful to someone...

450
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,793
for keeping you safe and sound!

451
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:22,156
Fuck me!

452
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,727
- Why were those shoes there?
- What?

453
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:28,304
Why where those shoes there?
I heard you.

454
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,771
You were going to sell them.
That they were worth 6000!

455
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:32,967
- So?
- What are you up to?

456
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,010
- Are you stealing?
- Don't be an idiot!

457
00:43:35,145 --> 00:43:37,841
I’ve been working in a shoe
factory for seven years!

458
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:40,177
I worked in a bakery
for five years...

459
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:43,411
and I don't have a boot
full of doughnuts!

460
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:47,446
- What were they doing there?
- Because after seven years...

461
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:51,652
they fired me and paid my
redundancy in shoes...

462
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:55,231
and I was going to sell them!
That's why!

463
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:59,260
You aren't a jinx!
You're self-centered...

464
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:01,200
and you think everything
revolves around you!

465
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:05,331
And the sad thing is,
you don't even see it!

466
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:07,942
And be thankful I put
the shoes there...

467
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:10,376
or you'd be getting your ass
kicked in a wasteland...

468
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:12,004
beside the highway somewhere!

469
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:15,243
Why don't you get your
ass kicked and Let me sleep?!

470
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:18,048
- Shut the fuck up!
- I'll call the police!

471
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:21,783
Why didn't you call them
when they were robbing us?!

472
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,353
Take it easy, Felipe!

473
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:26,054
- Come on.
- Leave me alone.

474
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:27,011
Jonahs?
Yes, I’ve met Loads.

475
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:30,049
There's a Lot in
your Line of work.

476
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:35,351
But what are you
Looking for exactly?

477
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:40,356
I have to prepare
a character who's a jinx...

478
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:44,089
and as you know everyone,
I thought you could help me...

479
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:49,103
to meet one, to talk a Little,
study him closely.

480
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:52,842
There's a guy whom L
haven't seen for ages.

481
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:55,440
He was an administrator
in the theatre.

482
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:57,171
What was his name?

483
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:59,714
I called him Coco so as
not to use his name...

484
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:01,909
but just in case, I give
the Left one a touch.

485
00:47:02,052 --> 00:47:03,747
And is it possible to find him?

486
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:07,084
I went to his house once.
He Lived in Devoto.

487
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:09,018
Do you remember where?

488
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:11,558
When you Leave the station,
the dome is on the right.

489
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:15,290
<i>On the other side, diagonally
across, there's an old house.</i>

490
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:18,890
<i>The guy lived there.
Tell him I sent you.</i>

491
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:24,170
- Ls Coco there?
- Who is asking?

492
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:27,038
Felipe NugaL.
Tell him Pepe sent me.

493
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:33,049
You're preparing to play a jinx?

494
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:36,619
- And you want me to give
you the details? - Yes.

495
00:47:38,055 --> 00:47:39,818
You want me to tell you what it's
Like to Live...

496
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:41,686
pointed out by a bunch of idiots...

497
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:44,385
who call themselves artists?
Ls that what you want?

498
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:50,859
I'll tell you.
It’ll be 100 in advance.

499
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,193
What's wrong?

500
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:58,841
When you go to a specialist,
doesn't he charge you?

501
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:03,672
Well, I’m an expert in my field.
Lt's up front or piss off.

502
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:07,910
I was very busy scratching
my balls before you arrived.

503
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:14,482
I don't think I have enough.
I have 45.

504
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:23,990
As a favour to Pepe.
What do you want to know?

505
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:28,233
- How did it start?
- How did it start?

506
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,070
The day I started work
at the theatre...

507
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:36,407
a series of events began,
silly Little things.

508
00:48:36,813 --> 00:48:39,748
A Light exploded,
and burned the curtain.

509
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:41,578
The next day, when they
were changing it...

510
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:44,653
one of the technicians
had a heart attack.

511
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:48,988
Luckily, he recovered.
But there was an actor...

512
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:52,027
an asshole, that started
going around saying...

513
00:48:52,162 --> 00:48:55,654
that I was a jinx.
That's how it started.

514
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:59,024
Someone points you out,
the rumour goes around...

515
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:02,002
then everyone is saying it,
and you're finished.

516
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:07,502
But did you feel guilty
when the bad things happened?

517
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:09,544
Well, it gets into your head.

518
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,342
But things Like that
happen everywhere!

519
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:14,245
Yes, but when it got
into your head...

520
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:17,820
did you try to do anything
to stop being a jinx.

521
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:20,480
I wasn't one!
They made me into one.

522
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:23,925
The fucked up thing isn't
if you are or aren't a jinx.

523
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:25,858
Lt's the way they make a
reputation for you.

524
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:29,625
Then you have to Leave
all the circles you moved in.

525
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:32,496
And if your family depends
on that, what happens?

526
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:37,437
They ruin your Life, don't they?
But I screwed them, buddy.

527
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,743
- Do you want to know how?
- Yes.

528
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:45,040
I made a List of everyone
who touched themselves...

529
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:48,743
when I walked past,
and I started to call them up.

530
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:55,284
Hi, Cacho, how are you?
Lt's Humberto, from the theatre...

531
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:58,223
the jinx that has everyone
touching themselves...

532
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:00,193
every time I walk by.
Do you remember me?

533
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:03,788
That's great.
Because I remember you.

534
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:07,097
I’m always thinking of you.
And I was calling to say...

535
00:50:07,237 --> 00:50:10,729
I hope you have a good week,
without any problems.

536
00:50:10,874 --> 00:50:16,540
I'll be calling you forever.
Every Sunday to say good Luck...

537
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:20,309
every birthday to wish
you many more...

538
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:26,411
<i>every opening you have,
to say: "break a Leg".</i>

539
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:30,387
I’m always going to call you
to wish you the best.

540
00:50:30,594 --> 00:50:32,391
Bye. Until next Sunday.

541
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:37,059
That's how I started.
One by one.

542
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:39,901
They were shitting themselves.
Actors, you know.

543
00:50:40,937 --> 00:50:45,636
After 3 weeks of phone calls,
I went up to each one of them...

544
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:49,542
and said, "Lf you don't want
me to call every Sunday...

545
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:51,579
for the rest of your Life,
take down this account number...

546
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:57,711
and put in 100 pesos every month,
which is the minimum...

547
00:50:57,854 --> 00:50:59,947
for having ruined my Life
by humiliating me...

548
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:03,992
and closing all the doors
to the job I Loved doing...

549
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:05,594
you son of a bitch.

550
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:11,599
- And? - I make 4000 a month,
without moving a finger.

551
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:17,867
Now, everyone who fucked me,
is working for me.

552
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:25,203
But you didn't come here to
prepare a character.

553
00:51:25,515 --> 00:51:26,846
Why are you here?

554
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:29,480
Because...

555
00:51:30,987 --> 00:51:32,579
I’m a jinx too.

556
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:38,194
And I’d Like to know what
to do to make it stop.

557
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:40,454
What do you expect from me?
Diet tips?

558
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:47,130
So you're a jinx.
Fuck me.

559
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:50,636
Two colleagues, face to face.

560
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:54,671
So you really are a jinx.

561
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:58,707
Yes, I’m terrible, buddy.

562
00:51:59,182 --> 00:52:01,878
There aren't many of us,
and I understand you...

563
00:52:02,018 --> 00:52:04,885
because you end up constantly
questioning yourself.

564
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:09,081
Everyone Leaves you.
I just have my mother Left.

565
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:15,256
Take this. How am L
going to charge you?

566
00:52:15,398 --> 00:52:21,166
I think I'll raise
the installments next month.

567
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:25,468
Prices have gone up so much.
And I always wanted a Mercedes.

568
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:27,907
I’m saving for a used one.

569
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:30,245
Those fuckers screwed me
so much...

570
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:33,213
I’m going to make them all
pay for the Mercedes.

571
00:52:35,218 --> 00:52:41,919
- Do you want to know more
about this? - Yes.

572
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:45,789
The guys get together once
a week. Why don't you come?

573
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:47,190
What guys?

574
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:50,231
- "Skinny thing. "
- Nice to meet you.

575
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:53,461
- "Magic Hands. "
- Hello.

576
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:57,902
- "José Wiggy. "
- Nice to meet you.

577
00:52:58,041 --> 00:53:01,067
- This is "the Sergeant".
- Nice to meet you.

578
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:04,578
- And "Little Ears".
- Hi.

579
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:11,284
I once shook hands with a
former president, at an event...

580
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:17,518
and the next day,
inflation began to rise.

581
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:18,992
Don't remind us!

582
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:21,120
Welcome pal!

583
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:26,825
Here you’ll
feel supported, Loved...

584
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:29,404
and even proud
of your condition...

585
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,871
because this is an
iron-strong brotherhood.

586
00:53:32,008 --> 00:53:35,068
- Isn’t that right, Wiggy.
- Of course it is! Welcome pal!

587
00:53:36,479 --> 00:53:43,351
I’d Like to make a toast
to the memory of our hero.

588
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:44,919
No, no!

589
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:46,920
Please...

590
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,617
You know he was Like a
father to us.

591
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:53,996
What's wrong, man?

592
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:56,894
After everything that "Christ"
went through!

593
00:53:58,034 --> 00:54:00,468
Or are we going to forget him too?

594
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:07,170
His name deserves to be spoken,
even if only now and then.

595
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:12,043
- Remember what happened Last time.
- He's right...

596
00:54:12,215 --> 00:54:14,911
Lf you all won't drink
to him, then I will.

597
00:54:18,455 --> 00:54:22,084
To the memory of
my dear friend, comrade...

598
00:54:22,225 --> 00:54:24,785
and the founder of this
wonderful brotherhood.

599
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:29,365
He taught us to walk
with dignity and pride.

600
00:54:29,499 --> 00:54:32,559
To the memory of our dear
Elbio Di NapoLi.

601
00:54:42,846 --> 00:54:44,643
I told you!

602
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:50,185
I told you, asshole!
Don't say his name!

603
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:52,045

BOOKS

605
00:56:32,487 --> 00:56:34,478
<i>In my essay on luck...</i>

606
00:56:34,622 --> 00:56:38,285
<i>I claim that mankind is divided
into two main groups.</i>

607
00:56:38,826 --> 00:56:42,785
<i>Those with good
luck and those with bad luck.</i>

608
00:56:42,964 --> 00:56:46,866
<i>We pass from one group to another
without realizing it...</i>

609
00:56:47,001 --> 00:56:50,129
<i>not even being aware of it...</i>

610
00:56:50,271 --> 00:56:53,798
<i>until luck, good or bad,
touches us clearly.</i>

611
00:56:54,275 --> 00:56:57,039
<i>These shifts happen
all the time...</i>

612
00:56:57,178 --> 00:56:59,203
<i>because the system tends
towards equilibrium.</i>

613
00:56:59,347 --> 00:57:04,080
<i>For every lucky person,
there is an unlucky person...</i>

614
00:57:04,218 --> 00:57:05,583
<i>and vice-versa.</i>

615
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,582
<i>Just as electrons jump
from atom to atom...</i>

616
00:57:08,723 --> 00:57:11,453
<i>while searching for
a nucleus to orbit...</i>

617
00:57:11,592 --> 00:57:14,857
<i>people are also shifting from
one group to the other.</i>

618
00:57:14,996 --> 00:57:19,626
<i>Let us take an example.</i>

619
00:57:20,168 --> 00:57:23,604
<i>We are in an airport,
anywhere in the world.</i>

620
00:57:25,606 --> 00:57:29,906
<i>Mr. A misses his family badly,
and arrives at the airport...</i>

621
00:57:30,044 --> 00:57:32,376
<i>wishing to travel immediately,
so as to see them.</i>

622
00:57:33,448 --> 00:57:36,349
<i>He gets the last seat
on the flight.</i>

623
00:57:36,484 --> 00:57:40,318
<i>Mr. A now finds himself
in the lucky group...</i>

624
00:57:40,455 --> 00:57:42,855
<i>being able to now
satisfy his desire.</i>

625
00:57:46,861 --> 00:57:51,560
<i>Mr. B, just like Mr. A, wants
to travel to the same place...</i>

626
00:57:51,699 --> 00:57:55,897
<i>as he has been offered a highly
lucrative business opportunity.</i>

627
00:57:56,037 --> 00:57:58,870
<i>He thus also finds himself
in the lucky group.</i>

628
00:57:59,073 --> 00:58:02,634
<i>But he must arrive today
or the chance will be lost.</i>

629
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:08,041
<i>Mr. B arrives just after Mr. A.
Unable to get a seat on the flight</i>

630
00:58:08,249 --> 00:58:12,276
<i>and on the point of losing
his business opportunity...</i>

631
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:17,255
<i>Mr. B leaves the lucky group
to move into the unlucky group...</i>

632
00:58:17,391 --> 00:58:19,188
<i>as the system balances itself.</i>

633
00:58:20,161 --> 00:58:24,860
<i>Mr. B's only chance is the stand-by
list he put his name on...</i>

634
00:58:24,999 --> 00:58:26,899
<i>in the hope
of getting the flight.</i>

635
00:58:28,236 --> 00:58:32,696
<i>About to board, Mr. A begins
to feel sharp stomach pains...</i>

636
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:36,708
<i>due to the rush with which
he ate his sandwich of ham...</i>

637
00:58:36,844 --> 00:58:39,335
<i>cheese, peppers,
guacamole, egg and mayonnaise.</i>

638
00:58:41,415 --> 00:58:44,748
<i>Mr. B's luck has changed again.
He will soon find out...</i>

639
00:58:44,886 --> 00:58:48,549
<i>he has moved from the unlucky group
to the lucky one once more...</i>

640
00:58:48,689 --> 00:58:51,988
<i>as Mr. A's condition is so
severe, that he is unable...</i>

641
00:58:52,126 --> 00:58:55,618
<i>to leave the toilet in time
to catch his flight...</i>

642
00:58:55,763 --> 00:58:58,789
<i>finding himself once more
in the unlucky group.</i>

643
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:01,825
<i>Mr. B is delighted.</i>

644
00:59:02,203 --> 00:59:05,798
<i>He will now be able to seal
his million dollar deal.</i>

645
00:59:05,973 --> 00:59:09,170
<i>In the take-off,
a fire in the engine...</i>

646
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:12,279
<i>causes a fatal accident.</i>

647
00:59:13,281 --> 00:59:16,842
<i>Mr. B, who had been
in the lucky group...</i>

648
00:59:16,984 --> 00:59:18,781
<i>is now once again
among the unlucky...</i>

649
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:21,946
<i>for he has not only lost
his business deal...</i>

650
00:59:22,089 --> 00:59:24,785
<i>but also his life,
in the accident.</i>

651
00:59:24,959 --> 00:59:28,156
<i>Meanwhile, Mr. A,
still seriously ill...</i>

652
00:59:28,296 --> 00:59:31,663
<i>moves from having bad luck at
having lost his flight...</i>

653
00:59:31,799 --> 00:59:35,030
<i>to having good luck again,
having remained alive...</i>

654
00:59:35,169 --> 00:59:39,503
<i>although, unaware of the events,
he continues to curse his luck.</i>

655
00:59:39,841 --> 00:59:43,470
<i>This is a crude example,
with tragic consequences...</i>

656
00:59:43,611 --> 00:59:47,945
<i>but this is how things
happen all the time...</i>

657
00:59:48,082 --> 00:59:50,141
<i>regardless of the scale
of the events...</i>

658
00:59:50,284 --> 00:59:53,617
<i>and mostly, we don't even
realize what is happening.</i>

659
01:00:20,081 --> 01:00:23,710
Those whose Lives are
invariably dominated...

660
01:00:23,851 --> 01:00:26,411
by good or bad Luck are
considered to be extreme cases.

661
01:00:26,554 --> 01:00:28,419
An extreme person identifies
himself...

662
01:00:28,556 --> 01:00:29,614
with one group or the other.

663
01:00:29,757 --> 01:00:31,691
If I am unlucky and believe
myself to be so...

664
01:00:31,826 --> 01:00:33,225
I tend be more and more so.

665
01:00:33,361 --> 01:00:36,489
One example is someone we
associate with bad Luck...

666
01:00:36,631 --> 01:00:39,828
whom we avoid even naming,
Labeling him as a jinx.

667
01:00:41,702 --> 01:00:44,000
This condition can be
innate or hereditary.

668
01:00:44,138 --> 01:00:46,163
This is called,
"extreme inheritance. "

669
01:00:46,307 --> 01:00:48,798
<i>For example: Lf an extreme
person dies, the inheritance...</i>

670
01:00:48,943 --> 01:00:53,073
may pass on to anyone, but
the most susceptible people...

671
01:00:53,214 --> 01:00:57,116
are those who share an emotional
bond with the subject when he dies.

672
01:01:02,823 --> 01:01:07,487
- Can one voluntarily change from
one group to the other? - Yes.

673
01:01:07,995 --> 01:01:10,361
Lf the individual manages to
invert the polarity...

674
01:01:10,498 --> 01:01:13,524
of his electrical charge.
See illustration.

675
01:01:15,136 --> 01:01:18,765
Human electrical
polarity converter.

676
01:01:19,774 --> 01:01:23,938
<i>An electrical charge can
alter our frequency...</i>

677
01:01:24,078 --> 01:01:26,672
<i>and induce a shift from
one group to another.</i>

678
01:02:56,971 --> 01:02:58,165
Laurencio?

679
01:02:59,106 --> 01:03:01,074
- Guillermo.
- Nice to meet you.

680
01:03:02,676 --> 01:03:06,168
I understand the
"master" bit.

681
01:03:06,881 --> 01:03:09,349
I wanted you to explain
the "magic" involved.

682
01:03:11,018 --> 01:03:14,249
- So you got the bug then...
- Yes. - Why?

683
01:03:16,524 --> 01:03:18,219
I want to Learn to dance tango.

684
01:03:18,359 --> 01:03:21,851
And why today and not Last year
or in two months' time?

685
01:03:22,797 --> 01:03:25,732
Actually, I want to Learn
the tango to get a woman.

686
01:03:26,467 --> 01:03:28,731
I Like it better now.

687
01:03:29,003 --> 01:03:31,870
I went to a club. She was waiting
for me to ask her to dance...

688
01:03:32,006 --> 01:03:34,304
but I didn't because
I can't dance tango.

689
01:03:34,508 --> 01:03:36,533
I ended up just
standing there.

690
01:03:37,912 --> 01:03:41,473
Tell me.
Do you force or flow?

691
01:03:42,616 --> 01:03:46,916
Do you make things happen
or just go with the flow?

692
01:03:47,588 --> 01:03:49,954
I just know I have
to Learn the tango.

693
01:03:50,124 --> 01:03:52,718
I don't know her,
I don't know who she is...

694
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:55,922
but if I don't Learn how,
I won't do anything.

695
01:03:56,864 --> 01:03:59,355
I think it's already happened.

696
01:04:00,201 --> 01:04:03,432
You and her are already together,
or you will never be.

697
01:04:04,238 --> 01:04:05,899
Do you follow me?

698
01:04:06,707 --> 01:04:10,302
I dance all day every Sunday.
I’m in here all day.

699
01:04:10,878 --> 01:04:14,405
I have no idea what goes on in the
world outside. I don't know.

700
01:04:14,548 --> 01:04:17,540
At night, I watch the replay of
the football game on TV.

701
01:04:17,685 --> 01:04:20,085
But for me, it's as if
it were a Live broadcast.

702
01:04:20,254 --> 01:04:24,987
So I get happy,
get sad, get excited...

703
01:04:25,126 --> 01:04:29,563
and when the ball goes up
in the air, well, it's a goal.

704
01:04:30,030 --> 01:04:33,659
However, the ball will Land where
it has to, and nowhere else.

705
01:04:33,968 --> 01:04:38,496
Why?
Because it has already happened.

706
01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:43,042
But since I’m unaware of that,
I think it's happening at the time.

707
01:04:43,644 --> 01:04:46,579
Time is difficult to understand.

708
01:04:47,915 --> 01:04:51,214
I think we fool ourselves thinking
Life is a Live event.

709
01:04:51,352 --> 01:04:54,253
But I think it's actually a replay.

710
01:04:55,356 --> 01:04:58,120
That woman and you are
already together...

711
01:04:58,259 --> 01:05:00,591
or you won't ever be together.

712
01:05:01,795 --> 01:05:04,855
Now you have to Learn to dance
a Little and go find out.

713
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:06,930
There's the magic.

714
01:05:28,956 --> 01:05:33,359
Technically, it's about
openings and changes.

715
01:05:33,861 --> 01:05:37,854
Dancing tango is Like walking
with a woman stuck to your chest.

716
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,596
Hold her. Hold her, go on.
Put your arm around her waist.

717
01:05:44,972 --> 01:05:47,736
Take a step. Move away.

718
01:05:47,875 --> 01:05:50,742
No, don't Look down.
Always keep your head up.

719
01:05:50,878 --> 01:05:53,870
That's it. You did that by
yourself!

720
01:05:54,114 --> 01:05:57,880
You're already correcting yourself.
That's a good start.

721
01:06:00,354 --> 01:06:03,653
You flow Guille!
Very good!

722
01:07:20,134 --> 01:07:21,396
Felipe...

723
01:07:22,102 --> 01:07:23,501
Guillermo.

724
01:07:24,738 --> 01:07:27,605
I had an idea for the old man.

725
01:07:29,276 --> 01:07:31,369
We can bring him a placebo.

726
01:07:32,579 --> 01:07:34,046
I know.

727
01:07:35,449 --> 01:07:38,418
We’ll give him some
baking powder or something...

728
01:07:38,552 --> 01:07:40,349
and tell him it's cocaine.

729
01:07:41,955 --> 01:07:44,150
No, he won't be able to tell
the difference.

730
01:07:44,591 --> 01:07:46,821
He won't notice, trust me.

731
01:07:49,129 --> 01:07:52,064
OK, I'll do it, but
both of us should go.

732
01:07:53,834 --> 01:07:55,131
Fine.

733
01:07:55,602 --> 01:07:58,070
Good bye.

734
01:08:02,343 --> 01:08:06,370
- I’m sorry, I slept in.
- Lt's all right.

735
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:10,279
Know what?

736
01:08:11,518 --> 01:08:14,009
I’m sorry about the scene
I made the other night.

737
01:08:16,357 --> 01:08:19,724
I’m sorry about the one I made.

738
01:08:20,761 --> 01:08:21,989
L...

739
01:08:23,997 --> 01:08:26,295
Do you really think you're a jinx?

740
01:08:26,934 --> 01:08:31,337
No, I was a bit out of it
the other day.

741
01:08:33,073 --> 01:08:36,065
Lf you want, we could go
for a drink sometime.

742
01:08:36,877 --> 01:08:40,506
- Lt's been such a Long time.
- Yes.

743
01:08:42,282 --> 01:08:45,479
- I saw you Last year.
- Where?

744
01:08:46,487 --> 01:08:50,355
- I went to see you in the theatre.
- Really?

745
01:08:52,326 --> 01:08:57,559
- You were doing Shakespeare.
- A Midsummer Night's Dream.

746
01:08:58,899 --> 01:09:04,838
- You were brilliant.
- Thanks.

747
01:09:18,852 --> 01:09:20,149
Hello...

748
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:48,614
- How are you feeling?
- Fine.

749
01:09:49,049 --> 01:09:52,610
Tell me. Ls it day or night?

750
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:01,189
Lt's daytime, Dad.

751
01:10:01,395 --> 01:10:07,527
Do you know if the board
confirmed the figures?

752
01:10:08,802 --> 01:10:10,429
Yes, they did.

753
01:10:13,874 --> 01:10:17,037
Dad, we got what you wanted.
Do you remember?

754
01:10:17,644 --> 01:10:21,375
That thing, to make the Little 25
watt Lights Look Like 60 watts?

755
01:10:21,715 --> 01:10:26,448
Oh yes! The Little Lights...

756
01:10:30,290 --> 01:10:34,920
What Little Lights...?
With all these crocodiles...

757
01:10:35,062 --> 01:10:41,968
running here and there...
Little Lights...?

758
01:10:46,406 --> 01:10:52,140
I want to speak to my
brothers. My brothers...

759
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:55,575
You don't have any brothers, Dad.

760
01:10:56,517 --> 01:10:57,848
I have two.

761
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:01,981
Felipe and Guillermo.

762
01:11:02,923 --> 01:11:05,084
I Love them so much.

763
01:11:05,926 --> 01:11:12,422
Guillermo always comes to
visit me, he's so good...

764
01:11:14,234 --> 01:11:21,538
Felipe... Felipe’s kind of
angry with me...

765
01:11:21,909 --> 01:11:26,209
He's very sensitive.
He's an artist.

766
01:11:28,215 --> 01:11:32,811
He has to be Looked after.
He's a great artist.

767
01:11:32,986 --> 01:11:34,851
Look after him please.

768
01:11:38,292 --> 01:11:40,817
Look after him for me.

769
01:11:44,898 --> 01:11:47,662
My Little brother.

770
01:11:48,835 --> 01:11:50,803
I Love him so much.

771
01:14:03,737 --> 01:14:06,501
Hello, Dad.
How are you?

772
01:14:09,943 --> 01:14:12,173
I know you can't answer me.

773
01:14:15,148 --> 01:14:18,675
I was thinking about that
story the other day.

774
01:14:20,887 --> 01:14:24,618
Maybe it would have been better
to have stayed with the dancer.

775
01:14:28,195 --> 01:14:31,187
You wouldn’t have ended up
a widower when Mum died...

776
01:14:33,567 --> 01:14:36,297
and you would have avoided
that mad woman...

777
01:14:36,436 --> 01:14:38,370
that walked out on you
and Guillermo.

778
01:14:42,175 --> 01:14:44,735
You might have had a happier Life.

779
01:14:47,781 --> 01:14:50,306
At Least happier
than the one you had.

780
01:14:53,954 --> 01:14:57,754
I have some nice memories of those
few years we spent together.

781
01:15:01,461 --> 01:15:03,759
You were always so serious.

782
01:15:06,133 --> 01:15:08,624
I think you were bored
to death back then.

783
01:15:15,675 --> 01:15:22,672
The other day you said
I was an artist.

784
01:15:24,751 --> 01:15:27,618
That I was very sensitive
and needed Looking after.

785
01:15:29,356 --> 01:15:31,916
"My Little brother", you said.

786
01:15:34,394 --> 01:15:38,023
Look what we had to go through
to finally say these things.

787
01:15:43,270 --> 01:15:46,239
You don't know what's
happening to me.

788
01:15:47,474 --> 01:15:53,071
I could have really used your help.
So much Lost time.

789
01:15:56,483 --> 01:16:00,579
I want to admit my mistakes too.
I want to say sorry.

790
01:16:01,421 --> 01:16:03,753
I want to say I Love you.

791
01:16:05,258 --> 01:16:07,192
I Love you very much.

792
01:16:12,933 --> 01:16:14,833
- Excuse me?
- Excuse me?

793
01:16:15,969 --> 01:16:18,938
- What is it, ma'am?
- What is it?

794
01:16:19,105 --> 01:16:21,266
I’ve come to say hello
to my husband.

795
01:16:36,022 --> 01:16:37,148
OK...

796
01:17:22,402 --> 01:17:27,840
If I told you what just happened,
you'd Lose all respect for me.

797
01:17:31,978 --> 01:17:33,878
I'll sum it up for you.

798
01:17:38,151 --> 01:17:40,346
I Love you very much.

799
01:17:44,324 --> 01:17:47,521
Get the guy in the next room
to tell you the rest.

800
01:17:47,694 --> 01:17:50,629
Lt Looks Like he’ll be
on the same train as you.

801
01:18:52,525 --> 01:18:55,016
How many girlfriends
have you had Guillermo?

802
01:18:55,929 --> 01:18:56,520
Three.

803
01:18:56,663 --> 01:18:58,824
- And what were they Like?
- All different.

804
01:18:58,965 --> 01:19:00,159
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

805
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:02,359
I think they're always
the same in the end.

806
01:19:02,502 --> 01:19:04,629
We always do the same things
over and over.

807
01:19:04,771 --> 01:19:07,103
Lt's very difficult to avoid
repeating yourself.

808
01:19:07,574 --> 01:19:11,237
You can change the shape
but the pattern is always the same.

809
01:19:12,178 --> 01:19:15,739
Lf you become aware of repetitions,
you can stand aside...

810
01:19:15,882 --> 01:19:17,315
and Let the ball roll past.

811
01:19:17,450 --> 01:19:20,783
Then you have a better chance
of beginning to find...

812
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:24,378
what is right for you.
Lt's the same with women.

813
01:19:24,791 --> 01:19:27,658
"Repetition" is the opposite
of "evolution".

814
01:19:27,861 --> 01:19:29,954
To evolve, you have to Learn.

815
01:19:30,964 --> 01:19:35,424
- Did you ever have to Learn
something to get a woman? - No.

816
01:19:35,568 --> 01:19:38,401
Lt Looks Like Life has chosen
tango for your evolution.

817
01:19:39,539 --> 01:19:44,067
Buy a good pair of shoes
and you’ll notice the difference.

818
01:19:46,212 --> 01:19:47,679
- Thank you.
- Bye.

819
01:20:07,267 --> 01:20:09,258
<i>Hi, Felipe. It's Alfredo.</i>

820
01:20:09,402 --> 01:20:12,462
<i>I hope it all went well with the
fortune teller and the other thing</i>

821
01:20:12,605 --> 01:20:14,732
<i>There's
an audition for a film...</i>

822
01:20:14,874 --> 01:20:17,138
<i>and they're only looking
for a few people.</i>

823
01:20:17,277 --> 01:20:20,178
<i>I can't go. We have
an extra rehearsal.</i>

824
01:20:20,313 --> 01:20:23,407
<i>So I'm passing it on to you.
All my best, buddy.</i>

825
01:20:35,562 --> 01:20:38,588
<i>- Who is it?
- I’m here for the audition.</i>

826
01:20:38,731 --> 01:20:39,857
<i>Come in.</i>

827
01:20:52,879 --> 01:20:53,868
Hello.

828
01:20:57,050 --> 01:20:58,347
Yes.

829
01:21:01,888 --> 01:21:03,617
Yes, I’m on my way.

830
01:22:08,588 --> 01:22:12,024
- Ma'am.
- Yes, dear.

831
01:22:45,325 --> 01:22:48,852
Hello, Victor, sweetheart.

832
01:22:49,762 --> 01:22:54,290
Do you remember me?
I’m Lina Delponte.

833
01:24:30,530 --> 01:24:33,727
<i>Hello, this is a message
for Mr. Felipe Nugal...</i>

834
01:24:33,866 --> 01:24:38,360
<i>from Europa Films.
We'd like him to get in touch...</i>

835
01:24:38,504 --> 01:24:45,376
<i>to organize an interview. The
number is 47216594. Thank you.</i>

836
01:24:48,948 --> 01:24:51,109
I think we're ready
to go see what happens.

837
01:24:52,085 --> 01:24:54,349
- Do you think so?
- Yes, why not.

838
01:24:55,054 --> 01:24:57,614
You know how to hold her
and then, just walk with her.

839
01:24:57,757 --> 01:24:59,224
That's all you need.

840
01:24:59,992 --> 01:25:03,860
Women don't want some guy
with fancy dance moves.

841
01:25:04,731 --> 01:25:07,723
They want a guy
who can hold them.

842
01:25:10,636 --> 01:25:13,161
Go to the club
and ask her to dance.

843
01:25:14,207 --> 01:25:16,835
Then you’ll know if the ball
is in the back of the net...

844
01:25:16,976 --> 01:25:18,534
or if it went wide.

845
01:25:53,079 --> 01:25:55,104
- Can you hear it?
- What?

846
01:25:55,815 --> 01:25:58,375
Listen to it, because
it will be the Last time.

847
01:25:59,485 --> 01:26:00,918
Come and help me!

848
01:26:02,155 --> 01:26:05,886
We have to take advantage
of this unique situation.

849
01:26:06,025 --> 01:26:10,485
My wife has taken the kids
to her mother's in Chascomús.

850
01:26:11,063 --> 01:26:13,793
- We're alone!
- But wait! Wait!

851
01:26:14,066 --> 01:26:15,431
Where are you taking me?

852
01:26:15,568 --> 01:26:17,900
She didn't want to.
"Are you mad?", she said...

853
01:26:18,037 --> 01:26:21,529
She didn't want to... But
you want to end this too...

854
01:26:21,674 --> 01:26:24,142
I can get it for a grand,
and it’ll be over!

855
01:26:24,277 --> 01:26:25,938
I don't understand any of this
and I have to go!

856
01:26:26,078 --> 01:26:27,705
You can go afterwards,
come to my place first!

857
01:26:27,847 --> 01:26:29,712
A grand! I paid for it!

858
01:26:30,917 --> 01:26:32,509
What a moment!

859
01:26:33,953 --> 01:26:36,080
This is a great moment.

860
01:26:36,856 --> 01:26:39,689
I’ve been waiting for this
for two weeks.

861
01:26:45,431 --> 01:26:47,058
Lt's so beautiful...

862
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:49,998
- Ls that a real bazooka?
- Thank the Lord.

863
01:26:50,670 --> 01:26:54,106
Lt's a good-Luck-night for some
and a bad-Luck-night for others.

864
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:55,673
- No, you're mad.
- We're both mad...

865
01:26:55,808 --> 01:26:58,276
if we think it's fair to keep
Letting those bastards interrupt...

866
01:26:58,411 --> 01:26:59,673
our sleep.

867
01:26:59,879 --> 01:27:02,245
Now's the time to sort
this problem out.

868
01:27:02,381 --> 01:27:04,349
The world belongs to whoever
takes the bull by the horns.

869
01:27:04,484 --> 01:27:08,147
- When was the Last time you slept?
- Months ago.

870
01:27:08,387 --> 01:27:10,116
You are going to sleep tonight.

871
01:27:11,757 --> 01:27:14,885
Let's do it now,
or I'll chicken out too.

872
01:27:22,001 --> 01:27:23,298
Do you know how to use it?

873
01:27:23,436 --> 01:27:26,837
I got it from an ex-army guy,
he wrote me down the instructions.

874
01:27:27,039 --> 01:27:28,597
He said it was easy.

875
01:27:28,875 --> 01:27:32,311
And if soldiers all over the world
use them, it can't be so hard.

876
01:27:34,947 --> 01:27:36,744
Take out to use.

877
01:27:38,518 --> 01:27:40,577
Open rear end.

878
01:27:43,089 --> 01:27:45,182
Extend tube.

879
01:27:51,831 --> 01:27:54,766
Load explosives
into the tube.

880
01:28:05,211 --> 01:28:06,644
Read it for me.

881
01:28:06,812 --> 01:28:08,780
Hold the bottom half
of the tube...

882
01:28:08,915 --> 01:28:10,883
and Line up the target
with the upper end.

883
01:28:11,017 --> 01:28:13,485
Come here.
Come here!

884
01:28:16,155 --> 01:28:18,817
- Are there any people around?
- No, there's no-one.

885
01:28:19,091 --> 01:28:21,525
Now you’ll get it,
you son of a bitch!

886
01:29:11,444 --> 01:29:12,604
Guille.

887
01:29:18,317 --> 01:29:21,047
- Hi.
- Hi.

888
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:29,757
I missed you a Lot.

889
01:29:31,230 --> 01:29:35,326
Guillermo, Alfonzo didn't
mean anything. Lt's over.

890
01:29:37,103 --> 01:29:42,837
I think if we want to,
we can fix things up.

891
01:29:44,710 --> 01:29:48,874
Why don't we start
over again, period.

892
01:32:01,647 --> 01:32:04,616
Hello. I’m here
for an interview with...

893
01:32:04,750 --> 01:32:06,615
- You're Felipe.
- Yes.

894
01:32:06,752 --> 01:32:08,310
I recognized you from
the audition tapes.

895
01:32:08,454 --> 01:32:11,389
I’m Marcia... Mark's assistant.
Follow me.

896
01:32:48,327 --> 01:32:51,421
- Hi, I’m Mark Johnson.
- Felipe NugaL.

897
01:32:52,131 --> 01:32:54,065
Have you been doing this for Long?

898
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:57,033
Quite a while.
I’m not well-known.

899
01:32:57,303 --> 01:32:59,931
I haven't done television.
Lots of theatre work.

900
01:33:00,139 --> 01:33:02,573
You had a great audition.

901
01:33:05,177 --> 01:33:09,807
The film is a co-production
between the USA and France.

902
01:33:10,216 --> 01:33:13,276
Lt's a fairly ambitious project.

903
01:33:13,452 --> 01:33:15,215
And the script...

904
01:33:16,956 --> 01:33:20,221
Lt's one of the best scripts
I’ve ever read.

905
01:33:21,527 --> 01:33:24,257
Felipe...
Are you working in theatre?

906
01:33:24,396 --> 01:33:25,988
Or doing anything that would
stop you traveling?

907
01:33:26,131 --> 01:33:28,998
