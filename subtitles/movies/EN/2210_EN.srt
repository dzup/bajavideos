1
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,106
Blockade! Blockade!

2
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,873
Are you hot, baby?

3
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:55,214
Today they do a blockade!

4
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:57,852
They could've
warned beforehand.

5
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:00,586
Foreigners come in
and see such a scene.

6
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,029
I'm not against
them protesting.

7
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:08,829
But they can go do
it somewhere else.

8
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,893
Only a car per minute
can go by...

9
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,302
and they said the flight
schedule won't change.

10
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:15,204
We'll have to go back home.

11
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:17,300
No, I'll never go back.

12
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:20,480
I'm not going back.
I'll walk.

13
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,641
It's not good for you, Nilda.

14
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:26,151
I'm not going to die.
Awalk will do us good.

15
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:28,744
Specially for you, so you
can slim that tummy.

16
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:31,254
- What about the car?
- She'll stay with the baby.

17
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:34,294
Don't leave me alone in
this mess with the baby.

18
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:36,421
Don't worry, the police is here.

19
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:38,794
They'll take care
of any problem.

20
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:41,390
Bye, honey. Take care
of the baby.

21
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:43,766
Give him something to eat
so he won't cry. Bye, honey.

22
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:47,102
I want to wear my glasses.

23
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:50,506
It's so hot.
Come on, Lito.

24
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,077
Let's go, Contreras.

25
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,713
We'll never get there.
Careful!

26
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,643
How can it be?

27
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:12,694
DON'TCLOSE THE FACTORY

28
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:35,383
Blockade, damn it!
Blockade, damn it!

29
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,851
- How does this affect you?
- What?

30
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,859
How does this blockade
affect you?

31
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:46,125
We have to take a plane.
My wife is sick.

32
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:49,566
If every factory that closes
they're going to do this

33
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,365
the government
will have to intervene.

34
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:53,871
Thank you.

35
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,948
Don't forget to cut the
power on the weekends.

36
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:10,213
And pop in Sunday noon.

37
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:15,158
Lito, he knows it by heart.
He'll do it.

38
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:18,389
- Nilda.
- What, honey?

39
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:21,262
- How do you feel?
- Fine. Fine.

40
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:25,530
You asked me 5 minutes ago.
You go first.

41
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:47,256
Go wrap the bags
with plastic.

42
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:50,626
- What for?
- Security.

43
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,790
They've got a lock.

44
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:56,130
- Go do it.
- Where is it?

45
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:58,261
I don't know.
Somewhere.

46
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,737
- I'll go with you.
- No, you stay with me.

47
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:04,174
I'm sick.
He can do it on his own.

48
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:08,872
I wanted to say something
regarding the factory.

49
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:11,751
Me too. Don't worry...

50
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:16,586
I'll be fine if you
don't do anything.

51
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,658
Sit down.

52
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:24,096
If during all this time
it went well with Lito

53
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:26,859
that means the factory
can go on by itself.

54
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,171
You'll be in charge
of the factory.

55
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:47,515
So please be responsible.

56
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:53,282
You, yourfamily, and all of
us live thanks to the factory.

57
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:57,727
Don't worry,
everything will go fine.

58
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,357
Don't look so sad.

59
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:03,527
I'm young, I've got lots
of things to do still.

60
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:07,061
I don't plan on moving yet.

61
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:13,104
Go find Lito. They might
even wrap his head.

62
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:24,181
- Everything OK?
- Yes, fine.

63
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,363
- How much is it?
- $48.

64
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,929
$48?

65
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:44,234
- $6 each.
- $48 pesos?

66
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:48,680
- $48 dollars.
- What?

67
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,340
Prices are in dollars.

68
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,543
$48 dollars?

69
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,516
What a rip off.

70
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:10,832
I hope everything's fine.
And come back soon.

71
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:14,532
Everything will be all right.
You know what you have to do.

72
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:19,567
- You do know.
- Yes, Nilda. Don't worry.

73
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:23,274
- Don't forget the small chamber.
- Yes.

74
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:28,116
And rememberthat you have
the cameras in that bag.

75
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:32,351
Anah? Wants you to film
the plane on the inside.

76
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:38,796
I'll explain again. You film
with the red button and...

77
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:42,028
You told me a thousand times.

78
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:45,229
Come on, Lito.
Forget the camera.

79
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,707
Nilda, your coat.

80
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:50,232
Your bag.

81
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,909
Bye. Bye.
Akiss to the family.

82
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,210
Send my love to yourwife.
And take care.

83
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:01,143
Carefull with the chamber.

84
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,024
- Have a good trip.
- Bye, bye.

85
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:08,118
Good luck with everything
you have to do.

86
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:10,218
Thanks. Bye.

87
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,996
Good luck. Have a good trip.

88
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:23,270
- It's almost set up.
- Wait a second.

89
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:26,277
Let me see, Lito.
Wait, wait.

90
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:28,778
You can't go out
any old way.

91
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:32,215
Hold on a second.
I'll go see the guys.

92
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:38,388
Hey, get ready overthere.
You look like a football team.

93
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:42,287
Ok. Roll it.

94
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,959
That's it.

95
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:48,159
OK. Take it easy.

96
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,502
We're at the door
of our factory.

97
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:57,905
And if you may escort me,
here we go.

98
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:06,881
THROUGH YOUR EYES

99
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,047
I'd say these machines aren't
found anywhere in the world.

100
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,816
They're fantastic.

101
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,328
And we're... wait.

102
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:20,391
Tell them to work!

103
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,696
We owe lots of money
and they're just sitting there.

104
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,396
Do something!
You get a rag.

105
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,140
And you pretend to oil
that machine.

106
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,005
Let's continue.

107
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:35,104
And here we are at
the heart of ourfactory.

108
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:41,781
This machine, as you see,
"Societ? Well, it's French.

109
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:46,723
Is from 1925.
Get a close-up.

110
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:49,386
From 1925.

111
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:53,899
My grandfather's grandfather brought
this machine. Come on, Nilda.

112
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,063
Then we have these two
enormous condensers that...

113
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:02,538
- Lito, this is no good.
- Why?

114
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:05,941
They're old. It won't
give a good impression.

115
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:09,573
- I want to show all we can.
- I don't like it.

116
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,844
- What is it, Lito?
- This won't go.

117
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:14,284
She's right.

118
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:23,125
Now I want to introduce you
to our star machine: The Rolicube.

119
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:33,036
The Rolicube which I invented
in 1983.

120
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:39,444
You have money to buy a camera
but none for salaries.

121
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:46,241
Through this computer,
we can immediately see...

122
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:52,383
the control of the three
cold storage chambers.

123
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:57,122
- Lito, two don't work.
- Why don't you shut up?

124
00:09:57,196 --> 00:10:00,097
I'm trying to sell here.
Just shut up.

125
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,469
Come here.
Give me the camera.

126
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:05,767
Here. Careful.

127
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,234
Excuse me.

128
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:13,402
Go on and sit down.

129
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:21,618
Here we have Mr. Contreras
controlling the plant.

130
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,552
Don't smile.

131
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,181
- What do I do?
- Nothing.

132
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:29,921
This is the last stage
of our ice production.

133
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,496
As you can see here...

134
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:41,439
every hour we produce
50 bags of 15 kg each.

135
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:48,070
They're packaged ain'tight
and sent to Expeditions.

136
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:54,347
Later they're prepared to be
distributed among the customers.

137
00:10:54,854 --> 00:11:00,156
As you can see this is
the invention of 1983...

138
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:03,525
for which I want to
make a toast with you now.

139
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,888
Cheers.

140
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,977
Excuse me, you can't
film here. House rules.

141
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:18,272
Excuse me, you can't
film here. House rules.

142
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,278
- Please turn it off.
- Of course.

143
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,108
You should've protested.

144
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,286
What?

145
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:31,017
- You can film.
- No, I respect rules.

146
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:40,828
- Diabetic?
- No, my wife is.

147
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,392
Sorry, but my grandmother
was diabetic.

148
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,236
We're going to get some
tests in the States...

149
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:50,901
because she has to have
a kidney transplant.

150
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:53,441
She wants to do
it in New York.

151
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,013
She'd stay and live there too.

152
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:58,812
You plan to move?

153
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:02,081
No. I said she'd like
to live there.

154
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:04,588
Me? BuenosAires
and Gardel.

155
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,214
Good.

156
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:12,924
Put that away.

157
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,835
Chicken or pasta?

158
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,599
Pasta.

159
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,675
Chicken, please.

160
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,737
Thank you.

161
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,351
Thank you very much.

162
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:44,394
Not so much.
It's bad for you.

163
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,863
Just to give it some flavor.

164
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,832
Here.

165
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:55,336
- You want everyone to know?
- Test yourself, please.

166
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:57,375
Eat it, honey.

167
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,619
Gershwin Hotel.

168
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,060
What's he saying?

169
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:28,832
He doesn't speak a word.
Give me some paper.

170
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:41,177
$48 pesos forthat
crappy plastic?

171
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:45,417
Oh, my God, please,
take it down.

172
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,622
Gershwin...

173
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,459
Just like it sounds.
Gershwin...

174
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,760
S- H...

175
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:58,463
- What is "Double U".
- W. Gershwin.

176
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:01,028
- Gershwin...
- Hotel.

177
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,905
- Hotel?
- Hotel.

178
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,636
Driver.

179
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,078
What?

180
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,688
Does he understand anything?

181
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:44,611
At last.

182
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:48,119
Rememberthe mess we went
through for our visas?

183
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,982
Anyone can get one.

184
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:56,722
Then they say this country
isn't tolerant.

185
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,259
I'm so tired.

186
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:42,869
Come on! Come on, Lito.

187
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,876
You can see later.

188
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,548
Yourwife's tough.

189
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:55,814
Let me know and we can
push her off the roof. Joking.

190
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:57,753
- Are you Argentine?
- Yes.

191
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:59,758
- Peru.
- You're Peruvian?

192
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:02,625
No, but they call me Peru.
See you.

193
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:08,992
I'll wreck it.

194
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:14,273
I love that if Americans
are into details.

195
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,104
I love that if Americans
are into details.

196
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:20,544
The brush has
a red handle

197
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:22,603
Tiles matching the curtain.

198
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,577
How embarrassing
at the freeshop today.

199
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,643
Why did they reject our card?

200
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,816
I thought the Gershwin Hotel

201
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:36,320
it's named afterthe jazz musician.

202
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:44,098
I picked it.
Since it was called "Gershwin"...

203
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:49,038
I thought there'd be music,
a concert.

204
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:54,011
Apiano in the lobby.
Did you see one?

205
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,946
After all, we are in N.Y.
Right on 5th Avenue.

206
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,612
Don't touch the fridge
It's waytoo expensive.

207
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:12,587
Did you call the bank? You pay
with the card for everything here.

208
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,862
Lito, turn that down.

209
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,196
I can't find the button.

210
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:44,089
Sorry, I didn't know
you spoke Spanish.

211
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:47,061
I could've ordered in English.

212
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:51,332
Here's a...

213
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,402
With cream.

214
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,373
Fortwo.

215
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,550
- Lito, I ordered dinner!
- What?

216
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,212
I ordered dinner.

217
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:13,025
Don't you want
to measure it first?

218
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:17,394
Get me the NPH first. I should've
applied it 5 hours ago.

219
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:28,435
It was 7 hours ago, there's
a two hour difference.

220
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,134
And you didn't want
to do it on the plane.

221
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,008
Stop worrying.

222
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,014
You're going to make
me more sick.

223
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:40,415
I ordered food:
Steak with salad

224
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:44,189
a fruit salad and
dessert for you.

225
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:46,453
Adessert for me
that you're going to eat.

226
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:50,016
You ate everything
on the plane and now this.

227
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:53,489
- It not good for you.
- Lito, dej? Est? Bien.

228
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,867
- What is it?
- Nothing.

229
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:03,199
It always happens.
It'll go away soon.

230
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:04,833
Go on.

231
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,339
Lito...

232
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:23,283
What is it?

233
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:26,483
I'm going to the bathroom.
I don't feel well.

234
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:29,822
I'm OK...

235
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,375
I can't see, Lito.

236
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:54,976
- What is it, Nilda?
- I can't see anything.

237
00:20:56,855 --> 00:21:01,224
Go get an ambulance.

238
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:05,822
Hurry, I'm blind.

239
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:21,439
Please, my wife has high
blood pressure. An ambulance.

240
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:32,554
Peru, please! Call an ambulance,
my wife's sick.

241
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:42,029
Get me my robe.
The silk one.

242
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:46,202
Don't talk.
Please, don't talk.

243
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:50,809
- You have my make-up?
- I've got everything.

244
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,300
- I can't see.
- Easy, easy.

245
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:56,279
- Is my brush here?
- Yes, it's there.

246
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:58,747
Please, don't talk.

247
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:03,345
Tell them, Lito, that
I'm Ok. This is temporary.

248
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:10,823
You don't need
to come with me.

249
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:13,558
I know you don't like
to be in an ambulance.

250
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:27,510
I don't know what
I did wrong.

251
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:31,675
We didn't eat anything.
Well, we did...

252
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:39,781
The salty peanuts,
the Coke.

253
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:43,293
- Are you here?
- I'm here.

254
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:46,455
You had the chicken.

255
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:52,295
I only had noodles
with cream.

256
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:15,484
Because I say so!
And don't say the truth!

257
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:20,489
No, I've been discharged.

258
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,937
What? Aparty at my house?
Don't you dare!

259
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:33,939
It's my house and I want
it just like I left it!

260
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:36,377
Excuse me.

261
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:41,310
I heard you speak Spanish,
and English as well.

262
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:44,685
- That's my job.
- I don't speak a word.

263
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:48,089
I teach English. I've got
my cards in the room.

264
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:52,152
My wife speaks English.
We're leaving soon anyway.

265
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:55,256
I wanted to make
a call and I don't how.

266
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,063
- You're Argentine, right?
- Yes.

267
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:01,638
I noticed because of
your shoes. Number?

268
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,301
- 42.
- Phone number.

269
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:09,474
47...

270
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:24,462
The operation went fine.
You can see her at 10.

271
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:30,259
She's just scolding me.

272
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:39,871
She's still sedated, on diuretics
and she has a cateter.

273
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:47,308
Her kidneys are not working well
so we'll to have to do a dialysis.

274
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:51,321
Please, no, not dialysis.

275
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:54,187
We came here
to get a transplant.

276
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:01,664
The transplant will have to be
done later. The dialysis can't wait.

277
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,930
If you have a insurance. How do
you expect to pay for everything?

278
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:11,440
I have an insurance
from Argentina...

279
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,570
but I don't think
it'll cover us here.

280
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:16,375
I'll pay with my credit card.

281
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:28,051
We'll transfer yourwife to dialysis
and then you'll take care of everything

282
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:30,219
with administration later.

283
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:34,490
Good luck.

284
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:38,262
Argentina.

285
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,547
Looks like they cut it last night.
It's all flooded.

286
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:54,380
I knew they'd cut the power.

287
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:56,187
First they send you a
telegram warning you...

288
00:25:56,187 --> 00:26:00,817
and then they cut it.
Seems like they enjoy it.

289
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:04,519
They're the ones with
the hole in the middle.

290
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:06,188
They melt in a second.

291
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:08,357
Plus some idiot cut it
off last night.

292
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:12,098
Isn't there automatic payment?

293
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:15,001
The bank won't give any
more credit...

294
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,234
We've been in red
for a century.

295
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:20,745
Good thing Lito went to N.Y.
If he see this he'll die.

296
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:26,079
In this heat. We could sell
the entire production in a day.

297
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:28,244
They'd be begging for more.

298
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,380
Everthought of a generator?
Chiche can get you one.

299
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:35,391
With the gas price?
How could we afford it?

300
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:37,654
He can get you the gas too.

301
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:41,662
Does Chiche have an oil
duct in his garden?

302
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:47,296
He has a friend that sucks gas
from parked cars with a hose.

303
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:53,067
Chiche says someone steals it,
but I bet he does it.

304
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:56,942
- How long would he take?
- El Chiche would take...

305
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,683
- What is it?
- Phone, from N.Y.

306
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:15,231
Hello. Lito?

307
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,801
Hello, Contreras.
How are you?

308
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:21,232
How are things overthere?
How's Nilda?

309
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:25,639
Fine. She already had her
tests done. We'll leave soon.

310
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:29,080
How are things overthere?

311
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,173
Fine.

312
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:35,514
It was more expensive than
we thought, so send money.

313
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:37,152
How much?

314
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:39,052
All you can.

315
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:43,457
I'll need a few days to collect
money from some clients.

316
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:47,726
If you have any problems,
talk to Rodriguez Ford.

317
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:50,924
- The bank manager?
- Yes.

318
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:52,559
Is it hot?

319
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:56,300
It's cooler now. But we're
running out of ice.

320
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:58,342
The temperature may go up...

321
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:00,242
Hello?

322
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:04,943
Hello? Lito?

323
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:10,377
Lito!

324
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:14,624
Should I call Chiche?

325
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:19,955
Go ahead. But I don't
want any stolen gas.

326
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,167
Is he going to steal it?

327
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:33,906
Hello.

328
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,880
I look awful.

329
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,179
You're fine.

330
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:42,713
How are you?

331
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:45,017
I'd feel better if
you didn't lie to me.

332
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:51,592
She's saying I can't
wear any make-up...

333
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:54,791
and I'm telling her
that I sleep with it on.

334
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:57,399
She's right, you just
got out of surgery.

335
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:59,494
Yes, but I'm pretty good.

336
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:02,334
And you look well.

337
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:09,137
- Could you make the call?
- Yes, thank you.

338
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:11,910
Good. Yourwife?

339
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:27,993
Excuse me.

340
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:35,168
Get me my make-up.
The red one.

341
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:38,808
Here.

342
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:47,411
There's a lighter and
a darker one.

343
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:49,810
I want the darker one.

344
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:51,081
Here.

345
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:54,454
Is it OKhere?

346
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:59,695
Excuse me.
Sorry to butt in.

347
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:04,326
I had the same problem.
I always wore make-up.

348
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:06,300
So I had this done.

349
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:09,631
Permanent make-up.
Want to see it?

350
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:11,473
Sorry!

351
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:14,670
Show him.
Look at it.

352
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:26,815
Well?

353
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,921
Lmpressive.

354
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,621
Tell me more,
so I can imagine it.

355
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:34,221
It's like a tatoo.

356
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:37,530
You can wash yourface
and it won't smear.

357
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:41,094
You can even take a shower
and you're always made up.

358
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:43,666
Sara Santamarina.

359
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:46,640
I have to sit in that?

360
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:53,139
- If you want to learn English...
- I know English.

361
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:57,578
He told me. Good luck,
nice to meet you.

362
00:30:57,655 --> 00:30:59,486
Likewise. Thank you.

363
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:10,696
Lito, call the doctor.

364
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:14,395
- What for?
- I want permanent make-up.

365
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,841
You didn't even see her.

366
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:19,569
I can imagine.
Call the doctor.

367
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:21,669
Let's make a deal.

368
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:26,443
You can have it done
if you go to dialysis.

369
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:30,544
OK. I'll have the make-up
done first, then the dialysis.

370
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:32,112
The doctorwill decide.

371
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,987
Besides, he was to do
dialysis tomorrow.

372
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,209
What's he doing?
What's he playing?

373
00:31:55,513 --> 00:32:04,785
Oh, God! He's drilling
a hole in my head!

374
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:07,984
It's the boys playing
across the street.

375
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,959
Please...

376
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:14,793
I'm going to ask for a bed
so I can lie next to you.

377
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:20,835
No, Lito.
Please, don't, Lito. What for?

378
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:23,133
You're right.

379
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:28,237
You don't need
to come tomorrow.

380
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:31,082
I'm having dialysis
in the morning.

381
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:32,947
Come in the afternoon.

382
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:36,544
Don't forget the camera.

383
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:41,851
I want you to film everything.
Everything.

384
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:46,861
I can't sit here all day
in the hospital.

385
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:50,423
I'm going to get an operation and
you won't have to go back to Bs. As.

386
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:53,362
What's the matter, Lito?

387
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:58,201
There's still some tape left.

388
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:02,613
- But we only have this cassette.
- Buy another one.

389
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:05,707
I want to film everything
to show the girls.

390
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:08,911
When I tell you to tape,
tape everything.

391
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:14,186
The streets, the stores,
parks, clothes, everything.

392
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:17,022
You can tell me and
then I can tell the girls.

393
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:19,859
I'll be your eyes.

394
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:24,260
What eyes?

395
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:30,399
Now go to the hotel,
take a hot bath

396
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:35,137
sleep all night. In the
morning, have breakfast

397
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,338
and get dressed.

398
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:41,283
Put on yourturquoise sweater.
It matches your eyes.

399
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:45,948
Your grey pants. I don't
know if we brought them.

400
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,151
And your jacket, it's cold.

401
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:54,098
And don't forget to bring
me my cologne and my bag.

402
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:57,101
Everything's on the dresser
in the room.

403
00:33:57,101 --> 00:33:58,864
Won't forget anything?

404
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:07,341
- Good night. Get some rest.
- Go on, hurry.

405
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:37,236
I...

406
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:44,476
Manhattan Gershwin Hotel

407
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:06,599
River...

408
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:08,661
Acab in the river?

409
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,909
Oh, a boat.
Manhattan.

410
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:17,747
Thank you.
See you tomorrow.

411
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:21,030
Good evening.

412
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:24,334
Hi, Gramps.

413
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:28,736
- How's yourwife?
- Better.

414
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:33,747
It's so cold.

415
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:36,781
Have a drink.

416
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:39,118
No, I quit 20 years ago.

417
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:42,249
Once I get to see some good
football and not this crap...

418
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:44,726
with the stick and the ball.

419
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:47,320
I need a favor.

420
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,369
I need to get some
tape forthe camera.

421
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:54,361
Maybe you could come
with me, since you speak...

422
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:56,370
I could pay you.

423
00:37:57,508 --> 00:37:59,738
I know a place where
they sell them cheap.

424
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:03,539
- Tomorrow?
- What time?

425
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,174
In the morning. 8?

426
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:10,246
Will it be this cold?

427
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:12,346
Colder.

428
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,297
Nilda?

429
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:39,049
I don't speak spanish.

430
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:43,113
Here's my office.

431
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,648
The rooms are in the back.
This is the living room.

432
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,180
- You sleep here?
- It's the best.

433
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:50,345
If I get bored,
I take off.

434
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:52,513
Put this on, it's cold.

435
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:00,590
Come on, Lito!

436
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:05,892
Where are you going?
There's a lot to choose from.

437
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:12,034
Hurry up.
I have to be back at 12.

438
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:21,851
Hurry up.

439
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:24,979
Come on.

440
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:55,882
Do you study English?

441
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,218
You learn by force.

442
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:03,961
When I got here, I didn't
understand a word.

443
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,630
Theytalked to me in English
and I couldn't get it.

444
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,656
It was so hard to understand.
And they started calling me Per?

445
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,856
Lito, give me some money.

446
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:04,352
Aren't you going to eat
your hamburger?

447
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:08,081
And the fries?

448
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:10,386
I can't digest fried food.

449
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:16,328
Come on. Your wife's sick,
not you. Eat something.

450
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:37,383
You like it, don't you?

451
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:43,793
Get off here, Gramps.
Don't get lost. It's two blocks away.

452
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,327
How much?

453
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,803
Shitty town.

454
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:53,175
Nilda?

455
00:46:55,846 --> 00:46:57,711
She's in dialysis.

456
00:47:07,057 --> 00:47:08,490
Nice to meet you.

457
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,692
I don't understand.

458
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:38,577
Nilda...

459
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:42,424
Died.

460
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:38,971
Do you have friends?

461
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:44,197
They send me to tell you that you have
a message from Contreras Gonzalez.

462
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:48,173
- Thank you.
- Wait.

463
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,043
How's yourwife?

464
00:50:52,649 --> 00:50:54,480
Fine.

465
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:03,019
How do you call
BuenosAires from here?

466
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:05,119
Let me help you.

467
00:51:06,963 --> 00:51:09,295
And it's so hard
to find a job.

468
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:13,359
If you fall off the train,
you can't catch it again.

469
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:18,169
Don't worry, Peti. Don't be silly.
Everything will turn out fine.

470
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:22,339
But you know me.

471
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:24,971
I always see
the glass half empty.

472
00:51:26,883 --> 00:51:29,147
Looks like they found Chiche.

473
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:32,416
Did you hear him? Chiche is
coming forthe generator.

474
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:36,323
He's in the hospital.
His stomach burst.

475
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,894
You know what he was doing?

476
00:51:38,995 --> 00:51:42,089
He used to go with
a hose and a drum...

477
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:45,566
and he stole gas from
the cars parked outside

478
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:49,537
He was getting away with it.
And this time he went to Recoleta.

479
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:53,007
It's full of security guards
in that neighborhood

480
00:51:53,076 --> 00:51:55,374
and there are cops there too.

481
00:51:55,745 --> 00:51:58,179
One of them followed him.

482
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:01,478
He put the hose in his mouth
and started sucking...

483
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:05,544
and one of the guards caught him.
He got scared and swallowed gas.

484
00:52:06,423 --> 00:52:09,359
And when he tried to run,
they shot him.

485
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,589
I told him that
the Chiche was stealing.

486
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:13,063
Chiche's an idiot.

487
00:52:13,063 --> 00:52:15,623
No, he isn't.
Cool it.

488
00:52:15,732 --> 00:52:18,701
He almost lost his life
because of the factory.

489
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:23,765
We're just down here
taking water out.

490
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:26,968
You complain all the time
and Lito's in N.Y.

491
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:32,174
The phone's ringing.
You go, it's all dark.

492
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:43,290
Contreras, Lito.

493
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,753
Lito, how's Nilda?

494
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:47,295
Fine.

495
00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:51,300
I'm about to leave the hotel.
We have some problems.

496
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:54,734
When are you sending
me the draft?

497
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:59,571
We still need the signature
from the bank manager.

498
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:01,941
Is Nilda there?
I'd like to say hello.

499
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:08,841
Hello, Lito?

500
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:12,344
He hung up.

501
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:20,226
Do you mind if I take
the towels, Gramps?

502
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:27,634
I have to leave the hotel with
the bags and go to the hospital.

503
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:31,130
How much would you charge me?

504
00:53:31,975 --> 00:53:34,273
That's no charge, Gramps.

505
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:05,370
Why don't you go
pay to save time?

506
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:08,669
- Pay?
- You can't leave without paying.

507
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:25,454
I don't understand.
Please call Peru.

508
00:54:25,795 --> 00:54:27,126
Peru.

509
00:54:37,674 --> 00:54:41,405
He says your card's been
rejected. You have to pay cash.

510
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:45,580
It's been rejected?
That's impossible.

511
00:54:45,682 --> 00:54:47,980
I reserved two days
from Buenos Aires.

512
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,860
You have to pay forthree
days plus the phone calls.

513
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:03,699
Tell him that in two days
I'll get a draft in dollars.

514
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:18,674
He says you have to pay for
your stay or he'll call the cops.

515
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:23,244
- Is he calling me a thief?
- No, a South American.

516
00:55:23,553 --> 00:55:27,614
Tell him I've always paid.
That I've always been responsible.

517
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:29,692
That I don't owe a penny.

518
00:55:36,399 --> 00:55:38,128
Wait for me outside.

519
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:47,066
Call the police, Sting,
and the whole fucking squad!

520
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:49,737
Have a little compassion!

521
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:53,645
No wonder you're
in the rut you are!

522
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,616
Run, Gramps!

523
00:56:22,946 --> 00:56:24,846
I made you lose your job.

524
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:28,516
No problem, Lito.
I've got other jobs.

525
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:32,717
Yeah, you shouldn't have only one.

526
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:35,618
Ahouse, a wife, a job.
That's no good.

527
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:39,328
You have to move. You shouldn't
settle down anywhere.

528
00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:42,328
Orthey grab you
by the balls.

529
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:45,600
If you don't believe me,
look at yourself.

530
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:49,330
- What?
- Forget it.

531
00:56:50,306 --> 00:56:53,764
I'll take you to the hospital,
you pay me

532
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:56,437
and I'll take off. OK?

533
00:56:56,579 --> 00:57:00,174
Listen. I need you
one more day.

534
00:57:00,316 --> 00:57:02,511
I'll pay you.

535
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:06,689
Come on. We just ran off
because you had no money.

536
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:09,850
Just one more day.
Please.

537
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:19,463
Money's no problem
I have a lot.

538
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:21,128
Is there a problem, Gramps?

539
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:27,173
Please explain to her
that I want them...

540
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:31,703
to permanently make
her face up.

541
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,908
Money's no object.

542
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,021
What did she say?

543
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:51,567
That the idea of permanent
make-up is to enjoy it in life.

544
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:56,503
That doesn't matter.
Permanent make-up.

545
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:10,877
She can make her up lightly.

546
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:15,414
No. No.
The permanent job.

547
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:19,929
I promised her.
It was herwish.

548
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:27,127
Sara...

549
00:58:27,203 --> 00:58:30,001
Yes, Sara Santamarina.

550
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,777
It's hard to get understood.

551
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:47,583
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I'm going to make a call.

552
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:09,373
Sara.

553
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:11,547
I don't know if you
remember me.

554
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:13,909
It's Julio Litoracci.

555
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:19,288
Nice to talk to you.

556
00:59:19,422 --> 00:59:26,385
Listen, I'd like to talk
to you in person.

557
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:31,865
Just the two of us.
Without Nilda.

558
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:34,633
Yes, I have the address.

559
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:38,040
What time?

560
00:59:38,308 --> 00:59:39,935
Lito!

561
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:42,043
Problems.

562
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:46,473
See you laterthen.
Thank you very much.

563
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:51,185
What is it?

564
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:53,381
$24.291 dollars.

565
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:57,724
$24.291 dollars?

566
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:02,828
I already paid $2.000.

567
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:04,900
Here I have $3.200.

568
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:07,936
And the day aftertomorrow
I get a draft from Argentina.

569
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:17,138
Listen.

570
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:23,850
If the make-up is so important,
pay for it and keep $200.

571
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:28,253
Meanwhile we can wait
forthe moneyfrom Bs. As.

572
01:00:32,228 --> 01:00:35,254
We can sell these.
You have to pay with something.

573
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:42,200
We can make some cash with
the jewelry plus the money...

574
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:51,637
You know her?

575
01:00:51,714 --> 01:00:53,875
No. She was stealing.

576
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:57,209
Some guys started hitting her
and cut her head open.

577
01:00:57,286 --> 01:00:59,117
I brought her
to the hospital.

578
01:01:05,194 --> 01:01:06,661
Is she coming too?

579
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:17,936
You want to go back?

580
01:02:06,823 --> 01:02:09,724
- What's that?
- Agreat meat store.

581
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,427
LooksArgentine.

582
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:15,429
It is. Come on.

583
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:28,807
Come on, Gramps.

584
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,193
Good morning, Argentina!

585
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,294
How are you, man?

586
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:57,772
Fine. How are you?

587
01:02:58,508 --> 01:03:02,069
This is a friend of mine, Lito.
Chango.

588
01:03:02,578 --> 01:03:05,513
Lito had a problem and
we need some help.

589
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,273
Martita.

590
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:11,250
How are you, Martita?

591
01:03:11,687 --> 01:03:14,019
I've been waiting for
my orderfor 2 hours.

592
01:03:14,157 --> 01:03:17,558
My van broke down.
I didn't forget.

593
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:20,363
But you remembered to put
the musician outside.

594
01:03:20,363 --> 01:03:23,025
He's a tradition.

595
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:26,469
- Did you remember my gizzard?
- Don't insult me.

596
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:29,438
My van broke down.
Here's your order.

597
01:03:30,573 --> 01:03:33,838
I added some extras.
They're delicious.

598
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:37,780
Martita, should I put
it on yourtab?

599
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:39,645
Obvio, Chango.

600
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:44,381
"Obvio, Chango."

601
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:49,586
- Did your van break down?
- No, I just forgot.

602
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:55,558
Theythink I can make
a living making sausages.

603
01:03:56,732 --> 01:03:58,597
What do you need?

604
01:04:13,549 --> 01:04:15,016
Interesting.

605
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:18,115
- Is there more?
- Like always.

606
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:22,821
I'm with a Russian girl that
can get me a few things.

607
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:26,018
You believe her?

608
01:04:26,395 --> 01:04:28,693
She's alone
and out of money.

609
01:04:28,764 --> 01:04:30,595
We can try.

610
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:34,162
Plus you need some bait
to get to the Russians.

611
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:39,075
- You have more of this?
- Yeah.

612
01:04:39,075 --> 01:04:40,440
- Where?
- In the batmobile.

613
01:04:40,509 --> 01:04:41,669
Go get it.

614
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:46,910
- What was your name?
- Lito.

615
01:04:47,683 --> 01:04:51,050
Go through that door
and come around the back.

616
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,179
- Here?
- Yes.

617
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:12,297
The mate's good.

618
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:14,840
Nilda says you should have
3 mates in the morning...

619
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:18,074
and 3 in the afternoon, and
you have no stomach problems.

620
01:05:18,948 --> 01:05:20,848
Wait a minute.

621
01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:25,754
Put it here.

622
01:05:35,831 --> 01:05:37,628
So Nilda's yourwife?

623
01:05:38,301 --> 01:05:39,996
She was.

624
01:05:43,906 --> 01:05:48,775
- I'm sorry, I didn't know.
- That's why we came.

625
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:52,210
Lito needs some cash to pay
the hospital bill.

626
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:54,949
How much does he need?

627
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:57,779
- $20.000
- What?

628
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:02,219
Let's see what you have.

629
01:06:02,658 --> 01:06:05,320
With that shitty music,
no one will come in.

630
01:06:05,761 --> 01:06:09,288
Are you Argentine or what? You
only sell me soap and towels.

631
01:06:09,899 --> 01:06:11,992
Is this your family?

632
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:15,266
Yes, my wife.

633
01:06:15,771 --> 01:06:18,365
She died two days before our
first grandchild was born.

634
01:06:20,343 --> 01:06:22,470
She's here in the cemetery.

635
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:27,874
Wait yourturn.

636
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,816
What about the Russian girl?

637
01:06:30,953 --> 01:06:35,947
I met her on the river.
On a cab.

638
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:38,320
Let's do this.

639
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:45,189
I'll give you a hand,
and you can help me too.

640
01:06:59,148 --> 01:07:01,912
I still have
some merchandise left.

641
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:04,448
I used to sell them on
the street.

642
01:07:05,054 --> 01:07:08,717
But after 9- 11 things changed
and no one wants this.

643
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:15,557
But they're tough. Talk to her
and see what you can do.

644
01:07:16,999 --> 01:07:21,629
Here. This is forthe jewelry.

645
01:07:22,238 --> 01:07:25,207
But if you give me a hand
with this, there's more.

646
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:51,325
- Ready.
- Ready?

647
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:55,494
- You have a place to stay?
- My batmobile.

648
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:57,698
You're kidding, Peru.

649
01:07:58,107 --> 01:08:00,541
I'd take you home, Lito,
but with 3 grandchildren...

650
01:08:00,609 --> 01:08:02,474
there's no place to breathe.

651
01:08:05,448 --> 01:08:07,780
- Is this far?
- Let's see.

652
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:11,075
No.

653
01:08:37,246 --> 01:08:39,305
I'm Lito Litoracci.

654
01:08:39,381 --> 01:08:41,906
I'd like to see Sara Santamarina.

655
01:08:54,864 --> 01:08:56,525
Lito!

656
01:08:57,166 --> 01:09:00,602
What a surprise!
I'm glad you came.

657
01:09:01,003 --> 01:09:04,063
Welcome! Come in.

658
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,471
Excuse me.

659
01:09:10,412 --> 01:09:12,039
You take care of her.

660
01:09:16,285 --> 01:09:18,651
First, his name is Ricardo.

661
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:21,849
Second, he understands
everything I say...

662
01:09:21,924 --> 01:09:24,484
and like you, he doesn't
want to speak Spanish.

663
01:09:27,463 --> 01:09:30,057
Sorry, Lito. Come in.

664
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:36,670
Just a minute.

665
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:41,768
Please, sit down.

666
01:09:44,413 --> 01:09:46,711
I'm about to finish my class.

667
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:49,184
Excuse me. Let's continue.

668
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,448
What were we saying, Paco?

669
01:09:55,224 --> 01:09:58,159
Acomplete sentence.

670
01:10:02,097 --> 01:10:03,530
Very good.

671
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:09,037
Everybody.

672
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:13,038
Again.

673
01:10:39,168 --> 01:10:42,331
- Have some.
- I don't drink alcohol.

674
01:10:42,838 --> 01:10:47,172
The best coffee in the world.
Puerto Rican coffee.

675
01:10:47,276 --> 01:10:51,645
The coffee the Pope used to drink.
And this is aged rum.

676
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:57,181
- Since I don't drink alcohol...
- You can't reject my rum.

677
01:10:57,419 --> 01:10:59,046
OK.

678
01:10:59,722 --> 01:11:01,485
What were you saying?

679
01:11:01,991 --> 01:11:09,193
With Nilda, we spoke about
the permanent make-up.

680
01:11:09,565 --> 01:11:14,832
Since she saw yours.
That's why I came.

681
01:11:15,137 --> 01:11:17,401
You want to see my
permanent make-up?

682
01:11:18,007 --> 01:11:20,703
Let's begin with the brows.

683
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:24,507
Then the lips.

684
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:30,949
First this side.
It's my best side.

685
01:11:32,554 --> 01:11:34,488
Do I look all right?

686
01:11:35,357 --> 01:11:37,154
Perfect.

687
01:11:37,226 --> 01:11:40,195
I can't believe you're
doing all this for Nilda.

688
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:44,561
Whatever Nilda says,
it's an order.

689
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:47,935
Some women have all the luck.

690
01:11:48,904 --> 01:11:51,707
I'm so glad you're
staying for dinner.

691
01:11:51,707 --> 01:11:54,107
Your company makes
me feel so good.

692
01:11:54,176 --> 01:11:58,875
I'm going to make a dish
specially for you.

693
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:03,109
It gets cold in New York.

694
01:12:04,386 --> 01:12:06,718
And I make ice.

695
01:12:08,691 --> 01:12:11,125
I feel it most
in my hands.

696
01:12:11,193 --> 01:12:12,922
Don't you have gloves?

697
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:16,195
I haven't had time
to buy any.

698
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:18,664
I have a pain'to give you.

699
01:12:19,134 --> 01:12:22,968
But it's so cold out,
you can sleep over.

700
01:12:23,038 --> 01:12:25,734
I have a spare room
you can use.

701
01:12:28,777 --> 01:12:32,474
And underneath,
as you may see

702
01:12:32,548 --> 01:12:39,954
there's a knife that cuts the ice
which falls into the tray...

703
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:44,118
and then the cubes are
bagged for distribution.

704
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:46,286
So you sell ice cubes.

705
01:12:47,129 --> 01:12:52,123
Aspecial kind, because
there are manytypes.

706
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:57,764
I make round ones with
a hole in the middle.

707
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:05,207
- Did you like the food?
- Very much.

708
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,976
I hope you're not hungry.

709
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:12,617
I only cook for myself.

710
01:13:13,255 --> 01:13:15,189
Not for your daughter?

711
01:13:15,257 --> 01:13:18,852
- She eats with herfather.
- I wish I knew where he was.

712
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:22,522
She says that eating here
depresses her.

713
01:13:23,098 --> 01:13:25,589
It's the best meal I've
had in New York.

714
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:26,725
Thank you.

715
01:13:26,869 --> 01:13:30,737
See? That's the last stage
of the production.

716
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:36,606
This is the ice we
can produce...

717
01:13:36,678 --> 01:13:39,579
and which we want
to export.

718
01:13:39,715 --> 01:13:43,549
That way we can create more
jobs, more production

719
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:45,587
and get a better result
for the country.

720
01:13:45,654 --> 01:13:48,384
We can export to many countries.

721
01:13:48,490 --> 01:13:51,584
We have our eyes set on China.

722
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:54,388
There are over 1 billion
inhabitants.

723
01:13:54,663 --> 01:13:56,927
There aren't enough cows
in Argentina...

724
01:13:57,032 --> 01:14:00,335
to feed the Chinese
people one day.

725
01:14:00,335 --> 01:14:08,606
That's whywe decided to offer
our actions to everybody.

726
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:12,669
You, for example, could
buy actions.

727
01:14:13,048 --> 01:14:14,777
Lito...

728
01:14:15,584 --> 01:14:19,953
- Do you like coco pudding?
- Yes.

729
01:16:05,727 --> 01:16:07,490
Lito...

730
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:09,696
Is it OK?

731
01:16:10,832 --> 01:16:13,699
If it has a wrinkle,
I can't sleep.

732
01:16:18,006 --> 01:16:19,530
Thanks.

733
01:16:32,354 --> 01:16:36,654
Thanks for cheering up my meal.
I haven't had the in a while.

734
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:44,760
- Nilda used to like to cook.
- She doesn't cook any more?

735
01:16:46,835 --> 01:16:48,735
No.

736
01:16:50,005 --> 01:16:52,098
Some women don't know
what they have.

737
01:17:07,222 --> 01:17:08,780
Good night.

738
01:18:05,414 --> 01:18:06,938
Lito.

739
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:10,718
You're going to scare me
to death. You disappeared.

740
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:14,518
You don't have to worry.

741
01:18:14,856 --> 01:18:17,051
If you hire me,
I worry about you.

742
01:18:20,595 --> 01:18:22,119
Did you sleep here?

743
01:18:33,842 --> 01:18:38,211
She says they're finishing
the cosmetic surgery.

744
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,609
No, no.

745
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:47,917
I taped Sara Santamarina's
face so they could copy it.

746
01:19:20,522 --> 01:19:22,649
You can see her, Lito.

747
01:19:34,035 --> 01:19:35,900
Go on.

748
01:19:36,671 --> 01:19:40,038
- I can't do it.
- Neither can I.

749
01:19:40,108 --> 01:19:42,872
- I'll pay you.
- No, Lito.

750
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:45,579
- Here.
- Money doesn't matter.

751
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:48,112
Don't do this to me.

752
01:19:53,822 --> 01:19:55,847
He speaks Spanish.

753
01:19:57,993 --> 01:19:59,654
Hello. Take a seat.

754
01:20:40,602 --> 01:20:43,435
Nilda, with God.

755
01:20:58,286 --> 01:20:59,776
Here you are.

756
01:21:03,925 --> 01:21:05,620
I have to go.

757
01:21:12,767 --> 01:21:16,100
She says you have to sign
some papers and wait a while.

758
01:21:18,974 --> 01:21:22,933
I'm going with the Russian girl
to sell Chango's stuff.

759
01:21:34,055 --> 01:21:35,579
Come on, Gramps.

760
01:21:37,225 --> 01:21:39,159
Four eyes see more than two.

761
01:22:28,343 --> 01:22:30,368
Sleep well last night, Gramps?

762
01:22:32,547 --> 01:22:37,314
- How did you guys sleep?
- Fine. Why?

763
01:22:38,219 --> 01:22:42,553
- Since the car's small.
- You find ways.

764
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:46,988
You came directly
to the hospital?

765
01:22:47,262 --> 01:22:50,789
We slept and came
directly here.

766
01:22:51,232 --> 01:22:55,328
Why the questions? You want
to know if I fed her?

767
01:22:55,403 --> 01:22:57,234
I'm just asking.

768
01:22:57,305 --> 01:23:01,071
I'm not yourfather and
I don't want to be.

769
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:04,403
You're adults and you
know what to do.

770
01:23:04,512 --> 01:23:06,571
We're adults and you
sound like a child.

771
01:23:09,918 --> 01:23:13,684
- Why are you angry?
- I'm not.

772
01:23:14,622 --> 01:23:17,716
You aren't?
Why the face?

773
01:25:19,881 --> 01:25:21,781
Hey!

774
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:23,881
Somebody's there.

775
01:25:28,356 --> 01:25:29,345
What are they doing?

776
01:25:31,326 --> 01:25:33,624
It's Chango's box.
Damn you, asshole!

777
01:25:37,031 --> 01:25:38,794
They took everything!

778
01:25:41,336 --> 01:25:44,237
Son of a bitch!
What a son of a bitch!

779
01:25:44,339 --> 01:25:46,933
She's a bitch!
Damn you, old man!

780
01:25:51,579 --> 01:25:54,548
I was ripped off
because of you!

781
01:25:55,316 --> 01:25:58,444
What a damn bitch.
Was I screwed!

782
01:28:04,712 --> 01:28:07,078
You can tell me and
then I can tell the girls.

783
01:28:07,181 --> 01:28:09,581
I'll be your eyes.

784
01:28:11,219 --> 01:28:13,414
What eyes?

785
01:28:14,589 --> 01:28:18,355
Now go to the hotel,
take a hot bath,

786
01:28:18,459 --> 01:28:23,328
sleep all night. In the
morning, have breakfast,

787
01:28:23,398 --> 01:28:25,730
and get dressed.

788
01:28:25,833 --> 01:28:30,099
Put on yourturquoise sweater.
It matches your eyes.

789
01:28:30,538 --> 01:28:33,063
Your grey pants. I don't
know if we brought them.

790
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:35,803
And your jacket, it's cold.

791
01:29:04,572 --> 01:29:09,669
You want to go home
and take a shower?

792
01:29:09,777 --> 01:29:13,907
What can I do?
Let the factory fall apart?

793
01:29:14,015 --> 01:29:17,542
How are you, Chiche?

794
01:29:17,618 --> 01:29:20,746
It hurts when I yawn,
but I'm OK.

795
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:24,051
What do you want?

796
01:29:24,125 --> 01:29:27,424
Don't tell me you
want your salary.

797
01:29:28,563 --> 01:29:31,555
What are you doing?
That's Lito's office.

798
01:29:31,632 --> 01:29:35,193
Get out of there.
Take yourfeet off.

799
01:29:35,303 --> 01:29:38,602
What do you want?

800
01:29:38,706 --> 01:29:41,766
This isn't handled
so easily.

801
01:29:41,843 --> 01:29:44,641
You're not doing so well,
Contreras.

802
01:29:45,313 --> 01:29:47,679
We haven't been
paid in 2 months.

803
01:29:47,749 --> 01:29:48,977
Next month...

804
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:52,986
Looks like we won't get
paid next month either.

805
01:29:53,421 --> 01:29:55,719
So what? You're
going on strike?

806
01:29:56,657 --> 01:30:00,962
When Lito gets back,
you talk to him.

807
01:30:00,962 --> 01:30:05,023
We've talked it over and
we'll decide in a meeting.

808
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:12,335
- Hello.
- Contreras?

809
01:30:12,407 --> 01:30:14,238
It's Lito.

810
01:30:15,176 --> 01:30:18,145
How are things overthere?

811
01:30:18,746 --> 01:30:21,408
Listen, I only have
a couple of coins.

812
01:30:21,482 --> 01:30:24,610
You know when
you're coming back?

813
01:30:24,685 --> 01:30:28,416
The draft didn't get here.
Send me some money.

814
01:30:28,489 --> 01:30:31,925
I'm on it.
How's Nilda?

815
01:30:34,195 --> 01:30:38,131
Nilda... She died.

816
01:30:40,034 --> 01:30:41,661
She died?

817
01:30:46,340 --> 01:30:49,901
What do you mean?
It can't be.

818
01:30:49,977 --> 01:30:55,472
I'll explain later. Please send
me some money, I'm stranded.

819
01:30:57,618 --> 01:31:00,086
Things aren't well here.

820
01:31:00,755 --> 01:31:05,920
We're doing what we can,
but there's no money.

821
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:10,326
- Put a mortgage on the house.
- We already did.

822
01:31:11,799 --> 01:31:15,530
Send me something, please.
Hello?

823
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:51,328
Polaco told me Peru
would screw me. And he did.

824
01:31:51,939 --> 01:31:54,134
And he screwed you too.

825
01:31:57,111 --> 01:31:58,806
What about yourwife, Lito?

826
01:32:03,918 --> 01:32:05,783
She's in the morgue.

827
01:32:06,888 --> 01:32:12,690
The nurse, Greta, told me
if there was someone...

828
01:32:13,828 --> 01:32:17,025
Orthey'll send herto
the university and...

829
01:32:18,032 --> 01:32:20,660
Don't worry about the money.

830
01:32:21,969 --> 01:32:24,563
You can pay me back
some other day.

831
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:28,700
I'll accept it, and I'll
pay you back for sure.

832
01:32:28,776 --> 01:32:30,505
It's not that.

833
01:32:32,113 --> 01:32:34,604
What else can
I help you with?

834
01:32:46,794 --> 01:32:48,694
Is that truck yours?

835
01:32:51,933 --> 01:32:53,867
This is crazy.

836
01:32:55,469 --> 01:32:58,063
What if the police stops us?
What do we say?

837
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:24,891
Want to see her?

838
01:33:56,297 --> 01:33:59,460
- I don't know how to thank you.
- It's nothing.

839
01:34:58,993 --> 01:35:00,661
It's OK. Come on, let's go.

840
01:35:00,661 --> 01:35:02,595
God be with you.

841
01:35:02,930 --> 01:35:04,557
Staywith God.

842
01:35:04,832 --> 01:35:06,163
Where?

843
01:35:08,536 --> 01:35:10,436
The second door, Lito.

844
01:35:10,671 --> 01:35:12,605
That one, open it.

845
01:36:30,684 --> 01:36:32,584
Lito, you want to say something?

846
01:36:38,159 --> 01:36:39,786
Nilda...

847
01:36:43,330 --> 01:36:45,195
You're in New York...

848
01:36:47,401 --> 01:36:49,369
where you wanted to be.
