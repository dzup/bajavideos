1
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,584
Juan, get up.

2
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:24,751
Juan.

3
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:31,842
Get dressed.

4
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:45,731
Taxi!

5
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,107
Taxi!

6
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:30,567
Yes?

7
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,445
- Who is it?
- Pilar.

8
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,128
Pilar, come in.

9
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,216
Are you okay?
What's wrong?

10
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:01,139
- I'm still wearing my slippers.
- What?

11
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:06,019
I'm so stupid...
still wearing my slippers.

12
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,397
It doesn't matter.

13
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:10,107
I didn't notice.

14
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:18,657
TAKE MY EYES

15
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:24,288
Stay with us a few days
till you feel better.

16
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,749
I didn't bring much of our stuff.

17
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,335
I'll go get whatever you need.

18
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,258
I haven't told Antonio.

19
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,428
Well, I'll tell him
whatever you want.

20
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:43,015
That I'm glad to have you
for a few days.

21
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:46,351
We never see each other.
You can help me get things ready.

22
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,020
Ready for what?

23
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:51,064
The wedding.
John and I are getting married.

24
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:58,864
Silly! If I thought you'd take it
like that I wouldn't have toldyou.

25
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:01,867
- Have you told Mom yet?
- I will.

26
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:13,730
HOSPITAL RECORDS

27
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,335
Pilar!

28
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,005
Pilar, are you there?

29
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,508
Listen, Shorty.

30
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,343
This place is a mess.

31
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,346
Wanna go out?

32
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,765
Get something to eat?

33
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,684
Okay, Shorty?

34
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:54,813
What the hell do you want?

35
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:58,984
I need my sister's things.
She's staying with me.

36
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:01,862
Staying with you?
Bullshit!

37
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,948
Tell Pilar to cut the crap
and come home.

38
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,284
She's not coming back.

39
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:09,995
Get out.

40
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:11,371
- I'm not finished.
- Get out!

41
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,598
- Can I help?
- Sure.

42
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:48,784
Juan.

43
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,287
Would you like to stay here?

44
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:56,333
- Forhowlong?
- A little while.

45
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,127
You could skip
your English lessons.

46
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,755
John can teach you.
It'll be more fun.

47
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:08,512
Do you love Dad?

48
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:13,225
Of course I love him,Juan.

49
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,437
Iwant to see him.

50
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:22,234
Okay.

51
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,377
- I'll be right back.
- Want me to go with you?

52
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,504
That's okay.

53
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,694
Antonio. It's Pilar.

54
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:21,668
Pilar!

55
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:24,880
Pilar!

56
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:26,381
Pilar!

57
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,176
Fucking hell, Pilar.

58
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:33,263
You can't do this to me.
You left without afuckingword!

59
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,183
- Don't yell,Antonio.
- Then open the door, dammit!

60
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:38,352
Pilar!

61
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:40,938
Open the door.

62
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,440
Open the door, Pilar.

63
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:47,861
I'm not leaving
till you let me in.

64
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:50,781
Pilar! You hearme?

65
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,251
Cut the crap, let's go for coffee.
Come on.

66
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,213
Dammit, Pilar.

67
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,756
Open the door.

68
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,052
We'll get some coffee.
Andtalk.

69
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,814
I brought you this.

70
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,233
Just a silly little thing.

71
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,367
You like it?

72
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:45,502
How's Juan?

73
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:48,380
He's fine.

74
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:50,757
He wants to see you.

75
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,760
So get him and let's go home.

76
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,514
Pilar, dammit.

77
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:00,601
I'm going to change.
I swearl will.

78
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:03,187
I'll do anything you say.

79
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:04,688
You already know.

80
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,192
- You already know.
- I'll surprise you, I swear.

81
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:11,945
Shorty, I swear. I'll surprise you.
Get Juan and let's go home.

82
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,704
Okay. Hey, hey...

83
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:22,164
Shorty.

84
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:26,835
Don't you love me anymore?

85
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:33,550
Come on, Shorty.

86
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:36,595
I'm scared.

87
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,932
I'm... scared.

88
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:41,850
I'm sorry.

89
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:45,646
I'm sorry, forgive me.
I'm sorry.

90
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:50,609
Okay. You're my sunshine.
I can't live without you, Shorty.

91
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:54,905
Hey, come on, Pilar.

92
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:56,990
Look at me.

93
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:59,034
Look at me, Pilar.

94
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:00,911
Open the door.

95
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:03,163
Open the door.

96
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:04,748
Open the door.

97
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,502
Dammit, Pilar!
Open the door!

98
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,135
No, I'm glad.

99
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,263
Don't get me wrong.

100
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:21,974
I just want to know one thing.

101
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:26,520
Are you planning a proper wedding
or just any old thing?

102
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:29,690
Just any old thing?
- A civil ceremony.

103
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,692
Then yes, just any old thing.

104
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,945
Ana, didn't you say
John was Catholic?

105
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:36,071
No, he's Protestant.

106
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:39,658
Couldn't you be married
in a church anyway?

107
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,413
Here, honey.

108
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:03,974
Pilar.

109
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:05,267
What?

110
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,353
I saw the hospital records.

111
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:13,483
Pilar,why do you put up with it?

112
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,404
Why don't you get a separation?
Shall we see a lawyer?

113
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:19,823
No.

114
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,784
Want to stay with us
tillyoufigure things out?

115
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,206
Your place is small.
I'd be in the way.

116
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,416
You're not in the way, Pilar.

117
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,586
What will I live on?

118
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:34,421
Air?

119
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:38,926
At Santo Tome they need
a substitute. I could mention you.

120
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:44,014
- I haven't had a job in ages.
- All the more reason.

121
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,727
What will Antonio do?

122
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:51,772
Antonio can go screw himself.

123
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:00,531
Listen, John.

124
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:04,451
I've been thinking
about the wedding...

125
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,078
Where will you be buried?

126
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:08,121
Sorry?

127
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:12,209
Well, you can see
this isn't very big.

128
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:17,172
I suppose when your time comes,
you'll want to be with your family.

129
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,716
Oh, no!
I just saw them at Christmas.

130
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:25,430
Right, but what I mean is...
I've bought

131
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:29,059
a burial policy for the girls.
If Ana moves to Scotland,

132
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:31,728
her place is still here.

133
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:34,481
Grandma, where will I be buried?

134
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,276
Right here with us.
Where else, dear?

135
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:07,306
Hi.

136
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:10,225
Go ahead,
I'll be right over.

137
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:12,728
- That way?
- Right, that way.

138
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:15,439
Straight tillthe end.
I'll be down in aminute.

139
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:56,396
She just realized she left home
in her slippers.

140
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,153
How are you, Ana?

141
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,240
You must be Pilar.
How do you do?

142
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:08,200
- How do you do.
- Have a seat.

143
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:14,456
The job has morning and evening
hours. Just work experience.

144
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:15,582
Not much, really.

145
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:16,917
It's just fine.

146
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:19,545
- It's to cover someone on leave.
- Perfect.

147
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,046
Perfect.

148
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:22,381
Okay?

149
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:36,270
- What about after school?
- Ana picks me up

150
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:37,980
and I do my homework with John.

151
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:40,107
What about yourmother?

152
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,234
She works at a church.

153
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:46,071
What do you mean, works?
At what church?

154
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:48,532
One with apainting.

155
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:50,033
A painting?

156
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:51,702
Yeah, by El Greco.

157
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,208
- She sells tickets to see it.
- What did she tell you?

158
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:00,627
That this is permanent?

159
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,087
I don't know.

160
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:06,800
But what did she say?

161
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,971
I'm asking you a question.

162
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,684
Did she say
we were going to separate?

163
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,227
Is that what she said?

164
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,062
What did she tell you?

165
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:22,941
Nothing.

166
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,236
Juan, come here.

167
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:31,116
Look me in the eye.

168
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:33,744
A man who lies is what?

169
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:36,371
A worthless shit.

170
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:40,334
Is your mother seeing anyone?

171
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:43,420
I don't know.

172
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:55,891
Historical records describe El Greco
as a flamboyant,

173
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:57,017
rebellious,

174
00:16:57,226 --> 00:17:00,229
mystical man who traveled
all around the Mediterranean.

175
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:02,356
From his native Greece

176
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:04,858
he first went to Italy,
where he learned

177
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:07,194
this use of color

178
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:11,823
and composition from the Venetian
painters. Laterhe arrived

179
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:17,788
in Spain, the source of his realism,
sorrow, tortured postures...

180
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:20,833
Darker, more somber, grayer...

181
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:23,377
In fact, the painting
is divided into two parts.

182
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:25,462
The Italian influence above...

183
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:28,006
Pilar, there's a group
at the door.

184
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:35,848
You all want tickets?
That makes...

185
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,015
Nine.

186
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:39,810
- How much are they?
- This?

187
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:41,603
Two. Six euros, please.

188
00:17:41,812 --> 00:17:44,857
- And the pencils?
- That's... two.

189
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:49,236
- But this one's cheaper.
- It's the same as the otherone.

190
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:52,072
Yes, but it's not
the American "no-frost" kind.

191
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,282
Antonio.

192
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:54,825
Coming.

193
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:57,035
- Anything else?
- You said ovens.

194
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:58,745
Right, show us the ovens.

195
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:00,164
And the refrigerator?

196
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:01,874
It's very expensive.

197
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:03,834
All right, I'll be right over.

198
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:05,085
Antonio!

199
00:18:05,294 --> 00:18:07,087
Washing machines.
The micros.

200
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:19,141
Oh, I forgot.
Someone left this here for you.

201
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,476
- For me?
- An admirer.

202
00:18:21,894 --> 00:18:24,855
- Who brought it?
- I don't know, a guy.

203
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:29,443
A messenger?

204
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,320
No, I don't think so.

205
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:41,205
How did the morning go?

206
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:43,332
- Fine.
- I want you to meet these...

207
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,877
barely presentable ladies. Carmen,
from Santa Cruz and Raquel...

208
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:49,087
- Nice to meet you.
- What's up?

209
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:52,299
- Want to join us for lunch?
- I don't know.

210
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:53,800
Were you going somewhere?

211
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:56,595
- Yeah, to get something to eat.
- Then join us.

212
00:18:56,762 --> 00:18:59,181
- Let's try Angel's place.
- That's where we usually go.

213
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:01,934
- It's really good.
- Don't order gazpacho again...

214
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:11,818
Where's your sister?

215
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,070
- Outside.
- Outside?

216
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:14,821
Look what I brought you.

217
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,448
Where should we hang it?

218
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:17,908
Over there?

219
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:20,160
Help me, honey.

220
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,704
Here.

221
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:25,207
So it doesn't drag on the floor.

222
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,584
I've had it dry-cleaned

223
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:29,920
and I don't want it
to get dirty.

224
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:31,797
There it is.

225
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:35,467
Look.
It's so pretty, isn't it?

226
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:36,969
And it's still in fashion.

227
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:39,012
These dresses always are.

228
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:41,849
You're plumper than your sister was,
but it won't show.

229
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:44,476
You expect me to wear that dress?

230
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:48,438
Go a head, try it on.
Let's see how it fits.

231
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:50,983
- No, Mom.
- Why not? It's lovely.

232
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:54,319
- I don't like it.
- Listen, Ana.

233
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:57,322
Since the ceremony
isn't what it should be,

234
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:59,783
at least get some
decent pictures taken.

235
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:01,326
Something pretty to remember.

236
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:03,453
No, Mom.
Not in that horrible thing.

237
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:08,375
I'm sorry, Pilar. It's very pretty
but it's not my scene.

238
00:20:08,584 --> 00:20:10,210
Scene? What scene?

239
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:12,880
Don't you remember
how pretty Pilar was?

240
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:15,132
So small, so excited and hopeful...

241
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:19,219
Now, now, don't be sad.

242
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:22,931
You should work things out
with Antonio

243
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,474
- and go home.
- Bullshit.

244
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:27,853
She should get a separation
and a restraining order.

245
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,730
- That's what she should do.
- Don't talk rubbish.

246
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:30,939
I'm not, you are.

247
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:33,692
When a woman runs away from home,

248
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:36,111
maybe she's better off alone.

249
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:38,655
A woman is never better off alone.

250
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:40,782
You don't understand.

251
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:43,368
How do you know what goes on
between Pilar and Antonio?

252
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:45,913
I do. You're the one
who doesn't know,

253
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:47,539
or doesn't want to.

254
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:49,875
Tell her, Pilar.

255
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:52,044
Go on, tell us about it.

256
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:54,463
All the "falls"
in the hospital records?

257
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:58,383
How often do you fall
down the stairs? Well?

258
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:00,969
Don't you look where you're going?

259
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:04,973
Leave your sister alone.
She knows what's best.

260
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,226
Either try the dress on...

261
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:08,894
or I'll take it back.

262
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:11,313
Why won't you talk about it?

263
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:14,983
Before it's too late for us to help.

264
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:16,151
Leave her alone, dammit!

265
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,362
Nobody asked you.

266
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:21,823
All those cases of tendonitis,
torn muscles...

267
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,367
loss of vision in one eye...

268
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:25,786
that bastard even kicked her
in the kidney.

269
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:27,913
- Shut up, Ana!
- Both of you shut up!

270
00:21:32,668 --> 00:21:34,753
- Come on, dear.
- Don't touch me, Mom.

271
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:49,935
Okay, let's see, Javier.

272
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:53,814
- Why do you say your wife is crazy?
- Because she's hysterical.

273
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,066
She can't do anything right.

274
00:21:56,984 --> 00:21:59,528
Now she's going around
saying I beat her.

275
00:21:59,695 --> 00:22:02,197
Stuff like that.
Well, I shoved her

276
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:05,951
a few times but hey,
that's not beating.

277
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:07,786
That's how it is

278
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:11,165
with all couples, isn't it?
Occasional friction is common.

279
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:15,043
What, she doesn't give you enough
reasons? Mine gives me plenty.

280
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:19,006
That's exactly why... She provokes
me just so I'll beat her.

281
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:22,843
Women have lots of ways
to drive you totally nuts.

282
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,053
For instance,
I work in construction.

283
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,390
Shit, you get home tired,
working hard to make a living...

284
00:22:28,557 --> 00:22:30,267
for your family, your wife...

285
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:32,936
for everything, for God's sake.
You get home,

286
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:37,441
you want a little affection...
Well, really you want sex...

287
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:39,443
a husband deserves that...

288
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,403
- and the bitch...
- Pulls away from you.

289
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,281
Pulls away?
I wake her up and say "Hi, honey... "

290
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:45,574
and she pulls away.

291
00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:47,284
I get so fucking mad.

292
00:22:47,493 --> 00:22:52,414
- That's no reason to beat a woman.
- Not that. But you end up doing it.

293
00:22:52,623 --> 00:22:54,583
Does it solve the problem?

294
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,960
Maybe not,
but after a good slap

295
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:59,338
- she calms right down.
- I'm not so sure.

296
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:01,423
Well, I am. Fuck yes.

297
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:05,511
I don't care if she loves or hates
me. As long as she doesn't bug me.

298
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:07,638
Okay, just a minute, look.

299
00:23:08,597 --> 00:23:10,307
I want you to meet Julian.

300
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:14,478
He was here with us
two years ago.

301
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:17,314
That's right, two years ago.

302
00:23:17,481 --> 00:23:21,151
And kind of like you guys,
I thought all this was just normal.

303
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,238
It was kind of easy,
just no big deal.

304
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:28,492
I even liked it. She showed me
respect and kept quiet.

305
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,663
I thought she was in awe of me.
I felt more confident at home.

306
00:23:34,248 --> 00:23:37,000
Until I realized
that it's not right.

307
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:40,462
She was really suffering,
terrified everytime I came home.

308
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:43,882
- I had erased her personality.
- You had no reason to hit her.

309
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,385
What reasons are there?

310
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,719
Did she provoke you?

311
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:49,680
Maybe I provoked myself.

312
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:53,851
Anyway, it was one of those nights.

313
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:56,895
You go out, come home
a little wilder than usual...

314
00:23:57,396 --> 00:23:58,605
So I lost it.

315
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:00,983
Well, I lost it and...

316
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:04,111
then,well...

317
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:08,866
I knocked her out. I mean...

318
00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:11,910
I thought she was dead.

319
00:24:14,204 --> 00:24:15,747
She looked dead...

320
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,499
And that kind of...

321
00:24:20,002 --> 00:24:22,045
wakes you up, you know?

322
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:16,141
He said he couldn't wait.

323
00:25:37,496 --> 00:25:41,625
I'M IN THERAPY.
WHEN WILL YOU SEE REASON?

324
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:44,837
He's really hung up on you.
Do you know who he is?

325
00:25:45,754 --> 00:25:48,340
- Yes. My husband.
- Awesome!

326
00:25:51,385 --> 00:25:52,553
He must really love you.

327
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:07,025
- Rosa, a beer?
- No, no.

328
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,944
- How are you, Angel?
- And you, Pilar?

329
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:11,238
Three beers and a glass of juice.

330
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:15,742
- How's your sister?
- Fine. With her Scot, very happy.

331
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:17,536
- Who's happy?
- My sister.

332
00:26:17,703 --> 00:26:21,373
- Really? Why?
- He's marvelous. You don't know him?

333
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:24,585
- No. Is he marvelous?
- Yes, he is.

334
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:27,546
He makes breakfast,
clears the table, goes shopping,

335
00:26:27,713 --> 00:26:29,590
makes supper, does the dishes...

336
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:32,801
That's not a Scot.
That's an extraterrestrial, right?

337
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:36,680
And she gets to learn English
while she fucks. It's not fair,

338
00:26:36,889 --> 00:26:37,848
I want one too!

339
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:41,560
- Then go to Scotland.
- We're going to Scotland, kid.

340
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:45,689
- You'd strike out even in Scotland.
- Look who's talking!

341
00:26:45,856 --> 00:26:48,400
- Come on.
- Did you see your guy?

342
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:50,360
- I did.
- Well?

343
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:52,404
- Is he cute?
- Good enough to eat?

344
00:26:52,613 --> 00:26:54,490
What is he, a sausage?

345
00:26:55,699 --> 00:26:56,867
They've been chatting

346
00:26:57,034 --> 00:27:00,078
for ages,
but we don't know who he is.

347
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:03,207
- That's great.
- I met a guy on the Internet.

348
00:27:03,499 --> 00:27:07,002
We chatted for a month and a half,
and guess how old he was?

349
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:09,505
- Thirteen.
- No!

350
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:12,132
Yes. He said he was 26
the bastard.

351
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:14,718
- How old did you say youwere?
- That's not the point.

352
00:27:17,638 --> 00:27:21,642
When we get violent, physically,
what do we feel?

353
00:27:22,184 --> 00:27:24,061
You start burning.

354
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:27,105
- You boil over...
- Very good, heat.

355
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:30,317
- Something just gets going here...
- Exactly.

356
00:27:30,484 --> 00:27:34,404
Now we've got some signs that help
us recognize rage when we feel it.

357
00:27:34,947 --> 00:27:38,200
We're beginning to recognize rage,
but we don't know

358
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:41,370
how to control it yet,
so what do we do

359
00:27:41,954 --> 00:27:44,164
to avoid a violent situation?

360
00:27:44,373 --> 00:27:46,083
- Time out.
- Time what?

361
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:47,835
- Time out. Leave the house.
- Exactly.

362
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:49,169
What's that?

363
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:51,672
Julian knows.
We stop right there. We leave.

364
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,842
We walk out.
And once we're out,

365
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,426
we look for a distraction.

366
00:27:57,052 --> 00:27:58,929
We think about something else.

367
00:27:59,137 --> 00:28:01,557
- Yeah, beer and stuff.
- No, no props allowed.

368
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:03,141
You have to do it alone.

369
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:05,644
I'd like you to think of a time

370
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:07,813
you felt peaceful,
that you enjoyed...

371
00:28:08,272 --> 00:28:09,815
In my little town in the summer.

372
00:28:10,524 --> 00:28:13,569
At night out in the yard
under the grape trellis.

373
00:28:14,111 --> 00:28:16,780
- Listening to classical music.
- No.

374
00:28:16,947 --> 00:28:18,782
Just the night,
the grapevines and me.

375
00:28:22,244 --> 00:28:24,872
- Fishing out on the open sea.
- Wow, how nice.

376
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:27,875
Antonio?

377
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:31,795
- I can't remember.
- Come on.

378
00:28:31,962 --> 00:28:33,255
Try.

379
00:28:39,344 --> 00:28:42,306
Okay, now I'd like you to write

380
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:45,225
about all this. Fishing,
the grapevines... in a notebook.

381
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,936
Describe the peaceful feeling

382
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:51,064
you get when you remember it,
okay?

383
00:28:51,273 --> 00:28:53,317
Like you were writing to a friend.

384
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:23,263
Make as many combinations
as you want. When we add your photo

385
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,640
it will be lovely.

386
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:26,016
You'll see.

387
00:29:26,517 --> 00:29:27,976
It's a shame he's not here.

388
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:30,395
You wouldn't say
that if you met him.

389
00:29:30,562 --> 00:29:31,688
- Want one?
- No thanks.

390
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:34,066
He had his quirks,
like anyone.

391
00:29:34,733 --> 00:29:36,777
He didn't like parties,
ornoise...

392
00:29:37,027 --> 00:29:38,403
I'll get it.

393
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:42,157
It's not time
to open the presents yet.

394
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:47,037
Dad!

395
00:29:49,832 --> 00:29:52,376
- Can I get you a drink?
- A beer.

396
00:29:52,543 --> 00:29:54,086
I'll get it.

397
00:29:54,503 --> 00:29:56,505
- Do you like it?
- Thanks.

398
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:03,011
It was the boy. He wanted to see
his father. It's normal, darn it.

399
00:30:04,096 --> 00:30:06,056
- Hi, Antonio.
- How are you?

400
00:30:12,145 --> 00:30:13,647
I've got something for you.

401
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:34,376
Here Lidia, an arrow fory ou.

402
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:37,045
Has everybody got one?

403
00:30:38,547 --> 00:30:40,465
Careful where you aim it.

404
00:30:40,716 --> 00:30:41,925
Right overthere.

405
00:30:43,343 --> 00:30:45,137
Lightly, that's right.

406
00:30:45,637 --> 00:30:47,222
Turn it towards yourself.

407
00:30:49,266 --> 00:30:52,186
One fell, one fell behindyou.

408
00:30:52,394 --> 00:30:54,980
- Okay.
- Here it is.

409
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:04,865
For you.

410
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,825
Here's your arrow.

411
00:31:07,826 --> 00:31:09,286
Get your arrow.

412
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:11,163
The cake!

413
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:14,124
Oh, careful.

414
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:17,044
Will you give me a minute?

415
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:18,337
Blowhard.

416
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:21,465
John, got a lighter?
They've gone out.

417
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:23,091
Give me a lighter.

418
00:31:23,342 --> 00:31:24,593
Don't blow now.

419
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,262
- Don't blow yet. Just a minute.
- Elbows off the table.

420
00:31:29,264 --> 00:31:33,227
You can all blow
at the count of one, two, three.

421
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:36,271
Very good, bravo.

422
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:38,273
Will you cut it?

423
00:31:38,774 --> 00:31:40,317
Plates.

424
00:31:50,994 --> 00:31:52,329
Let's see the games.

425
00:31:52,746 --> 00:31:53,831
Do you like it?

426
00:31:54,832 --> 00:31:56,333
- Thank you, Ana.
- You're welcome.

427
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,336
- What is it?
- A Playstation 2 with two games.

428
00:32:00,629 --> 00:32:04,258
Formula One. With DVD included.
It's great.

429
00:32:04,424 --> 00:32:05,300
I'm leaving.

430
00:32:06,051 --> 00:32:09,388
- So soon? I'll see you out.
- No, that's all right.

431
00:32:22,484 --> 00:32:23,527
Antonio!

432
00:32:28,073 --> 00:32:29,366
How are you?

433
00:32:30,826 --> 00:32:33,412
- I'm fine. And you?
- I'm fine.

434
00:32:35,747 --> 00:32:37,291
Everything's fine at home?

435
00:32:39,626 --> 00:32:40,669
Yes. Fine.

436
00:32:41,211 --> 00:32:42,254
Pilar.

437
00:32:42,588 --> 00:32:43,714
Pilar.

438
00:32:46,216 --> 00:32:47,176
Pilar.

439
00:32:48,468 --> 00:32:49,303
Anyway...

440
00:32:49,511 --> 00:32:50,554
Coming.

441
00:32:58,896 --> 00:33:00,314
Don't, Ana. I'll do it.

442
00:33:01,023 --> 00:33:02,107
Thanks.

443
00:33:03,859 --> 00:33:06,403
- How did he ask you?
- Ask me what?

444
00:33:07,946 --> 00:33:11,575
John. How did he ask you
to marry him?

445
00:33:14,286 --> 00:33:16,914
I don't remember
any one special moment.

446
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,291
It just sort of came out over time.

447
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:23,295
I do. I remember everything.

448
00:33:25,172 --> 00:33:26,882
How he took me by the arm...

449
00:33:27,174 --> 00:33:28,717
His hands were sweaty.

450
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:30,427
And how he smiled...

451
00:33:30,677 --> 00:33:32,387
I smiled to encourage him.

452
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:36,350
A motorcycle drove by
and startled us.

453
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:38,977
We walked to the river,

454
00:33:39,686 --> 00:33:41,313
we sat down on a bench.

455
00:33:43,941 --> 00:33:45,901
And he just kept silent.

456
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,569
Well, finally he said:

457
00:33:47,736 --> 00:33:51,156
"Well, Shorty, this isn't like
in the movies,

458
00:33:51,365 --> 00:33:52,991
on your knees and all that.

459
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,370
But if it's okay with you,
that's it. "

460
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,539
And he looked at me

461
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:03,126
with those big intense eyes of his.

462
00:34:06,004 --> 00:34:07,881
Then we gave each other gifts.

463
00:34:09,466 --> 00:34:11,093
I gave him my nose

464
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:14,263
and my ears.

465
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:17,224
He said they were very pretty.

466
00:34:19,643 --> 00:34:21,019
And he gave me his hands.

467
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:30,154
Pretty silly, wasn't it?

468
00:34:33,907 --> 00:34:35,993
I mean, I can hug her, you know?

469
00:34:37,411 --> 00:34:41,165
I can hug her, touch her, kiss
her... But talk to her? No way.

470
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:43,625
What would you like to tell her?

471
00:34:45,252 --> 00:34:48,297
Just that I miss her,
that I want to be with her.

472
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:49,882
What do you miss?

473
00:34:50,507 --> 00:34:52,509
What do you mean?
Her, of course.

474
00:34:53,177 --> 00:34:55,053
Her doing your laundry,

475
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,014
- ironing clothes?
- No, dammit.

476
00:34:57,764 --> 00:35:00,976
- Cooking, keeping you warm at night?
- Shit, it's more than that.

477
00:35:01,143 --> 00:35:04,897
I know there's more. Cleaning
the house, doing the shopping...

478
00:35:05,063 --> 00:35:06,398
Quit fucking around!

479
00:35:06,565 --> 00:35:08,525
Then what do you miss, Antonio?

480
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:16,366
Look, Antonio.

481
00:35:16,783 --> 00:35:18,744
I want you to concentrate
for a moment

482
00:35:18,911 --> 00:35:21,580
and think of one little thing
about her, anything.

483
00:35:21,747 --> 00:35:23,790
Something about her
you especially like.

484
00:35:31,048 --> 00:35:32,090
Her sound.

485
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:33,383
Her sound?

486
00:35:35,761 --> 00:35:37,179
Yeah, it's...

487
00:35:40,307 --> 00:35:41,225
Pilar...

488
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:46,813
Pilar moves quickly
but she hardly makes any noise.

489
00:35:47,147 --> 00:35:48,232
You know?

490
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:51,443
I don't know what it is.
Maybe her bracelets or clothes...

491
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:54,822
She moves around quickly
and hardly makes any noise.

492
00:35:55,197 --> 00:35:57,241
It's like hersound, you know?

493
00:36:01,036 --> 00:36:04,498
When she's home I just sit there
like a dummylisteningto her.

494
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:08,293
Have you ever apologized to her?

495
00:36:10,879 --> 00:36:13,632
- What?
- Have you ever said you were sorry?

496
00:37:12,816 --> 00:37:14,067
What's that?

497
00:37:16,195 --> 00:37:17,571
You like it?

498
00:37:19,531 --> 00:37:20,866
Why do you have to wear that?

499
00:37:22,951 --> 00:37:24,411
You don't like it.

500
00:37:24,912 --> 00:37:26,705
I like what's inside.

501
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:32,044
Come on.
Let's go to the bridge.

502
00:37:37,966 --> 00:37:40,010
Anger isn't bad.
Everybody gets angry.

503
00:37:40,219 --> 00:37:42,262
But you have to keep it
under control.

504
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:48,393
The problem is seeing it,
recognizing it...

505
00:37:49,102 --> 00:37:51,438
But if you do, you can control it.

506
00:37:52,773 --> 00:37:54,650
I can control myself, Shorty.

507
00:37:55,609 --> 00:37:58,195
Whenever I notice I'm getting mad,
I stop myself.

508
00:37:58,612 --> 00:38:02,574
I say: "Stop" and I tell you:
"Time out. " And then I leave.

509
00:38:03,325 --> 00:38:05,702
- See?
- No.

510
00:38:06,537 --> 00:38:08,872
I didn't either at first.
So I can control it.

511
00:38:10,332 --> 00:38:13,585
I can control myself.
You have to help me, okay?

512
00:38:14,419 --> 00:38:16,839
- How?
- By being with me.

513
00:38:19,341 --> 00:38:21,510
Because if we're together,
I can handle anything.

514
00:38:22,636 --> 00:38:24,763
Without you, I can't do anything.

515
00:38:26,098 --> 00:38:27,182
Antonio,

516
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:33,188
- promise me you'll really change.
- I promise, I promise, okay?

517
00:38:33,397 --> 00:38:34,523
I promise.

518
00:38:35,899 --> 00:38:38,402
I don't want to be sixty
like those guys,

519
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,865
at group therapy,
ruining their families' lives.

520
00:38:45,576 --> 00:38:46,702
Oh, look!

521
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:55,377
- There's nothing in it.
- Because I just bought it.

522
00:38:56,587 --> 00:38:58,630
Look, the yellow pages
are for a diary.

523
00:38:59,214 --> 00:39:01,550
To write down
what happens every day.

524
00:39:02,259 --> 00:39:04,970
The green part is for good stuff.

525
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:07,973
And the red is for the bad stuff.

526
00:39:11,226 --> 00:39:13,729
But now that I'm with you,
I won't need it,

527
00:39:14,646 --> 00:39:15,772
right?

528
00:39:18,317 --> 00:39:19,860
Know what the shrink says?

529
00:39:22,321 --> 00:39:24,281
That I don't have
any goals of my own.

530
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:31,038
Everything was just handed to me,
I had no choice.

531
00:39:31,997 --> 00:39:33,790
Because of my family
and all that.

532
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:36,668
Do you have any goals?

533
00:39:38,212 --> 00:39:40,172
I'd like to do something different.

534
00:39:41,423 --> 00:39:43,133
Go far away.
The three of us.

535
00:39:45,511 --> 00:39:48,096
You bet. And screw the store.

536
00:39:48,722 --> 00:39:51,016
- And Toledo.
- And my brother.

537
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:55,062
- And my mother.
- And your sister. And her Scot, too.

538
00:39:55,229 --> 00:39:58,106
Screw everything, right?

539
00:39:58,273 --> 00:40:01,318
Screw everything.
Say it, Shorty.

540
00:40:01,902 --> 00:40:05,572
- Screw everything.
- Reallyloud, okay?

541
00:40:07,282 --> 00:40:08,408
Screw everything!

542
00:40:08,826 --> 00:40:10,994
Screw everything!

543
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,501
Call your father to see
if he's bringing anyone.

544
00:40:17,668 --> 00:40:20,587
My mother's coming for sure.
I don't know about my father.

545
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:21,421
Hi.

546
00:40:21,755 --> 00:40:22,548
Hi.

547
00:40:24,633 --> 00:40:26,093
- Have you had supper yet?
- Yes.

548
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,929
- How'd it go with Rosa?
- Fine.

549
00:40:29,096 --> 00:40:32,224
- Where did you go?
- Down by the river.

550
00:40:32,391 --> 00:40:33,976
- Have you done your homework?
- Yes.

551
00:40:34,184 --> 00:40:36,770
Okay, look. 78, 79, 80...

552
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:39,231
Juan, my sister

553
00:40:39,398 --> 00:40:42,025
and my sister's escort.
Are you bringing anyone?

554
00:40:44,736 --> 00:40:45,779
No.

555
00:40:46,155 --> 00:40:47,823
What about that guy?

556
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:51,493
No, Ana.

557
00:40:52,411 --> 00:40:55,455
- Hey, what does "retrete" mean?
- Toilet.

558
00:40:56,123 --> 00:40:58,333
A toilet?
You asked for a toilet?

559
00:40:58,542 --> 00:41:01,795
- Sure. Ours is all cracked.
- Ana, how am I going to tell...

560
00:41:02,004 --> 00:41:04,673
Can you think of a better time
to ask for a toilet?

561
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:08,302
- How can we tell my mother?
- Bridal registry or bank account.

562
00:41:08,427 --> 00:41:10,721
I refuse to have the house
full of junk.

563
00:41:10,888 --> 00:41:13,765
A bank account? You mean money?
How crass!

564
00:41:14,016 --> 00:41:16,185
You're the crass one.
Write it: "retrete. "

565
00:41:27,154 --> 00:41:28,655
Ready to go?

566
00:41:28,989 --> 00:41:32,117
- I'm meeting my sister.
- Come on, let's go.

567
00:41:32,284 --> 00:41:33,619
See you later, Lola.

568
00:42:00,145 --> 00:42:03,065
- Anyone home at your sister's?
- Not till tonight.

569
00:42:03,232 --> 00:42:05,901
- Let's go then.
- Antonio, not at Ana's!

570
00:42:06,068 --> 00:42:07,694
- What?
- Not there.

571
00:42:07,861 --> 00:42:09,363
- Come on, damn.
- Antonio.

572
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:12,491
Antonio...

573
00:42:42,855 --> 00:42:44,481
You haven't given me anything
in ages.

574
00:42:48,026 --> 00:42:49,653
Like your ears or your nose.

575
00:42:51,655 --> 00:42:52,990
Tell me what you want.

576
00:42:55,951 --> 00:42:58,245
Everything. I want all of it.

577
00:43:00,747 --> 00:43:01,957
From here...

578
00:43:03,625 --> 00:43:04,918
to here.

579
00:43:07,004 --> 00:43:08,422
It's already yours.

580
00:43:10,549 --> 00:43:12,092
I want you to give it to me.

581
00:43:17,973 --> 00:43:19,266
It's yours.

582
00:43:22,853 --> 00:43:24,479
All of it. I want it all.

583
00:43:27,816 --> 00:43:30,152
Your arms, your legs
your fingers and toes...

584
00:43:31,403 --> 00:43:32,821
Give it all to me.

585
00:43:34,948 --> 00:43:37,326
- Say it.
- Take my arms.

586
00:43:47,252 --> 00:43:49,963
- Your legs.
- Take my legs.

587
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,557
Your fingers and toes.

588
00:44:02,184 --> 00:44:04,269
Take my fingers and my toes.

589
00:44:08,857 --> 00:44:10,275
Your neck.

590
00:44:11,401 --> 00:44:13,779
Take my neck.

591
00:44:15,155 --> 00:44:16,740
Your breasts.

592
00:44:21,328 --> 00:44:23,914
Take my breasts.

593
00:44:31,463 --> 00:44:32,798
Your back.

594
00:44:35,592 --> 00:44:37,135
Your shoulders.

595
00:44:37,678 --> 00:44:39,096
My back.

596
00:44:41,014 --> 00:44:42,558
My feet.

597
00:44:53,026 --> 00:44:55,445
Take my eyes.

598
00:44:58,198 --> 00:44:59,491
And my mouth.

599
00:45:20,179 --> 00:45:22,222
Come on, Ana might come home.

600
00:45:23,098 --> 00:45:25,517
So what?
I'm your husband, aren't I?

601
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:28,353
I don't want her to know just yet.

602
00:45:28,896 --> 00:45:30,063
Why not?

603
00:45:30,689 --> 00:45:32,566
Don't you like how we are now?

604
00:45:33,108 --> 00:45:36,570
I do. It's as if
we were dating again.

605
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:44,703
Look, when we're feeling more sure

606
00:45:45,329 --> 00:45:47,539
and things are more settled.

607
00:45:47,789 --> 00:45:49,291
When what's more settled?

608
00:45:49,875 --> 00:45:53,337
We've been married
for nine years!

609
00:45:54,004 --> 00:45:55,214
Come on now.

610
00:45:55,672 --> 00:45:57,132
The hell I will.

611
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:05,265
What, you want some
new boyfriends now?

612
00:46:07,518 --> 00:46:09,394
An English boyfriend
like your sister?

613
00:46:09,937 --> 00:46:11,897
A foreigner who talks like a clown?

614
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:18,028
Or maybe a husband
who sells refrigerators

615
00:46:18,195 --> 00:46:21,740
- isn't good enough anymore?
- That's not it, Antonio. I'm sorry.

616
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:24,326
Hell no.
Shit, this isn't normal.

617
00:46:25,828 --> 00:46:27,079
It's not normal, Pilar.

618
00:46:28,497 --> 00:46:31,250
<i>Spouses must live together,</i>

619
00:46:32,543 --> 00:46:33,961
be faithfulto one another

620
00:46:34,586 --> 00:46:36,713
and come to each other's aid.

621
00:46:37,297 --> 00:46:38,799
Husband and wife

622
00:46:39,383 --> 00:46:42,261
have equal rights and obligations.

623
00:46:43,929 --> 00:46:45,055
John McCormick,

624
00:46:45,764 --> 00:46:49,059
do you take

625
00:46:49,268 --> 00:46:51,562
Ms. Ana Perez Villaras your

626
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:52,813
lawfully wedded wife?

627
00:46:53,146 --> 00:46:54,356
I do.

628
00:46:54,982 --> 00:46:57,860
Ana Perez Villar, do youtake

629
00:46:58,026 --> 00:47:02,030
Mr. John McCormick
as your lawfully wedded husband?

630
00:47:02,906 --> 00:47:04,032
I do.

631
00:47:05,242 --> 00:47:09,371
By the powers legally vested in me,
I now pronounce you

632
00:47:09,538 --> 00:47:10,873
husband and wife.

633
00:48:42,673 --> 00:48:46,218
Ana, it's a beautiful wedding.
Lots of fun.

634
00:48:46,426 --> 00:48:49,596
Right, for you.
What the hell is he doing here?

635
00:48:54,309 --> 00:48:56,144
I didn't want to upset you.

636
00:48:57,563 --> 00:48:59,356
I should have told you.

637
00:49:00,566 --> 00:49:01,775
We're going home.

638
00:49:02,276 --> 00:49:03,318
What?

639
00:49:05,112 --> 00:49:07,322
- We're going home.
- Why?

640
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:10,659
John and I will be away
for two months. You can find

641
00:49:10,826 --> 00:49:13,579
- another place.
- I'm going home with Antonio.

642
00:49:13,745 --> 00:49:15,664
- But why?
- Because I love him.

643
00:49:15,873 --> 00:49:17,749
Are you a complete idiot?

644
00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:20,669
He's ruining your life!
Have you forgotten

645
00:49:20,836 --> 00:49:24,298
- everything he did to you?
- He's my husband and he loves me.

646
00:49:24,464 --> 00:49:27,467
A man who does that to you
doesn't love you.

647
00:49:28,135 --> 00:49:29,303
How would you know?

648
00:49:30,387 --> 00:49:34,683
You don't know him.
You never understood him.

649
00:49:35,517 --> 00:49:38,187
You never thought
he was any good.

650
00:49:38,395 --> 00:49:40,522
You never bothered
to get to know him.

651
00:49:40,689 --> 00:49:42,566
Never, Ana. Never.

652
00:49:42,774 --> 00:49:44,568
What's there to know?

653
00:49:45,027 --> 00:49:46,987
Because he helped you
when Dad was ill?

654
00:49:47,196 --> 00:49:48,864
Don't talk to me about that.

655
00:49:48,989 --> 00:49:51,450
You weren't there,
so how would you know?

656
00:49:51,658 --> 00:49:53,285
That was hell, Ana.

657
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:56,163
But no, the little princess
is above all that.

658
00:49:56,747 --> 00:49:59,791
You've always had it easy.

659
00:50:00,751 --> 00:50:01,877
Always away,

660
00:50:02,085 --> 00:50:03,504
always protected.

661
00:50:03,754 --> 00:50:05,797
I get all the unpleasant stuff.

662
00:50:06,548 --> 00:50:10,928
And you always judge
and criticize everything.

663
00:50:11,637 --> 00:50:13,764
- What?
Just leave me alone.

664
00:50:13,972 --> 00:50:16,016
Leave me alone. I don't need

665
00:50:16,183 --> 00:50:19,186
your approval.
Go on living in your wonderful world

666
00:50:19,394 --> 00:50:21,355
and just let me live in peace.

667
00:50:34,034 --> 00:50:36,495
And now, if you don't mind,
I'd like to ask

668
00:50:36,703 --> 00:50:39,665
my mother to sing a song.
For Ana.

669
00:50:39,957 --> 00:50:41,750
Long live the newly weds!

670
00:51:32,801 --> 00:51:35,470
Okay, this is the living room

671
00:51:36,471 --> 00:51:39,224
and that's the door,
and you come in now.

672
00:51:40,142 --> 00:51:41,768
No, no. Not you.

673
00:51:41,977 --> 00:51:43,687
- Wh ynot?
- You're playing the wife.

674
00:51:43,854 --> 00:51:45,147
Let someone else do it.

675
00:51:45,439 --> 00:51:47,149
- Get someone else!
- Come on!

676
00:51:47,357 --> 00:51:49,568
- Shit!
- What a hot babe.

677
00:51:52,237 --> 00:51:53,655
Go ahead. You get home.

678
00:51:57,618 --> 00:51:58,785
What?

679
00:52:00,954 --> 00:52:02,539
Well? Say something.

680
00:52:07,085 --> 00:52:08,420
Where's my dinner?

681
00:52:09,296 --> 00:52:11,715
Okay, can't anyone
think of something better?

682
00:52:13,258 --> 00:52:16,845
- Antonio.
- Hello. How was your day?

683
00:52:19,389 --> 00:52:21,266
How was your day?
Where's dinner?

684
00:52:24,603 --> 00:52:26,814
Okay, right. Let's see.

685
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,148
Imagine you're her.

686
00:52:28,357 --> 00:52:31,485
You've been working all day,
you get home...

687
00:52:32,027 --> 00:52:33,487
There must be something
to talk about.

688
00:52:33,654 --> 00:52:34,613
Sure.

689
00:52:34,822 --> 00:52:39,159
She's been home all day and she has
things to tell you, too. Go ahead.

690
00:52:42,871 --> 00:52:44,748
- Hey.
- Hey.

691
00:52:45,833 --> 00:52:48,293
- Hey there.
- Hey there yourself.

692
00:52:48,502 --> 00:52:49,753
Don't laugh, shit.

693
00:52:51,088 --> 00:52:54,925
- Let her talk first. So what...
- But I'm the one who... I'm at home.

694
00:52:55,384 --> 00:52:56,677
And I just got home.

695
00:52:57,386 --> 00:52:59,263
So how about, what's up?

696
00:52:59,388 --> 00:53:00,973
What's up today?

697
00:53:02,349 --> 00:53:04,977
- You guys aren't helping.
- I say: "What do you care?"

698
00:53:05,686 --> 00:53:08,522
No, that's how it goes.
What do you mean, I don't care?

699
00:53:08,689 --> 00:53:11,984
- I've been working hard all day.
- Let somebody else do it.

700
00:53:14,987 --> 00:53:16,947
Have you told them about the course?

701
00:53:17,114 --> 00:53:18,699
Sure, but you know how lazy

702
00:53:18,907 --> 00:53:20,409
they are.
It's impossible.

703
00:53:20,659 --> 00:53:22,744
- Want some tomato?
- Go on, give me two.

704
00:53:24,746 --> 00:53:28,292
They never sign up.
Not even for the easiest courses.

705
00:53:28,876 --> 00:53:30,294
Well, it's their loss.

706
00:53:30,627 --> 00:53:32,754
- They always take the easy way.
- They do.

707
00:53:32,963 --> 00:53:36,383
It's because it's for volunteers.
Take out some cheese.

708
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:38,760
Have you told Pilar
about the courses?

709
00:53:39,887 --> 00:53:41,847
- No, not yet.
- You may have other plans,

710
00:53:42,055 --> 00:53:45,475
but since both of our contracts
are up, we had an idea for you.

711
00:53:46,226 --> 00:53:49,646
Here. We offer courses
at the museum to train

712
00:53:49,855 --> 00:53:53,358
visitors' guides. Rosa's one
of the teachers and I'm taking it.

713
00:53:53,525 --> 00:53:56,904
It's really good.
But since it's for volunteers,

714
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:59,740
when you're done
you don't earn a cent.

715
00:54:00,449 --> 00:54:02,075
But we can make money with it.

716
00:54:02,451 --> 00:54:04,328
We'd meet people out of town,

717
00:54:04,578 --> 00:54:08,832
travel all over...
travel agencies, exhibit halls...

718
00:54:09,041 --> 00:54:12,794
Yeah, especially at savings banks.
They've got tons. At schools, too.

719
00:54:16,965 --> 00:54:19,843
Museum guides?
Isn't that very specialized?

720
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:22,888
Well, for what I do, it is,
but Lola's got another idea.

721
00:54:23,096 --> 00:54:26,266
Yeah. We'd offer a sort of "tour"

722
00:54:26,475 --> 00:54:30,020
of the paintings with a brief
summary instead of a long,

723
00:54:30,187 --> 00:54:31,104
scholarly one.

724
00:54:31,313 --> 00:54:32,523
Nothing too dull.

725
00:54:32,689 --> 00:54:36,693
Exactly. Not guides, but rather
guided visits. Right, Rosa?

726
00:54:37,778 --> 00:54:41,740
I can see it already: "Rosa, Pilar
and Lola's Guided Tours. "

727
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:51,625
Look, this is Orpheus
and she's Eurydice, his wife,

728
00:54:51,792 --> 00:54:55,921
who died from a snake bite.
He feels very sad

729
00:54:56,129 --> 00:54:58,799
and decides to go to Avernus
to look for her.

730
00:54:58,966 --> 00:55:00,926
- What's Avernus?
- Hell.

731
00:55:01,385 --> 00:55:03,720
The Underworld.
Here's where these two live.

732
00:55:04,471 --> 00:55:06,223
Pluto and Proserpina.

733
00:55:07,057 --> 00:55:09,142
Orpheus plays the lyre verywell.
See it?

734
00:55:10,269 --> 00:55:13,397
And he begs them to let him
take his wife back

735
00:55:13,564 --> 00:55:15,524
to the land of the living.

736
00:55:16,191 --> 00:55:18,068
- And does he?
- Yes.

737
00:55:18,235 --> 00:55:19,945
But on one condition.

738
00:55:20,821 --> 00:55:23,907
He has to go first and he can't
turn around to look at her

739
00:55:24,074 --> 00:55:26,118
until they're out of hell.

740
00:55:26,535 --> 00:55:30,581
They walk a long misty paths,
dark roads,

741
00:55:30,747 --> 00:55:33,041
and just before they reach the top,

742
00:55:34,001 --> 00:55:37,462
Orpheus can't stand it anylonger
and he turns.

743
00:55:38,297 --> 00:55:39,590
Then what happens?

744
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,387
Time forbed, it's late.

745
00:55:48,557 --> 00:55:50,350
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.

746
00:55:52,227 --> 00:55:54,104
Do you want some supper?

747
00:55:54,271 --> 00:55:57,024
A beer
I had a sandwich at the shop.

748
00:56:03,197 --> 00:56:05,574
Want to go to the country
this weekend?

749
00:56:06,074 --> 00:56:08,118
My brother asked for our help.

750
00:56:14,082 --> 00:56:17,044
- How about it?
- Okay.

751
00:56:20,255 --> 00:56:21,298
What's this?

752
00:56:24,551 --> 00:56:27,137
Antonio, I'd like to take a course

753
00:56:27,304 --> 00:56:30,307
to learn how to be a visitors' guide
at the museum.

754
00:56:31,683 --> 00:56:33,560
It's free for employees.

755
00:56:33,811 --> 00:56:35,145
What for?

756
00:56:36,939 --> 00:56:39,358
Because it's really nice.

757
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,110
What do you have to do?

758
00:56:42,778 --> 00:56:45,447
Learn about paintings...
and explain them.

759
00:56:46,782 --> 00:56:49,284
- Learn about what?
- Well, we choose

760
00:56:49,451 --> 00:56:53,205
a painting and look for
the mythological story it portrays

761
00:56:53,622 --> 00:56:55,040
and the painting's history.

762
00:56:55,707 --> 00:56:56,875
Look.

763
00:56:57,751 --> 00:56:59,336
I chose this one.

764
00:56:59,837 --> 00:57:00,879
Right.

765
00:57:02,631 --> 00:57:03,757
Okay.

766
00:57:05,759 --> 00:57:07,970
Well, let's go to bed.
I'm beat.

767
00:57:16,353 --> 00:57:17,479
Look.

768
00:57:27,281 --> 00:57:29,783
- How's it going?
- Get more bricks.

769
00:57:30,409 --> 00:57:33,745
Coming. Hey!
What do you want, clay?

770
00:57:36,915 --> 00:57:38,125
To mix mortar.

771
00:57:39,376 --> 00:57:41,170
Hey! This is ready.

772
00:57:41,378 --> 00:57:42,713
Come on, time to eat.

773
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,507
Lunch is ready. Okay?
Antonio.

774
00:57:45,841 --> 00:57:47,176
I need some grub.

775
00:57:49,928 --> 00:57:52,472
- Let's see, the wine.
- You said just a little lunch.

776
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,269
- So how does it look?
- Great, man.

777
00:57:58,187 --> 00:58:00,772
It looks very nice.
I like it alot.

778
00:58:00,939 --> 00:58:03,984
- So simple.
- Yes, it's nice. I still wish

779
00:58:04,109 --> 00:58:06,987
we had a second story.
There are some nice views

780
00:58:07,154 --> 00:58:08,363
and we can't see them.

781
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:10,657
Not that again.
There's room to spare.

782
00:58:10,866 --> 00:58:14,453
- But there's a lovely olive grove...
- Why not build a tower?

783
00:58:14,995 --> 00:58:18,290
- Oh, yes.
- Instead of a whole story. A tower

784
00:58:18,457 --> 00:58:21,418
- would give you the views.
- Yeah, more building,

785
00:58:21,585 --> 00:58:25,255
more roofing, more bricks, more
money. Are you going to build it?

786
00:58:26,173 --> 00:58:29,593
- No, I'm just saying...
- Keep your great ideas to yourself.

787
00:58:29,843 --> 00:58:32,137
Antonio thinks
he's an architect now.

788
00:58:33,222 --> 00:58:34,389
More wine anybody?

789
00:58:34,598 --> 00:58:36,099
No, I'm drinking beer.

790
00:58:36,642 --> 00:58:38,435
Could you pass me a glass please?

791
00:58:41,688 --> 00:58:43,565
You get ano-interest loan
from your father,

792
00:58:43,732 --> 00:58:45,234
free labor from your brother...

793
00:58:45,818 --> 00:58:47,110
and you're all set.

794
00:58:51,573 --> 00:58:53,617
It would be an amazing
country house.

795
00:58:54,493 --> 00:58:57,538
And Andres says we can visit
whenever we want. No shit.

796
00:58:57,788 --> 00:59:01,917
Hell, the place should be ours. My
father's loan comes from the store

797
00:59:02,084 --> 00:59:04,711
and all the hours I've put in.

798
00:59:07,047 --> 00:59:08,465
Without getting a cent.

799
00:59:08,632 --> 00:59:10,509
With that crummy salary
he won't raise.

800
00:59:10,717 --> 00:59:12,427
And Susana needs another story

801
00:59:12,594 --> 00:59:16,807
so she can see the olive grove. Some
fucking nerve. I do the roofing.

802
00:59:16,974 --> 00:59:18,433
I lay the bricks.

803
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:26,066
What are you thinking?

804
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,442
Nothing.

805
00:59:27,651 --> 00:59:29,444
Nothing? Tell me, dammit.

806
00:59:31,947 --> 00:59:34,366
- Nothing.
- Don't lie to me. Tell me.

807
00:59:34,575 --> 00:59:36,368
That I'm not worth a shit?

808
00:59:36,535 --> 00:59:38,245
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

809
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:40,372
What are you thinking?

810
00:59:40,706 --> 00:59:43,208
I'm not thinking anything.
Honestly.

811
00:59:46,253 --> 00:59:47,963
Tell me or we'll stay here

812
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:49,756
- all fucking night.
- What can I say?

813
00:59:49,923 --> 00:59:51,717
- What you're thinking.
- That you're right.

814
00:59:51,884 --> 00:59:54,303
- That I'm not worth a shit?
- No, they should pay you more.

815
00:59:54,511 --> 00:59:57,723
Ah, so I don't earn enough.
I don't earn enough.

816
00:59:57,890 --> 01:00:00,601
- I didn't say that.
- But that's what you think.

817
01:00:00,767 --> 01:00:02,311
- That I'm an idiot.
- No.

818
01:00:02,478 --> 01:00:04,521
- Then what are you thinking?
- Mom.

819
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:06,523
- It doesn't matter.
- What?

820
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:08,734
What I say doesn't matter?
Don't you care?

821
01:00:08,942 --> 01:00:11,445
Shut up. You're not interested.

822
01:00:11,612 --> 01:00:13,822
- Mom.
- Shut your fucking mouth!

823
01:00:14,448 --> 01:00:15,657
Antonio.

824
01:00:51,944 --> 01:00:56,114
We've got three. Two euros and
76 cents for four bottles of milk.

825
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:02,913
A pack of yogurts...

826
01:01:04,998 --> 01:01:07,459
Juan, come here.

827
01:01:14,049 --> 01:01:15,008
Thank you.

828
01:01:17,469 --> 01:01:19,012
Go over to Angel's and try them out.

829
01:01:19,179 --> 01:01:20,138
Okay.

830
01:01:44,663 --> 01:01:45,956
Do you like it?

831
01:01:46,456 --> 01:01:47,791
If you don't, we can

832
01:01:47,958 --> 01:01:49,293
change it, okay?

833
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:51,712
I like it very much.

834
01:01:54,506 --> 01:01:56,049
Better now?

835
01:01:57,509 --> 01:01:58,844
More relaxed?

836
01:02:02,848 --> 01:02:04,183
Tell me.

837
01:02:06,268 --> 01:02:07,478
Yes.

838
01:02:09,396 --> 01:02:10,981
Yeah, Shorty, tell me.

839
01:02:12,316 --> 01:02:14,276
When you're quiet I feel terrible.

840
01:02:16,403 --> 01:02:17,946
You know that.

841
01:02:19,615 --> 01:02:21,325
Because you know everything.

842
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:25,120
Who knows me better than you do?

843
01:02:26,914 --> 01:02:28,248
Nobody.

844
01:02:32,169 --> 01:02:33,879
Who understands me like you do?

845
01:02:35,672 --> 01:02:37,007
Nobody.

846
01:02:47,726 --> 01:02:49,686
Who knows you better than I do?

847
01:02:51,605 --> 01:02:52,940
Nobody.

848
01:03:00,197 --> 01:03:01,907
Who loves you more than I do?

849
01:03:02,866 --> 01:03:04,243
Nobody.

850
01:03:17,047 --> 01:03:18,757
Nobody, Shorty. Nobody.

851
01:03:22,052 --> 01:03:25,389
- He's big, and just as stupid.
- Did you talk about it after that?

852
01:03:25,556 --> 01:03:27,933
What could I say?
I don't want to talk to him.

853
01:03:28,142 --> 01:03:29,685
I never want to see him again.

854
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:32,563
- Who, the kid?
- Too bad. He was so cute.

855
01:03:32,729 --> 01:03:34,982
Cute? He's a jerk,
that's what he is.

856
01:03:35,274 --> 01:03:37,317
The whole party
flirting with my friends.

857
01:03:37,526 --> 01:03:40,571
- Saying how great you guys are...
- You should have done the same.

858
01:03:40,779 --> 01:03:43,198
No, what I did was
pour beer over his head.

859
01:03:43,448 --> 01:03:45,075
- You did?
- Did you really?

860
01:03:48,453 --> 01:03:50,164
Listen, Lola.

861
01:03:50,372 --> 01:03:52,332
What do you want
a steady boyfriend for?

862
01:03:52,541 --> 01:03:54,543
Have some fun
and do whatever you want.

863
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:55,586
It's not that easy.

864
01:03:55,794 --> 01:03:59,464
Sure. You have a wonderful man
who you can't stand having at home.

865
01:03:59,631 --> 01:04:03,260
Exactly. Let him iron his own shirts
and take me to the movies.

866
01:04:03,427 --> 01:04:05,095
- Beer for everyone?
- And wine fo rme.

867
01:04:06,221 --> 01:04:08,182
Look, I want to tell you something.

868
01:04:08,348 --> 01:04:11,393
If you're in a steady relationship,
you fuck.

869
01:04:11,602 --> 01:04:13,896
That's how it is.
Pilar, do you fuck your husband?

870
01:04:15,564 --> 01:04:18,108
- Yes.
- Like I said. That's the only way.

871
01:04:19,401 --> 01:04:21,195
Lola, isn't that your man?

872
01:04:21,361 --> 01:04:22,571
How about it?

873
01:04:22,738 --> 01:04:23,906
- Go on.
- I'm not going.

874
01:04:24,072 --> 01:04:25,866
Go on, he's asking you to.

875
01:04:26,074 --> 01:04:27,493
- Don't be silly.
- Everyone be quiet.

876
01:04:27,659 --> 01:04:29,453
She coming right out.

877
01:04:30,704 --> 01:04:32,206
Okay, I'll go.

878
01:04:33,081 --> 01:04:34,041
There she goes.

879
01:04:34,249 --> 01:04:36,376
How romantic,
meeting her at the bar!

880
01:04:38,629 --> 01:04:40,380
- She's head over heels.
- Him too.

881
01:04:42,132 --> 01:04:43,258
- Lola.
- What?

882
01:04:43,467 --> 01:04:45,093
- You won't talk to me?
- Leave me alone.

883
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:47,137
- No, Iwon't.
- Leave me alone.

884
01:04:47,304 --> 01:04:50,724
I want... I'm in love with you.
Listen, I was a little drunk.

885
01:04:50,933 --> 01:04:54,144
- I'm sick of you, don't you get it?
- Don't say that.

886
01:04:54,353 --> 01:04:56,563
- You can't treat me like that.
- What?

887
01:04:56,814 --> 01:04:59,858
Flirting with my friends
like that... I've had it.

888
01:05:00,067 --> 01:05:03,821
- You're my sunshine, my treasure...
- Let's see what line you try now...

889
01:05:03,987 --> 01:05:05,322
I can't live without you.

890
01:05:05,489 --> 01:05:08,784
I can't. I swear.
I love you. I love you.

891
01:05:08,951 --> 01:05:09,993
- Will you change?
- Kiss me.

892
01:05:20,879 --> 01:05:23,841
- Bye, cutie.
- He's got her where he wants her.

893
01:05:24,049 --> 01:05:25,592
Until the next time.

894
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:28,595
What have we got here?
Tuna, roast chicken, trout...

895
01:05:35,894 --> 01:05:36,937
Hi.

896
01:05:48,365 --> 01:05:49,491
Where'd you have lunch?

897
01:05:49,658 --> 01:05:50,826
With Rosa.

898
01:05:51,368 --> 01:05:53,662
- What Rosa?
- From the museum.

899
01:05:56,790 --> 01:05:58,584
I left three messages
on your cell phone.

900
01:06:01,086 --> 01:06:03,505
I must have turned it off
at the museum

901
01:06:03,714 --> 01:06:05,757
and forgot to turn it back on.

902
01:06:06,258 --> 01:06:08,051
I'm not used to it yet.

903
01:06:09,303 --> 01:06:10,470
Who else went along?

904
01:06:10,637 --> 01:06:12,222
- Where?
- To lunch, dammit.

905
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,101
Lola, another friend.

906
01:06:17,144 --> 01:06:18,770
Why didn't you tell me?

907
01:06:19,396 --> 01:06:20,856
I didn't know
you were eating at home.

908
01:06:21,023 --> 01:06:23,859
How the hell could you
if you don't use your cell phone?

909
01:06:24,026 --> 01:06:26,111
- Why did I give it to you?
- I told you...

910
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,197
Don't turn it off, dammit!

911
01:06:28,363 --> 01:06:30,324
Don't turn it off.
I get fucking mad.

912
01:06:30,532 --> 01:06:32,659
Then I get home
and there's no one here.

913
01:06:33,076 --> 01:06:35,120
- I'm sorry, I didn't know.
- You're clueless.

914
01:06:35,329 --> 01:06:36,663
You can't do
two things at once.

915
01:06:36,830 --> 01:06:39,208
You can't be at work
and answer the phone.

916
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:41,168
You only think about nonsense.

917
01:06:41,335 --> 01:06:43,295
All nonsense. Look at me

918
01:06:43,462 --> 01:06:45,005
when I talk to you, dammit!

919
01:07:06,944 --> 01:07:09,488
- I didn't touch her.
- Not this time.

920
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:11,782
But you often have.

921
01:07:12,324 --> 01:07:14,701
And you must learn
to stop much earlier.

922
01:07:16,787 --> 01:07:18,580
Go on, take out your notebook.

923
01:07:19,164 --> 01:07:20,958
I want you to write,
step by step,

924
01:07:21,124 --> 01:07:23,794
what you think when
Pilar doesn't answer her phone.

925
01:07:25,003 --> 01:07:26,213
Go on, I'll help you.

926
01:07:28,131 --> 01:07:30,342
What happens when
she doesn't answer?

927
01:07:30,926 --> 01:07:33,887
- I get mad as hell.
- Yes, but that's not why.

928
01:07:34,179 --> 01:07:36,723
It's the thoughts
you have about it.

929
01:07:36,890 --> 01:07:39,935
That's what we needto cut short.
What were you thinking?

930
01:07:43,188 --> 01:07:46,024
That she didn't want me
to know where she was.

931
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,026
Because...?

932
01:07:48,235 --> 01:07:49,361
I don't know.

933
01:07:49,987 --> 01:07:52,698
I don't know.
I'd rather not know.

934
01:07:52,948 --> 01:07:54,533
Because she's cheating on you?

935
01:07:56,243 --> 01:07:59,121
Come on, if you don't say it,
we can't dismantle the idea.

936
01:07:59,496 --> 01:08:02,749
How do we dismantle it?
By asking ourselves,

937
01:08:03,375 --> 01:08:05,169
"Is she really with someone else?"

938
01:08:05,669 --> 01:08:07,254
Rational response:

939
01:08:07,629 --> 01:08:11,508
"Not answering doesn't necessarily
mean she's with someone else.

940
01:08:11,884 --> 01:08:14,928
It means she can't answer
because she's working. "

941
01:08:15,596 --> 01:08:16,805
You follow me?

942
01:08:18,265 --> 01:08:19,892
What else were you thinking?

943
01:08:24,438 --> 01:08:26,023
That she's forgotten about me.

944
01:08:29,151 --> 01:08:30,486
And that...

945
01:08:31,236 --> 01:08:35,449
She might meet someone...
notice someone else.

946
01:08:35,824 --> 01:08:38,660
Okay. Now we ask ourselves:

947
01:08:39,203 --> 01:08:41,413
"Does one thing necessarily
lead to the other?"

948
01:08:41,622 --> 01:08:44,249
Rational response:
"Dealing with men every day

949
01:08:44,416 --> 01:08:46,376
doesn't mean falling
in love with them. "

950
01:08:46,627 --> 01:08:48,712
You see women every day
at the store

951
01:08:48,921 --> 01:08:51,715
and you don't go off with them.
So why should Pilar?

952
01:08:51,882 --> 01:08:54,676
I'm not interested
in those women.

953
01:08:56,136 --> 01:08:58,931
I just want a normal relationship.

954
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:03,519
- Normal? What does that mean?
- A normal one.

955
01:09:03,685 --> 01:09:05,562
A normal marriage,
I don't know.

956
01:09:06,939 --> 01:09:09,441
Knowing where the other person is,
what they're doing.

957
01:09:09,608 --> 01:09:12,027
Okay then, you'll have to ask her.

958
01:09:12,778 --> 01:09:15,572
But it's not about being in control,
it's about trust.

959
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:19,785
How can you always know
what she's doing?

960
01:09:20,369 --> 01:09:23,580
What she's thinking?
What her dreams are?

961
01:10:06,790 --> 01:10:09,084
Actually, in the book
"The Metamorphosis"

962
01:10:09,293 --> 01:10:10,544
Ovid says that

963
01:10:10,711 --> 01:10:14,423
an oracle tells Danae's father
Acrisius that his grandson

964
01:10:14,548 --> 01:10:15,507
will kill him.

965
01:10:16,175 --> 01:10:18,135
So he locks his daughter
in a tower

966
01:10:18,343 --> 01:10:20,512
so no man can get near her.

967
01:10:20,929 --> 01:10:23,557
But Jupiter is in love with her

968
01:10:23,724 --> 01:10:28,395
and enters the tower, turning
himself into gold dust to have her.

969
01:10:28,562 --> 01:10:29,855
You see?

970
01:10:30,564 --> 01:10:34,943
There's a storm, like golden rain,
and it goes straight into the tower.

971
01:10:36,111 --> 01:10:39,406
- What did she think about the dust?
- Danae?

972
01:10:41,533 --> 01:10:44,745
Well, I think she looks
pretty happy, doesn't she?

973
01:10:46,788 --> 01:10:48,749
She gives herself
to him body and soul.

974
01:10:48,916 --> 01:10:50,792
At least,
that's how Titian painted it.

975
01:10:51,043 --> 01:10:53,754
See? With her legs open like that,

976
01:10:54,505 --> 01:10:56,507
oblivious to what's going on
around her,

977
01:10:57,049 --> 01:10:59,092
without the slightest resistance.

978
01:10:59,301 --> 01:11:01,637
So was this like pornography
at the time?

979
01:11:03,305 --> 01:11:06,642
It was. In fact, this painting
was hidden for centuries.

980
01:11:07,017 --> 01:11:10,521
Philip the Second had it painted
and placed in his private rooms.

981
01:11:10,854 --> 01:11:13,106
Then came others who locked it up,

982
01:11:13,732 --> 01:11:16,068
until Philip the Fourth
inherited it

983
01:11:16,276 --> 01:11:19,488
and placed it in the room
where he took his naps.

984
01:11:20,113 --> 01:11:22,157
His naps or...

985
01:11:22,366 --> 01:11:24,076
something else.

986
01:11:24,785 --> 01:11:26,578
Some of its owners,
like Jupiter,

987
01:11:26,787 --> 01:11:29,665
wanted Danae right nearby.

988
01:11:30,707 --> 01:11:32,209
But others

989
01:11:32,376 --> 01:11:36,338
were like his father,
locking it up so no one saw it.

990
01:11:38,006 --> 01:11:40,592
One king even wanted to burn it,

991
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:46,265
but he didn't manage to, and here
it is where everyone can see it.

992
01:11:47,432 --> 01:11:48,642
<i>Pilar Perez Villar.</i>

993
01:11:52,104 --> 01:11:53,647
What do you mean, gone?

994
01:11:54,565 --> 01:11:56,191
Did she get my messages?

995
01:11:57,901 --> 01:11:59,278
When did she leave?

996
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:01,280
And you don't know where.

997
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,466
Pilar, are you home?

998
01:12:22,634 --> 01:12:24,219
Answer, dammit!

999
01:12:24,761 --> 01:12:25,888
Are you there?

1000
01:13:00,547 --> 01:13:01,882
Hello, Antonio.

1001
01:13:02,799 --> 01:13:04,426
They said it was urgent.

1002
01:13:04,635 --> 01:13:07,095
- Is something wrong?
- I don't know.

1003
01:13:07,888 --> 01:13:09,681
- You don't know?
- No, I don't.

1004
01:13:11,725 --> 01:13:12,935
I don't know what's going on.

1005
01:13:13,143 --> 01:13:15,687
I don't know if Pilar is with
someone else.

1006
01:13:15,854 --> 01:13:18,690
With someone else?
Have you any evidence? Proof?

1007
01:13:19,191 --> 01:13:21,944
- No.
- Then what makes you say that?

1008
01:13:22,110 --> 01:13:24,905
She's different, dammit!
I can see it in her eyes.

1009
01:13:25,072 --> 01:13:28,367
I can see it in her face.
In everything. She's different.

1010
01:13:28,534 --> 01:13:31,161
- How is she different?
- In everything, shit.

1011
01:13:31,328 --> 01:13:34,081
She's prettier, she dresses up more,
she's more everything.

1012
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:38,585
- She talks about love all the time.
- Didn't she start a new museum job?

1013
01:13:39,419 --> 01:13:42,047
Then it's normal she'd dress up
to deal with people.

1014
01:13:42,214 --> 01:13:43,590
- Normal?
- You dress up, too.

1015
01:13:43,757 --> 01:13:45,634
- But that's different.
- Why?

1016
01:13:45,801 --> 01:13:50,472
Because I do it to work,
not to talk about stupid things.

1017
01:13:50,806 --> 01:13:54,476
Not about gods or any fucking crap.
I talk about normal stuff, dammit.

1018
01:13:54,685 --> 01:13:56,979
So what bothers you
is that she dresses up

1019
01:13:57,146 --> 01:13:58,689
or that she talks about painting?

1020
01:13:58,856 --> 01:14:01,692
That damn museum.
She knows it upsets me.

1021
01:14:01,859 --> 01:14:05,195
They don't even pay her. Why do it?
To bug me? To provoke me?

1022
01:14:05,404 --> 01:14:06,613
Maybe she likes it.

1023
01:14:06,822 --> 01:14:10,492
Yeah, sure she fucking likes it.
She likes bugging me, that's it.

1024
01:14:11,743 --> 01:14:13,745
You still haven't said
why you're upset.

1025
01:14:14,413 --> 01:14:17,624
She'll meet one of those jerks
who go to museums, dammit.

1026
01:14:17,791 --> 01:14:19,543
What if they fall in love?

1027
01:14:19,710 --> 01:14:21,295
What will I have left?

1028
01:14:21,461 --> 01:14:23,338
Antonio, Pilar came back home.

1029
01:14:23,672 --> 01:14:25,340
Why would she leave?

1030
01:14:25,507 --> 01:14:28,594
Why should she stay?
Why the hell would she stay with me?

1031
01:14:28,802 --> 01:14:30,596
What can I talk about with her?

1032
01:14:30,762 --> 01:14:34,141
About orders? Delivery notes?
What the hell can I offer her?

1033
01:14:34,308 --> 01:14:38,437
A shitty salary, a shitty apartment,
vacation with my parents...

1034
01:14:39,188 --> 01:14:41,899
Why should she stay
with a guy like me?

1035
01:14:44,526 --> 01:14:47,362
Because you love her,

1036
01:14:48,822 --> 01:14:52,326
you listen to her,
you respect her

1037
01:14:53,327 --> 01:14:54,870
and don't threaten her

1038
01:14:55,245 --> 01:14:57,873
or insult her, or hit her,
or humiliate her.

1039
01:15:05,589 --> 01:15:07,424
"I have an important job.

1040
01:15:07,549 --> 01:15:10,427
I keep certain birds from
devouring the fertilizer,

1041
01:15:10,636 --> 01:15:12,095
- the seeds... "
- Hi.

1042
01:15:14,723 --> 01:15:16,141
- Do you have homework?
- No.

1043
01:15:16,975 --> 01:15:18,769
Okay then, that's done.

1044
01:15:19,645 --> 01:15:21,438
Can I play with my Playstation?

1045
01:15:27,861 --> 01:15:29,571
Are you hungry?
you want supper?

1046
01:15:30,364 --> 01:15:31,490
No.

1047
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:35,160
I have homework, too.

1048
01:15:45,546 --> 01:15:47,005
Is something wrong?

1049
01:15:49,883 --> 01:15:51,510
I was at the museum.

1050
01:15:52,302 --> 01:15:53,762
At the museum?

1051
01:15:57,474 --> 01:15:58,767
I didn't see you.

1052
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:01,145
I saw you.

1053
01:16:03,856 --> 01:16:05,023
You looked very pretty.

1054
01:17:46,708 --> 01:17:49,920
The painter says
we can listen to paintings,

1055
01:17:50,754 --> 01:17:53,215
hear them here inside
like when we listen to music.

1056
01:17:54,049 --> 01:17:56,301
Because the colors are like notes

1057
01:17:56,510 --> 01:17:58,887
and they are repeated as
in a melody.

1058
01:18:01,056 --> 01:18:02,432
Three yellows,

1059
01:18:04,309 --> 01:18:05,519
two blues,

1060
01:18:05,853 --> 01:18:07,271
then yellow again,

1061
01:18:08,856 --> 01:18:11,024
and a silence, some white.

1062
01:18:11,692 --> 01:18:14,653
White makes no sound,
it doesn't hurt.

1063
01:18:15,904 --> 01:18:18,407
If we can hear them,
we can also feel them.

1064
01:18:19,908 --> 01:18:21,785
Green is balance.

1065
01:18:21,994 --> 01:18:23,871
- We've got an offer for a job.
- We do?

1066
01:18:24,079 --> 01:18:26,456
Blue is depth,

1067
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:29,209
and purple...

1068
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:32,004
purple is fear.

1069
01:18:50,522 --> 01:18:51,940
- Hi.
- Hi.

1070
01:18:52,691 --> 01:18:54,651
- How are you?
- Fine.

1071
01:18:55,527 --> 01:18:57,863
Antonio, they've offered us a job.

1072
01:18:59,656 --> 01:19:01,533
They want to give us a test first.

1073
01:19:02,784 --> 01:19:04,119
A test for what?

1074
01:19:04,286 --> 01:19:07,122
To be a guide
for exhibits in Madrid.

1075
01:19:09,041 --> 01:19:11,543
Madrid?
You're going to work in Madrid?

1076
01:19:12,211 --> 01:19:14,254
Well, if they hire us,
I can commute.

1077
01:19:15,881 --> 01:19:17,382
Yeah, but what for?

1078
01:19:18,342 --> 01:19:20,511
Why the hell work in Madrid?

1079
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:22,429
I like it, Antonio.

1080
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:25,474
I forget about myself
and everything.

1081
01:19:27,851 --> 01:19:31,063
- It's something I think I can do.
- No doubt about that.

1082
01:19:31,188 --> 01:19:33,232
You were always good
at useless things.

1083
01:19:35,609 --> 01:19:38,237
But what's the problem?
Are you bored with me?

1084
01:19:39,738 --> 01:19:41,782
Anything to get away from home?

1085
01:19:45,118 --> 01:19:48,413
What if we all go to Madrid?
The three of us.

1086
01:19:48,872 --> 01:19:50,457
Get out of Toledo.

1087
01:19:51,083 --> 01:19:54,586
Would you like that?
And screw everything.

1088
01:19:55,045 --> 01:19:57,339
Where would I work?
Would you support me?

1089
01:19:58,465 --> 01:20:00,342
We'll find something.

1090
01:20:00,551 --> 01:20:02,052
You're good, Antonio.

1091
01:20:02,427 --> 01:20:04,513
You could do much more
than they let you.

1092
01:20:04,847 --> 01:20:06,557
- We'll see, Shorty.
- Let's try it.

1093
01:20:06,765 --> 01:20:09,893
Aren't we okay here?
you want to spoil everything?

1094
01:20:10,352 --> 01:20:12,396
- No, I don't.
- Then I don't see why

1095
01:20:12,604 --> 01:20:15,649
you need to go to interviews,
dammit.

1096
01:20:17,067 --> 01:20:19,736
Why am I seeing a psychologist
like some idiot?

1097
01:20:19,903 --> 01:20:21,071
What for?

1098
01:20:21,446 --> 01:20:24,491
So that you can move away
and leave me here writing crap

1099
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:25,659
in some notebook?

1100
01:20:25,868 --> 01:20:27,494
It's not crap, Antonio.

1101
01:20:29,163 --> 01:20:31,456
you want to leave? Then leave.

1102
01:20:31,707 --> 01:20:35,043
Leave already, fuck it. But quit
driving me crazy. Just leave!

1103
01:20:46,388 --> 01:20:50,684
"Your heart goes faster and it's
like your head goes all fuzzy

1104
01:20:51,685 --> 01:20:54,480
and you can't breathe.
It feels like

1105
01:20:55,981 --> 01:20:58,650
your neck is full of ants

1106
01:20:59,234 --> 01:21:01,028
and you dry up inside.

1107
01:21:02,279 --> 01:21:05,115
The air goes still,
all the sounds stop.

1108
01:21:05,741 --> 01:21:08,494
Everything stops and you can't see. "

1109
01:21:10,329 --> 01:21:12,039
That's what fear is like,
Antonio.

1110
01:21:13,707 --> 01:21:15,083
Don't be afraid.

1111
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:17,836
Don't be afraid, Antonio.

1112
01:21:19,463 --> 01:21:20,839
Don't be afraid.

1113
01:21:46,740 --> 01:21:49,076
They even had to do that
any old way.

1114
01:21:50,369 --> 01:21:53,205
Your photo is much prettier
than Ana's.

1115
01:21:56,959 --> 01:21:58,836
- How is everything, dear?
- Fine.

1116
01:21:59,044 --> 01:22:00,754
I haven't seen you
for so long.

1117
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:04,466
Spoken with your sister?

1118
01:22:06,718 --> 01:22:07,928
No.

1119
01:22:10,764 --> 01:22:12,307
When will you two make up?

1120
01:22:20,649 --> 01:22:22,526
I'll never forgive myself

1121
01:22:24,027 --> 01:22:26,989
for not going to Valencia when
my brother Alfonso fell ill.

1122
01:22:27,948 --> 01:22:29,283
You remember Uncle Alfonso?

1123
01:22:30,826 --> 01:22:33,620
You know what your father was like.

1124
01:22:34,037 --> 01:22:36,248
He tried everything to stop me

1125
01:22:37,332 --> 01:22:38,876
and in the end I didn't go.

1126
01:22:41,170 --> 01:22:42,296
And after that

1127
01:22:42,462 --> 01:22:44,548
I never got another chance
to talk with him.

1128
01:22:45,299 --> 01:22:46,550
And I really loved him.

1129
01:22:48,343 --> 01:22:50,137
But your father
couldn't stand him

1130
01:22:50,721 --> 01:22:52,514
and I let him come between us.

1131
01:22:53,974 --> 01:22:55,601
- Hi.
- Hi.

1132
01:22:56,226 --> 01:22:57,853
I'm so glad you came.

1133
01:23:00,397 --> 01:23:02,774
The thought of him alone
today of all days.

1134
01:23:03,025 --> 01:23:04,276
He's not alone, he's dead.

1135
01:23:04,485 --> 01:23:07,029
Well, it's still his birthday.
Look.

1136
01:23:08,697 --> 01:23:10,657
Thank you. Well.

1137
01:23:11,992 --> 01:23:14,203
I'll leave you two to talk.

1138
01:23:14,828 --> 01:23:17,789
That's your only regret?
Not going to Valencia?

1139
01:23:19,541 --> 01:23:21,710
You likedy our life as a martyr?

1140
01:23:22,002 --> 01:23:24,213
Always there with a man
who ruined your life?

1141
01:23:25,297 --> 01:23:27,341
Or did you like being so good,

1142
01:23:27,758 --> 01:23:29,468
so understanding, everyone

1143
01:23:29,676 --> 01:23:31,970
pitying you
for putting up with so much?

1144
01:23:33,931 --> 01:23:36,558
- I did it for your sake.
- That's alie.

1145
01:23:36,725 --> 01:23:38,143
You did it for yourself.

1146
01:23:38,477 --> 01:23:40,187
I did the best I could, dear.

1147
01:23:42,564 --> 01:23:44,066
You try to do things better.

1148
01:23:44,858 --> 01:23:46,193
What are you talking about?

1149
01:23:52,991 --> 01:23:55,536
Sorry, Ana.
I have to go pick Juan up.

1150
01:23:56,954 --> 01:23:58,163
Pilar.

1151
01:23:58,747 --> 01:24:00,082
Pilar!

1152
01:24:36,952 --> 01:24:38,078
Antonio.

1153
01:24:39,079 --> 01:24:41,957
Tomorrow I'm going to Madrid
with Lola to guide an exhibit.

1154
01:24:44,793 --> 01:24:46,920
If we do it well,
we'll get the job.

1155
01:25:53,153 --> 01:25:56,782
- So you're going to that thing.
- Yes, Lola's expecting me.

1156
01:25:57,032 --> 01:25:58,700
Look at me when I talk to you.

1157
01:25:59,868 --> 01:26:01,078
Turn around.

1158
01:26:03,664 --> 01:26:06,542
- That's some get up.
- I want to look presentable.

1159
01:26:06,959 --> 01:26:10,087
- And you want people to look at you.
- I didn't say that.

1160
01:26:12,172 --> 01:26:14,133
- That's what turns you on.
- No.

1161
01:26:14,299 --> 01:26:15,467
Liar.

1162
01:26:17,761 --> 01:26:19,805
Like when you talk about paintings.

1163
01:26:22,307 --> 01:26:24,726
Walking around
while they follow you.

1164
01:26:25,227 --> 01:26:26,812
That's what turns you on.

1165
01:26:27,062 --> 01:26:29,231
Letting them look at
your legs and ass.

1166
01:26:31,608 --> 01:26:32,818
Show me how you do it.

1167
01:26:33,569 --> 01:26:35,529
Come to the museum anytime.

1168
01:26:36,947 --> 01:26:38,282
I want to see it now.

1169
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:40,576
Go on, do it here for me.

1170
01:26:40,742 --> 01:26:43,495
That story about the god
who fucks his brains out.

1171
01:26:43,662 --> 01:26:45,289
- Antonio, don't.
- Do it!

1172
01:26:45,789 --> 01:26:47,374
They're expecting me.

1173
01:26:48,041 --> 01:26:50,002
Let's see, this one.

1174
01:26:51,044 --> 01:26:54,339
The naked fat ladies.
What are they doing? This one.

1175
01:26:55,090 --> 01:26:59,511
The goddess of menopause
feeling up the goddess of cellulite?

1176
01:27:00,762 --> 01:27:01,972
Don't you like it?

1177
01:27:03,265 --> 01:27:05,267
Let's get rid of it.
This one?

1178
01:27:05,809 --> 01:27:07,144
Not this one either.

1179
01:27:07,311 --> 01:27:09,521
And this one?
What's wrong?

1180
01:27:10,147 --> 01:27:11,315
Go on, tell the story.

1181
01:27:11,482 --> 01:27:13,108
Am I not enough of an audience?

1182
01:27:13,275 --> 01:27:15,861
No. What you like
is being looked at.

1183
01:27:16,028 --> 01:27:17,946
It turns you on
when they look at you.

1184
01:27:18,113 --> 01:27:19,698
Your ass, your tits,
everything, right?

1185
01:27:21,074 --> 01:27:24,119
- Antonio!
- That's what turns you on.

1186
01:27:26,830 --> 01:27:30,209
That's what turns you on.
That's what turns you on, right?

1187
01:27:30,417 --> 01:27:32,127
No, Antonio!

1188
01:27:37,049 --> 01:27:40,093
That's what you like.
Let everybody see you.

1189
01:27:40,427 --> 01:27:43,597
- Let everyone see you.
- No, stop!

1190
01:27:48,143 --> 01:27:50,312
What's wrong,
not enough of an audience?

1191
01:27:50,521 --> 01:27:51,730
Everybody's looking at you.

1192
01:27:52,564 --> 01:27:55,776
Antonio, please.
Let me in!

1193
01:27:56,902 --> 01:27:57,986
Let me in!

1194
01:28:00,197 --> 01:28:03,784
Are you happy? Did the neighbors
get a good look? Did they see you?

1195
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:05,577
Are you happy?

1196
01:28:19,383 --> 01:28:20,676
Go clean yourself up.

1197
01:28:42,656 --> 01:28:44,533
Okay, you want
to report an assault.

1198
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:47,077
When did it take place?

1199
01:28:48,537 --> 01:28:50,414
This morning. In my home.

1200
01:28:51,582 --> 01:28:53,208
The assailant attacked you
in your home?

1201
01:28:53,792 --> 01:28:55,377
How did he get in?

1202
01:28:56,336 --> 01:28:58,672
He lives there.
He's my husband.

1203
01:28:59,381 --> 01:29:00,174
I see.

1204
01:29:00,799 --> 01:29:02,593
Do you have a medical report?

1205
01:29:03,469 --> 01:29:04,678
No.

1206
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:07,222
You know that

1207
01:29:07,389 --> 01:29:11,101
after you press charges your husband
will be called to make a statement?

1208
01:29:12,394 --> 01:29:14,771
You may want to leave your home,
for your own safety.

1209
01:29:15,355 --> 01:29:17,900
Shall I put you in touch
with social services?

1210
01:29:19,443 --> 01:29:23,197
All right. Where did he hurt you?

1211
01:29:26,950 --> 01:29:28,994
No, there are no injuries
on the outside.

1212
01:29:30,871 --> 01:29:32,539
They're on the inside.

1213
01:29:35,083 --> 01:29:37,669
Let's see if you can
describe what happened.

1214
01:29:38,128 --> 01:29:40,339
You say he didn't
attack you physically.

1215
01:29:40,506 --> 01:29:43,592
Did he insult you?
Did he threaten you verbally?

1216
01:29:46,303 --> 01:29:47,679
He broke everything.

1217
01:29:49,973 --> 01:29:52,017
Did he break anything of yours?

1218
01:29:58,273 --> 01:29:59,483
Everything.

1219
01:29:59,691 --> 01:30:01,318
He broke everything.

1220
01:30:01,693 --> 01:30:03,654
Everything, everything.

1221
01:30:05,781 --> 01:30:07,324
Take it easy, ma'am.

1222
01:30:11,703 --> 01:30:12,704
Excuse me.

1223
01:30:13,205 --> 01:30:14,706
Wait.

1224
01:30:14,998 --> 01:30:18,502
Why don't you sit down for a moment
until you feel better?

1225
01:30:19,878 --> 01:30:22,339
Something to drink?
A glass of water?

1226
01:30:22,548 --> 01:30:23,465
No. Excuse me.

1227
01:30:23,674 --> 01:30:26,802
I won't take up anymore
of your time. Sorry to bother you.

1228
01:30:44,111 --> 01:30:45,988
What's wrong?
Won't you talk to me?

1229
01:30:47,156 --> 01:30:48,490
Say something.

1230
01:30:49,158 --> 01:30:51,034
- What can I say?
- I don't know.

1231
01:30:51,243 --> 01:30:53,871
What you did today. Anything.

1232
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:57,833
- I didn't do anything.
- Well talk to the kid at least.

1233
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,586
This is more like a funeral
than a family dinner.

1234
01:31:03,547 --> 01:31:04,965
- Can I go?
- We're not finished.

1235
01:31:05,132 --> 01:31:07,259
- Where?
- Let him go.

1236
01:31:07,468 --> 01:31:08,969
It's not his fault.

1237
01:31:12,347 --> 01:31:13,891
Can I go to Angel's house?

1238
01:31:15,392 --> 01:31:16,518
For ten minutes.

1239
01:31:32,451 --> 01:31:35,412
I apologized, didn't I?
What more do you want?

1240
01:31:35,579 --> 01:31:37,080
Nothing. Nothing at all.

1241
01:31:37,289 --> 01:31:39,708
What should I do?
Grovel on my knees?

1242
01:31:39,917 --> 01:31:44,004
I don't care what you say or do,
Antonio. I don't care.

1243
01:31:44,630 --> 01:31:46,757
I already said I was sorry.

1244
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:51,011
- It won't happen again.
- I don't believe you.

1245
01:31:51,220 --> 01:31:52,930
And I don't love you.

1246
01:31:53,180 --> 01:31:56,433
- Don't say that.
- I'll shut up, but it's true.

1247
01:31:57,559 --> 01:31:59,853
I don't love you.
I never will again.

1248
01:32:06,735 --> 01:32:08,111
What are you going to do?

1249
01:32:11,323 --> 01:32:12,825
What? Leave me?

1250
01:32:16,912 --> 01:32:18,872
If you do, I'll kill myself.

1251
01:32:21,667 --> 01:32:24,586
- Go ahead. I don't care.
- I'll kill myself, you hear me?

1252
01:32:27,005 --> 01:32:30,509
- If you leave I'll do it.
- I want you to leave me alone.

1253
01:32:34,012 --> 01:32:35,973
I'll kill myself, you hear me?

1254
01:32:36,348 --> 01:32:37,307
Look at me.

1255
01:32:39,226 --> 01:32:40,227
Pilar!

1256
01:32:41,103 --> 01:32:42,396
Pilar, look at me!

1257
01:32:45,274 --> 01:32:48,152
Look at me!
I'll kill myself!

1258
01:32:48,777 --> 01:32:50,946
If you leave,
I'll take my own life!

1259
01:32:52,781 --> 01:32:54,741
I don't give a shit!

1260
01:32:54,908 --> 01:32:57,035
- I don't care!
- Stop!

1261
01:32:58,328 --> 01:32:59,788
- I don't care.
- Stop!

1262
01:33:04,585 --> 01:33:05,669
Yes.

1263
01:33:06,295 --> 01:33:07,546
Yes.

1264
01:33:08,255 --> 01:33:10,591
No, we haven't heard anything yet.

1265
01:33:12,050 --> 01:33:14,011
Okay, darling. Bye now.

1266
01:33:15,679 --> 01:33:17,723
Don't worry,
they're watching a movie.

1267
01:33:18,015 --> 01:33:19,183
Thank you.

1268
01:33:26,648 --> 01:33:27,691
Wait here.

1269
01:33:29,401 --> 01:33:31,987
Look, she's one of your kind.

1270
01:33:38,076 --> 01:33:40,454
It's probably all the rage now.

1271
01:33:42,206 --> 01:33:44,541
- Are you Antonio's family?
- Yes.

1272
01:33:45,334 --> 01:33:46,960
He's fine.
The cuts are superficial.

1273
01:33:47,127 --> 01:33:49,004
We gave him a sedative
and he's calm.

1274
01:33:49,546 --> 01:33:51,006
He'll stay here tonight.

1275
01:33:51,173 --> 01:33:53,842
We'll send him home tomorrow.

1276
01:33:55,844 --> 01:33:58,806
- All right, thank you.
- Can we leave?

1277
01:33:58,972 --> 01:34:00,933
Sure.
You can't see him till tomorrow.

1278
01:34:01,141 --> 01:34:02,100
Okay, thanks.

1279
01:34:15,030 --> 01:34:16,323
Would you like some tea?

1280
01:34:16,490 --> 01:34:17,741
A glass of milk?

1281
01:34:18,158 --> 01:34:20,202
No, thank you.

1282
01:34:31,171 --> 01:34:33,966
How am I going to tell Juan?
What should I say?

1283
01:34:37,261 --> 01:34:39,346
You don't have to tell him anything.

1284
01:34:40,264 --> 01:34:41,890
Antonio wasn't serious about it.

1285
01:34:42,099 --> 01:34:44,184
He wouldn't have done it
in front of you.

1286
01:34:48,522 --> 01:34:50,065
I can't go back to him.

1287
01:34:51,692 --> 01:34:52,901
Not again.

1288
01:34:55,696 --> 01:35:00,117
Ana, I need you to look after Juan
until I can take him with me.

1289
01:35:00,450 --> 01:35:02,077
- Of course.
- Will you?

1290
01:35:02,244 --> 01:35:04,538
Of course.
And if you want to stay here,

1291
01:35:04,705 --> 01:35:07,624
- if you need money, anything.
- No.

1292
01:35:09,209 --> 01:35:12,254
I'm sure Lola and Rosa
will help me out.

1293
01:35:18,677 --> 01:35:21,138
I feel like
I haven't been much help.

1294
01:35:24,808 --> 01:35:26,435
You listened to me, but...

1295
01:35:27,102 --> 01:35:30,355
I couldn't speak.

1296
01:35:31,940 --> 01:35:33,484
And now you can?

1297
01:35:37,946 --> 01:35:39,656
I need to see myself.

1298
01:35:42,701 --> 01:35:44,077
I need to see myself.

1299
01:35:45,913 --> 01:35:46,955
I don't know.

1300
01:35:48,415 --> 01:35:50,209
I don't know who I am.

1301
01:35:52,961 --> 01:35:54,671
I don't know who I am.

1302
01:35:54,963 --> 01:35:57,257
I haven't seen myself for so long.

1303
01:36:03,931 --> 01:36:05,557
I can't explain it.

1304
01:36:10,062 --> 01:36:13,398
Count on me for anything you want,

1305
01:36:13,607 --> 01:36:15,108
anytime you need me.

1306
01:36:17,528 --> 01:36:18,862
Thank you, Ana.

1307
01:36:50,644 --> 01:36:53,522
Pilar, we don't have all day.
Where's the bedroom?

1308
01:36:54,398 --> 01:36:55,524
Over there.

1309
01:37:05,367 --> 01:37:08,245
- Is this it?
- Yes, that whole side. It's mine.

1310
01:37:15,544 --> 01:37:16,712
This too?

1311
01:37:16,879 --> 01:37:17,921
No, not that.

1312
01:37:54,166 --> 01:37:55,709
- Is that everything?
- Yes.

1313
01:37:55,918 --> 01:37:57,127
Let's go then.
