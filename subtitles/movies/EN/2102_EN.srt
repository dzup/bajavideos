1
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,485
Aldo, come on!
Go get the bike!

2
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,415
Get the bike down, you harelip!

3
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:18,069
Get the bike down for me...
or I'll fucking kick your ass!

4
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:26,409
Changuila, let him go!

5
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,078
Aldo, get the bike down for me!

6
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:59,946
You retard!
I'll get you when you get home!

7
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,060
Cristian, help me! Hurry up!

8
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,895
- Come on, I can't on my own!
- Wait!

9
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:22,102
Close.

10
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:23,936
Close, close.

11
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,105
Bend. Arch.

12
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,149
Don't touch yourself.

13
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,120
Open.

14
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,983
Kids, slow down!

15
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:45,064
I'm not sure I'll be able to go
to the pool opening.

16
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:47,066
- Everybody's going.
- It's right there?

17
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,193
Of course.
I doubt it would be at the vet's.

18
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,998
- That's disgusting.
- That cream's yours.

19
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,671
He didn't have enough room
to make it straight.

20
00:02:56,676 --> 00:03:00,246
It looks like a capital L.
Everybody's going.

21
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:03,147
He already has 70 people signed up
and still hasn't opened.

22
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,812
Well, but listen,
the turtle thing is disgusting.

23
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:08,854
I know who told you that.

24
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:11,023
Hold this, I've got the cylinders.

25
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,788
He shouldn't have built the pool
behind the vet's.

26
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:19,827
- Are they water turtles?
- No, that's not true.

27
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,828
If not, they'll drown.

28
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:24,496
What diseases do they carry?

29
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:27,335
It's impossible.
The chlorine would kill them.

30
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:28,897
Chlorine even kills plants.

31
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:31,977
It'll kill them,
even if they're water turtles.

32
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:35,239
Besides, they're very aggressive,
aren't they?

33
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,039
They brought us one
from Santiago del Estero.

34
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,286
We couldn't sunbathe
in the garden.

35
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,311
Go get your backpack,
it's on the table.

36
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,878
Hurry, hurry!

37
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,425
Open up.
You're going to suffocate.

38
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,025
Why are you naked?

39
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,497
That's enough, girls.

40
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,362
Watch those fingers!

41
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,865
Come here!

42
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:02,675
Let go!

43
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,343
Come on!

44
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,174
Get out of the water!

45
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:11,414
Your hair looks gorgeous.
The color is very flattering.

46
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,851
Too bad it's fading
with the chlorine.

47
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:16,884
- Should I put the dish in the trunk?
- Yes, please.

48
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:19,789
- We want to stay a bit longer.
- Go on, get in the back.

49
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,518
Come on, look for it.

50
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:51,996
THE HEADLESS WOMAN

51
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,995
This water is going to be
good for your hair.

52
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:27,669
Good thing someone brought you.

53
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,134
This water is a blessing.

54
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,215
Bring her in
and have her sit down.

55
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,554
Hi, Olga.

56
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:46,989
- It's pouring!

57
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,359
Take her down the hall,
to the left.

58
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,022
She'd already be admitted
for her physical.

59
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,297
It's really pouring!

60
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,240
For 3 pesos, a cab will take
you to the plaza.

61
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:06,742
Not the wedding rings.

62
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:09,246
It's just a head X-ray.

63
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:11,873
Just remove the barrettes
and the earrings.

64
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,476
What happened?
Did you bang your head?

65
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,191
Don't move.

66
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,821
- Nothing hurts.
- That's good.

67
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,762
Hold your breath.

68
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:38,500
She's falling asleep.

69
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:51,382
The lady is falling asleep.

70
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,294
Ma'am, don't fall asleep.

71
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,897
You need to keep
the blood flowing.

72
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:03,524
If not, it'll get blocked
and you'll be in a lot of trouble.

73
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,072
Please, fill this out.

74
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,910
Yes, at Emergency.

75
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,916
Not my name, yours.

76
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:27,224
Olguita, can you hand me
another form?

77
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,996
They're right there,
behind the phone.

78
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:41,098
Here's the hospital form.

79
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,509
Hang on, I'll sign it for you.

80
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,941
Wasn't that woman
Dr. Berardo's sister?

81
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,613
Yes, I thought
she looked familiar.

82
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,647
Look. An upper one.

83
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,647
Hurry up, Nadia!

84
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,387
Elizabeth Andrada.

85
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,632
The officer is looking for you.
Come on out.

86
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,701
Come on, behave yourself.

87
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:51,001
They'll prolong your sentence.

88
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:54,475
You'll get in trouble.
You'll get the officer in trouble.

89
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,310
It's not her fault.

90
00:11:56,716 --> 00:12:00,015
Crying's not going to help.

91
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:02,311
I told you.
She was in the bathroom.

92
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:06,152
- She doesn't want to come out.
- Listen to that cough.

93
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,550
Come out, Elizabeth.

94
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,995
Come on, Elizabeth.
Open up!

95
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:54,767
It'sjust rust.
Let it run and it'll clear up.

96
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,315
Good night.

97
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:29,175
Oh, hello.

98
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,972
Would you like something to eat?

99
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,940
No, I'm okay.

100
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,794
You were really exhausted.

101
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:58,995
You must be hungry.

102
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:02,431
Would you like
a roast beef sandwich?

103
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:05,835
Maybe some tea.

104
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:34,469
Vero!

105
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:36,666
What are you doing here so late?

106
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,677
I wanted a cup of tea.

107
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:42,069
What's wrong, Vero?

108
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,879
Charge it to the room.

109
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:46,711
- Should I take it up?
- No.

110
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,252
Okay.

111
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:55,583
You shouldn't be alone. I'll tell
Josefina to come if you want.

112
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,402
Are you okay?

113
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,883
Why don't I call Josefina?

114
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:19,951
No, thank you.

115
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:39,061
Did you park in the street?

116
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:44,637
Here you are.

117
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:49,105
I don't want anymore.

118
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:52,209
Wouldn't you like
another sandwich?

119
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,783
No, thanks, I'm fine.

120
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,249
You're tired.

121
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:37,625
Okay, I'm leaving.

122
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:32,140
Didn't Aunt Lala have
the same painting in her house?

123
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:34,676
It's identical.

124
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:13,020
Don't stay here.

125
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:16,918
Go on home.

126
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,091
I don't have my car.

127
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:26,063
Do you want me to drop you off
at the door or at the corner?

128
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,065
Fine.

129
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:35,606
Okay.

130
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,706
Thanks.

131
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:19,410
It got late and we got
stuck in the rain.

132
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,216
It was pouring.

133
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:34,561
Driving was dangerous.
We were going 2 miles an hour.

134
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:38,061
Where's your car, Vero?

135
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,708
Come on, sweetheart.

136
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:54,515
I'll try on the swimming trunks
you bought me.

137
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,090
Don't be mad.

138
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,431
Come on, come on!

139
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,967
I'm going to take a shower
and go to the studio.

140
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,738
You wouldn't believe
how we froze.

141
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:52,099
Kind of small, no?

142
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:02,018
I'll have a cup of coffee
and go to the studio.

143
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,849
Come on, make some coffee.

144
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,303
I'll take this out.

145
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:38,956
Do you want me to skin it?

146
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,651
No, you'll get all dirty.

147
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:44,487
I'll do it, it's no trouble.

148
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:47,228
Okay, but don't cut yourself.

149
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,802
Rinse it a little.

150
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,864
Some coffee?

151
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,873
There's some already made.

152
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:03,839
Over there.

153
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:26,832
Are you going into town today?

154
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:29,238
You parked nearby, didn't you?

155
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,007
I'm off.

156
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:40,341
Oh, hi. Just a minute, please.

157
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,521
They're waiting for you
at the office.

158
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,418
I'm without a car.

159
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:51,928
I'll call you a cab.

160
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:55,728
She's leaving now.
Yes, goodbye.

161
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:06,369
Hello?
Yes, I need a car.

162
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,740
40... 60...

163
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,074
What was it?

164
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,052
405.

165
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:20,990
Good morning, ma'am.

166
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,719
To the dental office.

167
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,226
The one at 3 Cerritos, yes.

168
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:32,993
It's on its way.

169
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,773
I got stuck on the street.

170
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:43,344
It flooded
and I stayed in the car.

171
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:56,960
The water almost reached
the gear shift.

172
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:00,027
It was quite a storm.

173
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:03,198
It didn't last long,
but it was bad.

174
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,473
Is this okay, ma'am?

175
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:25,780
They're waiting for you.

176
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:48,904
A nurse from Milagro
Hospital called.

177
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:52,739
She says you forgot your car keys
and a few other things.

178
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,420
Should I send someone for them?

179
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:06,688
I can send a courier.

180
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:10,595
No, it's okay.

181
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:17,264
Michi, go on, tell her.

182
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:29,209
The water is cold
and it hurts my teeth.

183
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:40,059
I feel a little...

184
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,800
I don't feel good.

185
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:46,632
Do you want me
to call your brother?

186
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:50,274
No, it's okay.

187
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,572
My stomach's a little upset.

188
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,481
Your mom is here.

189
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:02,711
I'll call you later
about the appointment.

190
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:05,880
I'll tell your brother
to see your patients.

191
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:07,889
It's no trouble.

192
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,725
Or would you rather
call him yourself?

193
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:13,726
No, not right now.

194
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:17,330
Shall I call your husband?
You shouldn't drive.

195
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:21,567
That's not necessary.

196
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:35,152
Thank you.

197
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:39,084
No, you asked me to buy it
for your aunt.

198
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,421
It's the talcum and a refill.

199
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:44,828
Wouldn't you rather
I called a taxi...

200
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:47,330
so you could go home
and rest a bit?

201
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:52,133
I'll go to the hospital
and pick up your things.

202
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:33,544
Guess who?
It's me, it's me.

203
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:38,179
Let me drive.
Are you going to auntie's house?

204
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:40,340
Be careful! The bag!

205
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,409
I crushed it.

206
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:44,578
Josefina's going, not me.

207
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:47,747
My car's at the mechanic's.
How does this work?

208
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,656
My car got flooded.

209
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:05,867
Hi, Vero.

210
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,080
Stupid girl!

211
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:11,206
I've been trying to get her
to rest for weeks.

212
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:12,840
- Give me another kiss.
- She should be in bed.

213
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:16,114
Lots of kids have hepatitis.
It's very contagious.

214
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:19,354
What's this, Vero?

215
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,551
It's nothing.

216
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:27,265
- Would you like a Chinese hair-wash?
- I'll do it!

217
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:30,234
- You should rest.
- I'm going to the office.

218
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:32,929
- You're going to make yourself sick.
- Don't forget the present, okay?

219
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:36,096
There's another leak.
One more kiss.

220
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:40,734
That present is ruined.

221
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,741
This storm has hurt
thousands of people!

222
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:48,484
If it happens every year
it's notjust unfortunate...

223
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:50,753
...it's shameful.

224
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:53,313
Do you want a card?
I think I have one somewhere.

225
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,923
What did I do with the cards?

226
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:59,093
- Ignacio!
- I don't know.

227
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,429
I can't find anything today.

228
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:21,014
I can't find anything today.

229
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,981
Poor aunt, she's unbearable now.

230
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:28,481
Why does everyone
in our family go crazy?

231
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,191
Tell me of one who has died sane.
None.

232
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:36,623
Vero!
You really smashed up the car!

233
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:41,470
What a mess! What did you hit?

234
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,108
A dog ran out in front of me.

235
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:46,800
It's going to cost a fortunel

236
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,029
The "ladies"are here.

237
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,965
Bring the plants, Candita.

238
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,366
Don't let them in the house, ok?

239
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:14,337
Don't let them in the house.

240
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,341
- How are you?
- Not good.

241
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:29,386
You're still sick?

242
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:33,824
- Look at me.
- I'm pretty yellow.

243
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,553
I don't have any nice paper.

244
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,561
We'll stop by a store...

245
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:40,093
...and have them wrap it.

246
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:44,192
I don't know where she
finds these people.

247
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:47,697
All day on their bikes,
like guys.

248
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:50,697
Some days I can't stand them.

249
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:52,377
Your hair is disgusting!

250
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:53,708
Yes.

251
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,710
Hello. You all know each other.

252
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,250
My cousins...

253
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:07,186
...Vero and Josefina.
Sit down, please.

254
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:10,386
After we have some ice cream...

255
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:12,459
...we'll pray the Rosary...

256
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,698
...with the girls from Church.

257
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:22,635
Mother is awake.

258
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,268
She's calm, had her hair done.

259
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:28,903
Zula, there's the hot water.
Could you do her nails?

260
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:33,281
Did you notice?
The virgin is dirty.

261
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:35,884
Her mantle is soiled.

262
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:48,663
You had such a nice figure.

263
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:52,967
A little doll.

264
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:55,432
And Marcos?

265
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:57,130
Well...

266
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,105
You were gorgeous.

267
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:04,682
- And those boys?
- Ex-classmates of Marcos.

268
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:08,618
Isn't that Federico, Mara's son?

269
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:12,148
What a family of crooks!

270
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,686
Look at the skinny arms you had.

271
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,655
You're lucky
not to have had children.

272
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:23,828
Tell her, Vero.

273
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,994
Remember, Lala.

274
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:31,298
Vero's daughters are going
to school in Tucumán.

275
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:34,675
- What are they studying?
- Tell her, Vero.

276
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:38,144
Law. They're going to Law school.

277
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:39,979
Oh well, how bold!

278
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,885
Look at little Candita!

279
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:46,047
- Is that Candita?
- Yes.

280
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,788
I never remember Candita.

281
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:52,293
Candita, how cuddly!

282
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,490
I don't even call her
on her birthday.

283
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:57,027
Okay, okay.

284
00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:59,902
The state senators.

285
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,670
Look at Gallardito with his wife,
what a miracle!

286
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:05,902
They're your relatives, Lala.

287
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:08,835
I don't see Monseñor Pérez.

288
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:11,245
- You passed him.
- Good.

289
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,850
Who's that dancer?

290
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:19,713
The effeminate one?

291
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:21,983
No, Juan Manuel isn't.

292
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:23,559
And in any case, that's
what I like about him.

293
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:25,823
Lala, you're going
to end up alone.

294
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:29,991
Those people are different.

295
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,263
He's different, she's different.

296
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,893
Turn off that waltz!

297
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,430
And the little one
is different, too.

298
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:38,270
He's not effeminate.

299
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:40,411
That voice
doesn't sound like yours.

300
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,512
You were so beautiful.

301
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:55,783
Why let yourself go?

302
00:34:57,728 --> 00:34:59,218
Stop, stop.

303
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:01,424
Give me the remote!
Give it to me!

304
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,767
Back it up.

305
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,603
What is she doing there?

306
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:09,371
It's Genoveva!

307
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:11,975
It's Genoveva.

308
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:17,743
Genoveva had already died.

309
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,645
Genoveva was dead.

310
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:31,287
Vero, I'm talking to Fer.

311
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:33,830
She want's to know if we are going
to Angelica's wedding.

312
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:36,923
Who?

313
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:39,001
Angelica's wedding.

314
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:41,503
Who are you talking to?

315
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,907
Hold on.
Your mom is still half asleep.

316
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:47,738
Your daughter.

317
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:50,774
Angelica is getting married.
We're all invited.

318
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:53,749
I don't really feel like going.

319
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:54,814
Okay.

320
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:57,081
What happened to your car?

321
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,956
A dog ran out in front of me
in the way home.

322
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:05,661
Tell her things are a little
complicated right now.

323
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:10,197
We'll send her a nice present.

324
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,271
Buy something nice.
Use your credit card.

325
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:23,312
Hello, ma'am. The kid
who washes the cars is outside.

326
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,516
Not the SUV.
Do you want him to wash your car?

327
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,381
Okay.

328
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:33,212
You'll have to throw away
the dishes that were in the car.

329
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:36,292
They're all broken.
There's broken glass everywhere.

330
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:42,455
That's without the pillowcases,
which are about 40 pesos more.

331
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,228
How much is that each?

332
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:47,300
We'd have to put... uh...

333
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:50,407
...about 85 more pesos each.
- Mom, stop.

334
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,236
He threw out the tennis shoe.

335
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,537
What are you doing?

336
00:36:57,682 --> 00:36:59,877
Look at the canal. It's full.

337
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,181
Gonzalo, go get the tennis shoe.

338
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,792
There's no water.

339
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:44,149
Are you okay?

340
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:08,978
I'll be right back

341
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,997
Good afternoon.

342
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:43,129
It's horribly crowded.

343
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:48,441
I killed someone on the road.

344
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:58,246
What did you say?

345
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:00,981
I killed someone on the road.

346
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:03,286
I think I run over someone.

347
00:41:57,414 --> 00:41:58,983
Over there.

348
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:00,814
There's something
on the roadside.

349
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,018
It's right there, Marcos.
You passed it.

350
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:14,221
It's a dog.

351
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:15,798
Wait.

352
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:25,040
Wait.

353
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,315
The canal is really full.

354
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:02,573
- There's the dog.
- Don't stop.

355
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:04,844
It's a dog.

356
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:08,180
You got scared.

357
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:10,181
It's okay.

358
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:13,552
I think I ran over someone.

359
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:18,050
You got scared.
You ran over a dog.

360
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,696
You got frightened by the dog.

361
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:23,931
You got scared.

362
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:27,131
You ran over a dog.
There, over there.

363
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,571
Do you want to go back?

364
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:51,123
It's me, it's me.

365
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:53,720
You're exhausted.

366
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:57,562
I arranged to see
your more serious patients.

367
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:00,666
Let's go to your bed.

368
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:19,621
What should I do?

369
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:22,181
- What should I do?
- Sleep.

370
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:26,185
Come on, lie down.

371
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:53,524
I asked Juan Manuel to stop by.

372
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,458
He should be here soon.

373
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:57,519
Who?

374
00:44:57,594 --> 00:44:59,323
Juan Manuel.

375
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:15,735
He'll make you feel better.

376
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:18,879
- He knows what to do.
- Ma'am?

377
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:22,912
What is it?

378
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,988
Mr. Villamayor is parking his car.

379
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:27,018
We'll be right down.

380
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:42,335
Juanma, we've got
a situation.

381
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,541
Will you make us some coffee?

382
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:46,075
I'll bring some right away.

383
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:52,241
I'll call you.

384
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,293
Look, Marcos...

385
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:13,837
You know how much
I've always loved Vero.

386
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:17,466
All of the cousins love her.
We've all been very close.

387
00:46:17,574 --> 00:46:18,905
Of course, Juanma.

388
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:20,944
Vero had quite a scare.

389
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:22,412
I don't think
it's anything serious,

390
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:24,880
- but for her own peace of mind...
- I killed someone on the road.

391
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:28,782
What?

392
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,154
Vero had quite a scare.

393
00:46:34,324 --> 00:46:36,986
She ran over a dog
coming back from Macu's.

394
00:46:37,094 --> 00:46:39,722
On the road by the canal...

395
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:44,300
...right by the little bridge
before the curve.

396
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:46,136
Anyway, she got quite a scare.

397
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:48,730
- It was the weekend of the storm.
- It hadn't started raining.

398
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:53,636
I didn't want to get out.

399
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:55,808
I didn't get out.

400
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:57,445
When was this?

401
00:46:57,614 --> 00:46:59,809
The weekend of the storm.

402
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:02,614
But it hadn't started raining yet.

403
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:06,989
If something had happened,
I would've heard.

404
00:47:07,057 --> 00:47:09,116
The police have to let us know.

405
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:13,158
Don't worry.

406
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,857
The noise must've been terrible.

407
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:19,367
It's a horrible sound.
Believe me, I know.

408
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:22,099
What can you do?

409
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,269
If you swerve...

410
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:26,135
...you might cross over
into the next lane...

411
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:28,505
...and have a real accident.

412
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:31,974
Don't worry.

413
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,013
Nothing happened.

414
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,015
Can I make a phone call?

415
00:47:38,722 --> 00:47:40,952
That way we'll calm down.

416
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:10,815
You can go.

417
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:13,314
Close the door, please.

418
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,377
Chatito!

419
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:45,748
Dr. Villamayor.

420
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:49,751
You're so rude!

421
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:54,456
When did you go?

422
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,532
And what did you catch?

423
00:48:57,668 --> 00:49:00,466
Oh, shit!
A 15 kilo subiri.

424
00:49:01,805 --> 00:49:05,639
Let me know, okay?
I have 10 brand new lures.

425
00:49:07,978 --> 00:49:09,775
Listen, Chatito.

426
00:49:09,846 --> 00:49:11,814
Do you have Gordo Flores's
phone number?

427
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:17,211
No, he's probably not home.

428
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:21,450
You don't have his mobile?

429
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,121
Let me write it down.

430
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:31,061
Next time, let me know.
Don't be so selfish.

431
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:33,931
You knew I was busy!

432
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:36,965
Okay. Thanks, buddy.

433
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:49,953
Gordo? It's Juan Manuel.

434
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:53,116
Call my mobile
when you have a chance.

435
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,923
Rosana is waiting for me.

436
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:57,083
When she's bored,
she starts calling people.

437
00:49:57,227 --> 00:49:58,751
I'm leaving, too.

438
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:07,162
Don't worry. It was nothing.
Just a scare.

439
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:10,963
As soon as he calls,
I'll let you know.

440
00:50:14,244 --> 00:50:16,371
I'm going to get some of
Candita's test results.

441
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:47,533
Hi, Gordo!

442
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:50,870
What's up?

443
00:50:53,784 --> 00:50:56,309
Well, I have a situation.

444
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:01,183
I wanted to know if you'd heard
anything about an accident...

445
00:51:02,859 --> 00:51:04,850
...near the canal...

446
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:08,364
...the weekend of the storm.

447
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:17,537
Nothing. Nothing happened.

448
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:21,242
Nothing happened
that weekend...

449
00:51:42,966 --> 00:51:45,298
Hi, sweetheartl

450
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:48,934
No, we were just getting up.

451
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,699
It's raining there?

452
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,271
No, it's nice here.

453
00:51:55,345 --> 00:51:57,210
We're coming next weekend.

454
00:51:57,314 --> 00:51:58,906
They're coming next weekend.

455
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:04,978
What did she tell you?

456
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,753
It's late.

457
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:14,656
She's probably waiting.
If we're late, I don't know the way.

458
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:21,094
What did I tell you, Candita?
Stay in the car!

459
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:24,331
You're never going to get better.
You don't listen.

460
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:27,939
Zula, put the bags in the back.

461
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:29,942
I need to get one more thing.

462
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,355
That girl should rest,
shouldn't she?

463
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:44,620
Yes, she looks pretty yellow.

464
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:47,322
Okay, by 4:00, 4:30,
we'll be at school.

465
00:52:47,397 --> 00:52:49,592
So come and find me there.

466
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:53,929
The principal wants to talk to you
about "Smile Week".

467
00:52:54,037 --> 00:52:57,006
- Are there a lot of students?
- 100-150, that's all.

468
00:52:57,073 --> 00:52:59,007
Mom, it's getting late!

469
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:04,005
We were talking about this
and that, and I told him:

470
00:53:04,814 --> 00:53:08,477
What were you thinking when you
built the pool behind the vet's...

471
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:11,546
...with all the money
you've put into it?

472
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:14,652
What were you thinking?

473
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,455
He was speechless.

474
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:19,361
And who will convince Teresa...

475
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:20,521
that he's not letting
the turtles loose there?

476
00:53:20,597 --> 00:53:22,032
Vero, can you hand me that?

477
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,201
I had to stop Teresa
from saying that many times.

478
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,566
I didn't say a word to Horacio.

479
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:28,297
Even though he asks,
'cause he suspects something.

480
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:33,676
He's got enough
with that mannish daughter of his.

481
00:53:34,744 --> 00:53:36,803
Turn left at the next corner.

482
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:56,397
Three of these will be fine.

483
00:53:56,466 --> 00:53:59,902
For the jasmine,
I'll need a little bit bigger one.

484
00:54:00,136 --> 00:54:02,195
Yes, I have some.

485
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:04,899
I have some at the warehouse.

486
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,675
Changuila!

487
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:22,215
Bring me 3 of the large ones.

488
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:26,785
And one with a bigger opening.

489
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:33,064
The other one.
That one's better.

490
00:54:33,136 --> 00:54:35,798
This one's nice.
It's blooming.

491
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:37,898
I'll carry it for you.

492
00:54:42,345 --> 00:54:45,439
I can't reach.
Aldo put it too high.

493
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:47,649
Go bring the plants.

494
00:54:50,153 --> 00:54:52,087
You'll have to come back Thursday.

495
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:54,487
I'm short one kid.

496
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:57,059
Can't someone get them down?

497
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,785
There's one of the kids
that's not showing up.

498
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,625
And they're too high.

499
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:05,831
We'll come back for them
another day.

500
00:55:06,536 --> 00:55:09,767
Don't eat that! It's fried!

501
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:13,442
Give that liver a rest, Candita!
Stay in the car!

502
00:55:18,214 --> 00:55:19,806
Where are they going?

503
00:55:19,883 --> 00:55:22,317
They can't drag themselves.
Somebody has to move them.

504
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:24,181
Where do they come from?

505
00:55:24,354 --> 00:55:26,117
They drag themselves from there.

506
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,267
The branches
can't move themselves.

507
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:42,471
How stupid.

508
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:47,707
Do you feel better?

509
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:52,046
Yes, I'm fine.
It was nothing.

510
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:53,941
Look! There's more over here!

511
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:56,884
Candita, let's go.
Come on, girls.

512
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:28,584
How awful! An accident!

513
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:40,526
They're looking for something.

514
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,762
There's something in the canal.

515
00:56:48,037 --> 00:56:49,698
Keep going.

516
00:56:50,273 --> 00:56:51,900
More, more.

517
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:24,239
What happened?

518
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:29,643
The firemen
aren't saying anything.

519
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:33,604
The sewer is backed up.
It could be a person or a calf.

520
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:37,879
Last year, the canal got stuck
with an animal that fell in there.

521
00:57:38,488 --> 00:57:40,479
Mom, close the window.
There's a horrible smell.

522
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:42,057
Thank you.

523
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,593
I'll turn on the air.

524
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:13,485
Try flourescent light.
It's much cheaper.

525
00:58:13,556 --> 00:58:14,750
You think so?

526
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:17,622
Isn't the light
kind of deathly pale?

527
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:20,026
No, it's better.

528
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:24,027
We're leaving, ok? Juanma's
coming in for a minute and we'll go.

529
00:58:26,803 --> 00:58:28,202
Who is it?

530
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:32,140
It's me, Lala.
Are you awake?

531
00:58:36,412 --> 00:58:38,004
That's a strange voice.

532
00:58:38,081 --> 00:58:39,309
It's me.

533
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:41,848
Would you like some water?

534
00:58:45,054 --> 00:58:46,783
Don't look at him.

535
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:50,715
They're...

536
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,659
The house is full of them.

537
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:05,000
Shh! The dead.

538
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:08,744
They're leaving now.

539
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,477
Don't look at them.

540
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:17,310
Ignore them and they'll leave.

541
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:22,416
I would have preferred modernity.

542
00:59:23,426 --> 00:59:25,155
Here you move...

543
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:27,396
...and everything squeaks.

544
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,160
What are the girls doing?

545
00:59:38,808 --> 00:59:40,867
Smell this, Lala.

546
00:59:40,944 --> 00:59:42,741
Stubborn yet again.

547
00:59:42,879 --> 00:59:45,871
It doesn't matter if she's awake.
If she's breathing, it's ok.

548
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:48,774
- Look at her!
- What is that horrible smell?

549
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:51,877
Could you check the heater?

550
00:59:51,955 --> 00:59:53,286
Candita, wait in the car.

551
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:54,890
Go.

552
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:01,192
Come on, Lala.
Do something with that ratty hair!

553
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:04,761
Let's go.
Let's not infect anyone.

554
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:09,071
Don't touch my feet!

555
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:19,705
How silly!
The main valve was closed.

556
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:28,119
We saw the firemen today.

557
01:00:28,324 --> 01:00:29,757
Where?

558
01:00:29,926 --> 01:00:31,052
On the road.

559
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,153
There, on the road.

560
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:36,798
At the canal.

561
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:39,792
Aunt is totally loony today!

562
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:42,338
- Zula, get that boy down.
- It was nothing, huh?

563
01:00:42,338 --> 01:00:44,169
Thank you, Juanma.

564
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:46,173
Move it, Candita.
Rinse out your glass.

565
01:00:47,276 --> 01:00:49,073
Not even let here hair get combed.

566
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:51,170
Get down from there
before you break your neckl

567
01:00:51,447 --> 01:00:53,244
They don't sting me because...

568
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,783
Get down!
Come over here.

569
01:00:55,685 --> 01:00:57,175
I'll walk you out.

570
01:00:58,621 --> 01:01:01,419
I put a little stick
for the red bees.

571
01:01:29,085 --> 01:01:30,882
Nobody's swimming!

572
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:34,286
They didn't even
bring their swimsuits.

573
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:37,226
I feel sorry for the poor man.

574
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:40,386
- The water is pristine.
- I'm not getting my hair wet.

575
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:47,496
Look, that girl's the vet.

576
01:01:48,104 --> 01:01:49,901
Did you see how young she is?

577
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:00,375
Mom, I want to go in the pool.

578
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:03,082
On the pool float
and don't get wet.

579
01:02:05,588 --> 01:02:07,351
Very young.

580
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:26,533
I'll be back, Vero.

581
01:02:26,609 --> 01:02:28,873
We're going to have coffee
with a friend.

582
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:31,013
We'll come pick you up later.

583
01:02:35,651 --> 01:02:36,948
Ma'aml

584
01:02:44,827 --> 01:02:46,954
The boy who washes
the cars is here.

585
01:02:48,297 --> 01:02:52,028
He wants to know if you have
any chores or if not some food.

586
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:56,761
What should I tell him?

587
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:02,634
Ask Marcos if he needs anything.

588
01:03:02,845 --> 01:03:06,645
He left early. He took your car.
He'll call later.

589
01:03:10,853 --> 01:03:13,151
- I didn't know.
- What should I tell the boy?

590
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:18,818
Give him something to eat.

591
01:04:07,243 --> 01:04:08,710
What is it?

592
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:14,311
It looks like they covered
a fountain or a pool here.

593
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:18,311
Look.

594
01:04:22,925 --> 01:04:24,984
This little piece.

595
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:37,463
I'm running late.
Candita, keep still!

596
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:42,097
That's too heavy for you!

597
01:05:44,073 --> 01:05:46,132
Calm down.
You've got a fever.

598
01:05:46,242 --> 01:05:48,369
I'm burning up.

599
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:50,605
What does a fever
have to do with hepatitis?

600
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:54,139
What's that music?

601
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:56,081
Turn it down.

602
01:05:58,321 --> 01:06:01,586
Can you go with Vero to the nursery
to pick up some pots?

603
01:06:01,991 --> 01:06:05,927
- I'll get them. Don't worry.
- They weigh a ton.

604
01:06:05,995 --> 01:06:07,462
She didn't come on the motorcycle.

605
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:12,126
Vero has the SUV.
I'll give you some bags of dirt.

606
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:37,691
Tell her to let me go with you.
I'll drive the SUV.

607
01:06:37,793 --> 01:06:39,852
You need to rest, Candita.

608
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,427
You're too much.

609
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:48,603
I'm bored to death here.

610
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:51,299
I want to see where they found
the boy that was murdered.

611
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:54,039
He drowned.

612
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,774
The paper says he drowned.

613
01:07:01,217 --> 01:07:03,048
The one on the bridge?

614
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:06,848
- Do you like me?
- The one on the bridge?

615
01:07:07,156 --> 01:07:09,386
I'm talking to you, Candita!

616
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:18,295
Love letters are to be answered
or returned.

617
01:07:32,181 --> 01:07:35,582
Turn here.
It's shorter through the canal.

618
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:38,015
I prefer to go this way.

619
01:07:38,354 --> 01:07:39,844
Do you know the way?

620
01:07:39,922 --> 01:07:42,186
Yes, it's longer.

621
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:52,496
The rain has done...

622
01:07:56,272 --> 01:07:58,604
...a lot of damage around here.

623
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:06,578
The pots are too high
and I hurt my back.

624
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:11,742
Here. See?

625
01:08:12,621 --> 01:08:17,024
One, two, three, four,
five, six pots.

626
01:08:19,628 --> 01:08:21,289
What an idea...

627
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:23,860
...putting the pots up there!

628
01:08:26,402 --> 01:08:28,370
How awful for that family.

629
01:08:28,737 --> 01:08:30,568
Almost a whole week...

630
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:34,042
looking for him!

631
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:37,045
Don't worry, ma'am.

632
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:41,913
Next week his brother, Changuila,
will be here.

633
01:08:42,151 --> 01:08:44,915
He'll help me bring down the pots.

634
01:08:45,588 --> 01:08:47,488
'Cause my back is messed up.

635
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:50,753
I can't keep coming
and going every day.

636
01:08:50,826 --> 01:08:52,157
Don't worry.

637
01:08:52,528 --> 01:08:55,122
Next week he'll bring down
all the pots.

638
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:58,462
I'll have the truck ready
and prepare everything for you.

639
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:04,837
Can you imagine how difficult...

640
01:09:06,675 --> 01:09:09,007
the way he arranged them.
What an idea, no?

641
01:09:13,849 --> 01:09:16,113
Cuquita, do me a favor.

642
01:09:16,285 --> 01:09:18,116
Take this to Changuila's mother.

643
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:21,254
- Tell her that next week...
- You're not going, Alicia?

644
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:23,655
You tell her.

645
01:09:23,726 --> 01:09:25,785
Those poor people,
such a tragedy.

646
01:09:25,861 --> 01:09:27,453
Tell Changuila to please come
the following week.

647
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:29,122
Can you drop me off
at the intersection?

648
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:45,006
You have to turn here.

649
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:47,674
Hello. Yes.

650
01:09:49,385 --> 01:09:51,546
Why didn't you tell me
you were going to Tucumán?

651
01:09:53,656 --> 01:09:56,648
Yes, she told me you took my car.

652
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:00,856
And the girls?

653
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:04,492
When are you coming back?

654
01:10:08,737 --> 01:10:10,500
You're not returning tonight?

655
01:10:12,775 --> 01:10:13,909
Okay, that's fine.

656
01:10:13,909 --> 01:10:18,175
Give the girls a kiss for me. Bye.

657
01:10:28,023 --> 01:10:30,184
Over there, by the girl
in green.

658
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:42,999
Where's the way out?

659
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:47,408
How do you get out?

660
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:50,670
She's very jealous.

661
01:10:52,548 --> 01:10:54,516
Tell the lady the way out.

662
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:58,417
Changuila, go get some water.

663
01:11:03,325 --> 01:11:04,758
Go straight this way...

664
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:08,695
...and turn right at the corner.
And then, let's see...

665
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:10,288
To go downtown?

666
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:12,060
She takes a right here
and then?

667
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:17,962
That'll take you right downtown.

668
01:12:08,957 --> 01:12:11,824
You're sure you had
the X-rays taken here?

669
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:25,436
Lover boy is here.

670
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:38,684
There's nothing,
not even a record of admission.

671
01:12:40,055 --> 01:12:41,886
There's no record of admission?

672
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:47,019
How about in Radiology?

673
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:51,188
You can ask,
but I don't think so.

674
01:12:52,601 --> 01:12:53,727
What happened to you?

675
01:12:53,902 --> 01:12:57,167
In the patio, I slipped and fell.

676
01:12:59,274 --> 01:13:01,242
Stretch your fingers.

677
01:13:06,915 --> 01:13:08,576
I'm going to take an X-ray...

678
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:11,811
...so please don't move.
Keep very still.

679
01:13:17,359 --> 01:13:18,986
Hold your breath.

680
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:41,406
Vero, what are you doing here?

681
01:13:41,884 --> 01:13:43,875
I came to pick up the X-rays.

682
01:13:43,952 --> 01:13:45,715
I already got them.

683
01:13:46,155 --> 01:13:49,181
I took everything, don't worry.

684
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:51,851
Go on home.

685
01:13:54,163 --> 01:13:56,256
There's a meeting on Friday, no?

686
01:13:57,166 --> 01:13:59,191
Yes, I think so.

687
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:42,066
Would you like me
to wash your car?

688
01:14:42,344 --> 01:14:44,505
No, thank you.

689
01:14:45,948 --> 01:14:49,611
Could you give me a hand
unloading the SUV?

690
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:53,482
Those poor plants haven't been
watered since yesterday.

691
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:59,351
I'll make you some coffee.

692
01:14:59,728 --> 01:15:01,753
No, thank you, ma'am.

693
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:11,634
If you'd like to take a bath,
there's towels in the maid's room.

694
01:15:24,253 --> 01:15:27,222
Would you like a sandwich
or something to eat?

695
01:15:27,322 --> 01:15:28,846
No, I'm okay.

696
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:31,283
There's nothing.

697
01:15:40,669 --> 01:15:43,229
Would you like me
to clean the SUV?

698
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:44,896
No, thank you.

699
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:53,009
What size do you wear?

700
01:15:59,955 --> 01:16:02,981
- What size are you?
- I'm not sure.

701
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:52,864
They're too small.

702
01:16:58,113 --> 01:17:01,605
Those two aren't mine.
Could you load them again?

703
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:11,319
Hold on, let me water them.

704
01:17:16,798 --> 01:17:19,392
Can I take the T-shirts?

705
01:17:20,135 --> 01:17:21,727
Yes, take them.

706
01:17:36,351 --> 01:17:39,752
Okay, open up. Open up.

707
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:41,254
Bite.

708
01:17:42,357 --> 01:17:43,756
That's it.

709
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:45,315
- What's your name?
- Carlos.

710
01:17:45,394 --> 01:17:47,453
Carlos, open wide.

711
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:50,859
Wider.

712
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:57,239
Good.

713
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:59,173
Blue, 55...

714
01:17:59,241 --> 01:18:01,643
...red 73 and 74.

715
01:18:01,643 --> 01:18:04,612
Blue... That's it.

716
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,444
With red... that's it.

717
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:10,542
- What does he need?
- Fillings and braces.

718
01:18:10,652 --> 01:18:13,280
It's just a recommendation,
not a diagnosis.

719
01:18:25,033 --> 01:18:26,398
Mom?

720
01:18:27,769 --> 01:18:29,327
Mom?

721
01:18:29,905 --> 01:18:32,066
I think it's your daughter.

722
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:39,309
The edge continues over here.

723
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:49,251
You changed the color!

724
01:18:50,759 --> 01:18:52,420
It's... not bad.

725
01:18:52,594 --> 01:18:55,529
- Not too dark?
- Maybe a little.

726
01:18:57,566 --> 01:18:59,158
It's nice.

727
01:19:01,803 --> 01:19:05,603
Tell the gardener to avoid
destroying the garden.

728
01:19:07,309 --> 01:19:09,937
Let's show your mom
Angelica's present.

729
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:44,044
Mom, come and seel

730
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:47,415
It's an outdoor heater,
for the garden.

731
01:19:47,849 --> 01:19:51,808
- For Tucumán?
- Well, at least for two weeks in winter.

732
01:20:01,263 --> 01:20:03,561
Hi! Good afternoon!

733
01:20:08,670 --> 01:20:10,467
Where do you want to put all this?

734
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:16,334
- In the yard.
- Come on, Yamil!

735
01:20:17,312 --> 01:20:19,109
Grab that pot.

736
01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:24,145
Go inside with them.

737
01:20:40,235 --> 01:20:41,998
So you got the car fixed?

738
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:45,669
I was close by, so I had them
touch it up a bit.

739
01:20:59,421 --> 01:21:00,854
It's nothing.

740
01:21:01,156 --> 01:21:03,818
They hammer it a little
from the inside.

741
01:21:07,996 --> 01:21:11,397
Be careful!
Stay close to the wall.

742
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:25,069
You look gorgeous!

743
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:26,647
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

744
01:21:27,616 --> 01:21:29,311
- You're going to the bathroom?
- Yes.

745
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:30,510
Will you wait for me?

746
01:21:30,585 --> 01:21:32,519
I'm taking the present and the bill
so they can figure it out.

747
01:21:59,814 --> 01:22:01,941
It's such a pretty color, Vero!

748
01:22:02,717 --> 01:22:04,582
It's your natural color, no?

749
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:07,415
I can't remember.
I must be completely grey.

750
01:22:07,589 --> 01:22:09,181
Who colored it?

751
01:22:09,658 --> 01:22:11,285
I did, at home.

752
01:22:11,793 --> 01:22:13,590
You're very brave.

753
01:22:19,834 --> 01:22:22,803
I'll wait with the girls.
I'll order you a coffee.

754
01:22:37,819 --> 01:22:39,878
If you need me, I'll be upstairs.

755
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:49,286
Excuse me.

756
01:22:49,364 --> 01:22:51,332
Room 818...

757
01:22:52,934 --> 01:22:57,667
No, room 818 was occupied
last weekend.

758
01:22:59,441 --> 01:23:00,965
I don't know.

759
01:23:01,843 --> 01:23:03,504
Check it.

760
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:13,951
No, it was free.

761
01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:17,021
Check again.

762
01:23:18,126 --> 01:23:20,458
Room 818.

763
01:23:20,628 --> 01:23:22,823
The weekend of the storm,
when was that?

764
01:23:23,131 --> 01:23:25,964
Yes, last weekend, but...

765
01:23:28,370 --> 01:23:30,167
that room wasn't occupied.

766
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:42,000
