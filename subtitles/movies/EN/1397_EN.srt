1
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,951
Left! 3rd!

2
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:27,789
Jean-Louis Schlesser in his mean
machine, No.10. 10 like Zidane!

3
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,478
30 meters, left! Brake!

4
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,996
World rally champion
in '98 and '99...

5
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,630
winner of the Paris - Dakar:
the man to beat!

6
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,877
Left, top speed!

7
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,837
Get a move on!
We'll get slaughtered.

8
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,638
I’m flat out!

9
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,754
The guy behind's flatter out!
Watch out!

10
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,755
He's flashing me!
Isn't that Vatanen?

11
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,273
No, a taxi!

12
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,676
Move your crate!
I’m working here!

13
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,469
Is it the right road?
- Short cut!

14
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,550
Short cut.

15
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,359
Don't let a taxi win!
- No way.

16
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,955
Sorry, folks.
A tourist's blocks the road!

17
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,111
It looks more like a race car.

18
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,278
It's just a clown
in a ''babe magnet''!

19
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,398
A taxi on our tail
sure looks bad!

20
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,118
I’ll shake him now.

21
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,478
He rammed me!

22
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,559
Enough!
We'll be here all week!

23
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,474
Nearly there, lady.

24
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,037
Why... why are there
so many people here?

25
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,191
They're in vacation.

26
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,839
Oh, right!

27
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,596
C'mon, Jean-Louis!
- Bravo, Jean-Louis!

28
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,594
No.10...
It’s not Schlesser!

29
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,113
A taxi.

30
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,153
l didn't catch his number.

31
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,870
17 minutes 25!

32
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,278
People always throw up after!
Never during!

33
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,793
OK, lady?

34
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,273
Who's it for?
- Her! Her water broke!

35
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,793
May l?

36
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,154
You're giving birth!
- Well, l ain't knitting!

37
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,311
Get the gear! We'll do it here!

38
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,712
Hey, doc, l gotta run.
Use the ground, not my seat!

39
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,871
Water's broken!

40
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,393
Water breaks?

41
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,273
Push!

42
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,160
Breathe! Push!

43
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,233
Hi, Lilly.

44
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,597
30 minutes late
for lunch with my folks!

45
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,432
Yeah, I’m on my way.

46
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,549
Daniel, you're finally meeting my Dad.
He's expecting you!

47
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,314
This is a super-big emergency!

48
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,948
What are my folks? Diesel?

49
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,473
Lilly, come on!

50
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,031
Mom's edgy, Dad's pacing the floor.
But hey, take your time!

51
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,636
l can't help it,
I’m stuck tight here!

52
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,554
''Stuck''? Who's yelling?

53
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,073
It’s... a woman.

54
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,915
Thanks! l guessed that much!
What's up?

55
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,358
I’m just watching.
It’s not what you think, you hear me?

56
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,308
l can hear that bitch!
Is it someone l know?

57
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,950
No! l don't know her either!
l just met her!

58
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,951
Oh, l feel it now!

59
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,473
l feel it!

60
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,750
Don't fuck with me!

61
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,515
You've got some slut there
while l wait for you!

62
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,639
No! This big woman's yelling
'cause her water snapped!

63
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,952
Her husband's here.
-Husband, too? A threesome in a car!

64
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,193
Oh, no! Someone tell her!
l don't know l can.

65
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,590
Here! This is your fault.

66
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,548
I’m the husband.
It’s marvellous!

67
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,314
Daniel, he's dead meat!

68
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,270
He's all shook up, that's all.
Want to talk to the doctor?

69
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,078
A doctor, too!

70
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,754
Lilly, l swear it's the truth!

71
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,390
The baby's coming out.

72
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,189
It’s a baby, l swear!
-A baby?

73
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,749
l see the head!
l think it's a head!

74
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,273
Your baby?

75
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,035
No, it's not!
He's nothing like me l swear!

76
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,636
He's as wrinkly
as an old garden gnome!

77
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,153
Marvellous!

78
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,198
You're messing me about!
-Just listen!

79
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,992
This woman just gave birth.
Outside the clinic, in my taxi!

80
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,232
She's ruined my back seat!

81
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,950
Don't hit that poor kid!
l can't hear a thing now!

82
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,236
Marvellous!

83
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,868
You be there
when l give birth!

84
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,238
l can sit and wait if you like.
This place looks fine.

85
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,231
You got 10 minutes!

86
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,351
Not twins? Is it a wrap?

87
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,114
No offence, but l gotta run!

88
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,433
Ah, hon!

89
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,591
Problem with your friend?

90
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,799
An emergency at the hospital.
A difficult birth.

91
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:03,671
l understand.
Saving lives all day. l respect that.

92
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,915
l don't know what to say.
You were wonderful!

93
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,358
l know!
-l hope you won't lose your license.

94
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,193
l don't have one!

95
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,032
l am quite pleased...
moved, even...

96
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,988
to give you... your first...

97
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,991
driver's...

98
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,513
license!

99
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,796
You sure?
- Yep!

100
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,076
l don't want to twist your arm.

101
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,437
No doubt about it, it's just fine!

102
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,433
It’s not 'cause it's my 27th time?

103
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,239
Your 100th time
would be the same!

104
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,551
You're ready. Really ready.

105
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,274
OK, l accept.
- That's fine.

106
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,557
I’ll back out.
- No!

107
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,994
Leave it!

108
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,513
Don't touch! Leave it!

109
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,955
I’ll do it! I’ll sort it out!

110
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,430
We'll sort it out!

111
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,511
Don't l have my license?

112
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,468
Yes, you do!
But don't go to extremes.

113
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,790
Take it smoothly.

114
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,315
Your license is in your hand.

115
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,359
Now you go home.
On foot! See?

116
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,990
l see. I’ll call tomorrow
in case you regret it.

117
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,756
No! l won't be around,
nor the following days.

118
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,992
l got transferred to Paris.

119
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:40,075
This a leaving present?
-For my most regular pupil!

120
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,798
Yeah, right.

121
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,793
''Regular''!

122
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,398
Car Weekly, please.

123
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,152
That's OK.

124
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,878
My pleasure!

125
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,911
Mom, he's here.

126
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,275
Yes, of course!
Let's eat!

127
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,356
Sorry, it won't happen again.

128
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,752
Not if you screw this up!
My dad's real strict.

129
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,993
Oh, come on,
deep down, he must be nice.

130
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,072
His daughter's eyes are so blue!

131
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,869
You just be careful!
-Don't worry, it'll be OK.

132
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,669
l know I’ll like him,
so he'll like me!

133
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,512
Is he a cop?
-No!

134
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,514
OK, then!
Ain't nothing worse than a cop!

135
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,633
Dad? I’d like you
to meet my boyfriend, Daniel.

136
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,435
You're a doctor?

137
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,754
Go on.
knock him dead!

138
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,914
Pleased to meet you.
I’ve heard so much about you.

139
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,436
Are you deaf
or won't you answer?

140
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,072
I’m not a doctor.
I’m an apprentice!

141
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,992
What year?

142
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,835
1st.
l mean, I’m about to change into 2nd.

143
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,595
2nd year? You're not young.
- Edmond!

144
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,231
What? I’m just inspecting
a new recruit. Answer!

145
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,152
Sir, I’m not young,

146
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,153
but I’ve done lots of jobs
to feed my family...

147
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,390
and pay for my license... studies.

148
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,599
l started when l was 12,
so I’ve aged.

149
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,239
What jobs?

150
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,392
l drive a taxi... ambulance.
Ambulance!

151
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,710
l got delayed at the clinic.

152
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,715
It lets me keep my hand in.
Eye in the road, eye on the patient.

153
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,714
2 things at once:
you make mistakes!

154
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,749
Excuse me, sir, but l disagree.
Just look at you.

155
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,319
Oh? What do you mean?

156
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,119
l see a lot of decorations there...

157
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,716
proving you've had
a successful career.

158
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,635
Then l see Lilly:
pretty, intelligent, well-educated.

159
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,794
You clearly managed
to do 2 things at once.

160
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,236
l drove an ambulance, too,
in '59 in Algeria.

161
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,789
Eye on the road,
eye on the machine gun!

162
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,953
See to the injured later.
lf they're still alive!

163
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,680
I’d like to see my roast beef!

164
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,150
Affirmative! I’m starving!
Forward!

165
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,233
Now, the endurance test:
3 hours of war stories!

166
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,234
I’ll slip into neutral
and cruise through!

167
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,790
l hurt you?
- Not at all.

168
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,794
Good.
l heard your hip crack.

169
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,554
It’s mine!
- Let's stop.

170
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,995
I’m fine!

171
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,438
l don't want to hurt you,
but I’ll be OK.

172
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,591
I’m OK now.

173
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:19,551
l could've massaged it for you.
But if you're OK. fine!

174
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,676
The surface pain's gone...

175
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,435
but deep down,
there's a nagging pain, a stiffness.

176
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,990
Maybe a little massage
would ease it.

177
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:35,871
OK, guys, a match to finish,
for 5 minutes. Bow!

178
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,873
Change partners?
- No.

179
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,759
l really don't want to hurt you.

180
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,629
I’m touched
by your concern, Emilien.

181
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:56,874
Now l warn you, l started, aged 4.
l can teach you a thing or two!

182
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:09,400
Your smile could melt a radiator!
You put me off!

183
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,596
Real opponents don't smile!
It’s not fair!

184
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,830
Listen up, you sumos!

185
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,152
Meeting with the boss in 5 minutes!

186
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,948
What's up?
You lost your lenses?

187
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,557
l can see you well enough
to kick your ass!

188
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,950
Just trying to help!

189
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,430
You done much judo?
- No.

190
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,194
Only a couple of times.
It’s not my sport.

191
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,638
So, what is?
- Karate. Far more effective!

192
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,793
Mine's ping-pong.
No good in fights, same principle:

193
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,234
Spirit of Rising Sun!

194
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,873
Kon-ichi-wa!

195
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,508
It’s easy.

196
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,593
''Con''.
''consummate idiot'' like Emilien!

197
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,352
Thanks!

198
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,873
Then, ''ninny'' like...

199
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,555
Sorry, Petra.
It’s just an example.

200
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,874
And ''a'' as in ''aaaa''!
Kon-ichi-wa!

201
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,598
Now, you.

202
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,954
Not bad.
- What's it mean?

203
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,033
It means ''hello'' in Japanese.
And don't forget it!

204
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:35,832
In under an hour, in ol' Marseille
we greet Japan's Defence Secretary.

205
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,675
Mr... Tefu... Techumila.

206
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,479
Mr. Tef... Tejus.
Just call him Nip!

207
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,632
The Nip's from Tokyo.

208
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:51,909
Before the Franco-Japanese summit
after Bastille Day in Paris...

209
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,197
he's visiting our charming town.
Known why?

210
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,112
The climate?

211
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,918
The sights?
- Sure.

212
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,832
The food?
- The Pastis?

213
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,718
The soccer match!

214
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,758
You're a big bunch of nerds!

215
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,230
Our anti-gang training base!

216
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,437
The Japs have a problem
with the Jacuzzi... Yakuza...

217
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,754
who are even kidnapping
members of the government.

218
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,118
The Defence Secretary
visited England, Germany and France.

219
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,918
Let's get one thing clear:

220
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,153
the Krauts and the Limeys
mustn't win the contract.

221
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,393
Let's make this World Cup II!

222
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,793
l put together a detailed operation
which l will now explain.

223
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:48,238
l called it Operation...

224
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,753
Ninja!

225
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,557
He's got no more ammo.

226
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,280
Suddenly... no more ammo!

227
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,079
Well, that's only natural.

228
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,878
Yeah, only natural.

229
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,157
l turn to Raymond.
Here he is.

230
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,152
l shake him.

231
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:15,029
''Raymond, your ammo!'' l say.
No answer!

232
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,316
l shake him again!

233
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,153
Then...

234
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,517
he falls sideways.
Dead!

235
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,557
Terrible!
- My whole unit!

236
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,358
I’m alone.

237
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:32,799
Armoured car's on fire, radio's out
and my flask's half-empty!

238
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,076
Oh, no!
So, then what?

239
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,958
l prayed!
- Well done!

240
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,318
That's all l could do.
Only a miracle could save me!

241
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,029
A miracle!
We're saved!

242
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,192
Now what?

243
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,955
Edmond, the red phone!

244
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,476
The red phone?
Excuse me.

245
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:03,119
General Bertineau speaking.
It’s you, Bertrand on the red phone?

246
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,919
Well done, Daniel.
You'll get dessert!

247
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,117
My God! l completely forgot!

248
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,078
No problem! I’ll be there!

249
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,639
Catastrophe!

250
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,792
We'll wait.
- I’ll be 1 hour!

251
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,475
l want you right now.
- Give me 20 seconds!

252
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,278
The airport, fast!

253
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,998
That's kinda long!

254
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,438
Catastrophe!

255
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,998
Dad!

256
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,391
You OK? You hurt?

257
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,193
Catastrophe!

258
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,308
She won't go so good now!

259
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:56,508
In 15 minutes I’m to greet Japan's
Defence Secretary. Catastrophe!

260
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:01,231
I’ll get you there in time.
- Impossible!

261
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,918
Try me, sir!

262
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,320
Seatbelt, please, Dad.

263
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,193
Is this your ambulance?
- No, a taxi.

264
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,033
My brother loaned it to me.

265
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,551
Save me some dessert.
- You can have seconds!

266
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,678
Let's go.
- Sure!

267
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:27,035
We're crawling 'cause of these tires,
but they'll soon warm up!

268
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,599
Don't overheat!

269
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,508
Now look, kid.
This is the new Cortex 500.

270
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,796
The Rolls Royce of speed traps!

271
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,350
Turn it on.
Instant read-out.

272
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,553
Go to the roadside.

273
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,397
Put your arm out slightly.

274
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,551
You better learn on the old model.

275
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,954
We're on the highway?
- Now l can step on it!

276
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,111
You must like hospitals!

277
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,233
Catastrophe!

278
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,191
Chief! We got one!

279
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,713
A biggie:

280
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,273
206!

281
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,513
l think it was a 406.
And not factory-fresh!

282
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,513
206 mph, moron!
Tell others!

283
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,432
A white taxi at 206 mph.
l repeat 206 mph!

284
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,953
Yup, 206!

285
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,076
We'll get him!

286
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,232
You OK, sir?

287
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,628
It’s him! l must get there!

288
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,392
Change of tactics!

289
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,032
What? This isn't it!

290
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,838
It’s a short cut!

291
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,913
Hold on!

292
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,109
l have a UFO on Runway 1!

293
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,797
Yield to aircraft.

294
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,791
We have just landed.
Outside temperature: 95 degrees.

295
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,714
We hope
you enjoyed flying with us!

296
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,115
Excuse me, Captain,
a taxi's coming.

297
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,794
l can't hear over the noise!

298
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,713
l repeat: taxi approaching.

299
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,440
l never ordered a taxi.
Did you?

300
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,318
No, but l know him.

301
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,240
14 minutes 30!

302
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:08,958
Great!

303
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,552
Bertineau, why the taxi?

304
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,757
We lost a car.
This guy saved my life.

305
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,351
Con-ninny-a!

306
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,231
What?
- What you said.

307
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,753
God help me!

308
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,959
Glad to be here.

309
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,875
Thank you
for greeting me in Japanese.

310
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:58,113
Me, Gibert, protect you
during your vacation... uh, stay.

311
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,192
Our Secretary.
Say hi. This is he.

312
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,952
Dear fellow!

313
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,834
I’m honoured to meet you.

314
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,473
I’m a member of your security team.
We wish you a nice stay.

315
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,119
You speak very well.

316
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:24,592
A little.
lf l can help in any way, just ask.

317
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,513
Pleased to meet you.

318
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,272
Only the blonde girl
speaks Japanese.

319
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,472
l copy. Go back to base.

320
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,351
Let us offer you a cocktail.
This way.

321
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,478
Does your file say
you speak Japanese?

322
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,234
Below my measurements.

323
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,039
Guess l stopped there.

324
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,031
Do me a favour, son.
See that taxi there?

325
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,553
l sure do!

326
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,551
Love to, lady, but I’m busy.
Another time?

327
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,598
Always in the right place!
- Know that guy?

328
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,149
Bertineau, head of the Med. Basin.

329
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,753
Lilly's dad!
- No shit!

330
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,797
l was there for lunch.

331
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,316
Unbelievable!
- Yeah, l can't stand the army.

332
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,270
You couldn't stand cops.
- l still can't. l can't stand you!

333
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,431
Well, he seems to like you.

334
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,990
He wants you
to come to the cocktail party.

335
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,277
Half cops, half soldiers?
That's a nightmare!

336
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,479
Prefer half mechanics,
half gas station attendants?

337
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,474
Come on. The chat's the same:
cars, sport, chicks!

338
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,110
You'll fit in fine.
- I’d be ashamed.

339
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:15,038
Listen. lf Bertineau is Lilly's father,
he could end up your father-in-law.

340
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,990
What will he think if you say no?

341
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,116
One drink, no more.

342
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,395
Martini?
- My sister's name!

343
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,552
One for the road won't hurt you!

344
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,393
Domo arigato.
- The gateau is good.

345
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:45,315
Locally made.
Next to the station.

346
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,711
Excuse me.
I’ll get you another.

347
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,316
Don't get him too stewed
to sign the contract.

348
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,392
No worries,
l know what I’m doing.

349
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,472
Just softening him up.
He's nearly done!

350
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,790
Is your plan ready?

351
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,509
Sir, it's hearsed
and rehearsed to death!

352
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,036
It’s fine-turned to the second.

353
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,957
You're not all as l imagined.

354
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:21,114
No offence,
but a bright 2nd-year medical student...

355
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,955
l thought you'd be more...

356
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,033
Pimply?
-Right. And a slower driver!

357
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,795
Yes, he's the ''fastest'' doctor l know.

358
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,511
Well, I’m very grateful.
Gratefully indebted to you!

359
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,877
Ask me anything,
but Lilly's hand!

360
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,635
'Course not!
l can't think of anything else.

361
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,792
Valid 1 year, parts and labour!

362
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,398
Excuse me.
- Go ahead.

363
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,791
Emilien, start of Operation Ninja.

364
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,918
Petra, watch him.
- Watch me?

365
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,039
Friends with cops?
- No, only with one.

366
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,749
Good! It’s rare.
Most youths are anti-cops...

367
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:12,277
anti-army, anti-everything!
They want to kill the father figure.

368
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,273
Sir, my patients are waiting.

369
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,468
Wait! 5 more minutes.
You'll find this very interesting.

370
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,595
Selling the Japs Peugeot?
- Nothing's impossible!

371
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,671
This is the Cobra.

372
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,231
Specially designed
to protect visiting dignitaries.

373
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,038
Titanium bodywork.

374
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,034
The multiple side panels
can resist any bullet!

375
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,589
Missile detectors,
front and back!

376
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,116
Coating: Phantom!
Solid tires!

377
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,158
It’s linked to the Atlas satellite...

378
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:09,438
and if necessary,
can be piloted from HQ.

379
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,033
Now, the engine.

380
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,833
Ninja!

381
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,151
Nice noise for a V12.

382
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,393
V12 engine, twin turbos.
Voice-activated!

383
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,028
Top speed: 210 mph!

384
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,193
Range: 550 miles.
Paris-Marseille.

385
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,875
2 airbags in front, 2 in back,
4 at the sides.

386
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:39,636
8 in all for maximum protection.

387
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,873
Ladies and gentleman,
this car is like France:

388
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,598
indestructible!

389
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,396
That's just 'cause we set it
to ultra-sensitive.

390
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,836
It’s usually on normal!

391
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,917
See the balloons?

392
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,548
Useful against thieves!

393
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,676
Get him out!

394
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,792
Tell him not to worry.

395
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,471
He needs the bathroom.

396
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,234
Bertrand, go with him.
- Yes, sir.

397
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,234
It'll be good as new
in no time.

398
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,229
Will he?
Now who'll drive it?

399
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:34,635
Sir, l have a young civilian driver.
He's very good. I’ll vouch for him.

400
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:36,918
Banco!

401
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:47,239
Before your tour of the town, I’ll show
you our latest computing innovation.

402
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,432
Gimme that!

403
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,995
Wear this.
- It’ll cramp my style.

404
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:02,039
Even a cretin with mitts on
could drive this baby!

405
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,192
Take him away!
- No, it's OK.

406
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,348
Told you!
- Never mind. No one'll see.

407
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,829
Go on! Ninja!

408
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:20,158
How do you stop it?
- You just have to say ''Nip''.

409
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,673
Ninja!

410
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:28,631
The mission's simple. We prepared
a demonstration. With fake attacks!

411
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:33,828
Like the ghost train?
- Yes, so as to impress the Nip.

412
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,157
Above all, don't worry.
Let things happen.

413
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,072
lf the Nip...

414
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:47,474
Don't play while I’m talking.
- You keep saying ''Nip''!

415
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,551
Great!
- Not bad.

416
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,952
Sir, we shall now escort you
to your hotel.

417
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,076
Get in!

418
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,512
Up shit creek again!

419
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,998
Forward!

420
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,713
They're here.

421
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,512
On this road.
It’s going as planned.

422
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,036
Very good, Katano.
Let me hear them.

423
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,670
Spring Roll, come in.

424
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,793
Hey, Emilien, come in!

425
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,713
Do you read me?
- Loud 'n' clear.

426
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,635
We just left for the 1st trap.
Be with you in 20 minutes.

427
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,031
OK, 20 minutes to warm up.

428
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:25,229
What about us?
What can we do for about 20 minutes?

429
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,755
l don't know. Any ideas?

430
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,196
Yeah, but 20 inches...
minutes is too short!

431
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:37,230
Oh yeah? So, we need an idea
we could start now and finish later.

432
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,039
Yes, that would work!

433
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,636
But... l too have an idea.

434
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,997
I’m sure you'll really like it.

435
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,390
Oh yeah?
It may be the same one.

436
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,755
That 'd be marvellous!

437
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:56,550
It'd be ideal!
Go on, you first.

438
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:04,670
Make the most
of these few quiet moments...

439
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,478
to learn Japanese!

440
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,074
It wasn't the same idea.

441
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,998
He won't see much of Marseille.

442
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,789
Sorry, he's suffering from jetlag.

443
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,713
May l ask why your boss is here?

444
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:27,351
To sign very big contract
and see anti-gang method.

445
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,478
He'll sure see that!
- You know method?

446
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:35,509
Sure l do!
1st, the suspect. He's probably guilty.

447
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,114
A foreigner is doubly suspect!

448
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:43,832
Then there's the guilty,
foreign, tanned suspect! He's had it!

449
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,393
lf he's tanned, he just sun-bathes and
does nothing all day, he's a suspect!

450
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,835
So, he's guilty. Faultless logic!

451
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,558
That boy any good?

452
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:58,635
Very good. A young doctor,
friend of my daughter's.

453
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,836
Something tells me they're flirting.

454
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,309
Only natural at their age.
- Quite.

455
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:08,156
To make the guilty party confess,
they use questioning!

456
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,517
Simple!
They apply a trilogy like Star Wars.

457
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,671
Episode 1: Beat him up!

458
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,831
Good, healthy exercise!

459
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,596
Episode 2: Tax 'em to raise
some cash for the Christmas party!

460
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,479
Episode 3: Drink copiously!

461
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:28,509
I’m pleased some youngsters
still respect our values.

462
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,069
A good son-in-law.
- Think so?

463
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,958
Many French gangs?

464
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,908
The most dangerous are
the heavy mob: 100,000 - strong!

465
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:40,356
Easy to spot:
always guzzling beer!

466
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,156
Go toward the port.
- My pleasure, chief.

467
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:51,279
He sounds very polite.
- Affirmative. Courteous, too.

468
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,915
Polite to your face,
shaft you from behind!

469
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:00,551
Like in the souk.
A big smile as they steal your cash!

470
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,314
But I’ve got my eye on him.

471
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,113
Tell me something.

472
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,829
I’ve not been in the police long,
but try me.

473
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,278
What means the word
your captain uses: ''Nip''?

474
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,478
Why 'd he stop?
l said to beware!

475
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,039
What's going on?

476
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:28,113
Just a simultaneous translation
problem!

477
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,833
Cut the crap.
We're at the meeting point in... now.

478
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,559
Don't worry!

479
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,073
General alert.

480
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,035
Shit!
There's a missile pointing at me.

481
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,872
Missile? What missile?

482
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,597
Atlas: real-time missile diversion.

483
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,832
Unique!
The Limeys won't get the ball!

484
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,798
Impressive,
but where's it headed?

485
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,714
Don't worry.
Somewhere far out at sea.

486
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,473
Shit, my boat!

487
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,431
The high point of our show.

488
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,993
Impressive!

489
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,156
Very good work, Gibert.

490
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:24,634
Thank you, sir, I’m so pleased to be
able to try out this equipment at last.

491
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,553
Roadhog!

492
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,915
OK, the coast is clear.

493
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:50,918
Impressive
- You get used to it. A regular day.

494
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,393
Your moves are improving,
but not your accent.

495
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,909
Spring Roll! Copy?

496
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,516
Just fine. Did you make it.
l mean, are you here?

497
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:18,116
1st attack completed.
Be with you in 5.

498
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,872
Ready?

499
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:25,512
Petra and l were checking
a few things out. A-OK.

500
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,319
Emilien, Gibert here.

501
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,833
I’m counting on you.

502
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,711
You can count on me, Petra.
l mean: you can count on Petra!

503
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,313
Count on Petra!

504
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,073
Go!

505
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,991
Dammit, l told you to warm up!

506
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,513
We're hot!

507
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:15,073
Gibert will kill you guys!
Go warm up!

508
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,789
Just off to the little girls' room.

509
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,878
I’ll go with you. You never know.

510
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,957
Can't you read?
It says ''Green light''!

511
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,714
Get a move on, you fag!

512
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,233
Oh shit!

513
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,872
Now turn left.
l repeat left.

514
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,679
Yes, chief.
l repeat, chief!

515
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,470
He says you drive well.
- I’m not moving!

516
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:19,794
It freaks me out
not to hear the engine speak to me.

517
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,876
Putting in earplugs?
Do l talk too much?

518
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,396
Nein!
It’s a miniature ear transmitter.

519
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,120
Brand-new!
I’m on channel 1.

520
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,078
But how do we talk?

521
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:43,917
l know you French can't handle it,
but an order isn't to be discussed!

522
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:49,029
Yeah, but if you have a problem
what do l do?

523
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,358
Can you hear me?

524
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,799
1 bang means yes, 2 means no!

525
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,110
Mind if we keep chatting?

526
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:13,313
That's good, 'cause the closed door
makes it easier to talk to you.

527
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:19,316
l don't dare
to say things to your face.

528
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:26,716
Your eyes trouble me.
They're so...

529
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,438
so blue!

530
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,953
What's Spring Roll up to?
- What?

531
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:37,193
It’s in code.
l just can't find the translation.

532
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,794
When your eyes look at me...
wow!

533
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,394
It’s a 1st,
or l had my back turned.

534
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:47,951
Part of method?
- You bet! Daniel's method!

535
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:53,597
It’s good to open my heart to you.

536
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,716
You don't mind too much?

537
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,831
Should l go on, then?

538
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,353
l don't get it!

539
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:11,640
Have you noticed
that I’m much closer to you now?

540
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,953
''No''?

541
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,598
Good!

542
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:29,356
OK, Petra, I’ll say something
you may find shocking. Here goes.

543
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,238
He'll screw up!

544
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:36,190
Well, since Day One,
I’ve known l love you!

545
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,711
Well played!
- Told you!

546
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,393
There, l said it!

547
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,917
Now put me out of my misery:
is it mutual?

548
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,638
So, uh...

549
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:54,033
1 bang: yes, 2 means no.

550
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:59,470
Change channels to talk dirty!
We're working!

551
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,315
Left here, kid.
- Yes, pops!

552
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,032
He's not one of us.

553
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:28,796
That's for sure.
He's not one of us.

554
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,996
What're you playing at?
Go on! Ninja!

555
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,118
Sorry to be so down:
l smell a trap.

556
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,637
Smell a trap?
l don't smell a thing. Do you, sir?

557
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:06,397
Strange how those trucks are parked.
Just room for 1 car!

558
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:11,878
No, there's no trap.
l checked the map. No trap here.

559
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,679
Drive on!
- lf you say so.

560
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,513
l should know.

561
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,630
Well, l never!
A trap!

562
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,473
What's he up to?

563
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,033
What page?

564
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,633
That's not on my list.

565
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,753
Hats off!

566
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,830
Shit!
Glad it's not my taxi!

567
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,674
What happened?
Where's the Nip?

568
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:38,719
Some Ninjas... came,
and the Secretary went.

569
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,269
What? He didn't fly away?

570
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:47,037
He did! At that speed,
he must be on his way to Mars!

571
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,512
Ask Atlas.
It must've spotted him!

572
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,274
General alert!

573
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,992
Stop! Police!

574
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,713
Shit!

575
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,399
Complex town, huh?
Small streets!

576
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,790
The jails are no bigger!

577
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:35,512
Lie down there!
I’m crack shot, so no tricks!

578
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,671
You speak French?

579
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,910
Me warn you: me shoot!

580
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,433
Spread out!

581
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:01,155
Is that how you wanna play it?
All right!

582
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:13,557
Now where are they?
They didn't fly away, too?

583
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,029
Where's Emilien? Emilien!

584
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,797
l reckon he's near the garbage.

585
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,794
l was this close to getting 'em,
but l was outnumbered.

586
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,235
They took the Secretary!
- Which one?

587
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,597
The Nip, not ours.
It’s a disaster!

588
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,149
Yeah, and they got Petra, too.

589
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:37,791
Good. She speaks Japanese,
so he'll be less alone.

590
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,156
Lilly, I’m coming.
Your dad made me stay!

591
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:12,632
But it's been 2 hours.
I’m hot all over.

592
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,633
All over?
- Yeah, all over!

593
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,756
I’ll be on fire soon.

594
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,435
I’m coming. Watch a documentary -
it'll calm you down!

595
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,512
I’ll be 5 minutes.
- Too long!

596
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,033
4 minutes!

597
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:41,799
It’s my fault
for leaving her in the john!

598
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:47,432
You shoulda gone with her.
- l thought of that. l did. But...

599
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,313
Finished scratching about yet?

600
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:55,314
There were indeed cars here.
3 of them.

601
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:59,234
You read Sherlock Holmes
to deduce that?

602
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,278
Don't you have any clues
to get us started?

603
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:07,594
We'll analyze the tire samples
at the lab. That'll tell us more.

604
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,797
They'll have time
to swim back to Tokyo!

605
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:19,428
Thanks for everything,
but l need my taxi now.

606
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,113
Want your convertible?

607
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,239
We're in shit!
These clowns are shaving the road!

608
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,152
Please help us find a clue.

609
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:31,233
Look, Lilly's on fire.
She might burn herself.

610
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,995
They got my girl.
Give me 2 minutes of your time.

611
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:38,630
Take a look, then I’ll handle it.

612
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:47,434
From below, l saw 3 black Mitsubishis.

613
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,158
A new model.

614
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,194
Tires straight from Japan.
- How d'you know?

615
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,351
Smell it.
- Fish.

616
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,988
Meaning?
- A restaurant?

617
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,948
You got fish oil for brains?
Restaurants and ports!

618
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:07,353
They were on a boat from Japan!
- So, that's why they smell of fish!

619
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,830
See? Now, are they stolen cars?
- Easy!

620
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,434
Alain!
- I’m onto it.

621
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,398
OK, you put your tweezers down.

622
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:22,829
On Monday morning, you'll get a whistle
and be put on traffic duty!

623
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,313
Idiots!

624
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:28,153
Nothing stolen from the port.

625
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:32,791
Bingo!
- What? It just means you were wrong.

626
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,555
Why wasn't the theft declared?

627
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,917
'Cause they use the warehouse
as a base!

628
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,230
You can be real smart!

629
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:47,633
General alert!
- No, Emilien. That's always my line.

630
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,519
Explain it to me once more.

631
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:56,028
I’m on my way!
You watching TV?

632
00:52:56,200 --> 00:53:01,035
No, l stopped. There was a report
on animal sex. l burned the rug!

633
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,872
Lilly's worried.

634
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,393
Give me that.

635
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:09,111
Tell your mom it's OK,
but l need to commandeer your friend.

636
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,748
He did a great job. Good recruit.

637
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:16,914
He'll bring me home.
You can say goodnight then. Bye, hon.

638
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:20,755
C'mon, let's go.
The mission's not over.

639
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,000
What's Gibert up to?

640
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:10,235
l dunno. He's been in the john for ages,
making weird noises.

641
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:30,312
What's up?
- l can't tell you. It’s... too horrible!

642
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:46,869
They won't come.
- What?

643
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:53,479
l think this was their 1st base.
They're gone. Long gone.

644
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,397
Suspect approaching.
Asian male.

645
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:16,351
They always return to the crime scene!
Police Academy, lesson 1! Positions!

646
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,193
Captain?

647
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:24,032
Suspects approaching front door.

648
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,553
Perfect!

649
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,272
I’m ready for 'em!

650
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:44,276
Hey, you sure about this?

651
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:47,113
What?
It’s the heist of the century!

652
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:51,319
There's a mountain of VCRs,
boxed and awaiting delivery!

653
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:53,596
They're about to break in.

654
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,673
We got 'em!
- Emilien! You break in to your home?

655
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,398
Sure.
- Oh yeah?

656
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:00,913
Well, no.

657
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:07,636
Uh-oh!
Chief, are you gonna...?

658
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:13,874
l like to stay close to my men.
Some action won't hurt me.

659
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,918
Just like in the old days!

660
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:21,358
It was long ago.
- The memory is distant.

661
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,431
But the reflexes...

662
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,797
are still intact!

663
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:31,074
Believe me.
Thanks!

664
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:41,558
Sure there's no cops?
- Relax, dammit! There's no one here!

665
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:46,510
They're all watching the game.
Every cop's in front of a TV.

666
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:49,592
Ready to attack?
Wait for my signal.

667
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:57,154
You worry me.
It’s a long way down.

668
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:00,471
It’s OK. Tie the knot.
I’ll do the rest.

669
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,437
Uh-oh.

670
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:08,195
See? They're all
at the match, like l said!

671
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:12,958
Attack!

672
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,994
Shit!

673
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,879
Emilien?
- OK, chief.

674
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,349
Bonzai!

675
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,392
Someone being knifed?

676
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:39,872
The knot's all right.
- Yeah.

677
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,833
Maybe the rope.

678
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,798
You got the wrong one.
- You're right.

679
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,313
Ambulance! Now!

680
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:10,310
l should never have left her
or let him down.

681
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:16,669
That's enough crying over spilled milk.
It won't bring her back. Think!

682
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:20,435
l am! But we don't have
a single lead to go on!

683
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,431
Ask the right questions.

684
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:26,798
Why didn't the Yakuza kill him at once?
- They need him?

685
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,236
Why? Did they ask for a ransom?
- No.

686
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:35,520
Why kidnap him here?
They must have had a good reason.

687
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,557
Why's he going to Paris?

688
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:43,113
To sign contracts.
Security, trains, army, nuclear.

689
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:48,354
There! Maybe they want to stop him.
-Makes no sense. Why do that?

690
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:52,035
He's right.
Yuki Tsumoto wants to stop him.

691
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:56,239
l know you.
Weren't you an air hostess before?

692
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:01,155
I’m here to protect the Secretary.
I’m in counter-espionage.

693
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:05,438
Funny! l too am.
I’m in counter-espionage.

694
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:09,354
That's Daniel.
- Intern. I’m learning to be stupid!

695
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,398
Clever!
Who's this Yuki Tsumoto?

696
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:16,678
Yakuza. Controls the north.
Powerful and conservative.

697
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:20,276
Refuses airplanes, trains,
nuclear power.

698
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:23,716
As France is keen to sell,
he's taking steps.

699
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:27,759
The Secretary won't sign,
nor will Japan ever again!

700
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:31,356
Tsumoto sent over
2 masters in hypnosis.

701
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:36,548
The Secretary, when the time is right
will shoot someone.

702
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,995
Perhaps the President.

703
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:42,869
France will sever
all diplomatic ties for years?

704
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,598
Exactly.
- Crazy!

705
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:48,833
We must free your friend
and the Secretary before 11.

706
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:53,790
l better tell my boss.
- The cripple or Sleeping Beauty?

707
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:57,350
Listen.
You both got someone to save.

708
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:02,275
As we're in a rush, we better
not disturb the powers that be.

709
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,158
No?
- Right!

710
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:07,949
No Nip'll beat us! Pardon me!
Where do we start?

711
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:11,874
First, can you find them in Paris?
- No way!

712
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,029
Easy! Child's play!

713
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:45,075
Thanks, Joe. You saved my life!
See you soon, pal.

714
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:48,118
They're hiding out
in southern Paris.

715
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,475
Sure it's her? Uh, them!

716
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:54,918
3 black Mitsubishis
with a blonde. OK?

717
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:59,232
To the airport!
- No plane for 3 hours.

718
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:05,634
We can't wait.
We must get there right away!

719
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,916
Get up! It’s war!

720
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:12,232
Men!
- It’s me, Daniel!

721
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:16,796
The troops?
- Wiped out! Just us to save the day.

722
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,315
You're indebted to me.
- Affirmative!

723
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:21,232
l need your help.

724
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,670
Shit! What 're they up to?

725
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,271
Cool, pal! Way to go!

726
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:54,514
l really hope you know
what you're doing, 'cause l don't!

727
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:57,399
Got a better idea?
- Right now? No.

728
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:59,312
Well, think fast!

729
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:24,998
l got it! Let me out.
- Too late!

730
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,952
Are you cool?

731
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:48,350
You bet! Cool as ice!

732
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,033
Just shout, OK?

733
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:55,313
OK, I’m shouting!
We lost a parachute!

734
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:58,631
There are 3.
1 or 2 always screw up!

735
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,153
Oh, right!

736
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:06,118
Got your license?
- Yes.

737
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,111
So, take over here.

738
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:10,032
C'mon, move!

739
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,960
I’ll steer us.
- Where do l go?

740
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,872
Straight ahead.

741
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:25,235
Straight ahead? OK!

742
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:30,512
Come on, just relax.
Be more zen.

743
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,120
That's good. Real good.

744
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,075
Oh Lilly, you OK?

745
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:45,233
Who's the warbler?
- Air hostess.

746
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:46,753
No, a nurse!

747
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:50,071
You in a massage parlour?
- No way, Lilly!

748
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:53,152
We're in the sky.
Your dad's guiding us.

749
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,993
Emilien's steering,
I’m fixing a parachute...

750
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:59,152
the nurse is singing
to calm us down!

751
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:01,072
You smoke a tree?!

752
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:04,915
I’m trying to save
Petra and Japan's Secretary!

753
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:07,548
I’ll call you when we land!

754
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,073
Goddammit!

755
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:12,909
You OK, hon?
- Just fine!

756
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,798
What a doubter!

757
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,948
Try to turn left a bit.

758
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:24,829
Now, turn left.
l repeat, left.

759
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:38,833
Hi there!

760
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,593
It’s OK! Stay calm!
Marseille Police!

761
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,113
Move!

762
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,959
You know them?
- Yeah.

763
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:59,352
An old pupil.
Well, I’ll walk home.

764
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:04,154
OK, Lionel?
- Jacques, Mr. Coutta.

765
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:05,673
Hello there.

766
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:13,711
All set, Coutta?
- Just Japan's Secretary to come.

767
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:38,798
l see her.

768
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:42,430
God, she's lovely!
l mean, she looks well.

769
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:46,309
The Secretary?
- Fine. He's exercising.

770
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:59,230
Maybe we should get 'em back.
- But we must warn your friend.

771
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,038
It won't be easy.

772
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,918
What a jerk l am!
- Really?

773
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:06,072
Her earphone!

774
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:13,040
Are you ready to kill?

775
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,356
You hear me?

776
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:22,114
We're not far away.

777
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:24,318
Get up...

778
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,473
and turn around.

779
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:34,033
Show me your hands.

780
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:41,717
What's going on?
- It’s not me.

781
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:44,155
You suck!
- So do you!

782
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:46,151
Sit down. We're coming.

783
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:49,039
Easy to say!
- l got a plan.

784
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,997
That's what worries me!

785
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:56,469
You hear only what l tell you.

786
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:59,916
Only what l tell you.

787
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:07,876
You obey me.

788
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:11,350
You do only what l tell you.

789
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,591
l wanna go home!

790
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:26,869
'Cause it's cold
and I’m getting sick.

791
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:32,670
You're going to sleep.

792
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,356
Raise your arms.

793
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:48,833
Hey, it's my turn now!
Come on!

794
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,560
I’m not bad at hypnosis!

795
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:54,109
Sit!
Good!

796
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:58,319
Now lie down!
Very, very good!

797
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,675
Now sleep!

798
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:06,512
Freeze or you'll sleep, too!

799
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:08,830
OK, I’ll cover you.

800
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,192
Hey, girls, what're you doing?

801
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,150
No need.
l had 'em covered.

802
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:05,912
It’s not loaded.

803
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:08,230
What's that?

804
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:09,958
How come?

805
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:16,158
It was me.
l emptied the clip yesterday.

806
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:20,438
So... it was never loaded?

807
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,989
So you wouldn't get hurt.

808
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:48,158
I’m late.
Help me out!

809
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:53,908
It’s OK, I’ll manage.

810
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:57,713
Jump in there!

811
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:59,916
Are you sure?

812
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:01,911
l don't wanna fall down!

813
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:22,631
Catch those clowns!

814
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:50,471
Fancy some sushi?

815
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:52,073
No exit, Daniel!

816
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:24,431
Nips closing in!

817
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:38,193
One less!

818
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,469
We'll get out here.

819
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:04,030
We're too heavy.
They're good!

820
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:06,839
Ask your colleagues to help out.

821
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,798
Forget it.
Paris Police hate us.

822
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:12,679
You just never asked 'em politely!

823
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:14,193
What the... ?

824
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:27,794
You faggots not at the parade?

825
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:33,239
Soldiers ain't your thing? You'd rather
stay home and gobble knobs?

826
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:36,039
How 'bout a love parade?

827
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:38,156
Catch me if you can!

828
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:48,078
You went a bit far!
- Don't worry! They love it!

829
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:53,358
Catch him alive!
I’ll kill him myself!

830
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,910
Where are you?

831
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:15,398
Where's Trocadero?

832
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:17,437
Change at Chatelet!

833
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,192
A bus!

834
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,236
Oh, the Eiffel Tower!

835
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,236
Off the grass!

836
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:16,193
Straight on!

837
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:17,713
OK!

838
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,350
There's one!

839
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:26,078
Get the taxi!

840
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,272
Kamikaze!
- Kami what?

841
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:51,994
l can't shake 'em!
We're too heavy!

842
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:54,276
I’ll get out!
- No, try again!

843
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:55,793
l can't!

844
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:01,954
Call the General.
- General!

845
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:05,078
Loud 'n clear!
How's your tour going?

846
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:06,639
Whizzing by!

847
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:11,715
He's gotta block the Dauphine tunnel.
We'll trap 'em!

848
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:13,518
Give me 5 minutes.

849
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:19,196
Picard? Bertineau here.
- Sir!

850
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:23,956
Got a spare tank or two?
- Sure l have.

851
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,391
He better hurry up!

852
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,833
We're there. What's he up to?

853
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:46,519
OK, sir, the tunnel is blocked.

854
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:48,033
4 mins. 32.

855
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:50,509
Well done, sir.
- Hang on!

856
01:16:56,400 --> 01:17:00,075
l don't wanna play!
- You wanna get shot down?

857
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:02,356
l don't wanna hit a tank!

858
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:06,797
l wanna spend time with Petra
before l die!

859
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:09,872
I’m taking you to Heaven!

860
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:14,677
l wanna stay here on Earth!

861
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:51,474
Learn to drive, you moron!

862
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:55,432
You scared me again!

863
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:58,592
Maybe one day you'll trust me!

864
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:06,349
You're wonderful.
Be his driver in Japan.

865
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:11,469
Thanks, but right now,
l just want to go home.

866
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:14,871
Yeah, we're going home.
Want dropping off somewhere?

867
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,353
Not the TV!

868
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:25,149
Just 5 minutes.
l want to see your father.

869
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:37,437
It looks like Daniel's taxi!

870
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:02,717
Well, that's brand-new.
A stealth taxi.

871
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:08,876
I’ll drop you at the grandstand.
This place freaks me out.
