1
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:49,739
...Kamchatka.

2
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:55,853
<i>In the beginning there was
a cell, nothing else.</i>

3
00:00:55,989 --> 00:01:00,619
<i>That cell split into two, those
two into others, and so on.</i>

4
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,787
<i>Some cells became plants,
others bugs...</i>

5
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:06,558
<i>...others animals...</i>

6
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:08,724
<i>...and others us.</i>

7
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:12,666
<i>What they never explain
is what happens next...</i>

8
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:16,674
<i>...between the moment
the cells become a person...</i>

9
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,802
<i>...and that person
climbs the Himalayas...</i>

10
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:21,573
<i>...discovers a vaccine...</i>

11
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:24,945
<i>...or becomes a famous
escapist like Houdini.</i>

12
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,746
<i>That is a real mystery.</i>

13
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:30,253
<i>No textbook mentions this.
No teacher does.</i>

14
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,086
<i>But my dad did so.
Once.</i>

15
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:35,023
<i>The last time I saw him.</i>

16
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:38,528
<i>My story, like all stories,
begins with a cell...</i>

17
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:42,066
<i>...but ends in Kamchatka.</i>

18
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,498
<i>Life,
the supreme mystery.</i>

19
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:52,008
<i>The energy which induces
cells to join together...</i>

20
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:55,205
<i>Fall, 1976.
... and form tissues...</i>

21
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:59,341
Days after
Argentina's military coup

22
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,287
"o".

23
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,924
It's got to have a vowel!

24
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,454
Look at all the "a's"!

25
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,293
"F"?

26
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,495
"T"?

27
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:24,271
Mum!

28
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:34,815
Ok, go.
I'll be outside.

29
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,858
- When are you coming?
- After English.

30
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,486
- My mum's making escalopes.
- Yes!

31
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,630
ABRACADABRA

32
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,632
Bertuccio's mum's
making escalopes.

33
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,832
- You're an invader!
- Here.

34
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,932
Wow!
The latest edition!

35
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,167
Yes, just out.

36
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:41,611
- Where are we going?
- To a friend's house.

37
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:44,723
You took me out of
school just for that?

38
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,917
We'll be back soon,
okay?

39
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,653
It's Thursday, remember.

40
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:52,856
I've got English, then
I'm going to Bertuccio's.

41
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:54,694
- Not today.
- Why not?

42
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:57,302
- We can't.
- Why not?

43
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,633
- Because we're going on a trip.
- Aren't we going...

44
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:05,369
...to your friends'? - We'll
drop in and set off from there.

45
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:11,715
I don't want to go there.

46
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:14,979
What am I gonna do?
I'll get bored.

47
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:25,055
- So leave me here and pick me
up later from Bertuccio's. - No.

48
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,666
I told you to leave me here
and pick me up later!

49
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,769
- Are you crazy or what?
- Leave me here!

50
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:33,098
- I won't!
- Why not?

51
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:36,868
- Because I say so!
- Keep going, madam.

52
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,919
It's not fair!
It's not fair!

53
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:57,754
<i>The invaders...</i>

54
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:01,058
<i>Aliens coming
from a dying planet.</i>

55
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,668
<i>Destination. ' The Earth.</i>

56
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:07,034
<i>Purpose. '
To dominate the world.</i>

57
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,802
<i>David Vincent has seen them.</i>

58
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:16,138
<i>For him it all started one night
on a lonely country road...</i>

59
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,147
Let me watch, you, Shorty!

60
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:22,345
<i>...looking for a short-cut
he never found.</i>

61
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:26,149
<i>It began with a closed
deserted diner...</i>

62
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:30,422
<i>...and a man too exhausted
to continue his journey.</i>

63
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,329
<i>A spaceship from another
galaxy landed...</i>

64
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,230
I was in the laboratory...

65
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:40,032
...when I saw her waving at me,
'Your husband on the phone! '

66
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,472
I asked him what happened 'I'd
been trying to reach you at the...

67
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:46,544
...law office and nobody
would answer! ' He told me...

68
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:50,410
...some militars had searched the
office and kidnapped Roberto...

69
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,983
...his partner.

70
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:56,918
What's wrong, sweetie?
Do you want something?

71
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:03,186
- Where's the bathroom?
- Down the hall.

72
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:06,355
- Do you want me to go
with you? - No.

73
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,608
I'd rather sleep
on the floor.

74
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,846
Little guy's kicking
the hell out of me.

75
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:33,482
This bed is going to hell!

76
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:37,458
Are you sleeping
there with mum?

77
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,765
So, tell me.
What happened today?

78
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:49,534
A girl saw the invaders
disintegrate a truck.

79
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:52,974
Then David Vincent
had to find the driver...

80
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:56,047
I saw that one,
about three times.

81
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:59,310
Your mum?
How was she?

82
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,550
The Rock!

83
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:05,186
She didn't let me go
to Bertuccio's.

84
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:08,758
- What happened to Roberto?
- What do you mean?

85
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,090
Don't goof around.

86
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,626
- Did mum tell you?
- They took him away, right?

87
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:19,497
But nothing'll
happen to him?

88
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,336
You'll get him out.
That's what lawyers are for.

89
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:28,639
But Roberto's a lawyer, too.

90
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:33,516
Do lawyers
get taken away, too?

91
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:39,019
- Nothing will happen to you,
right? - No.

92
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,884
Nothing.

93
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:44,352
You know what
we're gonna do?

94
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:47,091
Go away for a while,
till things calm down.

95
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,133
I got a house in the suburbs.

96
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:52,897
I've never been there, but I'm
told it's terrific! A pool...

97
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,304
...we can play soccer, you
name it! - Can Bertuccio come?

98
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,842
Do you think so?

99
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,915
I mean, if we invite him,
we get him into our mess, too.

100
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,416
You wouldn't want that.

101
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,675
Take the third left.

102
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:43,008
- Back to the city?
- Do it!

103
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,640
- We just came that way!
- Me, pilot. You, driver.

104
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:50,484
- My lion, I want my lion. - Once
mum drove into a gas station.

105
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:53,421
On the way out, she didn't
know if she had to go...

106
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:57,586
...right or left. - You're
not in the game, shut up!

107
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:02,133
- She's as disoriented as a
spinning top. - I want my lion!

108
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,669
- So we get out of here.
- Third left.

109
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:18,181
- Can I look, dad?
- Yes.

110
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,986
TEG

111
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:35,762
- Hey, look.
- He won't like it.

112
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:38,267
- Why not?
- It's hard plastic.

113
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,998
Little Guy's is a cuddly one.

114
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:43,702
Get the car keys from mum.

115
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,141
Not a word.
Hurry up!

116
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:06,798
There's a tree behind the house.
Leave it there, no one'll see it.

117
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,616
Come on, Little Guy.

118
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,486
- You know what a call for
action is? - What?

119
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:39,962
Like in movies when the soldier
warns of an Indian attack?

120
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:44,695
- Yes. - And the
Indians go: Ooh, ooh, ohh!

121
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:48,463
If mum or I call for action,
you must do this...

122
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,235
- Drop what you're doing...
- What if...

123
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,676
...we're drinking Nesquik?
... drop what you're doing...

124
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:58,648
...and come here running,
very, very, very fast.

125
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:02,185
So, what you do is this.
Listen carefully.

126
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:03,288
Yes.

127
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,253
- Find this stone...
- Yes.

128
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,986
Stretch out your arms, close
your eyes, lower your head...

129
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:11,494
...and wriggle through.

130
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,232
- Got it?
- Yes.

131
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,527
- Who wants to try first?
- Me!

132
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:20,864
Use your arms.
Watch out for your eyes.

133
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:23,531
When mum or I call
for action...

134
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:27,407
...find the stone
and wriggle through.

135
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,582
- That way's north. The way
we came. - Yes.

136
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:40,090
And that's south. It leads
straight to the village.

137
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,372
Be careful!
Don't you fall!

138
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,405
Who lived here before us?

139
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,268
Not a clue.

140
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:36,379
But somebody lent you
the house.

141
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:39,416
A friend of a friend
I don't know.

142
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,416
We forgot to bring coal.

143
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:45,488
Help me gather some
firewood.

144
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:53,698
HOCUS-POCUS

145
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:05,326
<i>Harry Houdini
was born in Budapest...</i>

146
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:10,135
<i>...on March 24, 1874.</i>

147
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:13,905
<i>He was an escapist,
not a magician, as believed.</i>

148
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:18,881
<i>An escapist can get out of
the most difficult situations.</i>

149
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,756
- Do you wanna play with me?
- Not even drunk...

150
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:33,865
...as a skunk!
- I haven't told you what at yet!

151
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,967
Ok, tell me.

152
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:41,706
<i>You're the skunk, nerd!</i>

153
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:49,504
<i>To do his job, Houdini had to
be in perfect physical shape.</i>

154
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,775
<i>He ran several miles a day...</i>

155
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:56,479
<i>...and could stay under water
for four minutes. Four minutes!</i>

156
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:05,596
<i>Houdini offered rewards to
anyone who could lock him up.</i>

157
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:09,495
<i>Many accepted the challenge,
only to lose.</i>

158
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:12,034
<i>He always escaped!</i>

159
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:23,213
- Yummy!
- Try the chili sauce.

160
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:26,648
I made the Tabasco too,
but it's a bit hotter.

161
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:30,312
The amount of firewood I had
to use! It burns quicker than...

162
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:33,084
Chemical coals burn slower...

163
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,750
What's this?
The rule is...

164
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:39,125
...science at the table...
... is bad manners!

165
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,932
Can we get to the point?

166
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:48,296
We'll be staying here for a
while. We don't know...

167
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,067
...for how long yet.

168
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,574
And our stuff?
There's nothing here.

169
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,908
- It's boring!
- It's boring!

170
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:00,041
I may go by the house
soon and bring some stuff...

171
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,676
...or have someone do it.

172
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,114
No school for a time.

173
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:11,426
I must go to the lab. But dad'll
stay with you for a few days.

174
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:14,430
- Tell them about the names.
- Just a second.

175
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:17,364
Be careful around the pool,
it's dangerous.

176
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,998
I'll teach you to use the gas
and fill the tank...

177
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,370
...there's no running water.

178
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:26,072
Don't answer
or use the phone.

179
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,338
- It's forbidden.
- Why?

180
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,879
If your mum says so,
there's a reason, ok?

181
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:37,680
Right, from now on,
we change our names.

182
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:40,917
- Change them?
- No one must know we're here.

183
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,120
If anyone comes asking for us
or phones...

184
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,993
<i>- They're not supposed
to answer! - Wait, wait...</i>

185
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:49,965
You mean we'll have
other names?

186
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:51,797
- Yes.
- For ever?

187
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,830
For some time, we said.

188
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:59,033
Then what if I have a new
name and I phone Bertuccio?

189
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,942
He'll realize it's me,
he's not stupid.

190
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,879
Didn't I make myself clear?
No phone calls, I said.

191
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,952
Not even if your name's
"The Wizard of Oz".

192
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:22,395
From now on,
we're the Vincents.

193
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,568
I'm David...

194
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:27,067
...and I'm an architect.

195
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:36,573
David Vincent,
the architect!

196
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:40,208
- What? What?
- Like in The Invaders.

197
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,582
Dad is David Vincent!

198
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:47,054
- Can I choose my name?
- Me too?

199
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,954
Harry.
I wanna be Harry.

200
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:56,862
Nobody's wearing what we
used to. We could only bring...

201
00:18:57,002 --> 00:19:00,267
...what we had on. Me neither.
- I want MY pajamas.

202
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:20,254
What's wrong with
this lion that's so hard?

203
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,198
He's softening it up.

204
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:00,330
What happened?

205
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:05,131
Did you drink a lot of
coke last night?

206
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:10,769
- Don't say anything. - Ok, but you
have to promise me something.

207
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,308
What?

208
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:14,839
You won't drink anything...

209
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,880
...at night, nothing.

210
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:20,416
No soda water, no water,
coke, nothing.

211
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:24,312
Is it dead?

212
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,724
It's the one I saw before.

213
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,520
It must have drowned.

214
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:31,788
It can't drown!
It's a toad!

215
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,057
Toads breathe air.

216
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,691
Obviously, it got trapped.

217
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,307
Yucky creature.
Loot at the skin.

218
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:54,809
"... Houdini's first stage
name was Eric The Great. "

219
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:58,650
Because his real name
wasn't Harry, see?

220
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:01,986
"At first, he was
assisted in his performance...

221
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:05,358
...by a co-worker from the
factory where he worked. "

222
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:09,263
Because he was poor and
worked since he was a boy.

223
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:14,338
"But later, he turned to
his younger brother, Theo. "

224
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,902
Turn it up, little guy.

225
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,916
I wanna watch The Saint!

226
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:33,452
<i>The Minister denied
categorically that anyone...</i>

227
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:38,052
<i>...on the list is being held by the
executive power, or in prison...</i>

228
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:41,597
They gotta whitewash
political prisoners.

229
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:44,361
- Who, me?
- Let me listen to it.

230
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,298
Tie me up, Little Guy.

231
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,964
- Who, me?
- Yes, you.

232
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,916
<i>We're writing a new chapter
in Argentina's...</i>

233
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,110
<i>...economic history.</i>

234
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,915
Sure, a new chapter.

235
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:08,083
<i>We'll open our markets
to foreign trade...</i>

236
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:10,227
Is that okay?

237
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,387
Tighter.

238
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:17,699
<i>...leading to the freedom of
our productive forces...</i>

239
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,964
What will your productive
forces produce?

240
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,667
More misery.

241
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:25,802
Perfect.

242
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:27,411
- Okay?
- Yes.

243
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:31,315
<i>The President of Argentina,
General Jorge Rafael Videla...</i>

244
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:35,978
<i>...stated that the government will
beat the rebels at any cost...</i>

245
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,590
Hey, what are you doing?

246
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:45,993
- Whitewashing the prisoner!
- Go away!

247
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,437
Who am I?
I said, who am I?

248
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:04,104
- Vincent.
- I work for...?

249
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:07,150
A construction company.
Campbell & Co.

250
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:09,753
- What about mom?
- Housewife!

251
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:12,047
We met at...?

252
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:16,560
- At...
- University.

253
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:18,788
We studied together.

254
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:22,862
She quit when we married.
I told you a million times!

255
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:36,981
Come here.

256
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:46,881
Stand here.

257
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:51,959
Hold this hand firm,
move this one when you hit.

258
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,793
Watch your feet.
Wide apart, this way.

259
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,560
Look that way.

260
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:00,270
Make sure the wood holds
steady, about a meter away...

261
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:03,238
...so that it doesn't splinter
away. Okay? - Yes.

262
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,740
Let's see.

263
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:08,510
Again...

264
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:11,075
...further back...

265
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,714
<i>...here, come on!</i>

266
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:43,537
- Can I come in?
- Yes.

267
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:46,047
What's cooking,
good-looking?

268
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:51,119
- What's that?
- Trunks.

269
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:52,689
- Nice, eh?
- Yes.

270
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:56,624
Houdini used to be chained
inside and thrown into the sea.

271
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,490
Once he was at the
bottom of a swimming pool...

272
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:03,624
...for 90 minutes,
no oxygen tubes, nothing.

273
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:06,134
- Amazing, isn't it?
- Houdini, the magician?

274
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:10,207
He wasn't a magician! He was
an escapist. It's different.

275
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:15,245
- Sure. Where did you get this?
- I found it there.

276
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,905
Only a fool would
leave this.

277
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,845
Maybe this Pedro
left it for you...

278
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,685
- What? Really!
- When I grow up...

279
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:26,313
...I wanna be an escapist.

280
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:30,192
And be locked in there,
and thrown in the sea?

281
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:31,818
Really?

282
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:33,521
My little boy.

283
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:39,429
You know something?
A boy's coming to live with us.

284
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:40,969
A boy? Who?

285
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:44,098
- Just a boy.
- Are you gonna adopt him?

286
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:48,176
Don't be a fool!
It's just for a few days.

287
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,644
He needs someplace
to stay.

288
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:54,943
But you gotta help me
with the Little Guy.

289
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:59,886
Ok?
You know, changes upset him...

290
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:06,328
Poor thing. I know he's doing
his best, isn't he?

291
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:10,501
- Did he give you much
trouble today? - No.

292
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:17,233
So, what then?
Will you help me?

293
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:19,499
Will you?

294
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:23,872
You know what's important.

295
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:28,185
- What? - Knowing how long
it takes to unchain yourself.

296
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,214
When you know so,
you'll know how much...

297
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:35,986
...oxygen you need.
Because oxygen needs space.

298
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:39,591
If you don't give it space,
you'll suffocate.

299
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:42,897
So this way
they'll survive?

300
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,901
<i>Some will.
The smart ones, for sure!</i>

301
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:48,596
Back a bit, there.

302
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:51,198
There, hold it.

303
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:54,640
Don't let it go.

304
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:59,374
There we go.
Hold it.

305
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:13,897
Now let it go.

306
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,623
Ready.

307
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,927
- Why don't we use this? It's
easier. - But at night...

308
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:24,132
...when we're asleep,
or when we leave this place...

309
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:27,005
They gotta learn
to survive alone!

310
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,335
Here comes mom!
Here comes mom!

311
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:01,035
Stay with me.
She's with the boy.

312
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:05,849
<i>Hi, mom!</i>

313
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:08,180
Hi, sweetie.

314
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:12,914
Oh, I missed you so much.

315
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:15,586
- Have you played a lot today?
- Yes!

316
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:17,422
- This way, Lucas.
- Okay.

317
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:19,325
Where's your brother?

318
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:22,490
- Where's he? - I don't know,
somewhere around.

319
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:35,407
- Did you have your milk? Did
daddy make it for you? - Yes!

320
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,412
- He did?
- Yes!

321
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:41,478
Hello, love.

322
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:44,785
Fine.

323
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:47,989
- This is David, my husband.
- How's it going?

324
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:49,684
- Okay?
- Fine.

325
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:54,528
- Gorgeous place, you were
right. - Simon, our youngest son.

326
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:58,130
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to
meet you. - Nice to meet you.

327
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:00,066
And this is Harry.

328
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,435
Harry. Cool name.

329
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:07,508
He speaks, but I hypnotize
him when we have guests.

330
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:13,912
This is Lucas, boys. He's gonna
stay with us for a few days.

331
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:18,516
- Can we show Lucas around?
- Of course.

332
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,221
We gotta take it all down.

333
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:26,660
Come on!

334
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,000
SAINT'S BED

335
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:42,375
HARRY AND SIMON'S CLOSET
HARRY'S BED

336
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:44,972
Why take them down?

337
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:49,576
Because he's not a boy.
He's a guard, a cop!

338
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:51,689
What if he's an Invader?

339
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:53,347
Excuse me.

340
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:55,625
And the mattress?

341
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:59,795
We took it outside
to somersault.

342
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,962
- Lucas's gonna sleep here
with you. - I can sleep...

343
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:07,094
...in the living room. - No!
It's freezing to death there.

344
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:09,399
Put your things anywhere.

345
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:31,456
- Who's the cutest little boy
in the world? - Me!

346
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:33,530
I'd take you in my purse...

347
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:37,692
...if I could fit you in!
How much I love you!

348
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,303
Me toooo!

349
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:42,396
If you behave well,
very, very well...

350
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,304
...we're gonna go home and get...

351
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:46,671
...some stuff.

352
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:48,870
- My lion!
... please, mom!

353
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:53,780
- My TEG! - My pajamas,
my tiki-taka! - Stop it!

354
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:58,713
Only one thing each,
or it's gonna be too much.

355
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:06,156
- Don't be mean, mom.
- Alright, 2 things, 3 things.

356
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:10,757
- TEG, TEG! Please, bring
the TEG -Tiki-taka!

357
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:13,799
If you need anything,
ask Lucas, ok?

358
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:15,735
Lucas!

359
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:20,300
Come here.

360
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:24,071
- How long has he been wetting
the bed? - Two days.

361
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,809
But don't tell him
I told you.

362
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:31,246
Don't worry,
I'll take care of him.

363
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,722
- I'm gonna call as many times
as I can. - But we can't answer!

364
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:38,226
3 rings and I hang up, twice.
On the third call you can answer.

365
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:40,923
- That's our secret code.
- Bye!

366
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:46,392
You pour the milk in this way.
See?

367
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:49,606
And stir, and stir.

368
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:54,507
It's lumpy. You can chew
the lumps like this.

369
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:59,739
- Chocolate!
- You can't have Nesquik.

370
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:02,442
You'll get tummy ache.

371
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:05,112
Oh, really?

372
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:11,053
Ask me to help you out, then.

373
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:15,828
I can make some for you.

374
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:21,498
Your name's not Lucas, is it?

375
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,535
No, it isn't.

376
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:27,171
Are you really Harry?

377
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,988
Newfoundland to N.Y., 3.

378
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,840
Brazil to Sahara, 3.

379
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:08,178
Again, Brazil to Sahara, 3.

380
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:20,761
- I take my own counters!
- Don't get pissed off. Hurry.

381
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:27,594
Iran to China with 3.

382
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:30,207
- Again?
- I'm winning.

383
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,775
Again, because I'm winning.

384
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:35,105
Iran to China with 3.

385
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:47,720
Again, with 3.
You... just 1.

386
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:58,666
<i>That's "TEG". The world
is divided into countries.</i>

387
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:01,499
<i>These are controlled
by armies.</i>

388
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:04,267
<i>Each army is a different color.</i>

389
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:07,867
<i>For example, right now I'm
the blue army.</i>

390
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:12,305
<i>The first one to control
30 countries wins.</i>

391
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,241
<i>But that's with
4 or 5 players.</i>

392
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,315
<i>With dad,
I play one to one.</i>

393
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:22,620
<i>To live or die.
And I always die.</i>

394
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,929
Taimir to Siberia with 3.

395
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:29,625
- Let him win sometime.
- Why? He'll win when he can!

396
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:35,472
Not again!

397
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:02,559
- Morning.
- Hi.

398
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:06,720
There's coffee in the fridge.

399
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:09,729
Mom makes gallons of coffee
and then reheats it.

400
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:13,803
- Thanks, I had some earlier when
your folks left. - Are they gone?

401
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:16,702
- Where?
- I don't know.

402
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:23,011
- What time are they coming
back? - They didn't say.

403
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:26,873
You know nothing!

404
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:36,120
Is this yours?

405
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:41,626
I know some magic, if you have
some cards I'll teach you tricks.

406
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:45,998
Card games are for kids.
And magic is stupid!

407
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:49,300
Houdini was an escapist,
not a magician.

408
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,341
What he did,
he did for real.

409
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:16,631
HOW LONG?

410
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:25,967
HE RAN SEVERAL MILES A DAY

411
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:40,389
HOUDINI HAD TO BE
IN PERFECT PHYSICAL SHAPE

412
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,598
HE COULD STAY UNDER
WATER FOR FOUR MINUTES

413
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:54,864
FOUR MINUTES!

414
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:06,012
Let us pray.

415
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:11,684
Lord, let's pray so that this
sacrament, received with joy...

416
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:14,380
...in commemoration
of St. Jerome...

417
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:17,688
...encourages the hearts
of the faithful.

418
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:20,524
Blessed be the name
of the Lord.

419
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:23,031
Now and forever.

420
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:27,261
Our help cometh
from the Lord.

421
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:30,533
Who created heaven and earth.

422
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:34,441
Let us stand.

423
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:40,250
In the name of the Father...

424
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:43,148
...and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit.

425
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:44,811
Amen.

426
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:51,125
Don't worry, they won't
be in the records.

427
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:54,887
There'll be a report card, but
no legal record or anything...

428
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:57,432
...that could reach
the Ministry.

429
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:27,761
Hey, don't be mad.

430
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:31,861
We don't want you
to get behind, that's all.

431
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:34,061
You've missed enough.

432
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:37,541
But if you catch up,
and when all this is over...

433
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:41,406
...you'll be back in the same
class at your old school.

434
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:46,244
Anyway, it's good to meet new
people, make new friends...

435
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,785
I don't need new friends.

436
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,913
I already have friends, but
you don't let me see them!

437
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:19,580
- Good morning.
- Good morning, father John.

438
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:21,810
Very kind of you.

439
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:26,121
I guess these clothes
are a donation.

440
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,916
But, if you decide
to claim for them...

441
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:33,988
...you can do it personally
at my office.

442
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,463
I'm here to introduce
a new classmate.

443
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:42,670
This is not a Roman circus...

444
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:47,371
...so please
don't behave like lions.

445
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:49,945
This is Harold.

446
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:55,878
Welcome.

447
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:12,696
- Daddy, what's this?
- It's like a greeting.

448
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:16,234
Evening.
How's it going?

449
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:18,773
- Have you eaten?
- No, nothing.

450
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:20,274
Join us.

451
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,877
How was your first day?

452
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,281
I think I put my foot
in it.

453
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:38,391
<i>Hello, God!</i>

454
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,653
Bye, God!

455
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:51,339
- The teacher said I had
nice hair. - Of course you do.

456
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:06,754
You wanna dance?

457
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:18,966
Hey!

458
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:22,539
Hey, where are you going?
It's cold out.

459
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,888
Mom, come and join us.

460
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:27,697
Your breathing...

461
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,873
...must always be regular...

462
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,769
...always.

463
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:36,977
Regular.
Keep the pace!

464
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,280
Come on!

465
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:58,927
- What's this?
- Are you okay?

466
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:00,627
I don't know.

467
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:02,204
Yes. Fine.

468
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:06,335
The key is to resist.

469
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:08,835
The fastest never wins.

470
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,379
The one that holds on does!

471
00:44:11,515 --> 00:44:15,110
- Where did you learn to run
this way? - The less you know...

472
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:18,119
...about me, the safer it'll be
for you. - At least...

473
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:22,089
...tell me if you always ran
like this or if you learned.

474
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:23,989
All good things are learned.

475
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:26,619
We know some things
since we're born.

476
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:29,858
- But you gotta learn to do
them well. - Really?

477
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,332
Thinking.
That's one.

478
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:35,839
- Swimming.
- Breathing.

479
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,339
Moving, walking, running...!

480
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:40,840
Feeling.

481
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:42,878
- Speaking.
- Laughing.

482
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,004
- Looking.
- Touching.

483
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:46,673
Playing.

484
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:48,214
Singing.

485
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:19,681
- Come join us!
- You're nuts!

486
00:45:28,525 --> 00:45:29,719
Move it!

487
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:00,916
- State-owned or private?
- Sate-owned.

488
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:03,848
- Which area?
- Wrong question.

489
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:07,479
- City or suburbs?
- Neither.

490
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:09,717
- Where are you from?
- Wrong question.

491
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:14,422
- Come on, tell me.
- Okay, La Plata, but...

492
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:17,033
- You got a dad?
- Yes, I have.

493
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:19,294
- You got a mom?
- Yes, I have.

494
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:22,269
- Then, what are you doing
here? - Wrong question.

495
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:25,637
- You had an argument with
your parents and ran away? -No!

496
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:27,937
Then, what are you
doing here?

497
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:31,206
- I'm fighting to save the world.
- Come on!

498
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,179
See? You don't
believe the truth.

499
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:35,478
Your parents threw you
out after a fight?

500
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:36,551
No!

501
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:39,349
One leaves home after a fight
or to get married.

502
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:42,788
- That's old-fashioned! - That's
you! You think you're cool...

503
00:47:42,926 --> 00:47:45,486
...'cause you have a girlfriend.
- Who told you?

504
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:47,358
I saw her!
I saw her!

505
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:51,695
- Where? - There's a photo in
your wallet and I saw her tits!

506
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:07,376
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

507
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:12,453
<i>Freedom, freedom...!</i>

508
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:15,183
- He's drunk, isn't he?
- Completely.

509
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:18,452
- What happened?
- What happened, love?

510
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:23,123
<i>- He's pissed! - We will
make Will Cadory to spit.</i>

511
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:27,203
<i>- Wèll what? - We will make
Will Cadory to spit.</i>

512
00:48:27,337 --> 00:48:29,396
Who's Will Cadory?

513
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:32,667
<i>We will swear with Glory
to live!</i>

514
00:49:22,926 --> 00:49:26,794
- Why are you back so early?
- You scared me.

515
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:30,192
You should be at work.

516
00:49:30,334 --> 00:49:31,699
I was fired...

517
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:34,267
...from the lab.

518
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:37,432
- Do you want your milk?
- Yes.

519
00:49:37,574 --> 00:49:39,235
Let me prepare it.

520
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:26,345
When I grow up,
I wanna be a saint.

521
00:50:26,823 --> 00:50:30,884
I told you before, Simon
Templar isn't a real saint.

522
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:46,032
<i>What's this? Who are you?
Get out!</i>

523
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:48,167
<i>Let me go!</i>

524
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:53,147
<i>Let me go!
What will you do with us?</i>

525
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:09,294
<i>Don't waste your time.</i>

526
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:13,363
<i>Perhaps he won't return.</i>

527
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:15,562
<i>The ship needs him.</i>

528
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,591
Hello?

529
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:40,661
Hello?

530
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,124
Hello?

531
00:51:45,335 --> 00:51:47,895
- Who is it?
- Some idiot.

532
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:19,495
How come you don't know the
name of any classmate?

533
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:22,196
- They're all stupid.
- No way!

534
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:24,864
- Is that too tight?
- Tighter.

535
00:52:25,008 --> 00:52:27,602
- Tighter?
- Tighter.

536
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:30,069
- I'm making it tight.
- Perfect.

537
00:52:30,213 --> 00:52:31,908
Perfect.

538
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:35,751
- I'll time you.
- Stay on that side!

539
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:38,979
- On the other side?
- But don't look, okay?

540
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:43,349
Let's see...

541
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,758
If it's a minute,
you're "Houdini".

542
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:51,061
If it's 2, you're "Averagini".
More than 3, you're "Louserini".

543
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:52,566
- Come on!
- Ready?

544
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:55,330
- Yes.
- Go, go!

545
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:03,169
Hey, if you shit on your pants,
you're out.

546
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:10,346
Don't you have any friends?

547
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:13,583
Of course I do.

548
00:53:16,293 --> 00:53:18,284
When do you see them?

549
00:53:20,564 --> 00:53:21,826
Never.

550
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,593
Don't you ever feel
like calling them?

551
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:29,167
What if you call them?
Would they tell you off?

552
00:53:29,773 --> 00:53:31,240
No. Why?

553
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:36,603
I'm a fugitive and I don't
wanna put them in danger.

554
00:53:36,947 --> 00:53:39,245
And the way things are...

555
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:43,049
You're my only friend, now.

556
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:45,888
You're all I've got.

557
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,415
Well, you and your family.

558
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:55,794
Come on! You're 30 seconds
away from losing.

559
00:53:55,966 --> 00:53:57,593
Did you hear me?

560
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:07,400
Sit up. It was too
tight, you could say so!

561
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:10,945
Or do I have to teach you to
speak as well? Give me your hand.

562
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,343
That's it.

563
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:16,411
- Does it hurt?
- I can't feel anything.

564
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:18,418
Give me the other hand.

565
00:54:18,555 --> 00:54:21,820
If it's too tight
it cuts off your bloodstream.

566
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:26,220
- Better? - What if
they don't come back?

567
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:31,098
Mom and Dad, what if
they don't come back?

568
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:43,545
- We got held up.
- Are the kids asleep?

569
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,978
- Did they eat okay?
- We had to avoid...

570
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:49,711
...the military check-out points.
- Harry was a bit sick.

571
00:54:59,195 --> 00:55:01,026
I'm here, sweetie.

572
00:55:02,232 --> 00:55:04,462
Call me if you need me.

573
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:10,263
I know you're awake, you know,
'cause I gave you birth.

574
00:55:13,176 --> 00:55:17,943
Of all my scientific experiments,
which I did a lot...

575
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:21,348
...you're the one
that came out best.

576
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:27,189
I don't care if
I'm talking nonsense...

577
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:30,055
...or drooling your ear...

578
00:55:30,794 --> 00:55:33,627
...or if I sound
like Bertuccio's mom.

579
00:55:35,565 --> 00:55:38,432
My sweet,
my darling little boy...

580
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:43,198
Keep all the kisses.

581
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:45,905
I love you.

582
00:55:58,421 --> 00:56:02,016
Dad didn't agree, as usual. But
I convinced him. So we leave...

583
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:06,117
...first thing Saturday
and return Sunday night.

584
00:56:06,262 --> 00:56:08,890
Yes! We're going to
grandpa's birthday.

585
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:11,899
Yippee!
We're going!

586
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:16,598
- Can Lucas come? - I invited
him but he's got stuff to do.

587
00:56:18,074 --> 00:56:22,374
- The oil's burning! - Get out
of my way, I'm in a hurry.

588
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:25,814
- Let me help.
- Okay, come here.

589
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:29,316
You gotta add some stock to
the egg to make it tastier.

590
00:56:29,452 --> 00:56:34,253
- Where did you pick that up?
- Bertuccio's mom told me.

591
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:38,954
- She's a genius. - What a
concept of genius you've got!

592
00:56:39,095 --> 00:56:42,292
So it's the same: Einstein,
Michelangelo and Bertuccio's...

593
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:46,129
...mother who is a fat ass!
- She's not fat. - Move...

594
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:49,636
She's always at home and
she helps with his homework!

595
00:56:49,773 --> 00:56:52,469
Yes, but you never need help.

596
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:55,303
It's burning.

597
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:02,544
You finish frying them, okay?
Be careful with the oil.

598
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:05,916
Any problems,
ring Bertuccio's mom.

599
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:09,722
- Are you serious?
- No, just kidding. I was kidding!

600
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:13,195
- You gotta go?
- Yes.

601
00:57:13,463 --> 00:57:16,728
- Where?
- A meeting at work.

602
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:19,562
- You were fired!
- They fired me from the lab.

603
00:57:19,702 --> 00:57:21,897
But I still have
stuff to do.

604
00:57:22,038 --> 00:57:25,496
- More important than us?
- No, never.

605
00:57:25,642 --> 00:57:27,837
So stay here, then.

606
00:57:29,512 --> 00:57:33,312
You can't ask me to do
something wrong. Not you.

607
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:52,694
You know, your dad's old now.

608
00:57:52,869 --> 00:57:55,303
He won't be with you
much longer.

609
00:57:55,605 --> 00:57:59,234
If he gets on your nerves,
take a deep breath...

610
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:01,309
...and count to ten.

611
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:05,013
Do you do that every night?

612
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:06,911
I wish she did.

613
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:11,519
But we hear you every night
going "Ah, ah, ah... "

614
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:19,751
Look at him. He's been
asleep the whole journey.

615
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:23,798
No, remember, he woke up in
La Plata asking about vaccines.

616
00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:27,994
"Daddy, daddy, do you have to
be vaccinated to be a saint?"

617
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:30,468
Look what he did!

618
00:58:30,607 --> 00:58:33,735
- I almost strangled him!
- Don't give him hell, he hasn't...

619
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:35,742
...wetted the bed today.

620
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:39,713
Well, I got up 3 times to take
him to pee but it was worth it.

621
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:43,649
- I got up once.
- And me twice more!

622
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:48,117
- I can't believe it. - That's why
he looks like a zombie. - Zombie!

623
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:12,441
Happy birthday, grandpa!

624
00:59:13,616 --> 00:59:16,380
Thank you. I see you still
have that old heap!

625
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:20,455
With two boys, it's the best
car to have. Happy birthday.

626
00:59:21,758 --> 00:59:23,623
Open it!
Open it!

627
00:59:25,595 --> 00:59:27,290
Oh, my favorites!

628
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:30,126
- Mom, are they chocolate?
- No, they're real.

629
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:33,394
- Happy birthday, grandpa.
- More gifts! Let's see.

630
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:38,366
I don't know if you want to
please me or kill me?

631
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:41,536
Whisky and cigars!

632
00:59:42,045 --> 00:59:44,036
You know when I last
saw you?

633
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:48,514
- When?
- 6 months and 12 days ago.

634
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,910
It's not your fault.

635
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:55,721
...8, 9, 10. And now?
Do I start again?

636
00:59:55,858 --> 00:59:57,450
Take a deep breath.

637
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:02,224
First, second, third, fourth...

638
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:04,329
...and reverse.

639
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,832
Again, but harder.

640
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:09,266
- That's it, good.
- First...

641
01:00:09,405 --> 01:00:11,805
...second, third...

642
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:14,967
...fourth... - Tell me,
your friend from China?

643
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:18,046
- Japan!
- China, Japan...

644
01:00:18,181 --> 01:00:19,944
How is he doing?

645
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:23,176
- He changed school last year.
- Really?

646
01:00:23,753 --> 01:00:26,449
What about... what's his name,
Bertutti?

647
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:29,683
- Bertuccio!
- Bertuccio.

648
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,760
How's Bertuccio doing?

649
01:00:35,565 --> 01:00:38,329
Don't tell me he
also changed school!

650
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:44,429
- No, I did.
- Really?

651
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:49,471
To a religious school run by
a priest friend of dad's.

652
01:00:49,779 --> 01:00:53,374
Since we've been going, my
brother wants to be a saint.

653
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:55,847
We live in the suburbs.

654
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:59,352
Mom was fired from the lab.
Dad had to shut down...

655
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:02,788
...his law office.
Some militars broke into it...

656
01:01:02,925 --> 01:01:08,022
...and destroyed everything, they
seized Roberto, his partner.

657
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:10,257
Sometimes he works at home.

658
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,130
Before, he used to work in
pubs but there were...

659
01:01:13,269 --> 01:01:15,737
...a lot of policemen around.

660
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:20,936
Promise me something.

661
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:24,037
Grandpa.

662
01:01:25,481 --> 01:01:27,005
Grandpa.

663
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:32,918
- Yes.
- Don't fight.

664
01:01:33,489 --> 01:01:35,423
Not this time.

665
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:57,743
If I'm not wrong,
there should be one here.

666
01:01:58,414 --> 01:02:01,645
- What's that smell?
- Mothballs.

667
01:02:01,818 --> 01:02:05,219
That's how things last for
so long. Here we go.

668
01:02:05,488 --> 01:02:07,649
This one.
Let's see...

669
01:02:09,092 --> 01:02:11,253
I knew it would fit.

670
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:20,759
This is all like it always
was, right?

671
01:02:21,304 --> 01:02:23,795
I mean, when dad was a kid.

672
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:25,631
Just the same.

673
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:29,110
Why didn't you change it?

674
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:31,907
- Into a playroom!
- For me?

675
01:02:32,849 --> 01:02:36,216
In a way, it is a playroom,
the way it is.

676
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:39,586
It's my time machine.

677
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:44,253
Whenever I come to dust,
I sit here and look around...

678
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:46,518
...and remember things.

679
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:49,526
You miss him, don't you?

680
01:02:50,867 --> 01:02:55,236
You want to know if I go
around weeping like a fool?

681
01:02:55,705 --> 01:02:57,605
No, I don't.

682
01:02:58,674 --> 01:03:01,472
But I like to remember
the good old times.

683
01:03:08,351 --> 01:03:10,319
We gotta find a reed...

684
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:13,284
...as thick as a finger,
more or less.

685
01:03:13,489 --> 01:03:17,186
Hollow it, then you can use
it to breathe under water.

686
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:21,192
- This one? - No, as thick
as my finger not yours.

687
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:23,423
If not, you can't breathe!

688
01:03:26,769 --> 01:03:30,569
- But there aren't any that thick.
- There are a lot, look.

689
01:03:30,706 --> 01:03:32,333
All right.

690
01:03:44,053 --> 01:03:46,544
Schools always need teachers.

691
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:49,988
That could be a temporary
solution, at least.

692
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:54,160
Try and convince him.
If I do...

693
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:57,425
...he won't listen. If his
dad does, hell's gonna burn.

694
01:03:57,567 --> 01:04:00,365
You know how they are,
two of a kind.

695
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,601
Come in, love.

696
01:04:04,073 --> 01:04:05,597
We're also to blame.

697
01:04:05,741 --> 01:04:09,268
Why? 'Cause we taught him to
take love, but not to give it.

698
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:12,779
They love each other whether
fighting or playing tough.

699
01:04:12,915 --> 01:04:15,577
You know what it's like
to live with 3 brutes.

700
01:04:15,718 --> 01:04:19,119
But then, when they grow up
and can't fight any more...

701
01:04:19,255 --> 01:04:23,214
Nothing will change. Someway,
they'll fight differently.

702
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:27,395
You won't be like that,
will you, dear?

703
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:31,861
The situation's tough, dad,
militars kill people every day.

704
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:34,936
We want to be together
as much as we can.

705
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:37,264
Is it so hard
to understand?

706
01:04:37,773 --> 01:04:40,606
- Come on, pour.
- It'll hurt.

707
01:04:40,843 --> 01:04:43,209
- You must see a doctor!
- Pour.

708
01:04:43,479 --> 01:04:46,243
David Vincent is brave
and doesn't cry.

709
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:54,287
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

710
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,157
Poor bird, eh?

711
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:25,613
- Can I take one?
- Yes.

712
01:05:26,122 --> 01:05:28,283
Here.
Then it's bath time, ok?

713
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:29,618
All right.

714
01:05:36,165 --> 01:05:37,530
See you up there.

715
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:40,636
No, wait.
Hang it round your neck.

716
01:05:42,171 --> 01:05:43,536
Like that.

717
01:05:45,574 --> 01:05:48,668
- Press here, right?
- Yes. This one to shoot...

718
01:05:48,844 --> 01:05:52,075
...and turn here
to wind the film.

719
01:05:53,649 --> 01:05:56,277
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking a photo.

720
01:05:56,419 --> 01:05:59,115
No, don't, really.
I hate photos.

721
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:02,224
You can take one of all this,
or that duck...

722
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:07,386
- Who cares about the duck?
- Go on, take one, but not of me.

723
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:11,463
I always come out with
a stupid grin on my face...

724
01:06:11,701 --> 01:06:15,262
...and you wonder, "What was
this guy thinking about?"

725
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:17,972
What are you
thinking about now?

726
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:21,007
That my son's a pain in the ass
taking photos...

727
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:26,240
...when I don't want.
- Come on, dad, tell me.

728
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:42,123
That we should've come here
more often.

729
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,363
And... why don't we stay?

730
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,297
Because we can't.

731
01:06:58,814 --> 01:07:00,304
Look at me.

732
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:04,347
Hey, look at me.
Look at me now.

733
01:07:06,088 --> 01:07:07,953
Look at me now.

734
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:12,887
We can't, son.

735
01:07:15,831 --> 01:07:17,355
We can't.

736
01:07:18,267 --> 01:07:19,859
We can't.

737
01:07:23,105 --> 01:07:25,039
Do you understand?

738
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:52,193
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

739
01:07:52,334 --> 01:07:55,599
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

740
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:59,435
<i>Happy birthday, dear Grandpa...</i>

741
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:02,810
<i>...happy birthday to you.</i>

742
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:05,543
Blow!

743
01:08:06,282 --> 01:08:07,510
Bravo!

744
01:08:09,385 --> 01:08:11,250
What a lot of smoke!

745
01:08:12,555 --> 01:08:14,819
Move together for a photo.

746
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:18,086
Cheer up a bit, please.

747
01:08:19,195 --> 01:08:23,632
- Grandpa's teaching me
to drive. - I wanna learn, too.

748
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:28,066
- Tell grandpa he's nuts.
- He told me you'd say that.

749
01:08:28,204 --> 01:08:31,731
He also told me to tell you
that you learned to drive...

750
01:08:31,874 --> 01:08:34,900
...when you were
younger than me.

751
01:08:35,544 --> 01:08:37,205
That's better.

752
01:08:37,446 --> 01:08:41,849
<i>Sleep, little baby...</i>

753
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:46,618
<i>...your mommy's in the field.</i>

754
01:08:46,755 --> 01:08:50,452
Leave him, you big boy.
You'll wake him.

755
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:56,040
May I?

756
01:10:57,953 --> 01:11:00,820
- Look, a shooting star!
- Where?

757
01:11:00,956 --> 01:11:04,915
There. Didn't you see it?
It's gone now. It fell.

758
01:11:05,327 --> 01:11:07,852
When your mom and dad
were engaged...

759
01:11:07,997 --> 01:11:11,398
...we'd sit here after dinner,
looking at the sky.

760
01:11:11,534 --> 01:11:16,369
There were lots of Russian and
US satellites and capsules then.

761
01:11:16,505 --> 01:11:20,236
On a moonless night, you
could see them. We did once.

762
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:24,244
Mom and her satellite!
It was a shooting star!

763
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:28,146
- It was a red light!
- No! Red was the wine you had.

764
01:11:29,218 --> 01:11:31,345
What's a shooting star?

765
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:35,120
If you stare at the sky
without blinking...

766
01:11:35,257 --> 01:11:37,623
...you might see a star...

767
01:11:37,893 --> 01:11:39,622
...come and go...

768
01:11:40,196 --> 01:11:41,788
...at 1000 mph.

769
01:11:42,164 --> 01:11:44,724
- Goodnight all.
- See you tomorrow.

770
01:11:46,702 --> 01:11:50,536
- Come here, grandpa. - No,
you're going to make me fall.

771
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:53,303
Careful, be careful.

772
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:54,966
Who's gonna get me up now?

773
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:58,773
- He will, he's the strongest in
the family. - Stay there, grandpa.

774
01:11:58,914 --> 01:12:02,145
If I get cold, not even a crane
will get me out of here!

775
01:12:02,284 --> 01:12:04,081
They're called
shooting stars...

776
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:07,121
...but they are really meteorites
or bits of rock...

777
01:12:07,256 --> 01:12:09,383
- No, no science, please!
- Sure?

778
01:12:09,525 --> 01:12:12,119
- Yeah.
- I can't see anything.

779
01:12:12,261 --> 01:12:14,092
You have to be patient.

780
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:16,721
If you see one,
you can make a wish.

781
01:12:16,866 --> 01:12:20,393
- What have wishes to do with
stars? - Honestly I don't know...

782
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:24,700
...but they always come true.
I made one once, right here.

783
01:12:26,609 --> 01:12:28,873
- And it came true.
- Really?

784
01:12:29,245 --> 01:12:32,339
Whatever, but
I'm sure it was a satellite.

785
01:12:32,481 --> 01:12:34,642
<i>For God's sake, mom!</i>

786
01:12:35,618 --> 01:12:37,449
<i>- Look, another one!
- Where?</i>

787
01:12:37,586 --> 01:12:39,144
There, look.

788
01:12:39,521 --> 01:12:41,853
<i>You're a liar, mom!</i>

789
01:12:42,892 --> 01:12:45,486
<i>Shooting stars are stones...</i>

790
01:12:45,628 --> 01:12:50,122
<i>...that burn up when they
get close to the atmosphere.</i>

791
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,862
<i>Mom was right about that.</i>

792
01:12:54,603 --> 01:12:55,968
<i>For some reason...</i>

793
01:12:56,105 --> 01:13:01,133
<i>...they are directly
related to wishes.</i>

794
01:13:02,111 --> 01:13:04,545
<i>Dad was right about this.</i>

795
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:11,017
<i>I watched and watched
till my eyes burnt...</i>

796
01:13:11,153 --> 01:13:13,485
<i>...but I didn't see anything.</i>

797
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:17,116
<i>That must be why
my wish didn't come true.</i>

798
01:13:35,945 --> 01:13:37,378
Lucas!

799
01:13:39,048 --> 01:13:40,675
Lucas!

800
01:13:45,955 --> 01:13:47,149
Lucas!

801
01:14:06,842 --> 01:14:09,037
You're gonna knock me down.

802
01:14:09,545 --> 01:14:11,479
What happened to the lights?

803
01:14:11,647 --> 01:14:13,274
A local blackout.

804
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:16,948
What's up?

805
01:14:19,221 --> 01:14:20,745
You got a minute?

806
01:14:22,558 --> 01:14:25,618
Give your mom a hand
before it rains. Come on!

807
01:14:34,403 --> 01:14:36,598
Dead toad!
Dead toad!

808
01:14:43,512 --> 01:14:46,345
This isn't a hole.
It's an elevator.

809
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:48,950
We'll put it there so
it can go straight...

810
01:14:49,084 --> 01:14:51,052
...to toads' heaven.

811
01:15:05,734 --> 01:15:08,032
I'm gonna wash my hands.

812
01:15:24,953 --> 01:15:26,352
I gotta go.

813
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:29,790
Now?
You'll get soaking wet!

814
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:32,450
- Your dad's taking me to
the station. - Can I go?

815
01:15:32,594 --> 01:15:36,121
- No.
- Why not? It's just a second.

816
01:15:36,265 --> 01:15:37,664
It's late.

817
01:15:38,133 --> 01:15:40,363
I waited just to say goodbye.

818
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:47,507
I'm going, Harry,
this time for good.

819
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:50,978
- Do you really have to go?
- Yes.

820
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:52,938
Why?

821
01:15:53,949 --> 01:15:55,814
Wrong question.

822
01:16:03,592 --> 01:16:05,287
Is that it, then?

823
01:16:06,361 --> 01:16:08,556
"Bye", I turn and leave?

824
01:16:10,165 --> 01:16:13,157
- Aren't we friends?
- Friends?

825
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:17,034
What for? We'll never
see each other again.

826
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:26,572
- I left my orange T-shirt.
- Go get it yourself.

827
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:21,732
Lucas! Lucas!

828
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:53,498
If they ask, say I'm ill.

829
01:17:53,635 --> 01:17:56,763
- Mom's gonna be mad.
- Say you don't know.

830
01:17:56,905 --> 01:18:00,534
Say we went in together
and you didn't see me again.

831
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:04,077
Okay? Go on,
I'll meet you here.

832
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:06,710
Oh, I forgot.

833
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:11,110
Your comic.

834
01:18:18,994 --> 01:18:20,222
<i>Three requirements...</i>

835
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:24,696
<i>...distinguish the professional
escapist from the amateur.</i>

836
01:18:28,604 --> 01:18:31,505
<i>First, discipline.</i>

837
01:18:33,242 --> 01:18:36,939
<i>The escapist knows
his task is a daily one...</i>

838
01:18:37,079 --> 01:18:39,809
<i>...arduous and restless.</i>

839
01:18:39,948 --> 01:18:42,178
A ticket to Buenos Aires.

840
01:18:43,352 --> 01:18:48,585
<i>Second, concentration. The
escapist must distinguish...</i>

841
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:52,353
<i>...the important
from the superfluous.</i>

842
01:18:56,932 --> 01:19:00,493
<i>The last requirement
is courage.</i>

843
01:19:04,673 --> 01:19:06,834
<i>The escapist needs it...</i>

844
01:19:06,975 --> 01:19:10,934
<i>...to see his task
through to the end.</i>

845
01:19:12,948 --> 01:19:14,609
Good morning.

846
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:22,589
- Is Bertuccio in? - No, he's not
back. He's at his aunt's.

847
01:19:22,924 --> 01:19:24,949
That's a pity.

848
01:19:25,193 --> 01:19:29,254
- Tell him I called by.
- Of course, dear.

849
01:19:34,936 --> 01:19:37,336
Can I come by another day?

850
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:40,367
Yes, but phone first.

851
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:48,845
<i>The Houdini book tells
a lot of things.</i>

852
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:52,947
<i>Where he was born,
who his parents where...</i>

853
01:19:53,288 --> 01:19:55,518
<i>...how he became famous...</i>

854
01:19:55,657 --> 01:19:58,751
<i>...what his most difficult
stunts were.</i>

855
01:20:10,772 --> 01:20:13,070
<i>The only thing
it doesn't tell...</i>

856
01:20:13,208 --> 01:20:15,676
<i>...is how he managed
to escape.</i>

857
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:23,850
He's coming!
Mom, Dad, he's coming!

858
01:20:24,086 --> 01:20:26,520
<i>Mom, Dad, he's here!</i>

859
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:30,318
<i>Mom, Dad, he's here!</i>

860
01:21:11,066 --> 01:21:13,057
My little boy,
my little boy.

861
01:21:22,744 --> 01:21:25,941
<i>That night we had
a historic match.</i>

862
01:21:46,301 --> 01:21:49,429
Spain to Great Britain with 3.

863
01:21:51,339 --> 01:21:52,636
With 2.

864
01:21:52,774 --> 01:21:55,607
<i>I immediately began
to beat my dad.</i>

865
01:21:55,977 --> 01:21:57,842
<i>I was beating him by far.</i>

866
01:21:58,513 --> 01:22:01,175
Brazil to Sahara with 3.

867
01:22:08,523 --> 01:22:11,981
You move your counters,
I'll move mine, okay?

868
01:22:12,527 --> 01:22:14,290
<i>At the crucial point...</i>

869
01:22:14,429 --> 01:22:17,592
<i>...I controlled
forty-nine countries.</i>

870
01:22:18,366 --> 01:22:21,927
<i>Forty-nine!
And he had only one.</i>

871
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:25,865
Siberia to Kamchatka with 3.

872
01:22:40,655 --> 01:22:43,954
China to Kamchatka with 3.

873
01:22:58,874 --> 01:23:01,434
Japan to Kamchatka with 3.

874
01:23:02,611 --> 01:23:05,580
Wait!
I'm regrouping!

875
01:23:14,723 --> 01:23:17,248
- May I explain?
- Shut up and play!

876
01:23:22,697 --> 01:23:24,289
Add three.

877
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:26,928
Pass.

878
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:34,369
China to Kamchatka with 3.

879
01:23:49,891 --> 01:23:51,950
<i>This went on for hours.</i>

880
01:23:52,127 --> 01:23:54,925
<i>Kamchatka versus
the rest of the world.</i>

881
01:23:55,564 --> 01:23:57,532
<i>But I couldn't beat him.</i>

882
01:23:59,467 --> 01:24:01,662
Kamchatka to Siberia, 3.

883
01:24:50,018 --> 01:24:54,421
<i>The following morning,
Dad called for action.</i>

884
01:24:54,556 --> 01:24:56,114
Hurry up!

885
01:24:59,894 --> 01:25:01,327
Take him!

886
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:26,708
Mom?
What's wrong with dad?

887
01:27:05,186 --> 01:27:06,881
They also got Oscar.

888
01:27:12,894 --> 01:27:14,589
What do we do now?

889
01:27:33,481 --> 01:27:35,608
Can I go to the toilet?

890
01:27:38,453 --> 01:27:40,546
Wait till dad finishes.

891
01:27:42,757 --> 01:27:45,089
I can go with him,
he's finished.

892
01:28:02,377 --> 01:28:04,402
- There you go.
- Go out.

893
01:28:11,419 --> 01:28:13,444
- Are you there?
- Yes.

894
01:28:13,888 --> 01:28:16,982
Did you see all the people
out there eating?

895
01:28:19,227 --> 01:28:23,095
Do you think they were
also called for action?

896
01:28:29,737 --> 01:28:31,602
Faster! Faster!

897
01:31:33,788 --> 01:31:36,313
PEDRO '75.
HARRY '76.

898
01:32:24,172 --> 01:32:27,664
I need to know they'll
be safe from all this shit.

899
01:32:30,545 --> 01:32:32,604
Do you know what I fear?

900
01:32:35,783 --> 01:32:36,977
No, what?

901
01:32:37,885 --> 01:32:40,445
Never ever seeing them again.

902
01:36:32,086 --> 01:36:35,180
- What would you like?
- Coffee and milk.

903
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:42,554
Grandma is so happy
about your coming!

904
01:36:45,866 --> 01:36:47,390
And the Little Guy?

905
01:36:48,069 --> 01:36:50,196
He's asleep in the car.

906
01:36:53,574 --> 01:36:56,839
I think that if he wakes and
you're gone, he'll be scared.

907
01:36:56,977 --> 01:36:58,774
He's with mom.

908
01:37:45,659 --> 01:37:47,422
I love you.

909
01:38:01,642 --> 01:38:03,940
I'll wait by the van.

910
01:38:11,352 --> 01:38:12,979
Be a good boy.

911
01:39:04,472 --> 01:39:06,099
I love you very much.

912
01:39:08,876 --> 01:39:10,741
And never forget...

913
01:40:35,396 --> 01:40:37,864
<i>The last time I saw him...</i>

914
01:40:37,998 --> 01:40:40,660
<i>...my dad spoke of Kamchatka.</i>

915
01:40:41,201 --> 01:40:43,328
<i>This time I understood.</i>

916
01:40:44,505 --> 01:40:46,666
<i>Whenever I played...</i>

917
01:40:46,941 --> 01:40:49,102
<i>...dad was with me.</i>

918
01:40:49,677 --> 01:40:51,975
<i>When the game
got tough...</i>

919
01:40:52,513 --> 01:40:55,482
<i>...I stayed with him
and survived.</i>

920
01:40:56,383 --> 01:40:58,214
<i>Because Kamchatka...</i>

921
01:40:58,385 --> 01:41:01,218
<i>...is the place to be
when you want to resist.</i>

922
01:41:04,385 --> 01:46:05,218
