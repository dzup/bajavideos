1
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:08,267
This UNRWA notice says:

2
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,200
"They have stopped distribution

3
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:13,200
from Tuesday the 8th".

4
00:04:14,533 --> 00:04:17,267
A week ago,

5
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:20,267
and until an unknown date.

6
00:04:23,267 --> 00:04:25,600
There will only be

7
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:28,000
when the supplies are available.

8
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:31,733
You see how long now?

9
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,700
Since a week, and

10
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:35,700
until an unknown date.

11
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,600
This is due to the siege.

12
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,200
You have to wear this

13
00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:36,267
to be visible.

14
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:41,500
OK, I'll give it to him.

15
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:43,200
Don´t give it to him.

16
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:45,000
It is clear that he is a civilian,

17
00:05:45,067 --> 00:05:46,267
but you...

18
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:55,667
Do you want to go?

19
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:56,700
For sure.

20
00:06:15,267 --> 00:06:16,700
Look around,

21
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:18,333
look what's happened to this area.

22
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:35,300
So this place was all planted

23
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,667
with olives and palm trees?

24
00:06:37,267 --> 00:06:38,633
It was all trees.

25
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:40,267
Now they have completely erased it.

26
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:48,733
Do you remember the Nakba?

27
00:06:50,533 --> 00:06:52,267
Are you a local or a refugee, sir?

28
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,533
I am a refugee.

29
00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:54,800
Where from?

30
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,200
>From Salama.

31
00:06:57,133 --> 00:06:58,600
Where is Salama?

32
00:06:58,633 --> 00:07:00,133
In Jaffa.

33
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,700
It was a long time ago,

34
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:03,367
my father was still alive.

35
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,000
In which year were you expelled, sir?

36
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:06,800
In 1948?

37
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,200
Yes, in 1948.

38
00:07:24,267 --> 00:07:26,267
This is my place.

39
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:31,633
I have two sons.

40
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:33,200
Both of them working.

41
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,267
What do they do?

42
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:39,267
They farm parsley and spinach.

43
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,133
It's like if I give you

44
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,067
this piece of land to work on...

45
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,333
But on other peoples property,

46
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:52,133
not our property.

47
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:53,733
Are your sons married?

48
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,733
Yes.

49
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:56,400
May Allah protect them for you.

50
00:07:56,467 --> 00:07:57,533
Thank you.

51
00:08:00,267 --> 00:08:02,267
Where is your wife?

52
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,733
My wife is at home.

53
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,700
What is wrong with her?

54
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:07,067
This year she broke her hip.

55
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:14,667
Only Allah knows,

56
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,467
we will go there

57
00:08:16,533 --> 00:08:18,067
and meet her later.

58
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,200
The army hit the houses

59
00:08:22,267 --> 00:08:23,600
and last year they
also hit my sons house

60
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:25,533
with a shell.

61
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,133
They asked the baby

62
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,533
to cover his ears

63
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:34,000
and they made a big hole,

64
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:35,333
even bigger than this tent.

65
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,000
Really, they asked the baby

66
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:41,133
to cover his ears?

67
00:08:41,133 --> 00:08:42,267
His mother told me that.

68
00:08:50,267 --> 00:08:52,267
He dug this hole to hide in
when there's any shooting.

69
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,733
I go down there,

70
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:55,300
but it doesn't protect me...

71
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,200
The bullets whistle over my head...

72
00:09:04,267 --> 00:09:05,533
If there's any shooting

73
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,333
he goes and climbs in there to hide,

74
00:09:07,367 --> 00:09:09,067
in this hole in the ground.

75
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:27,267
My wife is over there.

76
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:34,033
How are you doing?

77
00:09:34,067 --> 00:09:35,333
How is your health?

78
00:09:39,133 --> 00:09:41,133
Oh, how are you cute little girl?

79
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:45,667
How are you?

80
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,267
I am fine.

81
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:30,133
The Israeli army

82
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,467
is shelling with F16's.

83
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:35,067
Maybe they have hit the tunnels.

84
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:37,300
We are living a very hard life.

85
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,333
We just want the
world to do something fair.

86
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,333
This is the situation in Gaza Strip.

87
00:10:45,733 --> 00:10:47,667
Can you hear that?

88
00:10:47,733 --> 00:10:50,033
It's the same every day.

89
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:53,067
Maybe this is an invasion
of the whole of the Gaza Strip.

90
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:56,533
We are normal people.

91
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,200
What do you think about it?

92
00:10:58,267 --> 00:11:00,267
You can film it with your camera.

93
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,267
Can you hear it?

94
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:11,000
The surveillance plane
will see us and fire at us.

95
00:11:14,267 --> 00:11:16,067
The situation is critical.

96
00:11:16,067 --> 00:11:17,633
I am sure this is an invasion

97
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:19,200
of the whole of Gaza.

98
00:11:19,267 --> 00:11:21,067
This is a small
example of our daily life

99
00:11:21,133 --> 00:11:23,067
We have no idea of what is going on.

100
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:26,267
I think this is a complete invasion
of the whole Gaza Strip.

101
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,067
Go! Go!

102
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:41,667
Get him out of here!

103
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:56,667
Come on! Come this way!

104
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:03,267
It's near here! I'ts near here!

105
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,067
Film it, film it!

106
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,667
It's here!

107
00:12:26,533 --> 00:12:28,267
We are in the buffer zone,

108
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,533
near the border.

109
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
The Israeli army began bombing.

110
00:12:31,633 --> 00:12:33,667
The children are
now in terror and fear.

111
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,733
We live in the buffer zone

112
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:37,733
and here the
situation is very difficult.

113
00:12:39,267 --> 00:12:41,433
The war has been resurrected,

114
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:43,600
and the situation is critical.

115
00:12:44,267 --> 00:12:46,133
There is no food or drink,

116
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,067
no flour or even
milk for the children.

117
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:50,000
They are terrified,

118
00:12:50,067 --> 00:12:51,733
what can we say more than this?

119
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,200
Planes have hit many positions.

120
00:12:56,267 --> 00:12:58,000
What can we say?

121
00:13:47,533 --> 00:13:49,200
Here are the carpets from the mosque,

122
00:13:49,267 --> 00:13:50,733
let´s try to find Abu Jamal.

123
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:52,733
Have you found him?

124
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,267
No, he hasn't appeared.

125
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,000
Here are the carpets,

126
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:58,600
let´s try to find him.

127
00:14:04,267 --> 00:14:07,133
Be careful,
don´t come near this part.

128
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:12,367
Please, get out from there.

129
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,067
Don't go under the building.

130
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:16,000
Please, one or two
people should be there,

131
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:17,267
not all of you.

132
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,200
Quickly, quickly!

133
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:26,267
Only one or two.

134
00:14:37,267 --> 00:14:39,000
Abu Jamal!

135
00:14:40,267 --> 00:14:42,000
His cellphone is ringing!

136
00:14:43,267 --> 00:14:45,067
His cellphone is ringing!

137
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:46,400
Listen, listen!

138
00:14:48,267 --> 00:14:49,800
His phone is here.

139
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,333
The sound is here, here!

140
00:14:56,267 --> 00:14:58,133
Listen, listen, please!

141
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,667
Don´t speak, listen!

142
00:15:05,533 --> 00:15:07,600
There are gas bottles over there.

143
00:15:13,267 --> 00:15:15,033
Brothers,
please, don't make me

144
00:15:15,067 --> 00:15:17,200
have to give an order
and get all of you out!

145
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,333
May Allah burn
Israel and all the Jews

146
00:16:47,367 --> 00:16:49,600
in the fire of hell!

147
00:16:51,533 --> 00:16:53,000
Do you see the blood of the martyrs?

148
00:16:53,067 --> 00:16:54,400
Do you see our blood?

149
00:16:55,267 --> 00:16:56,400
How many casualties?

150
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:57,533
At least ten.

151
00:16:57,733 --> 00:16:59,267
All around!

152
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:01,333
Everywhere!

153
00:17:05,267 --> 00:17:07,200
May Allah curse the Jews

154
00:17:07,267 --> 00:17:09,333
and those who
established their state.

155
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,133
Britain and America,

156
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,733
and the Arab world
that is just watching.

157
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,600
They should be hit with an old shoe

158
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:16,067
like Bush was in Iraq.

159
00:17:17,267 --> 00:17:19,000
They deserve it, the Jews, the dogs!

160
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,733
Move!  Get out of here!

161
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,333
There are planes in the air!

162
00:20:52,267 --> 00:20:55,400
Tell him to be ready and
focus the camera on the gate.

163
00:20:56,267 --> 00:20:58,533
Be ready to be at the
gate when they come in.

164
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,133
Bring the stretchers!

165
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,667
Run, run! For the sake of Allah!

166
00:22:52,267 --> 00:22:54,267
May Allah bring you another daughter!

167
00:22:56,267 --> 00:22:58,267
It's God's will,
she will be in heaven.

168
00:23:10,267 --> 00:23:12,267
God is our only
saviour and protector.

169
00:23:27,267 --> 00:23:28,733
You can film more.

170
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:44,267
He's just a child.

171
00:23:45,267 --> 00:23:46,600
He is only eleven years old.

172
00:24:13,267 --> 00:24:15,267
What is his name? Saeid?

173
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,000
No, no, Ismael.

174
00:24:17,267 --> 00:24:18,400
Ismael Hamdan.

175
00:24:19,533 --> 00:24:20,733
You can film more here.

176
00:24:24,267 --> 00:24:26,267
You can come.

177
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,067
There is nothing more we can do.

178
00:24:42,267 --> 00:24:44,200
She's dead.

179
00:24:50,267 --> 00:24:51,667
She's dead.

180
00:25:00,267 --> 00:25:01,400
Bring me the nasal tube.

181
00:25:05,467 --> 00:25:07,267
Insert the nasal tube
and clean her nose

182
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:30,267
Is there any pulse?

183
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:38,000
May Allah surround
her soul with mercy.

184
00:26:09,133 --> 00:26:11,133
Bring me the tape to write her name.

185
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,067
That's all. It's over.

186
00:26:13,133 --> 00:26:14,667
Cover her.

187
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,300
These two girls were just

188
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:31,600
to take the rubbish
out from their house

189
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,300
and the plane bombed,

190
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:36,200
them and their brother

191
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,267
The sticky tape.

192
00:26:47,067 --> 00:26:48,467
What is her name?

193
00:26:48,467 --> 00:26:50,000
Something Hamdan.

194
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:04,267
The other one is
Haya and this is Lama.

195
00:27:10,267 --> 00:27:12,267
A pen? A pen?

196
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,267
Here.

197
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,633
Lama what?

198
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:18,200
Lama Talal Hamdan.

199
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:20,733
A pepper?  I'm doing a interview!

200
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,333
You cannot have white beans

201
00:41:49,367 --> 00:41:51,267
without green chilli peppers.

202
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,667
This one's dirty, pass me another one.

203
00:42:30,467 --> 00:42:31,667
Thanks.

204
00:42:45,133 --> 00:42:48,133
I like peppers a lot.

205
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,267
Don't get pepper in your eyes...

206
00:42:57,467 --> 00:42:59,267
The pepper,
don't get it in your eyes.

207
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,600
OK, thanks.

208
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,267
There is a ten metre
deep hole from an F-16.

209
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,300
We cannot take patients,

210
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:56,533
they're bombing all over,

211
00:44:56,567 --> 00:44:58,367
we can't,

212
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,233
we cannot even reach the injured.

213
00:45:01,267 --> 00:45:03,267
The Jews can't defeat the resistance,

214
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,267
so they take revenge on the civilians.

215
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:19,067
In Jabalia they are
attacking heavily, very heavily.

216
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:20,733
What we know for sure is that

217
00:45:20,733 --> 00:45:22,567
they are attacking with tanks.

218
00:45:22,567 --> 00:45:24,567
They are attacking simultaneously

219
00:45:24,567 --> 00:45:26,567
from the sea, with
helicopters, with F-16's.

220
00:45:26,567 --> 00:45:28,567
And the confirmed news is

221
00:45:28,567 --> 00:45:30,567
that they are also using tanks.

222
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,467
It's like lighting it all up

223
00:45:46,067 --> 00:45:47,600
so they can see everything.

224
00:45:47,633 --> 00:45:49,333
What are you saying?
That it's for lighting up?

225
00:45:49,367 --> 00:45:50,700
Don´t talk nonsense!

226
00:45:50,733 --> 00:45:53,333
A light comes down
slowly on a parachute.

227
00:45:53,367 --> 00:45:55,300
and it burns.

228
00:45:55,333 --> 00:45:57,667
It is something that burns.

229
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,233
Sorry, let's continue.

230
00:47:10,267 --> 00:47:11,733
In December no food entered. Full stop.

231
00:47:15,533 --> 00:47:17,200
What is the meaning of giving bread

232
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:19,133
to those who've just been

233
00:47:19,167 --> 00:47:21,000
freshly baked in a cemetery

234
00:47:21,533 --> 00:47:23,233
question mark.

235
00:47:23,267 --> 00:47:25,233
the urgency lies in
stopping the bombs,

236
00:47:25,267 --> 00:47:27,667
even before replacing supplies

237
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:28,667
full stop.

238
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,600
Dead bodies can't eat...

239
00:47:31,333 --> 00:47:32,733
comma,

240
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,067
they just fertilize the land

241
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,167
comma,

242
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,500
that here in Gaza,

243
00:47:37,533 --> 00:47:38,533
has never been so fertile,

244
00:47:38,567 --> 00:47:39,533
full stop.

245
00:47:41,267 --> 00:47:42,600
Children's corpses...

246
00:47:44,667 --> 00:47:45,767
...in the morgue of the hospital

247
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,800
should feed the
feelings of guiltiness...

248
00:47:52,267 --> 00:47:57,200
...of those who could
do something, comma,

249
00:47:57,233 --> 00:47:59,167
but they are on holiday in Hawaii,

250
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,200
having fun with friends, full stop.

251
00:48:02,533 --> 00:48:04,733
The image of a smiling Obama

252
00:48:04,767 --> 00:48:06,433
playing golf,

253
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:08,100
has been broadcast

254
00:48:08,133 --> 00:48:10,533
on all the Arab satellite channels

255
00:48:10,567 --> 00:48:11,500
comma,

256
00:48:11,533 --> 00:48:12,600
but don't worry,

257
00:48:12,733 --> 00:48:13,700
comma,

258
00:48:13,733 --> 00:48:16,100
nobody here believed

259
00:48:16,133 --> 00:48:21,000
that a president´s skin colour...

260
00:48:25,067 --> 00:48:26,767
...would radically change

261
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,400
US foreign policy,

262
00:48:28,433 --> 00:48:29,533
full stop.

263
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,300
Yesterday, Israel
opened the Eretz crossing

264
00:48:32,333 --> 00:48:36,200
to evacuate all
foreign nationals from Gaza,

265
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:37,267
comma,

266
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:38,167
We,

267
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,067
comma,

268
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,600
internationals of the ISM,

269
00:48:40,633 --> 00:48:41,633
comma,

270
00:48:41,667 --> 00:48:43,200
are the only ones remaining,

271
00:48:43,233 --> 00:48:44,200
full stop.

272
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,333
My back is killing me...

273
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,067
Isn't there a proper pan?
Is this a pan for boiling?

274
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,000
This is for coffee.

275
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,367
When it is crowded here

276
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,000
we have to use it to make coffee.

277
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,400
Resistance,
resistance...

278
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,233
How many spoons will you add?

279
00:49:37,267 --> 00:49:39,267
Listen, this needs at
least 10 more spoonfuls.

280
00:49:41,467 --> 00:49:42,667
I will put three.

281
00:49:43,067 --> 00:49:45,067
Three?  What's wrong with you?

282
00:49:48,533 --> 00:49:50,133
In the small pan,
we do it with three spoons.

283
00:49:50,333 --> 00:49:52,067
Add another two, add much more.

284
00:49:55,333 --> 00:49:56,700
OK, I put four and a half.

285
00:49:56,733 --> 00:49:58,533
Come on, put more,
I don´t want weak coffee.

286
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:05,267
The smell is great.

287
00:51:05,267 --> 00:51:07,233
They are shelling randomly.

288
00:51:07,267 --> 00:51:09,000
It sounds like
it's getting really close.

289
00:51:14,133 --> 00:51:15,667
We are evaluating the situation.

290
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,267
Do you think that they can see us?

291
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,067
They are shelling homes in
the west of Ezbet Abd Rabbo.

292
00:51:32,533 --> 00:51:34,733
If you want to come,
come, but be careful.

293
00:51:34,767 --> 00:51:37,133
Take a good look
when you reach Jabalia.

294
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,100
It is OK, come.

295
00:51:45,133 --> 00:51:47,600
I wish you luck.

296
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,800
Can you hear?

297
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,000
It is all around us.

298
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,667
May Allah end it well.

299
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,500
We can't go out.

300
00:52:07,533 --> 00:52:09,333
They are bombing out there.

301
00:52:14,067 --> 00:52:15,467
I don't even have an
ambulance here right now.

302
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,400
If we had one we would escape.

303
00:52:22,667 --> 00:52:26,267
We don't have ambulances,
the centre is surrounded.

304
00:52:28,067 --> 00:52:29,667
The bombs are falling all around.

305
00:52:32,533 --> 00:52:33,800
OK, I will see. My regards, bye.

306
00:53:00,267 --> 00:53:01,433
Vik is not here.

307
00:53:01,467 --> 00:53:03,733
I think he left with
one of the ambulances.

308
00:53:16,133 --> 00:53:17,367
Did you forget anything?

309
00:53:17,467 --> 00:53:18,600
Cellphones or anything?

310
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:27,067
Should we bring all the equipment?

311
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:33,600
Did you check the power switches?

312
00:53:33,633 --> 00:53:35,600
The phone that I gave you?

313
00:53:35,633 --> 00:53:37,600
Yes, it's here.

314
00:53:52,667 --> 00:53:55,733
The whole area,
Abu Rame's house is on fire,

315
00:53:55,767 --> 00:53:58,733
the whole area, listen to me...

316
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:08,400
OK, we will see,
May Allah end it well.

317
00:56:34,067 --> 00:56:37,033
The situation is all ablaze.

318
00:56:37,067 --> 00:56:41,067
They hit four of our
ambulances with F-16's.

319
00:56:51,267 --> 00:56:53,633
When the resistance shoots a bullet

320
00:56:53,667 --> 00:56:56,667
they answer with one million missiles.

321
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:04,267
A three year old boy

322
00:57:04,667 --> 00:57:07,667
was killed in the last attack.

323
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:14,200
>From the Al Kourd family.

324
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:22,600
There are no injuries,
only martyrs in Al Attatra

325
00:57:22,633 --> 00:57:26,200
but they won't allow
us to reach that far.

326
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:29,400
We went three times with coordination,

327
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:32,167
and they shot at us.

328
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,200
The first time with a tank
the second time with an F-16,

329
00:57:35,233 --> 00:57:37,633
then again with a tank

330
00:57:37,667 --> 00:57:40,000
so we could not bring them out.

331
00:57:40,033 --> 00:57:42,133
I will be at home in half an hour

332
00:57:42,133 --> 00:57:44,167
if it is Allah's will.

333
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,600
It's not known if
there are more martyrs.

334
00:57:51,533 --> 00:57:55,267
Maximum one hour and I will be home.

335
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:58,267
Do you want me to
bring something home?

336
00:58:20,667 --> 00:58:25,267
I am trying to call him
but he is not answering.

337
00:58:37,267 --> 00:58:42,067
I am calling the hospital,
but no one is answering.

338
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:44,467
The communications have been cut.

339
00:58:45,067 --> 00:58:47,467
Please,
don't film this!

340
00:58:53,667 --> 00:58:56,667
Guys, there are surveillance planes!

341
00:59:04,133 --> 00:59:05,800
Hi? Listen!

342
00:59:06,533 --> 00:59:08,533
A bomb has just fallen

343
00:59:08,567 --> 00:59:10,067
on the Al Awda hospital.

344
00:59:11,133 --> 00:59:15,133
There was a Jeep and they bombed it.

345
00:59:15,133 --> 00:59:16,733
A bomb came down

346
00:59:16,733 --> 00:59:17,733
in the courtyard of the hospital.

347
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,233
Around ten metres
away from where we are,

348
00:59:23,167 --> 00:59:25,567
there are injuries.
No, no, I'm OK.

349
00:59:27,133 --> 00:59:27,767
Fuck! Sorry, sorry, bye.

350
00:59:34,267 --> 00:59:36,533
The guys are over there.

351
01:00:00,467 --> 01:00:02,467
Stand up, Jamal.

352
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:07,533
Shrapnel has hit his face,
let´s take him to this corner.

353
01:00:11,333 --> 01:00:13,333
Stay where you are!

354
01:00:15,333 --> 01:00:17,733
Where are you going?

355
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:22,533
Move them like that,
move them over to there,

356
01:00:22,567 --> 01:00:25,533
there may be flying shrapnel hitting.

357
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:31,467
Hi? Who am I talking to, please?

358
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,333
Listen to me: two bombs
have just hit the hospital.

359
01:00:39,567 --> 01:00:41,467
I have it live on film

360
01:00:41,467 --> 01:00:43,167
now they are
getting rid of the oxygen

361
01:00:42,167 --> 01:00:43,667
because it could explode.

362
01:00:44,533 --> 01:00:46,467
They're directly attacking a hospital,

363
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,467
do you understand? I've recorded it,

364
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:50,600
some of the paramedics are injured.

365
01:00:54,633 --> 01:00:57,167
No, but shit!
I don't know what to say,

366
01:00:58,667 --> 01:01:00,067
but please report this, please.

367
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:04,333
Hospital Al Awda, a-l-a-w-d-a!

368
01:01:04,333 --> 01:01:06,167
In Jabalia refugee camp.

369
01:01:07,567 --> 01:01:09,600
Two missiles have just come down

370
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,200
in the courtyard of the hospital.

371
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,600
Abu Jahy, get out of
the square! Get over here!

372
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,400
They have launched two rockets there.

373
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
In Al Awda?

374
01:02:01,667 --> 01:02:04,267
Did they hit Al Awda?

375
01:02:05,467 --> 01:02:08,467
Yes, the Palestinian authority Jeep.

376
01:02:10,533 --> 01:02:12,533
But it's a hospital!

377
01:02:12,567 --> 01:02:14,533
Fuck them!
They have no honour.

378
01:02:14,567 --> 01:02:16,767
Two rockets. three injured.

379
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:19,133
Hi Youssef, where are you?

380
01:02:26,133 --> 01:02:28,333
I am at the hospital.

381
01:02:37,533 --> 01:02:40,133
These cellphones...
Who do they belong to?

382
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:44,200
Yes, we are at the hospital
We can´t get in or out

383
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:47,800
and we are waiting
for them to hit again.

384
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,800
They meant to target the hospital.

385
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,467
But they hit the Jeep.

386
01:02:59,467 --> 01:03:03,067
They can justify it by
saying it was a military vehicle.

387
01:03:03,667 --> 01:03:06,267
They can strike if a rocket

388
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:08,233
was launched from here.

389
01:03:08,267 --> 01:03:10,267
But they can't strike
without justification.

390
01:03:11,667 --> 01:03:13,667
What is that building close to here?

391
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:15,633
It is the medicine warehouse.

392
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:18,667
Maybe somebody will go
there to get the medicine?

393
01:03:19,667 --> 01:03:22,667
If someone does he'll
be walking to his death.

394
01:03:25,133 --> 01:03:28,100
Will you keep on going?

395
01:03:28,133 --> 01:03:31,600
Yes, but every time.
I go out I lose two kilos.

396
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,600
I know I will be killed.

397
01:03:42,667 --> 01:03:45,200
I swear to God, I swear to God...

398
01:04:03,533 --> 01:04:05,533
What can we do?

399
01:04:05,567 --> 01:04:07,100
Nothing.

400
01:04:07,133 --> 01:04:10,133
I think it's what, one
hundred and fifty metres from here?

401
01:04:10,533 --> 01:04:11,600
Less.

402
01:04:26,567 --> 01:04:28,600
So what did your wife say?

403
01:04:28,433 --> 01:04:31,667
She said: "I know you'll get killed".

404
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,333
Last night we were
talking about Arafa,

405
01:04:48,367 --> 01:04:50,367
who was killed yesterday.

406
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,433
She knows I am going to be killed.

407
01:04:53,467 --> 01:04:54,467
She says she is
prepared for my death.

408
01:05:00,067 --> 01:05:03,033
And my kids, I only see
them for 5 or 10 minutes,

409
01:05:03,067 --> 01:05:06,467
and the hour I went home
yesterday they were sleeping.

410
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:08,733
I couldn't see if they need anything.

411
01:05:08,767 --> 01:05:10,633
They have no food or gas,

412
01:05:10,667 --> 01:05:12,533
the water will run out soon.

413
01:05:12,567 --> 01:05:14,600
They only have Allah.

414
01:05:15,133 --> 01:05:17,200
They've already got used

415
01:05:17,233 --> 01:05:19,267
to the idea of my death,

416
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:21,700
even my children.

417
01:05:21,733 --> 01:05:24,233
When I go home,

418
01:05:24,267 --> 01:05:26,267
they refuse to leave me.

419
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:28,267
They tell me: "don't go out daddy",

420
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:30,667
as all children do.

421
01:05:31,667 --> 01:05:35,233
They understand the situation.

422
01:05:35,267 --> 01:05:37,667
The children talk
about my friend who died,

423
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,433
they say: "Poor man".

424
01:05:39,467 --> 01:05:42,467
And I explain to them
that all of us will die.

425
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:48,200
The problem is that no one cares.

426
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:50,800
The Jews think
that extensive shelling

427
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,800
and attacking us like this

428
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,600
will bring the people down.

429
01:05:54,667 --> 01:05:57,233
On the contrary,
it only encourages people.

430
01:05:57,267 --> 01:05:59,467
We would say:
"I am dead anyway, why die in vane"?

431
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,100
"I will launch a rocket

432
01:06:01,133 --> 01:06:02,667
blow myself up against them

433
01:06:02,667 --> 01:06:04,300
instead of dying in my home".

434
01:06:04,333 --> 01:06:06,600
It is better to die fighting them.

435
01:06:06,633 --> 01:06:09,067
So people are getting more mobilised.

436
01:07:03,467 --> 01:07:06,533
Sir, why are you
recording us on tape?

437
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:40,133
Why are you filming, sir?

438
01:09:24,067 --> 01:09:26,067
We need two more ambulances.

439
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:28,067
I will get two more.

440
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:40,400
Who belongs to the third crew?

441
01:09:40,433 --> 01:09:42,600
Who is there with you?

442
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,567
Where is he?

443
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,100
He's sleeping, write down his name.

444
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:59,667
Do you remember your
vehicle's plate number?

445
01:10:07,133 --> 01:10:10,600
Write it: Fayez al Ajramy.
And the medic, Mohammad Salah.

446
01:10:13,133 --> 01:10:15,567
Do you have their ID numbers?

447
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,600
I'll give you the
number of their ambulance.

448
01:10:25,267 --> 01:10:32,267
6-6915-90

449
01:10:40,467 --> 01:10:44,067
Do you want a fourth
crew or is that enough?

450
01:10:44,533 --> 01:10:46,400
A fourth crew.

451
01:10:46,667 --> 01:10:48,467
Naim, you will drive.

452
01:10:49,133 --> 01:10:52,133
Naim Rajab Khalil.

453
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,467
Where are we going while
all this shooting is going on?

454
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:59,000
Do you want to go, Youssef?

455
01:11:00,133 --> 01:11:02,467
Youssef Abd El Hameid.

456
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:06,133
The boss, he's the boss!

457
01:11:07,067 --> 01:11:10,067
Give me the number of the ambulance.

458
01:10:47,633 --> 01:10:52,500
3-99...31.

459
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:21,800
Bye, goodbye.

460
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,800
Go in peace.

461
01:11:53,333 --> 01:11:57,800
Naim, let´s go!  Naim!
Stay behind each other!

462
01:12:14,067 --> 01:12:19,667
Abed, you have my phone number, bye!

463
01:12:23,333 --> 01:12:25,333
Forgive us!

464
01:12:27,267 --> 01:12:30,267
Tell Al Ajrami to turn his siren on!

465
01:13:59,333 --> 01:14:02,800
There is a martyr
near the traffic lights!

466
01:14:03,333 --> 01:14:06,200
Where can the ambulances get to?

467
01:14:07,467 --> 01:14:10,200
He's there, lying on the ground!

468
01:14:12,333 --> 01:14:16,333
We want to rescue the
corpse but they shoot at us!

469
01:14:16,733 --> 01:14:19,333
So we cannot reach it.

470
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:22,600
We managed to drag
the body to the roundabout.

471
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,400
He's dead.
We dragged him and they shot at us.

472
01:14:27,733 --> 01:14:31,733
There, there, they're over there!

473
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Go back both of you, get back!

474
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:51,200
They will shoot at us! Get back!

475
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:54,200
Go and get yourselves killed!

476
01:15:30,667 --> 01:15:33,667
Don´t leave the vehicle! Stay inside!

477
01:15:35,267 --> 01:15:37,267
Keep your camera inside!

478
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:41,133
Bastards!

479
01:17:29,467 --> 01:17:32,267
It is only a bullet. Only a bullet.

480
01:17:32,467 --> 01:17:35,067
I have a bullet in my leg.

481
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:40,200
Do you want to lay on the stretcher?

482
01:17:40,233 --> 01:17:42,200
Relax, relax.

483
01:18:32,267 --> 01:18:34,267
I'm fine Youseff, I'm fine.

484
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:36,267
It's nothing.

485
01:18:43,067 --> 01:18:45,533
Don't worry man, it's OK.

486
01:19:43,533 --> 01:19:46,133
We were carrying the body.

487
01:19:46,167 --> 01:19:48,500
When they opened fire on us.

488
01:19:48,533 --> 01:19:51,133
So we left the body
behind with the stretcher.

489
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:01,133
Is your other leg OK?

490
01:20:01,167 --> 01:20:02,600
Yes, it's OK.

491
01:20:15,467 --> 01:20:18,467
Call Dr. Bashar and
tell him it's a minor injury.

492
01:20:19,067 --> 01:20:21,067
Go to Al Awda Hospital.

493
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:23,067
Is your head OK?

494
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:24,500
Yes.

495
01:20:24,533 --> 01:20:28,067
Don't worry Abu Ali, it's OK.

496
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:30,067
Dear Abu Ali!

497
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,467
Hi, how are you?
What happened?

498
01:21:24,667 --> 01:21:26,800
It's OK, thanks to God.

499
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:29,133
We went to rescue a martyr

500
01:21:29,167 --> 01:21:31,000
near Zimmo, and they shot at us.

501
01:21:31,033 --> 01:21:32,667
Were you outside the vehicle?

502
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:34,267
Yes, with my colleague.

503
01:24:29,733 --> 01:24:31,400
Where is the sniper?

504
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:33,767
Take care.

505
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:36,400
He's over there in one of the houses.

506
01:24:36,433 --> 01:24:37,800
They opened fire on us

507
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,367
and last night

508
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:41,467
they completely destroyed us.

509
01:24:42,067 --> 01:24:44,067
Where do you live exactly?

510
01:24:44,333 --> 01:24:46,333
Behind the mosque,

511
01:24:46,367 --> 01:24:48,333
they destroyed the house,

512
01:24:48,367 --> 01:24:50,233
so now we are leaving,

513
01:24:50,267 --> 01:24:52,067
we are evacuating to a UN school.

514
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:53,633
There is nothing left,

515
01:24:53,667 --> 01:24:55,400
we can't even find a sack of flour

516
01:24:55,433 --> 01:24:57,200
or anything.

517
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:00,400
Were you here yesterday
when they shelled with phosphorus?

518
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,400
Yes, with phosphorus.

519
01:25:02,667 --> 01:25:04,633
There is a house there

520
01:25:04,667 --> 01:25:06,667
which we can't reach

521
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:08,667
because of the snipers.

522
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,800
We cannot take you there.

523
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
There are unexploded
shells inside the houses.

524
01:25:14,267 --> 01:25:16,267
Can you describe
to me the phosphorus?

525
01:25:16,667 --> 01:25:18,633
This thing burns the clothes

526
01:25:18,667 --> 01:25:21,267
of every human being.

527
01:25:21,267 --> 01:25:23,667
When you try to get rid of it,

528
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:25,267
you can't.

529
01:25:25,667 --> 01:25:28,267
If you breathe it, you will faint.

530
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:32,567
So, how can you get rid of it?

531
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:34,600
No, you can't get it off you,

532
01:25:34,633 --> 01:25:36,600
you have to put
sand over your clothes.

533
01:25:36,633 --> 01:25:38,600
and we don't even have

534
01:25:38,633 --> 01:25:40,600
water in our houses...

535
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:43,800
I am leaving, peace be upon you.

536
01:25:55,133 --> 01:25:57,533
How many people are leaving?

537
01:25:58,467 --> 01:26:00,467
Our whole neighbourhood is leaving!

538
01:26:01,267 --> 01:26:03,267
How far did the army reach?

539
01:26:04,133 --> 01:26:06,400
Netzarim and around.

540
01:26:06,667 --> 01:26:08,667
There are only 300
metres between us and them.

541
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,600
Are there snipers?

542
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:14,600
It's all tanks and snipers.

543
01:26:14,633 --> 01:26:16,167
Special forces and planes,

544
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:17,600
even the mosque was hit.

545
01:26:17,733 --> 01:26:19,733
Everyday it is like this.

546
01:26:20,267 --> 01:26:22,667
We take our children out

547
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:25,267
when they say there
is a truce for eating.

548
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:27,667
We are staying at
other family's houses,

549
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:29,667
we don't know what to do.

550
01:26:30,267 --> 01:26:32,267
Allah is our only saviour.

551
01:26:33,333 --> 01:26:35,600
When we find a car, we'll leave.

552
01:26:37,467 --> 01:26:40,067
In the house we are staying

553
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:42,633
there are 50 people

554
01:26:42,667 --> 01:26:44,667
and it's 100 square metres or less.

555
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:46,167
We can't sleep

556
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:47,667
because of the
bombing and the planes

557
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:49,167
they fall on top of us.

558
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:51,200
Our houses are full of holes.

559
01:26:51,533 --> 01:26:53,300
Do you see the mosque?

560
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:55,067
Our houses are like that.

561
01:27:00,333 --> 01:27:02,733
Madam, I don't know what to say.

562
01:27:04,467 --> 01:27:06,433
Only Allah can protect us.

563
01:27:06,467 --> 01:27:09,067
He's the only one taking care of us.

564
01:27:09,067 --> 01:27:11,467
At any moment we could be killed.

565
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:13,433
We are waiting to die.

566
01:27:13,467 --> 01:27:15,433
When we walk, eat or drink,

567
01:27:15,467 --> 01:27:18,000
we are waiting for death.

568
01:27:18,033 --> 01:27:20,233
We don't want
anything else from this life.

569
01:27:20,267 --> 01:27:22,467
Only to die and rest in peace.

570
01:28:05,067 --> 01:28:07,533
Could you speak one at the time?

571
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:12,600
So this is this phosphorus thing?

572
01:28:12,633 --> 01:28:14,167
Yes, Yes.

573
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:16,600
When you move it,
it sets on fire again.

574
01:28:16,633 --> 01:28:19,167
It'll ignite if we move it?

575
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:21,600
Get back to make
space for the cameraman!

576
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:26,200
See the writing, see the writing.

577
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:30,600
This is illegal according to
international regulations.

578
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:35,200
Phosphorous, can you see?

579
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:37,733
Don't touch it with your hands,

580
01:28:37,767 --> 01:28:39,533
it will burn you.

581
01:28:44,133 --> 01:28:47,133
Where did this hit?

582
01:28:48,133 --> 01:28:50,133
Here, in this house.

583
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:58,000
These are burnt parts from the house.

584
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:03,400
Could you please put it
in the back of the car?

585
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:19,200
Can you see the
ceiling of the house?

586
01:29:25,667 --> 01:29:28,667
So this is the
missile that hit the roof.

587
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:17,200
How many days has it been like this?

588
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:18,400
Three days now.

589
01:30:41,533 --> 01:30:43,533
Pour some water, please.

590
01:30:47,733 --> 01:30:49,333
Pour a little bit more water.

591
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:57,200
You see, do it again.

592
01:31:22,667 --> 01:31:25,267
Thank you so much
may Allah reward you.

593
01:31:25,667 --> 01:31:27,667
Pardon me, but there's
no gas to make you any food.

594
01:31:28,267 --> 01:31:29,267
Thank you very much, really.

595
01:31:30,267 --> 01:31:32,267
We haven't had water
for almost 14 days now.

596
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:39,667
Wash your hands two or three times.

597
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:41,667
These are very toxic materials.

598
01:33:14,667 --> 01:33:17,667
Slaughterhouse, an Israeli butchery.

599
01:33:32,533 --> 01:33:35,533
How much blood does Israel need

600
01:33:38,067 --> 01:33:40,667
to stop this?

601
01:34:03,267 --> 01:34:05,067
You are good at
nothing but making tapes.

602
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:06,333
Act for us!

603
01:34:09,067 --> 01:34:10,800
Are you escaping
from the occupying forces?

604
01:34:11,067 --> 01:34:12,400
The occupation has destroyed us!

605
01:34:12,433 --> 01:34:13,733
We are escaping from our houses.

606
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:18,033
They destroy us with shells, missiles

607
01:34:18,067 --> 01:34:19,467
and planes, they are killing us.

608
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:21,733
Have mercy on us, you foreigners!

609
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:35,200
Have you had to leave your homes?

610
01:34:35,233 --> 01:34:36,500
We already left.

611
01:34:36,533 --> 01:34:37,800
We have taken refuge in a school.

612
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,167
We are going back home

613
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:40,533
to take a shower and
to change our clothes.

614
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:44,267
Can we follow you?

615
01:34:44,300 --> 01:34:45,267
Of course.

616
01:34:51,467 --> 01:34:54,167
Were there any injured?

617
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:55,267
Here a boy was killed.

618
01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:01,800
His name was Adam Maamoun Al Kourd.

619
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:04,200
How old was he?

620
01:35:04,333 --> 01:35:05,467
He was three years old.

621
01:35:12,133 --> 01:35:13,667
This was my brother's house,

622
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,400
two floors with four flats.

623
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,667
And this one is my house.

624
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:59,200
These are some of the
remains from the other house.

625
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:03,200
Welcome.

626
01:36:11,133 --> 01:36:14,000
Are there any old people at the
school who lived the first Nakba?

627
01:36:14,033 --> 01:36:15,400
Yes, many.

628
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:20,333
What do they think about being forced
to evacuate for the second time?

629
01:36:20,367 --> 01:36:21,533
Does it bring back memories?

630
01:36:21,567 --> 01:36:22,667
Yes, for sure.

631
01:36:25,533 --> 01:36:27,367
At the school we speak about it.

632
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:29,367
They used to tell us about it
and now we are living it.

633
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:31,333
But this Nakba is much
harder than the first one.

634
01:36:33,133 --> 01:36:37,067
In the first Nakba they were
not destroying the people this way.

635
01:36:37,133 --> 01:36:38,733
Now shells are
falling on people's heads.

636
01:37:42,733 --> 01:37:44,733
May Allah provide you with patience.

637
01:37:46,067 --> 01:37:48,467
I don't really know
what more I can say.

638
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:49,767
May Allah give you health

639
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:51,267
to see her grow to become a bride.

640
01:39:54,667 --> 01:39:57,100
Sir, I understand, listen to me.

641
01:39:58,500 --> 01:40:00,733
She understands me too.

642
01:40:02,733 --> 01:40:04,733
They are doing their best,

643
01:40:04,767 --> 01:40:05,767
telling the world what is going on...

644
01:40:07,100 --> 01:40:10,067
That people were sheltering...

645
01:40:25,700 --> 01:40:27,500
Allah is the greatest.

646
01:40:35,367 --> 01:40:39,033
He who thanks Allah will be rewarded.

647
01:40:39,067 --> 01:40:40,600
Oh Allah, loosen your power

648
01:40:41,700 --> 01:40:43,600
and strength on the Jews.

649
01:40:44,267 --> 01:40:45,467
Amen.

650
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:49,367
Please Allah,

651
01:40:49,700 --> 01:40:51,300
kill them all...

652
01:40:51,333 --> 01:40:52,500
And don't leave any of them alive.

653
01:40:52,533 --> 01:40:53,667
Amen.

654
01:40:56,033 --> 01:40:58,167
Oh Allah, with your great power.

655
01:40:58,200 --> 01:40:59,167
Allah!

656
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,567
We are asking you with
your infinite power, dear Allah.

657
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:03,533
Allah!

658
01:41:03,567 --> 01:41:04,700
Please dear Allah,

659
01:41:04,733 --> 01:41:06,733
take revenge
for our martyrs blood.

660
01:41:06,767 --> 01:41:07,733
Allah!

661
01:41:09,233 --> 01:41:11,600
Please Allah, get rid of the Jews.

662
01:41:11,633 --> 01:41:13,133
Bring them down.

663
01:41:13,167 --> 01:41:15,433
They are not as powerful as you.

664
01:41:18,267 --> 01:41:20,067
Please Allah, make the earth shake

665
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:22,100
and destroy the
pillars of their civilization.

666
01:41:22,133 --> 01:41:23,500
Please Allah,

667
01:41:23,533 --> 01:41:25,533
cast fear and
terror into their hearts.

668
01:41:25,700 --> 01:41:27,267
Oh Allah, disperse them

669
01:41:27,300 --> 01:41:29,533
so they become lost once again.

670
01:41:32,233 --> 01:41:35,267
Oh Allah, show us a sign.

671
01:41:37,733 --> 01:41:42,067
Oh Allah, surprise them
in a way they don't expect.

672
01:41:43,333 --> 01:41:46,467
Oh Allah, cast fear and
terror into their hearts.

673
01:41:46,567 --> 01:41:47,733
Oh Allah.

674
01:43:52,300 --> 01:43:54,300
Bring the flags, not the poles.

675
01:44:42,333 --> 01:44:43,300
No stay here.

676
01:44:44,767 --> 01:44:46,767
The snipers are operating in a square,

677
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:48,767
one where they can see clearly.

678
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:50,200
No, don´t film me.

679
01:45:00,667 --> 01:45:02,100
Go, straight on.

680
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:08,100
Is that a tank in that hole over there?

681
01:45:08,133 --> 01:45:10,000
Are we going to stop to film a tank?

682
01:45:10,033 --> 01:45:11,433
Are you crazy?

683
01:45:13,200 --> 01:45:15,000
Turn off near that street,

684
01:45:15,767 --> 01:45:17,767
the Islamic University is there.

685
01:45:20,667 --> 01:45:23,000
Keep going and don't stop at all.

686
01:45:23,033 --> 01:45:25,167
We don't want to see
if there's a tank or not.

687
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:27,367
The tank will
directly target us and kill us.

688
01:45:29,333 --> 01:45:32,533
They don't wait.

689
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:49,433
Keep going straight on, go, go!

690
01:45:49,667 --> 01:45:51,600
Can you see that bulldozer there?

691
01:45:51,633 --> 01:45:53,100
The one from the UN.

692
01:46:51,367 --> 01:46:53,067
The wood is going to burn!

693
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:54,600
The warehouse is full!

694
01:46:58,667 --> 01:47:00,100
Is there anyone inside?

695
01:47:00,133 --> 01:47:01,100
We don't know...

696
01:47:01,533 --> 01:47:04,300
They started to shoot
from planes and from the sea.

697
01:47:06,100 --> 01:47:08,100
These are phosphorous bombs.

698
01:47:08,700 --> 01:47:10,567
This is the warehouse.

699
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:12,600
Spare parts and medicine.

700
01:47:16,533 --> 01:47:18,500
What is burning here is

701
01:47:18,533 --> 01:47:20,533
all our medicine and flour.

702
01:47:26,467 --> 01:47:27,800
This is a huge mistake!

703
01:47:27,800 --> 01:47:29,333
An horrific mistake!

704
01:47:29,367 --> 01:47:30,667
This is a crime!

705
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:35,333
Is that flour over there?

706
01:47:35,367 --> 01:47:37,100
Yes, flour, medicine...

707
01:47:37,133 --> 01:47:38,167
Everything!

708
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:40,200
Not only flour. Also blankets!

709
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:46,433
This is the aid we received

710
01:47:46,467 --> 01:47:48,267
from the international community.

711
01:47:51,267 --> 01:47:52,667
Everything we had.
It's gone, it's finished.

712
01:47:57,400 --> 01:48:00,467
This is the central warehouse which
distributes to the whole Gaza Strip.

713
01:48:01,067 --> 01:48:02,733
>From Beit Hanoun to Rafah!

714
01:48:03,800 --> 01:48:05,400
This is the centre!

715
01:48:06,367 --> 01:48:08,800
How many people
does this warehouse feed?

716
01:48:10,667 --> 01:48:11,667
A million!

717
01:48:11,700 --> 01:48:13,100
The whole population!

718
01:51:00,267 --> 01:51:03,567
What about you?
Are you filming me? Why?
