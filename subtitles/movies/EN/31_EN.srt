1
00:01:23,066 --> 00:01:24,600
-Hello.
-Hi.

2
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:26,235
-Have you rung?
-No.

3
00:01:26,236 --> 00:01:28,070
No. Well, yes, l rang,

4
00:01:28,071 --> 00:01:30,405
but they told me to wait till
you arrived.

5
00:01:30,406 --> 00:01:33,406
-Ah, OK. Well, l'm here now.
-Right.

6
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:39,379
Well, tell me, what brings you here?

7
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:48,421
-What?
-You yawned.

8
00:01:54,264 --> 00:01:56,532
Hello?

9
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,734
Hi. No, no, no, no,
tell me,

10
00:01:58,735 --> 00:02:01,735
l'm not doing anything much.
Yes.

11
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:06,239
A BOYFRlEND FOR MY WlFE

12
00:02:07,277 --> 00:02:10,277
6 MONTHS BEFORE

13
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:57,490
Good morning.

14
00:02:57,527 --> 00:02:59,995
-Good morning.
-Hello, l just said hello, Tenso.

15
00:02:59,996 --> 00:03:02,996
OK, l didn't hear you.

16
00:03:17,347 --> 00:03:20,347
-What?
-Good God.

17
00:03:25,321 --> 00:03:27,522
-Don't smoke.
-Leave off, will you?

18
00:03:27,523 --> 00:03:30,523
-lt's still early.
-Yes, it's still early.

19
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,629
Great! l'm really off
to a shitty start today.

20
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:44,905
lsn't there one lighter in
this house that works properly?

21
00:03:47,543 --> 00:03:50,543
l don't believe it.

22
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:08,828
Do you know one of the things
l hate most in this world?

23
00:04:09,732 --> 00:04:11,733
l can't bear coincidence seekers.

24
00:04:11,734 --> 00:04:14,036
They get on my nerves.

25
00:04:14,037 --> 00:04:17,037
You know, people who are always
looking for bloody coincidences.

26
00:04:19,242 --> 00:04:20,876
Just yesterday the girl from 2B
asked me what sign l was.

27
00:04:20,877 --> 00:04:23,877
Just yesterday the girl from 2B
asked me what sign l was.

28
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,380
What sign am l? But don't you know me?
As if you cared.

29
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:31,386
Sagittarius, l said.
''Ah, when were you born?''

30
00:04:31,387 --> 00:04:34,387
Hey, l don't believe it!
19 December.

31
00:04:35,758 --> 00:04:38,758
She says: ''A friend
was born on the 11th''. So?

32
00:04:38,895 --> 00:04:41,229
l don't get it.
What the fuck do l care?

33
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:44,230
So you've got a friend who was born
two days later.

34
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:49,569
Excuse me.

35
00:04:52,308 --> 00:04:54,276
Stupid bitch. Brothers, sisters,
she says.

36
00:04:54,277 --> 00:04:56,078
Yes, l said.
Brother or sister?

37
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:58,280
Sister. l have a sister. Why?
So you or your friend have a sister?

38
00:04:58,281 --> 00:05:00,482
Some coincidence?

39
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:02,985
ls the earth about to move?
What's going to happen?

40
00:05:02,986 --> 00:05:05,721
Younger or older than you, she asks.

41
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,889
l've got a twin sister.
What do you make of that?

42
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,292
Some fuckin' coincidence!

43
00:05:10,293 --> 00:05:12,394
Don't you
think it's a coincidence?

44
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:15,097
What's the plan? To have me locked up?
Careful.

45
00:05:15,098 --> 00:05:17,132
-No, no, l was taking it off.
-Drive me mad,

46
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:20,133
until my brain rots whenever
l enter the building?

47
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:24,237
You knowthose people who talk
and talk and talk?

48
00:05:25,008 --> 00:05:26,675
As if a coincidence could
bring us closer together,

49
00:05:26,676 --> 00:05:28,944
so we can talk about things
together, or something.

50
00:05:28,945 --> 00:05:31,945
But she'sjust a neighbour.
The woman from 2B.

51
00:05:32,482 --> 00:05:33,982
l don't want to talk.

52
00:05:33,983 --> 00:05:36,918
She just lives
in the same building.

53
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,621
The old cow's probably up there
listening to us right now.

54
00:05:39,622 --> 00:05:42,622
l reckon you're winding yourself
up, Tana.

55
00:05:43,526 --> 00:05:45,527
-What's that?
-Uh?

56
00:05:45,528 --> 00:05:47,362
What you've got there, what is it?

57
00:05:47,363 --> 00:05:49,865
l don't believe you're still spending
money on the agent.

58
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:52,866
l don't believe you're still spending
money on the agent.

59
00:05:53,536 --> 00:05:56,505
What did you get him? Silk
handkerchiefs, some nice socks?

60
00:05:56,506 --> 00:05:58,940
What sort of present can you
give an agent?

61
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:01,276
OK, no problem, sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

62
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,945
Some people live
from official shady dealings...

63
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:06,281
Some people live
from official shady dealings...

64
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,617
and nobody says a thing.

65
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,618
-l think he's horrendous. Sorry.
-But he's a friend of mine.

66
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:14,189
l know, so l said sorry.

67
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,825
-We're going to his party Saturday.
-So we're going...?

68
00:06:16,826 --> 00:06:18,393
-Yes, what's up?
-Great!

69
00:06:18,394 --> 00:06:20,562
To hear a first-time mum
talk about baby poo.

70
00:06:20,563 --> 00:06:23,563
lt'll be great. Wonderful.

71
00:06:26,335 --> 00:06:29,335
-Come on.
-Fine.

72
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,706
There's a new radio station
round here.

73
00:06:31,707 --> 00:06:33,508
-A load of arseholes.
-Why not go and see?

74
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:35,410
-No, no.
-Perhaps they need people?

75
00:06:35,411 --> 00:06:37,312
-l've no time, Tenso.
-But...

76
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:40,313
-Piss off.
-Tana?

77
00:06:58,101 --> 00:06:59,668
-Hello.
-Listen...

78
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,436
That shitty TV l'm trying
to watch, it doesn't...

79
00:07:01,437 --> 00:07:04,437
That shitty TV l'm trying
to watch, it doesn't...

80
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,441
-Tana...
-l can'tswitch channels, nothing...

81
00:07:06,442 --> 00:07:08,777
l'm seeing the same thing
allafternoon...

82
00:07:08,778 --> 00:07:10,512
-Okay, okay.
Shitty thing...

83
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,414
By the way,
l've been thinking...

84
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:13,882
l mean it, really.
Firstofall...

85
00:07:13,883 --> 00:07:16,084
l mean it, really.
Firstofall...

86
00:07:16,085 --> 00:07:17,919
-because l've notgota thing to wear.
-Tana...

87
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,920
But even ifl had l don't want
to go.

88
00:07:21,057 --> 00:07:24,025
l've got nothing in common with them.

89
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:27,026
lfl don't talkl'm left looking
like a prat.

90
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,731
So when do you plan
to call your daughter?

91
00:07:29,732 --> 00:07:32,732
l rang 3 times today
and she couldn't speak.

92
00:07:33,302 --> 00:07:35,804
First she was with the masseuse,

93
00:07:35,805 --> 00:07:38,740
then she was in the shower.
And the next time she'd gone out.

94
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:41,610
What do you say to that?

95
00:07:41,611 --> 00:07:44,045
l reckon that
since her husband was made manager...

96
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:47,046
he thinks we are not good enough.
He won't lether talk.

97
00:07:47,617 --> 00:07:50,118
He doesn't let her.
That's not how we brought her up.

98
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:52,320
Not to worryabout us?
Come on!

99
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:55,321
What l'd like to know is
how much he's on now he's a manager.

100
00:07:57,059 --> 00:08:00,059
They're spending too much.
No saving going on there.

101
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,131
She was going on and on.
So l go into the bathroom,

102
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:06,001
and she puts her hand here,
and l felt so mad...

103
00:08:06,002 --> 00:08:08,270
and she puts her hand here,
and l felt so mad...

104
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:10,005
l just flipped and said
l'd like to kill you!

105
00:08:10,006 --> 00:08:11,473
-Sorry...
-What are you doing?

106
00:08:11,474 --> 00:08:13,575
-No, no, l'm sorry...
-You almost killed him.

107
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,076
-Go and see a shrink, kid.
-l don't like shrinks.

108
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,479
-And why don't you...?
-No, no... l want to...

109
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,980
-but it scares me.
-You feel guilty?

110
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:21,981
-No, not guilty. Scared.
-Go on.

111
00:08:24,954 --> 00:08:27,954
-Carry on, arsehole!
-Get off my back!

112
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:33,092
-l swear it, l can't.
-Look. Do it with your back to her.

113
00:08:33,629 --> 00:08:36,629
-l swear it, l can't.
-Look. Do it with your back to her.

114
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:39,801
You need to split up.
Just look at yourself.

115
00:08:39,802 --> 00:08:42,802
l don't want to.
l'm in a bad way.

116
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,775
Three words, Tenso.
Just three words.

117
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,776
l, 1 . Want, 2. Out, 3.

118
00:08:50,646 --> 00:08:53,515
lf you can't say it, it's because
you're a coward,

119
00:08:53,516 --> 00:08:56,117
But tell her, otherwise
you'll be in a really bad way.

120
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:59,118
But tell her, otherwise
you'll be in a really bad way.

121
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,657
-Try it on me. Come on.
-Uh?

122
00:09:02,658 --> 00:09:04,292
-Try it on me.
-What?

123
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,794
-Three little words, come on.
-No, sod off.

124
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,795
-Come on.
-Just do it.

125
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:13,299
-What?
-Come here.

126
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:21,309
l want out.

127
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,310
That's it, great, great!

128
00:09:27,183 --> 00:09:28,984
Tenso, be strong.
Marriage is like a job.

129
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,985
Tenso, be strong.
Marriage is like a job.

130
00:09:32,688 --> 00:09:34,422
That l want to resign from.

131
00:09:34,423 --> 00:09:36,524
You need a change of routine.

132
00:09:36,525 --> 00:09:38,660
To stop doing... what you always do.

133
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,928
When you get home,
what do you do?

134
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:41,896
When you get home,
what do you do?

135
00:09:41,897 --> 00:09:43,598
-l put my pyjamas on.
-Don't do it.

136
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:45,367
-l wash my hands.
-Don't wash them.

137
00:09:45,368 --> 00:09:48,336
-Then l sit down to dinner.
-You don't put your pyjamas on,

138
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:51,337
you don't wash your hands,
and when dinner's ready...

139
00:09:51,574 --> 00:09:53,675
you're not hungry.
You don't have dinner.

140
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,077
You stand up straight,

141
00:09:56,078 --> 00:09:59,078
looking at the wall,
and you say the three words.

142
00:09:59,115 --> 00:10:02,115
-l want out.
-And you go.

143
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:05,518
Be brave, Tenso.

144
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:09,124
l want out.

145
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,960
l want out.

146
00:10:11,961 --> 00:10:13,962
l want out.

147
00:10:13,963 --> 00:10:16,431
l want out!

148
00:10:16,432 --> 00:10:19,432
l want out.

149
00:10:20,403 --> 00:10:23,403
l want out.

150
00:10:25,308 --> 00:10:28,308
l want out!

151
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:32,979
Hell, l want out.

152
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:39,819
We're not all stupid. They reckon
we're not idiots, but we are.

153
00:10:40,956 --> 00:10:43,956
Howwas your day?

154
00:10:44,927 --> 00:10:47,927
Know how much this bloody onion cost?
Any idea?

155
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:52,467
What's wrong?
Go and change, it's almost ready.

156
00:10:52,468 --> 00:10:54,436
l'm not going to change.

157
00:10:54,437 --> 00:10:57,437
-What?
-Whatyoujustheard.

158
00:10:57,807 --> 00:11:00,675
Are you sure you're alright?

159
00:11:00,676 --> 00:11:02,143
Yes.

160
00:11:02,144 --> 00:11:04,346
OK, well go and sit up,
as it's almost ready.

161
00:11:04,347 --> 00:11:06,848
l'm not hungry.

162
00:11:06,849 --> 00:11:08,316
l made pasta.

163
00:11:08,317 --> 00:11:11,317
-Tana, l want...
-Don't you want pasta, Tenso?

164
00:11:19,795 --> 00:11:22,795
-lsn't it any good?
-Yes, it's good.

165
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,111
l was almostthere.

166
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,512
Work at a relationship,
otherwise it'll fade and die.

167
00:11:37,513 --> 00:11:40,513
Work at a relationship,
otherwise it'll fade and die.

168
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:43,850
What you need kid is someone
like ''Cuervo'' Flores.

169
00:11:45,521 --> 00:11:47,389
He knewwhat it was all about.
He was old school, he was.

170
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,457
He knewwhat it was all about.
He was old school, he was.

171
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,726
Real old school.

172
00:11:51,727 --> 00:11:54,727
-Who's ''Cuervo Flores''?
-Who was... a phenomenon.

173
00:11:54,864 --> 00:11:57,632
-A crook.
-A real talent, one of a kind.

174
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:00,168
-lt's in the genes with him.
-Yeah, but he caused a lot of harm.

175
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:02,470
No doubt. We couldn't
mention him at home.

176
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,173
Do you remember Susana Hoyos,
my cousin's wife?

177
00:12:05,174 --> 00:12:07,842
With a name like that...

178
00:12:07,843 --> 00:12:10,678
There was something about
Cuervo Flores, in his eyes.

179
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:13,148
He was wild, a hunting dog.

180
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:16,084
He knew you had to seduce a woman...

181
00:12:16,085 --> 00:12:17,852
by talking to her,
making her laugh.

182
00:12:17,853 --> 00:12:20,555
Christ, he caused havoc round our way.

183
00:12:20,556 --> 00:12:22,690
Christ, he caused havoc round our way.

184
00:12:22,691 --> 00:12:25,493
Maybe Marito never attended to
his wife as he should.

185
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,529
Do you remember lndia,
Gaita's girlfriend?

186
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:30,098
Do you remember lndia,
Gaita's girlfriend?

187
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:32,066
He saw her
the day before the wedding...

188
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:35,067
and convinced her to party with him,

189
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,939
and she missed her own wedding.

190
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,908
He's got a thing about married women.

191
00:12:39,909 --> 00:12:42,909
-l need someone like that.
-No, forget it.

192
00:12:43,612 --> 00:12:46,612
He can't show his face round there now.
They've got it in for him.

193
00:12:49,285 --> 00:12:52,285
Come on, Tenso!

194
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,792
Everything was horrible.

195
00:12:57,793 --> 00:12:59,928
The house was horrible,
l don't knowwhy.

196
00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:02,397
The neighbours were horrible, too.

197
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:04,032
And for some reason l wasn't
worth shit.

198
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:07,033
Basically there was something
l was never able to swallow...

199
00:13:07,937 --> 00:13:10,937
ls that the right word, swallow?

200
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,708
Does it matter? ls it the right word?
Yes, it is, yes.

201
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,244
Swallow.
You could also say assimilate.

202
00:13:16,245 --> 00:13:18,613
OK.
l prefer that.

203
00:13:18,614 --> 00:13:21,216
Because that's the word.
Assimilate.

204
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:24,217
l've never been able to assimilate,
which to me was like a boot in the...

205
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:31,090
the fact she didn't like my friends.
That was really hard for me.

206
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:34,393
The fact she was always miserable
with my friends was...

207
00:13:34,964 --> 00:13:36,331
-So l don't like your friends?
-Yes.

208
00:13:36,332 --> 00:13:38,266
l have to like your friends,
to be with you?

209
00:13:38,267 --> 00:13:40,068
-Don't you think?
-That's hard.

210
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,135
-Don't you think?
-That's hard.

211
00:13:41,136 --> 00:13:44,136
ls it hard to... what is it?
What's the word...? Well, yes.

212
00:13:44,607 --> 00:13:47,607
-That's enough.
-OK.

213
00:13:47,977 --> 00:13:49,978
Did you ring?

214
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:52,979
Put your cigarette out.

215
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,983
Alright, l'll put it out.

216
00:13:54,984 --> 00:13:57,984
-Tenso!
-l'm putting it out right now, see?

217
00:13:58,687 --> 00:14:01,687
Someone's calling you from over there.

218
00:14:03,826 --> 00:14:06,826
-Me?
-Yeah.

219
00:14:07,796 --> 00:14:10,031
-Oh, God.
-What?

220
00:14:10,032 --> 00:14:12,200
Well, we won't stay
too long. Just for a bit.

221
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:14,702
-Calm down, please.
-Good evening, welcome!

222
00:14:14,703 --> 00:14:17,703
-Hello, hello.
-Come on in.

223
00:14:18,007 --> 00:14:21,007
-Hi, happy birthday.
-Thanks.

224
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,014
-Come on...
-You can be so dumb.

225
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:29,015
That's it, come on in.

226
00:14:30,219 --> 00:14:31,819
-How are you?
-Happy birthday.

227
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,821
Thanks, thanks.

228
00:14:33,822 --> 00:14:35,356
-Happy birthday!
-Thanks.

229
00:14:35,357 --> 00:14:38,357
-lsn't it great? A presentfrom Pao.
-Fantastic.

230
00:14:48,037 --> 00:14:51,037
-What?
-What's wrong?

231
00:14:59,415 --> 00:15:02,415
That's the thing nowadays, see?
Guys of 40 with girls of 25.

232
00:15:02,518 --> 00:15:05,518
Lower your voice, please.

233
00:15:11,894 --> 00:15:14,894
What's wrong with that girl?
Has she fallen in love with that agent?

234
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:22,070
Can't she fall in love with an agent?

235
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:25,071
Yes, love, yes.

236
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:35,014
-OK, pretend to talk... she's coming.
-Shut it.

237
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:37,352
-Hi...
-Hello. How are you?

238
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,787
-Fine, you?
-Fine.

239
00:15:39,788 --> 00:15:42,290
Hi, how are you?
Macarena, my sister.

240
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,425
-Tenso, Tana...
-Wait, wait.

241
00:15:44,426 --> 00:15:47,426
-What do you say?
-No, no, sit down.

242
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,566
Very well. l'm happy that l've finally
found a live-in help,

243
00:15:51,567 --> 00:15:54,567
Very well. l'm happy that l've finally
found a live-in help,

244
00:15:55,738 --> 00:15:58,239
to look after the baby.
So now l'm fine.

245
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,775
-So l'm fine.
-That's good.

246
00:16:00,776 --> 00:16:02,944
-So l'm fine.
-That's good.

247
00:16:02,945 --> 00:16:05,146
Sorry l couldn't get to the clinic.

248
00:16:05,147 --> 00:16:08,147
Don't worry. No problem, Tana.

249
00:16:08,651 --> 00:16:11,651
ls the baby well?

250
00:16:12,421 --> 00:16:15,156
-ls he sleeping OK?
-She... it's a girl.

251
00:16:15,157 --> 00:16:17,392
-She... Ah, a girl, right. A girl.
-Yes, she's a saint.

252
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,961
-Yes, she's a saint, you can't imagine.
-Really?

253
00:16:19,962 --> 00:16:22,962
Yes, except when she's got wind,
that makes her...

254
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:25,965
because she's constipated.
She's taken after me.

255
00:16:26,001 --> 00:16:29,001
The whole family, just ask my sister,
we're all constipated.

256
00:16:29,304 --> 00:16:32,304
l passed on my slow-transit gene,
poor thing.

257
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,908
-Yes, but now it's all runny, isn't it?
-Really?

258
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,513
Her nappy had some runny poo.

259
00:16:38,514 --> 00:16:41,514
So l'm constantly having
to change her.

260
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:44,650
And l don't have much milk.
And l have to squeeze my...

261
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,820
And l don't have much milk.
And l have to squeeze my...

262
00:16:48,624 --> 00:16:51,624
my... tit,
sorry, like an orange.

263
00:16:52,628 --> 00:16:55,029
-What are you laughing at?
-l find it all amusing.

264
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,699
-But you have to experience it yourself.
-Yes, of course.

265
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,268
-Ah, but she's gorgeous, gorgeous.
-Do you have kids, Tana?

266
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,269
-No.
-No, we don't.

267
00:17:06,842 --> 00:17:09,444
-And you, you're well?
-Yes, very well.

268
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,979
-Lovely. You're looking pretty.
-Thanks.

269
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,614
-So what do you do, Tana?
-What, what?

270
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:16,615
-What do you do?
-Nothing...

271
00:17:17,986 --> 00:17:20,986
-But what's your thing?
-My thing?

272
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,858
-Your passion.
-My passion?

273
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:26,859
-None, l don't have a passion.
-But you do have a passion.

274
00:17:26,895 --> 00:17:28,663
-No, l don't.
-Don't say you don't.

275
00:17:28,664 --> 00:17:30,531
What's my passion?

276
00:17:30,532 --> 00:17:33,532
-l don't have one. ls that so bad?
-No, it's great.

277
00:17:34,236 --> 00:17:36,237
l'm not doing anything
at the moment either.

278
00:17:36,238 --> 00:17:39,238
What sign are you, Tana?

279
00:17:39,575 --> 00:17:42,575
-Sagittarius, why?
-Hey, l don't believe...!

280
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,847
l don't believe it!

281
00:17:45,848 --> 00:17:48,149
My ex was Sagittarius.

282
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,852
l mean he is, he's not dead.

283
00:17:50,853 --> 00:17:53,853
l have two very very good friends,
Gachi and Pachi,

284
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:57,091
both Sagittarius.
Tana, l don't believe it.

285
00:17:57,092 --> 00:17:59,360
lt's amazing!

286
00:17:59,361 --> 00:18:02,361
l don't believe it. lt's incredible,
you, your ex,

287
00:18:03,198 --> 00:18:05,266
and Gachi and Pachi,
all Sagittarius.

288
00:18:05,267 --> 00:18:06,534
-Right.
-Yes!

289
00:18:06,535 --> 00:18:09,535
lt's amazing. Unbelievable.
Did you hear that, love?

290
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:13,005
Her, Gachi and Pachi and Laura,
and... her ex boyfriend...

291
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,344
-That was Lorena.
-Lorena... all Sagittarius.

292
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,780
lt's amazing.
That's too big a coincidence...

293
00:18:18,781 --> 00:18:20,414
it sounds ridiculous, but
what a coincidence.

294
00:18:20,415 --> 00:18:22,383
And there must be people here too...

295
00:18:22,384 --> 00:18:25,384
Hey! everyone, excuse me...

296
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,389
Turn the music down, guys.

297
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,524
-Anybody born under Sagittarius here?
-Tana...

298
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,793
-Anybody born under Sagittarius here?
-Tana...

299
00:18:31,794 --> 00:18:33,094
Cool it, love. l'm only asking,

300
00:18:33,095 --> 00:18:35,062
Are you Sagittarius?
That's amazing.

301
00:18:35,063 --> 00:18:37,598
Are you Sagittarius?
That's amazing.

302
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:40,034
Any more Sagittarius?
No? Only two?

303
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:42,303
Any more Sagittarius?
No? Only two?

304
00:18:42,304 --> 00:18:45,304
OK, but it's still a load. There are
another two Sagittarius here too.

305
00:18:46,575 --> 00:18:49,575
So it's... Gachi, Pachi, her,
her boyfriend, her ex boyfriend,

306
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:53,281
me and these two prats,
all Sagittarius.

307
00:18:53,282 --> 00:18:56,282
lt's full of Sagittarius.
Amazing. Really. Fantastic.

308
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:58,920
Maybe that's a coincidence too,

309
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:00,454
Maybe that's a coincidence too,

310
00:19:00,455 --> 00:19:02,723
and then we'll all...

311
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,426
-Everyone here will drop dead.
-Tana...

312
00:19:05,427 --> 00:19:07,628
-We'll all freak out.
-Tana, get yourjacket.

313
00:19:07,629 --> 00:19:10,629
-You can't imagine.
-Get yourjacket, we're leaving.

314
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,739
-Come on.
-No, no, no, hang on, hang on.

315
00:19:22,344 --> 00:19:25,344
l feel like crying,
l don't feel well.

316
00:19:27,316 --> 00:19:30,316
l feel really bad.
That was a dreadful scene.

317
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,787
lt's over, Tana.

318
00:19:32,788 --> 00:19:35,788
No, it's not.
l made a total fool of myself.

319
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,259
And also...

320
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,265
-What?
-Come on, let's get out, Tana.

321
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:47,101
No! l feel really bad! Why?

322
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:50,102
And l had to apologise!
That cow looked like a slut!

323
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,140
l'm so angry.

324
00:19:57,512 --> 00:20:00,512
l can't bear it!

325
00:20:10,726 --> 00:20:13,027
-That's it!
-Come on!

326
00:20:13,028 --> 00:20:14,729
What did you do, arsehole?
Where did you send it?

327
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,730
-Go for it, Tenso!
-Come on! lnto the net and goal!

328
00:20:17,866 --> 00:20:20,801
Goal!

329
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,470
-Goal!
-Sorry, sorry.

330
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,471
Sorry. Keep your hair on, Gardel.
Have you never bungles one?

331
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:29,808
How did it go?

332
00:21:00,575 --> 00:21:03,575
Guys?

333
00:21:13,288 --> 00:21:16,288
Straight on, straight on.
To the east.

334
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,693
Just keep going...

335
00:21:49,758 --> 00:21:52,758
-lt's here, isn't it? We've made it.
-Yes, there's the...

336
00:21:53,996 --> 00:21:55,496
-We're going to be mugged here...
-No.

337
00:21:55,497 --> 00:21:58,132
You'll see.

338
00:21:58,133 --> 00:22:01,133
Well, let's wait.
Bloody cold, isn't it?

339
00:22:15,817 --> 00:22:18,817
-What are we doing, Tenso?
-Take it easy.

340
00:22:19,454 --> 00:22:21,689
-Yes.
-Take it easy, everything's OK.

341
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:24,690
Well...

342
00:22:25,293 --> 00:22:27,128
-What's going on?
-l don't know...

343
00:22:27,129 --> 00:22:29,864
What is it? What happened?

344
00:22:29,865 --> 00:22:32,865
What?

345
00:22:33,168 --> 00:22:36,168
He's coming... Look...

347
00:22:56,858 --> 00:22:58,959
Nobody.

348
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,960
-Did you leave me the note?
-Who else is in on this?

349
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,732
-Nobody at all.
-You... me and...

350
00:23:04,733 --> 00:23:07,733
-Nobody else.
-Leave your things here.

351
00:23:09,504 --> 00:23:11,072
Are you sure about what you're after?

352
00:23:11,073 --> 00:23:14,073
Very sure.

353
00:23:16,878 --> 00:23:19,878
Follow me.

354
00:23:40,402 --> 00:23:43,402
-You OK?
-Yeah, why?

355
00:23:51,046 --> 00:23:54,046
We have a problem with the guys.

356
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:57,916
-l don't like them.
-Hang on, Cuervo, hang on.

357
00:23:59,254 --> 00:24:02,223
All you have to do is listen to him.

358
00:24:02,224 --> 00:24:05,224
All you have to do is listen to him.

359
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:09,194
What do you want?

360
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:13,532
-Good evening, Mr. Cuervo.
-Mr. Flores to you.

361
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:19,204
Go on... go on... go on...

362
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:25,412
Mr. Flores...

363
00:24:25,413 --> 00:24:27,781

364
00:24:27,782 --> 00:24:30,584

365
00:24:30,585 --> 00:24:33,585

366
00:24:42,964 --> 00:24:44,965
-ls he Flores?
-Yes.

367
00:24:44,966 --> 00:24:46,133
Flores, Flores?

368
00:24:46,134 --> 00:24:49,134
He's all the worse for wear.

369
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,512
-Are you fucking me around?
-Stop it! Listen to him.

370
00:24:58,513 --> 00:24:59,847
What is this, tell me?
What the fuck's this?

371
00:24:59,848 --> 00:25:01,515
My name's Diego, ''El Tenso'', Polsky.

372
00:25:01,516 --> 00:25:04,151
l'm married to Andrea ''La Tana'' Ferro
and l want out,

373
00:25:04,152 --> 00:25:05,486
so l've come...

374
00:25:05,487 --> 00:25:07,688
because of your
vast experience in seduction,

375
00:25:07,689 --> 00:25:10,658
to ask you to seduce my wife
so she leaves me.

376
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:13,659
He's giving you the chance to do
things right.

377
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,600
Look... the girl's hard work.

378
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:24,970
l know her: it's impossible.

379
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:30,010
Why have you come to me?

380
00:25:30,011 --> 00:25:33,011
They say you never fail.
And that's what l need, Mr. Flores.

381
00:25:46,394 --> 00:25:49,394
l'll think it over, uh?
ls that clear?

382
00:25:50,732 --> 00:25:53,732
So... don't come looking for me.

383
00:25:56,404 --> 00:25:59,139
l've never done anyone any harm.

384
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,140
l only ever went in when there was a
sad woman wanting out.

385
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,545
-ls that clear?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

386
00:26:04,546 --> 00:26:06,880
l'll think it over.
l'll speakto you later, right?

387
00:26:06,881 --> 00:26:09,083
Did you hear?

388
00:26:09,084 --> 00:26:12,084
Thanks, Mr. Flores.

389
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:25,530
My wife's not going to like him,
he's too violent.

390
00:26:26,034 --> 00:26:29,034
He was born for this.
lt's in his blood.

391
00:26:29,871 --> 00:26:32,871
That's the firsttime that the pupil
has done better than the teacher.

392
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:46,253
-Hi.
-Hey, what happened?

393
00:26:46,254 --> 00:26:49,254
-Nothing.
-God, you scared me!

394
00:26:49,257 --> 00:26:51,959
-Where were you?
-At the club with the guys.

395
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,960
We stayed on chatting.
Just coming.

396
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,540
Listen and don't say a thing.

397
00:27:09,644 --> 00:27:11,412
Listen and don't say a thing.

398
00:27:11,413 --> 00:27:14,413
So l can see ifl want thejob,
bring her to me Thursdaynoon...

399

at "French Fries Paradise".
Got it?

400
00:27:20,422 --> 00:27:22,089
She keeps ringing so l'll go with her.

401
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:24,091
Do you knowwhy she rang?

402
00:27:24,092 --> 00:27:27,092
So l can go with her for her
Papanicolau test, or her smear,

403
00:27:27,295 --> 00:27:29,963
whatever it is she has done
every so often.

404
00:27:29,964 --> 00:27:31,832
But she doesn't stop ringing,
nagging me to go with her.

405
00:27:31,833 --> 00:27:34,833
l can't bear it! l don't have all the
time in the world!

406
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,770
So l'm telling you up front,

407
00:27:36,771 --> 00:27:39,473
so you don't go talking behind my back.

408
00:27:39,474 --> 00:27:42,474
Follow me? Unbelievable, isn't it?

409
00:27:42,477 --> 00:27:45,477
-Unbelievable.
-She's got a nerve! For God's sake.

410
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,781
-Unbelievable.

00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:15,273
Excuse me, madam. l'd just like to
pay tribute to your beauty.

417
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,610
To the most beautifulflower.

418
00:28:19,481 --> 00:28:21,648
-Thanks very much.
-Thank you.

419
00:28:21,649 --> 00:28:24,649
Thank you very much, on behalf of the
male sex.

420
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,327
Don't mention it.

421
00:28:33,328 --> 00:28:35,963
-Nothing, it's just that...
-What?

422
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,964
Nothing. Shall we go? Shall we go?

423
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,969
Nothing, it'sjust that some fool...

-The bill's been paid.
-Ah, l've already paid.

427
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:10,328
Hello...

428
00:29:10,932 --> 00:29:13,932
-Sorry.
-Are you alone?

429
00:29:15,236 --> 00:29:18,236
Yes, why?

460
00:30:28,977 --> 00:30:31,977
No, whattoys? No, nothing, normal...
Either me on top...

461
00:30:32,447 --> 00:30:34,848
or her like this... rough, on top.

462
00:30:34,849 --> 00:30:37,451
But... sorry, how long is it going to
take you to do the job?

463
00:30:37,452 --> 00:30:40,452
-Why?
-No, just wondering.

464
00:30:42,123 --> 00:30:45,123
-From 10 to 15 days.
-ls that all?

465
00:30:45,994 --> 00:30:48,994
How much is it going to cost?

466
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,798
You'll see.

467
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:54,799
Another thing: where does she work?

468
00:30:54,836 --> 00:30:57,836
-She doesn't work.
-What does she do?

469
00:30:58,206 --> 00:31:00,140
Nothing.

470
00:31:00,141 --> 00:31:03,141
Get her out ofthe house first.
l can't work there.

471
00:31:11,486 --> 00:31:13,654
Get her ajob in your radio station.
She's very talented,

472
00:31:13,655 --> 00:31:16,056
very talented,
but she needs a push.

473
00:31:16,057 --> 00:31:18,859
Kepelsky, we're from the same
background...

474
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,894
She's a bit down and needs that push,
just a little...

475
00:31:20,895 --> 00:31:23,895
She's a bit down and needs that push,
just a little...

476
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,233
-Has nobody ever helped you?
-Of course,

477
00:31:26,234 --> 00:31:28,735
but l don't have the money
for it, understand?

478
00:31:28,736 --> 00:31:31,705
-lt's a small radio station, Tenso.
-Yes, l know.

479
00:31:31,706 --> 00:31:34,706
To bring somebody in
l need a budget l haven't got.

480
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,911
-Does she have qualifications?
-Of course she does...

481
00:31:37,912 --> 00:31:40,912
-Yes, we can get it.
-Of course. Yes, no problem.

482
00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:43,183
-Yes, we can get it.
-Of course. Yes, no problem.

483
00:31:43,184 --> 00:31:45,519
Don't give up hope. l'll give you a
ring if something comes along.

484
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,987
Don't give up hope. l'll give you a
ring if something comes along.

485
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,322
But is it a yes?

486
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:51,323
lt's yes, if something turns up, yes,
l'll ring you.

487
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:54,359
-Eh?
-OK. Fine.

488
00:31:55,597 --> 00:31:58,597
Sorry. Dami?
No, sorry...

489
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,200
How much does an announcer earn?
Approximately.

490
00:32:03,104 --> 00:32:06,104
Well... about 500 pesos.

491
00:32:09,877 --> 00:32:12,546
l'll pay it!

492
00:32:12,547 --> 00:32:14,081
l'll pay. We're not going
to argue over money,

493
00:32:14,082 --> 00:32:15,849
we're ofthe same blood.

494
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,850
l'll pay it. You've got
a real talent there.

495
00:32:19,387 --> 00:32:21,855
She doesn't stop talking.
ln public.

496
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:24,856
You'll love her. You'll see.

497
00:32:49,651 --> 00:32:52,651
-Morning.
-Hi.

498
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:58,558
Hi.

499
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,559
What do they mean with ''winter's
back''? l don't understand.

500
00:33:01,829 --> 00:33:04,829
With two cold days in summer.
What? What does it mean?

501
00:33:04,999 --> 00:33:06,933
-Well yes...
-What have people got up top?

502
00:33:06,934 --> 00:33:09,269
What a load of rubbish. l understand...
is that what you understand?

503
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:12,270
People... a photo of people at the
coast on the front page?

504
00:33:12,607 --> 00:33:15,242
ls that news? Haven't they got
anything else to put there?

505
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,110
No, they obviously don't live
here in summer.

506
00:33:17,111 --> 00:33:18,512
Always, every summer...

507
00:33:18,513 --> 00:33:20,681
lt's always cold somewhere.

508
00:33:20,682 --> 00:33:23,682
Are they going to take that photo?
They look awful.

509
00:33:26,654 --> 00:33:29,654
-Want one?
-No, thanks.

510
00:33:36,964 --> 00:33:39,332
l was speaking to Kepelsky,

511
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:42,333
the owner of the radio station
in the club...

512
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:45,370
And well... we were chatting and your
name cropped up...

513
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:50,010
And... he asked me what you were
doing. l never speak about us,

514
00:33:50,011 --> 00:33:53,011
of you, me, l don't like to talk.

515
00:33:54,182 --> 00:33:56,149
And then Kepelsky says...

516
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:58,685
he's got something for you.

517
00:33:58,686 --> 00:34:01,686
-For me?
-Yes.

518
00:34:02,824 --> 00:34:05,824
-What?
-l don't know.

519
00:34:05,893 --> 00:34:07,327
He wants to tell you himself.

520
00:34:07,328 --> 00:34:10,328
Kepelsky, from that crap radio
station from round here?

521
00:34:11,065 --> 00:34:14,065
They're a bunch of arseholes.

522
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,904
Come on, Tenso, l'm in a bad way,
but not that bad.

523
00:34:17,905 --> 00:34:20,040
-Tana...
-No, you can't imagine,

524
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:22,542
it's absolute crap...
l listened to a couple of programs,

525
00:34:22,543 --> 00:34:25,345
-and they are dross...
Tana... Tana!

526
00:34:25,346 --> 00:34:27,080
l'm trying to talk and you
won't listen!

527
00:34:27,081 --> 00:34:28,849
l'm trying to talk and you
won't listen!

528
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,751
-But you're shouting.
-l am now.

529
00:34:30,752 --> 00:34:32,919
-OK, now.
-Please, go to the radio...

530
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,920
and do something with
your fucking life, please.

531
00:34:38,593 --> 00:34:41,593
They want to kill the thief

532
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:45,230
Who made offwith a woman.

533
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,833
Do you want to know where he is?

534
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:52,337
You'll neverknow.
But l know why

535
00:34:52,907 --> 00:34:55,907
They want to kill the thief

536
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:59,677
Who made offwith a woman.
They want to know,

537
00:34:59,947 --> 00:35:02,947
To know where he is

538
00:35:03,584 --> 00:35:06,584
But they'llnever know.
And l know why.

539
00:35:09,257 --> 00:35:12,257
He'llneverknow you're with me

540
00:35:12,927 --> 00:35:15,927
in a corner ofmy hut

541
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:19,430
because theydon'tknow the way...

542
00:35:19,901 --> 00:35:22,901
or the mountains

543
00:35:23,571 --> 00:35:26,571
l know they're looking forme

544
00:35:27,108 --> 00:35:30,108
because they've been shamed

545
00:35:30,745 --> 00:35:33,745
when l made offwith you

546
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,382
in theirrush theyfailed

547
00:35:37,418 --> 00:35:40,418
They want to kill the thief

548
00:35:41,289 --> 00:35:44,289
Who made offwith a woman
they want...

549
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:05,076
No, it's spectacular.

550
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:08,413
No, l'dprefer not to talkabout it.

551
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,817
lt upsets me.

552
00:36:10,818 --> 00:36:13,119
That's OK, take care.

553
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,120
-Yes, can l help?
-l'm here to see Mr. Kepelsky.

554
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:19,259
-You're from the cake shop, right?
-No, l'm not.

555
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,260
l'm notfrom anywhere
and l'm here to see Kepelsky.

556
00:36:24,632 --> 00:36:27,632
Ah, sorry, one last time...
your name is?

557
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:30,670
Andrea Ferro, and l'm here to see
Mr. Kepelsky.

558
00:36:30,671 --> 00:36:33,671
Yes, right.

559
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,609
She's out of her mind.
She's crazy!

560
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:40,778
She plans to get 45 people
into that living room!

561
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:44,651
The house is tiny.

562
00:36:44,652 --> 00:36:47,652
No, l'm not going to the party.

563
00:36:48,389 --> 00:36:51,389
She weighs... she must weigh 39 kilos.

564
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:54,792
You can't wear all that
if you weigh 39 kilos.

565
00:36:55,997 --> 00:36:58,997
Of course... absolutely, hang on.

566
00:37:02,069 --> 00:37:04,404
l'll be right with you.

567
00:37:04,405 --> 00:37:07,405
No, oh, God. Can you believe it?

568
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:11,809
The carnival guy we were going to
interview has just cancelled.

569
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,749
That isjust so rude,

570
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:18,750
because l do myjob, see?
And if you tell me at the last...

571
00:37:19,854 --> 00:37:22,854
No, l'm not going.

572
00:37:23,024 --> 00:37:25,525
With 50 people there...

573
00:37:25,526 --> 00:37:27,260
Excuse me...
Are you going to attend to me or not?

574
00:37:27,261 --> 00:37:29,329
lf not l'll go home...

575
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:32,032
while you send
your text messages.

576
00:37:32,033 --> 00:37:34,701
Didn't you collect
your pension today? Or...

577
00:37:34,702 --> 00:37:37,103
lt's not my fault.
Damian's on the air,

578
00:37:37,104 --> 00:37:40,104
that's why he
hasn't come to see you.

579
00:37:40,875 --> 00:37:43,875
Pension? ls that meant
to be an insult?

580
00:37:45,046 --> 00:37:48,046
so that comment...
if it's meant as an insult...

581
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:51,849
so that comment...
if it's meant as an insult...

582
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:55,353
l'd have to throw myself in front of
a bus. Maybe l should...

583
00:37:57,792 --> 00:38:00,760
-What's going on?
-l don't know. This lady here...

584
00:38:00,761 --> 00:38:02,729
-What's wrong?
-l don't know.

585
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:04,764
She got nervous for some reason.

586
00:38:04,765 --> 00:38:07,765
-l'm here to see Mr. Kepelsky.
-Ah, and you are...?

587
00:38:08,069 --> 00:38:09,369
Andrea Ferro.

588
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,371
-Ah, you're Tenso's wife.
-Yes.

589
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,873
-How are you?
-Fine. l'm here to see Kepelsky.

590
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:16,874
-Yes, that's me.
-Right, is your father here?

591
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,479
No, l'm in charge of the radio.

592
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,480
Oh, so you're in charge?
Pleased to meet you. How are you?

593
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,952
-Fine.
-Sorry. OK.

594
00:38:25,953 --> 00:38:28,588
-You're OK?
-Yes, fine.

595
00:38:28,589 --> 00:38:31,589
She was on the phone
and l had to wait a bit.

596
00:38:31,759 --> 00:38:33,994
Come in and take a seat.

597
00:38:33,995 --> 00:38:36,995
-Yes, thanks.
-You're welcome.

598
00:38:37,798 --> 00:38:39,499
-Hello.
-Hello.

599
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,435
No, l'm under a lot of stress.

600
00:38:42,436 --> 00:38:45,436
The thing with that girl was
that she got me mad...

601
00:38:45,773 --> 00:38:48,773
-Sorry.
-l see.

602
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,410
-Can l sit down?
-Go ahead, yes.

603
00:38:52,613 --> 00:38:55,448
-Does that often happen?
-What?

604
00:38:55,449 --> 00:38:58,449
-You getting mad?
-Oh, no, no.

605
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:01,619

607
00:39:09,163 --> 00:39:12,163
-Shall l leave?
-No, please. Sorry.

608
00:39:12,967 --> 00:39:15,967
-So you're a radio announcer.

That's right.
What sort of format interests you?

611
00:39:20,975 --> 00:39:23,975
What have you done in the past?

612
00:39:24,512 --> 00:39:27,512
Uh... well, l have a problem
with the word ''format''.

613
00:39:29,383 --> 00:39:32,383
lt'd be easier if l told you what
doesn't interest me.

614
00:39:32,386 --> 00:39:34,821
Okay.

615
00:39:34,822 --> 00:39:37,822
l'm not interested in a traditional
sort of radio programme...

616
00:39:38,392 --> 00:39:41,392
with a presenter, reporters trying to
be funny, with music and opinion.

617
00:39:43,497 --> 00:39:46,166
l hate to thinkthat the listener...

618
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:49,167
has a lower lQ than the presenter...

619
00:39:49,837 --> 00:39:51,638
And l don't want a woman...

620
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,807
sitting there just to read
the temperature...

621
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,675
or talking about the traffic problems.

622
00:39:55,676 --> 00:39:58,676
l think it's sexist, it's... pathetic.

623
00:39:59,547 --> 00:40:02,547
What else do you detest?

624
00:40:03,751 --> 00:40:05,218
-What else do l detest?
-Yes...

625
00:40:05,219 --> 00:40:08,219
-Anything else you can't stand?
-Uh...

626
00:40:11,092 --> 00:40:14,092
Other things l can't stand? Many.

627
00:40:14,361 --> 00:40:17,361
-For example...?
-Loads.

628
00:40:18,566 --> 00:40:20,767
Well, coincidence seekers...

629
00:40:20,768 --> 00:40:22,769
tend to get up my nose...

630
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:24,070
useless people who spend their time...

631
00:40:24,071 --> 00:40:25,872
looking out for coincidences.

632
00:40:25,873 --> 00:40:28,508
You know, your birthday,

633
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:31,509
birth sign, whatever.

634
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,747
What else?

635
00:40:34,748 --> 00:40:36,783
Models irritate me.

636
00:40:36,784 --> 00:40:39,552
People who smile all the time,
false modesty.

637
00:40:39,553 --> 00:40:42,188
Effusive thanks...

638
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:45,189
especially from the family...
that puts me on my guard.

639
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:48,862
when they come out of the screen
at you and then recede.

640
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,730
when they come out of the screen
at you and then recede.

641
00:40:50,731 --> 00:40:53,533
-Wallpaper.
-Especially of a beach...

642
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:56,136
and with sunglasses.
The scene.

643
00:40:56,137 --> 00:40:58,304
-The scene?
-Yeah. The idea of ''the scene''.

644
00:40:58,305 --> 00:41:01,305
Being in, being out.

645
00:41:01,742 --> 00:41:03,309
Have you ever listened
to our programmes?

646
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:06,212
No, never been able to.
Never had the time.

647
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:09,115
-You knowwhat l'd like you to do?
-Yes?

648
00:41:09,116 --> 00:41:11,751
Bring me a list...

649
00:41:11,752 --> 00:41:14,752
of all those things you hate,

650
00:41:15,289 --> 00:41:18,289
and we can put something together,
give you a space in the morning,

651
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:22,660
so you can vent on air all your hates
as naturally as you're doing now.

652
00:41:24,131 --> 00:41:27,066
-l'd come every morning?
-Yeah, let's see...

653
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:29,802
l think it'll work.

654
00:41:29,803 --> 00:41:32,803
-lt's for 500 pesos, you know?
-Oh... no, l don't know.

655
00:41:34,175 --> 00:41:37,175
-What do you mean, you don't know?
-The money.

656
00:41:38,145 --> 00:41:40,914
-How much do you want?
-No, l don't want to negotiate.

657
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,082
No, not at all.

658
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:46,083
l'm a dreadful negotiator.
l don't know, double?

659
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,021
-Double?
-Yes.

660
00:41:48,022 --> 00:41:50,857
We're a small radio station,
l don't have that sort of budget.

661
00:41:50,858 --> 00:41:53,126
No, of course.

662
00:41:53,127 --> 00:41:56,095
So we can forget it
until the radio grows.

663
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:58,198
-Thanks all the same.
-No, hang on a bit...

664
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:01,199
l'll consult, yeah?
We'll see whatwe can do.

665
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:05,102
-Alright.
-Will you wait?

666
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:18,017
-Damian Kepelsky, how are you?
-Ah, Kepelsky. How's everything?

667
00:42:18,018 --> 00:42:20,620
-Damian Kepelsky, how are you?
-Ah, Kepelsky. How's everything?

668
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,789
Great. Your wife's here,

669
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,558
but she won't go with 500.
She wants twice that.

670
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:28,559
-What do you mean twice that?
-lfyou like l'llplay it tough...

671
00:42:28,729 --> 00:42:30,897
No, she won't, l know her, but...
speak to her,

672
00:42:30,898 --> 00:42:33,800
No, she won't, l know her, but...
speak to her,

673
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,902
tell her it's a trial run,
and if it works...

674
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:38,338
-she'll have a rise.
-No, that's what l said...

675
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:41,040
-And what did she say?
-No, nothing...

676
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:42,375
Whatd'you mean nothing?

677
00:42:42,376 --> 00:42:45,044
-Work on her...
-Offer her 700.

678
00:42:45,045 --> 00:42:48,045
She's not worth 700, no way.
No, listen, Kepelsky...

679
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:52,850
Offer her 650, and l'll hold.
Go on.

680
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,920
OK, hang on.

681
00:42:56,724 --> 00:42:59,092
We could do 650.

682
00:42:59,093 --> 00:43:01,761
We could do 650.

683
00:43:01,762 --> 00:43:04,497
Um... no, no way... it's no good.

684
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:07,498
-What's your minimum?
-l don't know, 800.

685
00:43:07,868 --> 00:43:10,868
The fuckin' bitch...!
She wants to bankrupt me...

686
00:43:16,543 --> 00:43:19,379
No, it's OK.
But l run a small business.

687
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,380
l barely make it to the end of the
month. l can't afford that amount.

688
00:43:23,584 --> 00:43:26,519
-Just a sec, she wants 800 pesos.
-Listen, listen.

689
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,122
lt's the price of freedom, Tenso.
Get her out of the house.

690
00:43:29,123 --> 00:43:32,123
-And it's money that comes back in.
-No...

691
00:43:33,761 --> 00:43:36,761
Go on...

692
00:43:36,964 --> 00:43:39,964
Hello.

693
00:43:40,234 --> 00:43:43,234
OK, do it.
Pay her 800 pesos.

694
00:43:43,637 --> 00:43:46,039
Look...

695
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,474
Would it bother you if l gave
you a cheque?

696
00:43:48,475 --> 00:43:50,476
-A cheque to cash?
-Postdated 120 days?

697
00:43:50,477 --> 00:43:52,545
No, 120 days would ruin me.

698
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:54,080
No, l thought so.

699
00:43:54,081 --> 00:43:55,815
OK, look, from the 1st to the 5th...

700
00:43:55,816 --> 00:43:58,651
my secretary will take you the cash.

701
00:43:58,652 --> 00:44:01,621
-God, you're mean.
-l'm mean, l'm mean...

702
00:44:01,622 --> 00:44:04,622
But l'm the one paying the money!

703
00:44:11,332 --> 00:44:12,665
-What are you doing here?
-Where are you going?

704
00:44:12,666 --> 00:44:15,401
-What are you doing here?
-Where are you going?

705
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:18,402
What does it matter to you?
Excuse me...

706
00:44:21,275 --> 00:44:24,275
lf you like, we can have a coffee
and then you can leave.

707
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:27,578
-What do you think?
-No, l'm sorry.

708
00:44:27,815 --> 00:44:30,815
-Go on.
-l have some things to do so l can't.

709
00:44:35,656 --> 00:44:38,656
Just two minutes.

710
00:44:38,859 --> 00:44:41,859
You can't go home with wet hair.
A coffee?

711
00:44:43,297 --> 00:44:45,932
No, really, l'll just wait here.

712
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:48,933
l'll stay here, thanks.

713
00:44:53,507 --> 00:44:56,507
-Can l ask you something?
-Yes.

714
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:59,944
But do you have any idea?

715
00:45:00,848 --> 00:45:03,848
But do you have any idea?

716
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:07,618
Thanks.

717
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:12,690
Hold this...

718
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:18,731
Have one.

719
00:45:18,732 --> 00:45:21,732
-Shall l take one?
-Yes, go ahead.

720
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:33,210
Thanks.

721
00:45:34,381 --> 00:45:37,381
Toffees, chocolates?

722
00:45:39,586 --> 00:45:42,586
Now, tellme.

723
00:45:42,856 --> 00:45:45,856
Sex: how were things going?

724
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:49,260
l don't know. You speak.

725
00:45:50,264 --> 00:45:52,598
l don't get the mechanism:
Me or her?

726
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:55,599
She asks and we speak...

727
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:58,938
OK. Fine...

728
00:45:58,939 --> 00:46:01,939
That is... well... OK...

729
00:46:02,709 --> 00:46:05,445
Let's see...

730
00:46:05,446 --> 00:46:08,446
At times l'd initiate and feel things
thatweren't...

731
00:46:09,082 --> 00:46:11,050
weren't...

732
00:46:11,051 --> 00:46:12,952
That what?

733
00:46:12,953 --> 00:46:14,554
At times l'd initiate
and feel sort of...

734
00:46:14,555 --> 00:46:16,756
-You'd initiate...?
-Yes, l'd initiate...

735
00:46:16,757 --> 00:46:18,724
You should have made a noise...

736
00:46:18,725 --> 00:46:20,226
because l never actually realised.

737
00:46:20,227 --> 00:46:22,695
l never realised...

738
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:25,696
And the times l got on top of you?

739
00:46:25,966 --> 00:46:28,034
Ah, but...

740
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,735
What?

741
00:46:29,736 --> 00:46:31,938
When l got on top of you,
what was that?

742
00:46:31,939 --> 00:46:34,474
-You can't hear yourself?
-l don't know, l mean...

743
00:46:34,475 --> 00:46:37,475
-You can't hear yourself?
-l don't know, l mean...

744
00:46:40,247 --> 00:46:42,215
lt's true, l'd often get on top...

745
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:45,216
l mean it... No...
l want to be careful here...

746
00:46:45,786 --> 00:46:48,786
l don'twant to hurt anyone...

747
00:46:49,923 --> 00:46:52,923
Quite honestly, l don't remember
the last time l came.

748
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:04,235
This is a joke, Blanca.

749
00:47:08,108 --> 00:47:11,108
-Morning.
-Hello!

750
00:47:51,184 --> 00:47:54,184
-OK?
-Yes.

751
00:47:57,491 --> 00:48:00,491
No!

752
00:48:01,061 --> 00:48:04,061
No!

753
00:48:15,008 --> 00:48:18,008
Well, l'm off.

754
00:48:18,545 --> 00:48:19,912
-l'm a bit nervous.
-OK.

755
00:48:19,913 --> 00:48:22,913
Bye... see you.

756
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:26,250
-Wish me luck.
-Good luck.

757
00:48:26,386 --> 00:48:29,386
Thanks.

758
00:48:31,091 --> 00:48:33,359
-Tana, how are things?
-Bad.

759
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,493
Why should l lie?

760
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:36,829
Why should l lie?

761
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,031
-So what's the matter?
-Well, basically...

762
00:48:39,032 --> 00:48:41,701
l realise that living in society
is a big problem for me.

763
00:48:41,702 --> 00:48:43,536
Why? What's wrong?

764
00:48:43,537 --> 00:48:46,505
l feel l'm surrounded by mediocrity,

765
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:48,374
and frauds...

766
00:48:48,375 --> 00:48:50,910
Optimists,
and this week l realised...

767
00:48:50,911 --> 00:48:53,846
l detest optimism with all my heart.

768
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:55,915
lt's so damned stupid...

769
00:48:55,916 --> 00:48:58,784
to face life with optimism...

770
00:48:58,785 --> 00:49:01,785
And l realised l'm surrounded by
optimists,

771
00:49:02,089 --> 00:49:05,089
and that fake smile really
gets up my nose, l can't help it.

772
00:49:06,226 --> 00:49:09,095
For some people optimism
is a form of coping...

773
00:49:09,096 --> 00:49:11,864
The other day l ran into a friend,

774
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:13,799
The other day l ran into a friend,

775
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,235
who's no longer a friend,
and he said he'd smashed the car up.

776
00:49:16,236 --> 00:49:19,236
He was in plaster from hip to ankle,

777
00:49:19,306 --> 00:49:21,474
so l said: ''l can't believe
what you've just done'',

778
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:25,111
what ''an accident
with a stroke of luck'' is.

779
00:49:25,112 --> 00:49:27,580
what ''an accident
with a stroke of luck'' is.

780
00:49:27,581 --> 00:49:29,415
l fail to see what element of ''luck''...

781
00:49:29,416 --> 00:49:32,416
-Maybeyourfriend needed to see...
-She's got style, eh?

782
00:49:32,419 --> 00:49:35,419
-Maybeyourfriend needed to see...
-She's got style, eh?

783
00:49:36,923 --> 00:49:38,658
Sure, but what l sayis,

784
00:49:38,659 --> 00:49:40,426
why see things so positively?

785
00:49:40,427 --> 00:49:43,162
lfthis poorsod smashed the car up,

786
00:49:43,163 --> 00:49:45,297
he should at least be able to say:
Bloodyhell...

787
00:49:45,298 --> 00:49:47,333
what fuckin'bad luck l'm having...

788
00:49:47,334 --> 00:49:49,468
l don't mind whingers at all,
quite the opposite,

789
00:49:49,469 --> 00:49:51,470
l love people who moan, l do.

790
00:49:51,471 --> 00:49:54,471
''Down with optimism, long live
whinging'' l say.

791
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:58,242
-l reckon you're convincing me.
-Really?

792
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:01,578
lf l say your coming on this
programme was a stroke of luck,

793
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:03,349
would you take it
as an optimistic comment?

794
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:06,085
No... not at all. l'd say...

795
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:09,086
it's the most sensible thing
you've said so far.

796
00:50:10,323 --> 00:50:12,491
-Thanks, Tana.
-No, thank you.

797
00:50:12,492 --> 00:50:14,160
-Thanks, Mery.
-See you.

798
00:50:14,161 --> 00:50:17,161
Bye friends. Life is the pits.
See you.

799
00:50:29,142 --> 00:50:32,142
l adore your pessimism.

800
00:50:33,313 --> 00:50:36,182
What are you doing here?
What is this?

801
00:50:36,183 --> 00:50:39,183
lt's no coincidence.
l wantto take you to lunch.

802
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:43,220
-What for?
-To talk something over.

803
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:46,623
-What?
-No subject...

804
00:50:49,396 --> 00:50:52,364
Careful, l'm married.

805
00:50:52,365 --> 00:50:55,301
l want to have a meal with a woman...

806
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:58,302
who hates this sort of society.
ls that so wrong?

807
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:01,305
No.

808
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:22,695
-Ah, well...
-What's up?

809
00:51:22,696 --> 00:51:24,764
That's it!

810
00:51:24,765 --> 00:51:27,733
You've stolen my heart.

811
00:51:27,734 --> 00:51:30,734
Have pity on me, please.

812
00:51:32,405 --> 00:51:35,405
l'm a mere mortal.

813
00:51:41,248 --> 00:51:44,248
A mixed salad, please.

814
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:46,852
-Yes...
-The best beef you have...

815
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:49,853
-Tenderloin.
-Yes, that would be great.

816
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,925
So, let's drink.

817
00:51:52,926 --> 00:51:54,627
-Thanks.
-Would the lady like...

818
00:51:54,628 --> 00:51:57,628
a little ''nervous water''?

819
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:02,900
-Thank you very much.
-Not at all.

820
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:04,603
To this meeting.

821
00:52:04,604 --> 00:52:07,604
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

822
00:52:08,608 --> 00:52:10,910
And to my new life.

823
00:52:10,911 --> 00:52:13,911
Naturally.

824
00:52:15,448 --> 00:52:18,117
Some good things have been happening
to me lately, see?

825
00:52:18,118 --> 00:52:20,052
That's not usually how it is.

826
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:23,053
lf everything's going bad you have
to celebrate the good things.

827
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:29,226
Don't worry, l'm not going to start
talking. When l start l don't stop.

828
00:52:29,629 --> 00:52:32,629
-Talk, l don't mind.
-No, just for a while.

829
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,734
-l love listening to you.
-No, fine...

830
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:38,735
l've got all day and all night to
listen to you.

831
00:52:41,675 --> 00:52:44,443
Lots of things...

832
00:52:44,444 --> 00:52:47,444
have changed for me too recently.

833
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:50,516
l'm telling you this because l like you.

834
00:52:50,517 --> 00:52:53,517
And when l tell you who l am...

835
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:57,421
You do look familiar.

836
00:52:57,691 --> 00:53:00,159
Absolutely...
You lookfamilar.

837
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,661
Where do l know you from?

838
00:53:02,662 --> 00:53:05,662
-Well...
-Who are you?

839
00:53:07,634 --> 00:53:10,634
l've been ''in hiding'' for a while.

840
00:53:12,138 --> 00:53:15,138
-l'm ''El Cuervo'' Flores.
-Ah...

841
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:21,278
Don't be scared, please.
l know l've done harm...

842
00:53:22,816 --> 00:53:25,816
And l'm suffering for it.

843
00:53:27,654 --> 00:53:29,521
l'm telling you this because...

844
00:53:29,522 --> 00:53:32,522
l'd like us to be friends.

845
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:37,127
Nobody knows that.

846
00:53:37,197 --> 00:53:40,197
Nobody knows that.

847
00:53:40,867 --> 00:53:43,867
l've suffered as much
as those l've harmed.

848
00:53:44,738 --> 00:53:47,072
l'll apologise to them all one day.

849
00:53:47,073 --> 00:53:50,073
l swear.

850
00:53:53,413 --> 00:53:56,413
-Can we be friends?
-Of course.

851
00:54:11,264 --> 00:54:14,264
Where have you been all this time?

852
00:54:20,707 --> 00:54:23,707
-Will you excuse me?
-Of course.

853
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:37,220
Engaged.

854
00:54:37,891 --> 00:54:40,025
Hi, Cuervo! How are things? Fine?

855
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:43,026
-What are you doing here?
-l wanted to know how it was going.

856
00:54:44,264 --> 00:54:46,231
ls everything going according to plan?

857
00:54:46,232 --> 00:54:49,232
l'm backing out.
lf you just want to watch, l'm off.

858
00:54:49,269 --> 00:54:52,269
No, l don't enjoy watching.

859
00:54:52,806 --> 00:54:55,806
lt'sjust that l came...

860
00:54:57,410 --> 00:55:00,410
l began to feel a sort of anguish
in the chest...

861
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:04,047
Suddenly...

862
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:11,390
-Sorry, l feel embarrassed.
-Take it easy.

863
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:14,326
-No, don't look at me.
-Calm down.

864
00:55:14,327 --> 00:55:17,327
Breathe... inhale...
inhale, easy...

865
00:55:18,264 --> 00:55:21,264
Well...

866
00:55:24,938 --> 00:55:27,938
ln and out.

867
00:55:28,775 --> 00:55:31,176
-Does it hurt?
-A little.

868
00:55:31,177 --> 00:55:34,177
When l say ''go'' you go. OK?

869
00:55:35,348 --> 00:55:36,482
Go.

870
00:55:36,483 --> 00:55:39,018
-Better?
-l'm fine.

871
00:55:39,019 --> 00:55:41,954
Seeing me at work mixed you up, right?

872
00:55:41,955 --> 00:55:43,522
-Yep...
-For a few days...

873
00:55:43,523 --> 00:55:46,523
you'll think you like her again,
but don't worry.

874
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:49,860
l want total abstinence from you
for a few days, right?

875
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:53,330
Friendly but distant. lf she speaks,
answer in monosyllables, OK?

876
00:55:53,867 --> 00:55:56,001
Workto rule, got it?

877
00:55:56,002 --> 00:55:58,037
-Got it?
-Yeah...

878
00:55:58,038 --> 00:56:00,873
And don't ask her where she's going
or when she'll be back.

879
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:05,878
OK?

880
00:56:05,879 --> 00:56:08,879
OK?

881
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:14,186
Well, that's hard to understand too.

882
00:56:14,187 --> 00:56:15,387
-Hello.
-Hello.

883
00:56:15,388 --> 00:56:18,323
l'll ring you back.
Hello. Won't you say hello?

884
00:56:18,324 --> 00:56:20,059
-Yes, hello.
-How are you?

885
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:22,061
-Ugh, that stinks.
-Yes, it's wax.

886
00:56:22,062 --> 00:56:23,996
-lt turns my stomach.
-Did you listen to the programme?

887
00:56:23,997 --> 00:56:25,864
-Yes, l did.
-And?

888
00:56:25,865 --> 00:56:27,900
-So so.
-What do you mean so so?

889
00:56:27,901 --> 00:56:30,369
l liked it but... a fewthings...

890
00:56:30,370 --> 00:56:32,204
You can't hear itvery well.

891
00:56:32,205 --> 00:56:35,205
That's because the aerial is not very
powerful... or something.

892
00:56:35,375 --> 00:56:38,375
But they're a great lot who work there.

893
00:56:38,378 --> 00:56:41,378
You used to have a lisp, didn't you?

894
00:56:42,048 --> 00:56:45,048
-A lisp?
-Yeah, the letter 's'.

895
00:56:46,186 --> 00:56:49,186
Well... because l know you...
it sounded weird.

896
00:56:49,522 --> 00:56:51,523
But my friends rang
me because they all loved it.

897
00:56:51,524 --> 00:56:53,659
-Really?
-Yes.

898
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,660
The agent too?

899
00:56:56,696 --> 00:56:58,831
Don't call him ''agent''.
His name's Carlos.

900
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:01,233
lt's really pejorative calling him
''the agent''.

901
00:57:01,234 --> 00:57:03,735
OK, fine.
l use it affectionately.

902
00:57:03,736 --> 00:57:06,736
l've told you a thousand times.
But you never listen to me.

903
00:57:06,773 --> 00:57:09,773
Sorry.

904
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:24,855
-lt was a joke, sorry.
-No, it's OK.

905
00:57:25,458 --> 00:57:27,593
l'm so happy your friends liked it.
Are you serious?

906
00:57:27,594 --> 00:57:29,795
-Yes.
-l'm really happy.

907
00:57:29,796 --> 00:57:32,030
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

908
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:34,433
Look, l wanted to read to you.

909
00:57:34,434 --> 00:57:35,734
Tomorrow l've got to take along...

910
00:57:35,735 --> 00:57:37,703
another column like today's.

911
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:38,871
-Can l read it to you?
-No.

912
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:40,072
-No?
-No.

913
00:57:40,073 --> 00:57:42,040
-Are you busy?
-No, l've got to arrange something.

914
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:45,041
Can l borrow your cell phone?
l have to make a call...

915
00:57:45,311 --> 00:57:47,779
-The guy from the radio's calling...
-l don't have much credit, mind.

916
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:50,649
l'll recharge it. l should say
l don'twant to go.

917
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:53,585
He wants to meet but quite honestly
l'd prefer...

918
00:57:53,586 --> 00:57:55,587
No, no. Let's start again.
You have to go.

919
00:57:55,588 --> 00:57:57,656
No, no. Let's start again.
You have to go.

920
00:57:57,657 --> 00:57:58,957
-Why?
-Because it's yourjob.

921
00:57:58,958 --> 00:58:01,293
-And you have responsibilities.
-Yes.

922
00:58:01,294 --> 00:58:04,062
The radio doesn't stop
when the programme ends.

923
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:07,063
-lt continues. lsn't there a debate?
-No, luckily...

924
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:09,501
-Don't you all discuss things?
-l wantto stay and chat with you.

925
00:58:09,502 --> 00:58:10,769
-Go.
-No.

926
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:12,471
No, really, you have to go.
lt'll be good for you.

927
00:58:12,472 --> 00:58:13,939
Otherwise they'll starttalking.

928
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:15,574
-What can they say?
-That you're a sourpuss or a misery.

929
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:18,575
Things like that, so l think...

930
00:58:18,645 --> 00:58:20,145
You'll do well at the radio.

931
00:58:20,146 --> 00:58:21,813
Who knows where it could lead.

932
00:58:21,814 --> 00:58:23,482
-Hey, love, stop it!
-Uh?

933
00:58:23,483 --> 00:58:26,251
-l've got my hair up!
-Fine, fine, keep cool.

934
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:28,654
l've left you a sort of
''coq a la vin'' on the stove.

935
00:58:28,655 --> 00:58:30,989
-''Coq au vin'' it's called.
-Well, ''au vin'' then.

936
00:58:30,990 --> 00:58:33,990
-Well... that's all. See you.
-Hang on!

937
00:58:34,294 --> 00:58:36,195
What?

938
00:58:36,196 --> 00:58:37,829
You look really good in that dress.

939
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:39,198
-Really? Thanks.
-Yes.

940
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:42,199
The advance on my first pay cheque.

941
00:58:42,335 --> 00:58:45,335
-OK, see you. Bye.
-Bye.

942
00:58:48,474 --> 00:58:50,842
l hate this de auteur culture.

943
00:58:50,843 --> 00:58:53,843
So what's de auteur culture
for Tana Ferro?

944
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,548
Everything. Cinema, clothes,

945
00:58:56,549 --> 00:58:59,117
shoes... food, even wine nowadays.

946
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:01,053
What's wrong with you in Palermo...

947
00:59:01,054 --> 00:59:03,655
with your ''cruttons'' and ''tagglitelli''?

948
00:59:03,656 --> 00:59:05,791
And they've turned
a beautifulold quarter...

949
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:07,726
into a globalised dump.

950
00:59:07,727 --> 00:59:10,727
The otherday l went to eat in one of
those places with friends,

951
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:13,699
and we were met with a menu with
wonderful things, like...

952
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:15,667
macerated carpaccio,

953
00:59:15,668 --> 00:59:18,537
semolina with black sauce...

954
00:59:18,538 --> 00:59:20,505
and ginger, etc.

955
00:59:20,506 --> 00:59:23,375
Where does Cuervo get the money to
take her to places like that?

956
00:59:23,376 --> 00:59:25,010
-Keep quiet.
-Well, where...

957
00:59:25,011 --> 00:59:27,212
And then the "auteur" himself
appears and says:

958
00:59:27,213 --> 00:59:30,213
l macerated the carpaccio, then l
''drizzled'' on the black sauce,

959
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:33,483
and added grated ginger and nuts.

960
00:59:34,554 --> 00:59:37,055
but l'm not telling you...
''l got up,

961
00:59:37,056 --> 00:59:38,690
but l'm not telling you...
''l got up,

962
00:59:38,691 --> 00:59:41,026
Could you bring me...

963
00:59:41,027 --> 00:59:43,328
Could you bring me...

964
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:45,597
a fresh market garden salad,

965
00:59:45,598 --> 00:59:48,400
with freshly laid free-range eggs,
and a tomato,

966
00:59:48,401 --> 00:59:50,902
either a beef tomato or a plum tomato
but never a cherry?

967
00:59:50,903 --> 00:59:53,272
-What happened?
-l had to go somewhere else,

968
00:59:53,273 --> 00:59:56,008
where l ordered a mixed salad,
just lettuce, tomato and onion,

969
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:59,009
and a breaded beef cutlet, which is
basically a schnitzel, and l loved it.

970
00:59:59,245 --> 01:00:02,245
l was happy.

971
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:35,507
-Have a good day?
-Yes.

972
01:01:35,508 --> 01:01:37,209
Yeah, it was good.

973
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:39,378
-What did you do?
-Nothing... l went for a walk...

974
01:01:39,379 --> 01:01:42,379
and thought about
the programme for tomorrow.

975
01:01:42,482 --> 01:01:44,950
-Alone?
-Yes, alone.

976
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:47,951
Hey, come here,
l want to tell you something.

977
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:50,722
-Are you hungry?
-A little, you?

978
01:01:50,723 --> 01:01:53,723
Me too, but l couldn't cook.
Shall we order?

979
01:01:56,529 --> 01:01:58,630
-Pizza?
-OK.

980
01:01:58,631 --> 01:02:01,500
-Or something else.
-No, pizza.

981
01:02:01,501 --> 01:02:04,501
-Hello.
-Hello.

982
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:15,645
-Tana.
-Can l have a kiss?

983
01:02:17,917 --> 01:02:20,917
Give me a kiss.

984
01:02:25,758 --> 01:02:28,758
Tana...

985
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:47,913
Hang on a minute.
lt's my cellphone.

986
01:02:47,914 --> 01:02:49,614
-No, it's mine.
-No, it isn't. lt's mine.

987
01:02:49,615 --> 01:02:51,550
Yours doesn't sound like that,
it's my new one.

988
01:02:51,551 --> 01:02:52,918
Where did you get it?

989
01:02:52,919 --> 01:02:54,352
-They gave it me at the radio.
-When?

990
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:57,353
Just a minute and l'll tell you.
At the radio.

991
01:03:00,293 --> 01:03:03,293
-Everything OK?
-Yes.

992
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:08,700
-What's wrong?
-Nothing,

993
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:10,936
but l have
to leave in a while.

994
01:03:10,937 --> 01:03:12,904
-Hang on.
-But... What?

995
01:03:12,905 --> 01:03:15,307
-Tana, what are you hiding from me?
-Nothing.

996
01:03:15,308 --> 01:03:17,108
-Do you want to tell me something?
-No, why?

997
01:03:17,109 --> 01:03:19,311
-What are you laughing at?
-Atwhat you're asking me.

998
01:03:19,312 --> 01:03:21,580
-What do you want to know?
-Do you want to tell me something?

999
01:03:21,581 --> 01:03:23,782
No, nothing.

1000
01:03:23,783 --> 01:03:26,451
-Really?
-You make me laugh, that's all.

1001
01:03:26,452 --> 01:03:28,820
l'll be right back.

1002
01:03:28,821 --> 01:03:31,821
l'm on my way.

1003
01:04:12,798 --> 01:04:15,798
Over here!

1004
01:04:23,709 --> 01:04:26,709
Here's the list of things
about my wife.

1005
01:04:30,850 --> 01:04:33,652
-l'll go and get it.
-No... don't bother.

1006
01:04:33,653 --> 01:04:35,854
-l'll go and get it
-Don't worry.

1007
01:04:35,855 --> 01:04:38,855
There's no need.
l wanted to say...

1008
01:04:39,492 --> 01:04:42,227
l'm working on her very slowly...

1009
01:04:42,228 --> 01:04:45,228
l reckon... start thinking of
yourself as single again.

1010
01:04:46,332 --> 01:04:49,332
Thatwas quick, we'd said another week.

1011
01:04:49,835 --> 01:04:52,835
She's... Tana's a fine lass,
l don't want to push her, but...

1012
01:04:54,173 --> 01:04:56,541
Yes, start making plans.

1013
01:04:56,542 --> 01:04:59,542
ln a couple of days we'll be done.

1014
01:05:00,212 --> 01:05:03,212
-Why? Has something happened?
-Tenso...

1015
01:05:05,217 --> 01:05:08,217
No, sure, l...
No, as it's you...

1016
01:05:09,755 --> 01:05:12,057
You're beginning to realise...

1017
01:05:12,058 --> 01:05:14,392
what sort of girl she is, l suppose.

1018
01:05:14,393 --> 01:05:17,393
A great kid... but difficult...

1019
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:20,198
with a special sort of energy...

1020
01:05:20,199 --> 01:05:22,934
l contacted you because l couldn't...

1021
01:05:22,935 --> 01:05:25,935
l couldn't, not because...
what do you think?

1022
01:05:27,573 --> 01:05:28,940
l don't understand.

1023
01:05:28,941 --> 01:05:31,576
lt would help if at breakfast...

1024
01:05:31,577 --> 01:05:34,446
You made her a shake of...
make a note as this is essential...

1025
01:05:34,447 --> 01:05:37,447
pomegranate juice, paysion fruit and
coconut milk. First thing.

1026
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:39,918
-Passion fruit.
-Paysion fruit.

1027
01:05:39,919 --> 01:05:42,919
-No, passion fruit. No 'y'.
-Really? Oh.

1028
01:05:44,056 --> 01:05:46,524
No 'y'? OK, No 'y'.
A glass first thing.

1029
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:48,259
What's this for?

1030
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:52,697
Afruit, passion fruit.
Where can l get it?

1031
01:05:52,698 --> 01:05:54,099
Afruit, passion fruit.
Where can l get it?

1032
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:55,800
-l don't know, get back...
-You know.

1033
01:05:55,801 --> 01:05:57,602
Don't say l don't know.

1034
01:05:57,603 --> 01:05:59,037
-Where can l get passion fruit?
-What are you doing?

1035
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:00,639
-You are not answering!
-l don't knowwhere.

1036
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,641
-Where can l get passion fruit?
-What fruit?

1037
01:06:02,642 --> 01:06:05,410
-Passion fruit.
-ln Chinatown, go on, go on...

1038
01:06:05,411 --> 01:06:08,146
-ls it open?
-Yes, go on. Goal!

1039
01:06:08,147 --> 01:06:10,415
-Concentrate, are you mad?
-Why do you say that?

1040
01:06:10,416 --> 01:06:12,751
-How come you're not shadowing.
-You let it in, l saw you.

1041
01:06:12,752 --> 01:06:15,752
Excuse me, you've gone soft
in the bloody head.

1042
01:06:16,255 --> 01:06:18,123
Don't talkto me like that.

1043
01:06:18,124 --> 01:06:20,091
-Like what?
-l've never been rude to you.

1044
01:06:20,092 --> 01:06:23,092
-l've never called you a fat slob.
-Sensitive, aren't we, love?

1045
01:06:23,996 --> 01:06:26,996
Yeah, get lost.

1046
01:06:53,693 --> 01:06:56,693
-Morning.
-Hello.

1047
01:06:57,296 --> 01:07:00,296
-Hey, will you make me one?
-lt's for you.

1048
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:22,452
Sorry ifl pretend l haven't lostyou

1049
01:07:23,723 --> 01:07:26,723
lt hurts to accept thatyou're gone

1050
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:30,126
l can't getyou out ofmy mind.

1051
01:07:33,866 --> 01:07:36,866
One dayyou'll know
you're in myheart

1052
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:41,137
Life makes no sense

1053
01:07:41,373 --> 01:07:44,373
and l can die ifyou're not here.

1054
01:07:47,646 --> 01:07:50,646
l need you so much

1055
01:07:51,383 --> 01:07:54,383
lt hurts me to breathe

1056
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:57,920
Orperhaps in mydreams

1057
01:07:58,390 --> 01:08:01,390
l loveyou more and more

1058
01:08:01,727 --> 01:08:04,727
lt's raining stars

1059
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:08,164
ln ourroom

1060
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:11,667
They fill with tears...

1061
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:15,171
myheart

1062
01:08:16,008 --> 01:08:19,008
lt's raining stars

1063
01:08:19,445 --> 01:08:22,445
around me

1064
01:08:22,915 --> 01:08:25,915
andpeople ask

1065
01:08:26,185 --> 01:08:29,053
What's become ofyou...

1066
01:08:29,054 --> 01:08:32,054
what's become ofyou...

1067
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:37,527
l'd like to carryyou with me
and when the time comes

1068
01:08:39,098 --> 01:08:42,098
Get to the bottom ofyourfeelings

1069
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:45,535
To see ifyou feel the same way.

1070
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:50,575
No, no. Stop, no.

1071
01:08:50,576 --> 01:08:53,576
Blanca, l'm both very sociable
and very friendly.

1072
01:08:53,579 --> 01:08:56,579
l like birthdays, parties,
being with friends.

1073
01:08:56,816 --> 01:08:58,550
She's the complete opposite.
She doesn't like birthdays or parties.

1074
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:00,785
She doesn't like being with people,

1075
01:09:00,786 --> 01:09:03,321
so it's very hard on me, Blanca.

1076
01:09:03,322 --> 01:09:06,090
On top of that, Blanca,
l've got a wife who...

1077
01:09:06,091 --> 01:09:07,425
-Hold it a sec, hold it...
-No, let me get this out.

1078
01:09:07,426 --> 01:09:08,726
-l've got it here.
-Can you stop saying...?

1079
01:09:08,727 --> 01:09:11,095
Blanca this, Blanca that.
Blanca's not your aunt.

1080
01:09:11,096 --> 01:09:14,096
What are you, Blanca?
A psychologist?

1081
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:17,233
-Psychiatrist.
-Psychiatrist. Even more so.

1082
01:09:17,903 --> 01:09:20,471
So what should l say?

1083
01:09:20,472 --> 01:09:22,507
You say ''Blanca'' just once...

1084
01:09:22,508 --> 01:09:24,742
And we all knowthat this person here
is ''Blanca''.

1085
01:09:24,743 --> 01:09:26,744
OK, agreed.

1086
01:09:26,745 --> 01:09:28,780
Blanca, whatever you say.

1087
01:09:28,781 --> 01:09:31,249
-Do you knowwhat Kepelsky said?
-What did Kepelsky say?

1088
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,351
That he's going to pay Tana's salary.

1089
01:09:33,352 --> 01:09:36,352
He's got a few new sponsors so he
should be paying her.

1090
01:09:36,922 --> 01:09:39,922
Would you believe it?
There are times... hang on...

1091
01:09:43,095 --> 01:09:45,296
That really gets me,
we'd made a deal...

1092
01:09:45,297 --> 01:09:47,832
For the better? What are deals for?
To comply with.

1093
01:09:47,833 --> 01:09:49,767
For the better? What are deals for?
To comply with.

1094
01:09:49,768 --> 01:09:51,102
A girl comes along...

1095
01:09:51,103 --> 01:09:53,538
lt wasn't easy to get
that cash together. Coming!

1096
01:09:53,539 --> 01:09:56,539
Run, run!

1097
01:09:58,177 --> 01:09:59,944
Who hit me? Was it a goal?

1098
01:09:59,945 --> 01:10:01,646
-Are you alright?
-No, l'm not.

1099
01:10:01,647 --> 01:10:04,015
-Are you?
-Yes.

1100
01:10:04,016 --> 01:10:06,017
-Things OK?
-Let's carry on.

1101
01:10:06,018 --> 01:10:09,018
Come on, come on.

1102
01:10:09,355 --> 01:10:12,355
Tana!

1103
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:17,660
Tana, are you in?

1104
01:10:24,570 --> 01:10:27,171
Are you mad? Doyou know
how much we have in the bank?

1105
01:10:27,172 --> 01:10:28,873
-Yes, l know, l don't care.
-Yes, ofcourse.

1106
01:10:28,874 --> 01:10:30,975
You can'tpayoffan overdraft with a
cheque on the same account.

1107
01:10:30,976 --> 01:10:33,311
We have financialproblems,
what's so funny?

1108
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:35,480
lt's not that. We're young.
l don't want to worryabout that.

1109
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:37,649
Willyou carry on working with
yourdad although you hate it?

1110
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:39,217
You don'towe anything.
What's the problem?

1111
01:10:39,218 --> 01:10:41,419
-We owe the bank money.
-That's nobody.

1112
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:43,821
You want to open a shop of a thousand
lamps. Stop doing that!

1113
01:10:43,822 --> 01:10:45,990
-Not the end of the world?
-They're bits of coloured paper.

1114
01:10:45,991 --> 01:10:47,525
-Not the end of the world?
-They're bits of coloured paper.

1115
01:10:47,526 --> 01:10:49,160
Which l'm borrowing from my brother,
that's all.

1116
01:10:49,161 --> 01:10:51,029
-No, not your brother.
-OK.

1117
01:10:51,030 --> 01:10:54,030
Listen you say one thousand pesos and
six months in advance.

1118
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:56,334
-Athousand pesos...
-Athousand and six months in advance.

1119
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:59,037
Alright.

1120
01:10:59,038 --> 01:11:02,038
Great...

1121
01:11:06,879 --> 01:11:09,614
Forgive my interrupting butjust
listen to her. Listen.

1122
01:11:09,615 --> 01:11:12,615
l was in a similar situation
some years ago.

1123
01:11:12,885 --> 01:11:15,885
l listened to my wife and here l am.

1124
01:11:16,455 --> 01:11:18,523
What shall we do?

1125
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:20,858
What shall we do?
What shall we do, Tenso?

1126
01:11:20,859 --> 01:11:23,728
OK, do it, call them.

1127
01:11:23,729 --> 01:11:26,729
Great, congratulations.

1128
01:11:30,569 --> 01:11:33,569
-Tell me where he is!
-Let me go, l'll tell you.

1129
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:29,091
-Uh?
-l'm Flores.

1130
01:12:29,128 --> 01:12:32,128
Come with me.

1131
01:12:37,669 --> 01:12:40,104
Who grassed? Who was it?

1132
01:12:40,105 --> 01:12:43,105
No, Cuervo, nobody grassed.
Amilcar told me you were here.

1133
01:12:46,278 --> 01:12:48,112
-l hope it's notwhat l think.
-No, take it easy.

1134
01:12:48,113 --> 01:12:50,448
l'm pleased with your work.

1135
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:53,449
OK, we're here. Just go away and
forget you've been here.

1136
01:12:54,319 --> 01:12:56,287
-ls that clear?
-No, what l've come to say...

1137
01:12:56,288 --> 01:12:59,288
is ''it's over''.
No, l want you...

1138
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:02,458
to call it a day with the job.

1139
01:13:03,862 --> 01:13:06,862
l don't want to lose Tana, Cuervo.

1140
01:13:07,132 --> 01:13:09,300
l really...

1141
01:13:09,301 --> 01:13:12,036
am very grateful...

1142
01:13:12,037 --> 01:13:14,639
for all you've done,
because thanks to you,

1143
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,141
my life has changed 180 degrees.

1144
01:13:17,142 --> 01:13:19,877
She's started work,
she's happy, more content,

1145
01:13:19,878 --> 01:13:22,878
more of a woman... and that's
made me see her differently.

1146
01:13:23,382 --> 01:13:26,382
She's... she's changed, Cuervo.
She's another woman.

1147
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:30,653
And l'm in love with her
like the very first day.

1148
01:13:30,989 --> 01:13:33,989
What l mean is:
she's the woman of my life.

1149
01:13:45,504 --> 01:13:48,504
What's wrong?
What's up?

1150
01:13:48,707 --> 01:13:51,707
What's wrong?

1151
01:13:52,044 --> 01:13:54,011
Don't... don't...

1152
01:13:54,012 --> 01:13:56,380
Stand up, get this off...

1153
01:13:56,381 --> 01:13:59,283
What's wrong?

1154
01:13:59,284 --> 01:14:02,284
-l've fallen in love!
-Who with?

1155
01:14:02,354 --> 01:14:05,354
With Tana.

1156
01:14:05,624 --> 01:14:08,624
That hurts... a lot.

1157
01:14:11,964 --> 01:14:14,964
l didn't want to... l really didn't.

1158
01:14:16,735 --> 01:14:19,735
No, what you've told me is alright.

1159
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:22,940
lt can happen.

1160
01:14:22,941 --> 01:14:25,941
One of the risks of yourjob.

1161
01:14:28,914 --> 01:14:30,648
You'll leave off, right?

1162
01:14:30,649 --> 01:14:33,050
You've got a gem there. A gem.

1163
01:14:33,051 --> 01:14:36,051
You don't even deserve ten percent,
do you hear?

1164
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:39,388
But you're going to leave off,
aren't you?

1165
01:14:40,459 --> 01:14:43,459
l'll honour our agreement though.

1166
01:14:45,597 --> 01:14:48,597
l didn't like you when we met.
Now l know you better.

1167
01:14:49,101 --> 01:14:52,101
You're the biggest arsehole
l've ever met.

1168
01:14:52,804 --> 01:14:54,572
That's very nice of you,

1169
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:57,573
get it off your chest.

1170
01:14:58,944 --> 01:15:01,944
You'll be alright, because
you're an upright person.

1171
01:15:02,814 --> 01:15:05,814
With courage, strength and dedication
you'll be alright...

1172
01:15:07,085 --> 01:15:10,085
What doesn't kill you can only make
you stronger.

1173
01:15:34,813 --> 01:15:37,813
Tana?

1174
01:15:39,985 --> 01:15:42,687
-Hello.
-Hello.

1175
01:15:42,688 --> 01:15:44,989
-Hello.
-Hello.

1176
01:15:44,990 --> 01:15:47,024
-What?
-Nothing, sorry.

1177
01:15:47,025 --> 01:15:48,693
-What?
-Nothing, sorry.

1178
01:15:48,694 --> 01:15:51,395
l'm very confused.

1179
01:15:51,396 --> 01:15:54,065
Don't ask me to explain,
because l can't.

1180
01:15:54,066 --> 01:15:56,334
-My head's spinning.
-Confused in what way?

1181
01:15:56,335 --> 01:15:59,170
l don't want to fuck things up.
l'd rather leave.

1182
01:15:59,171 --> 01:16:02,139
-Confused? Why?
-Confused, l don't know.

1183
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:05,140
l feel l'm going to fuck it all up.
And l don't want to.

1184
01:16:06,578 --> 01:16:08,813
Why? What's up?
Why are you crying?

1185
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,481
-l'm not crying.
-You are crying.

1186
01:16:10,482 --> 01:16:13,482
My head's all over the place
and l'm... l don't know.

1187
01:16:14,253 --> 01:16:17,253
No, stop that. Leave that there.
Let's calm down.

1188
01:16:18,724 --> 01:16:21,724
-Has something happened?
-No.

1189
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:24,860
You're crying, Tana.

1190
01:16:25,364 --> 01:16:28,364
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.

1191
01:16:36,408 --> 01:16:39,408
l knowwhat's happening.

1192
01:16:41,046 --> 01:16:43,214
But it's all over now.

1193
01:16:43,215 --> 01:16:46,215
l'd be so happy if
l could thinkthat.

1194
01:16:46,618 --> 01:16:48,886
But... my love for you is not in doubt,

1195
01:16:48,887 --> 01:16:51,455
but... sorry, l'm very upset.

1196
01:16:51,456 --> 01:16:54,456
-l hate to have to do this.
-Tana.

1197
01:16:54,726 --> 01:16:57,726
Forgive me.

1198
01:16:57,863 --> 01:17:00,863
Come on.

1199
01:17:01,733 --> 01:17:03,434
l'm going to tell you something,
but you have to promise...

1200
01:17:03,435 --> 01:17:06,435
not to get angry and to listen to me.

1201
01:17:07,906 --> 01:17:10,906
-Yes?
-Yes.

1202
01:17:17,549 --> 01:17:20,549
Tana...

1203
01:17:22,788 --> 01:17:25,788
l contacted Cuervo Flores.

1204
01:17:26,925 --> 01:17:28,592
-Who?
-Cuervo Flores.

1205
01:17:28,593 --> 01:17:30,594
So we could make things up together.

1206
01:17:30,595 --> 01:17:32,330
What's Cuervo Flores got
to do with this?

1207
01:17:32,331 --> 01:17:35,331
Are you seeing Cuervo Flores?

1208
01:17:35,634 --> 01:17:37,935
How do you know l'm seeing
Cuervo Flores?

1209
01:17:37,936 --> 01:17:40,905
You're seeing him and...

1210
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:43,741
l asked him to do something.

1211
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:45,309
What did you ask him?

1212
01:17:45,310 --> 01:17:48,310
Things were not going well.

1213
01:17:49,114 --> 01:17:52,114
l thought by going to him
it would help things between us.

1214
01:17:52,517 --> 01:17:54,251
What for? What did you ask him?

1215
01:17:54,252 --> 01:17:57,252
l couldn't... it was impossible
for me to talk to you.

1216
01:17:57,322 --> 01:17:59,924
l... l didn't knowwhere to start,
l was...

1217
01:17:59,925 --> 01:18:02,026
What did you ask him? Tell me.

1218
01:18:02,027 --> 01:18:04,962
Things were bad between us and
we needed a change, didn't we?

1219
01:18:04,963 --> 01:18:07,031
Well, yes, l guess so. Yes.

1220
01:18:07,032 --> 01:18:09,333
We needed a change.
So l made a big mistake...

1221
01:18:09,334 --> 01:18:11,836
and asked him to take you out
a couple of times...

1222
01:18:11,837 --> 01:18:14,705
so l could make a decision l hadn't
been able to, and which...

1223
01:18:14,706 --> 01:18:17,508
You asked Cuervo Flores to seduce me?
ls that it?

1224
01:18:17,509 --> 01:18:19,777
-No.
-ls that what you did?

1225
01:18:19,778 --> 01:18:22,146
Answer me, because if you did
you're a fucking bastard.

1226
01:18:22,147 --> 01:18:23,981
-l didn't.
-You're lying!

1227
01:18:23,982 --> 01:18:26,450
-No, l'm not lying. l...
-Did you, yes or no?

1228
01:18:26,451 --> 01:18:28,018
-No!
-You bastard!

1229
01:18:28,019 --> 01:18:30,354
-No, no!
-You fucking bastard! You asked him to.

1230
01:18:30,355 --> 01:18:32,857
-No, no! The only thing l asked him...
-You're a bastard and a wanker.

1231
01:18:32,858 --> 01:18:35,858
No, l couldn't decide what to do
and l thought...

1232
01:18:36,228 --> 01:18:38,696
that if he took you out a fewtimes
it would make you reflect...

1233
01:18:38,697 --> 01:18:41,499
and together we'd be able
to sort things out between us.

1234
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:43,200
-That's it.
-You bloody idiot.

1235
01:18:43,201 --> 01:18:44,802
-And actually l didn't do too badly...
-You didn't do too badly?

1236
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:47,803
Just think...
you were moping round here,

1237
01:18:48,473 --> 01:18:50,408
-24 hours a day...
-You bloody idiot.

1238
01:18:50,409 --> 01:18:53,409
cursing me all day long from the time
you got up till you went to bed.

1239
01:18:53,678 --> 01:18:56,678
And thanks to me, you actually started
to work, yes or no?

1240
01:18:57,315 --> 01:18:58,983
-You bloody idiot.
-Yes or no?

1241
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:01,352
No, no, no! Thanks to the fact...

1242
01:19:01,353 --> 01:19:03,654
that l began to enjoy
working at the radio...

1243
01:19:03,655 --> 01:19:05,723
a guy who's always chatting me up,

1244
01:19:05,724 --> 01:19:08,724
a guy who's always chatting me up,

1245
01:19:09,094 --> 01:19:10,761
but whenever he wants to kiss me
l turn away,

1246
01:19:10,762 --> 01:19:13,762
because like an idiot l think
l could end up hurting you...

1247
01:19:14,533 --> 01:19:17,234
-What guy?
-Damian, does it matter?

1248
01:19:17,235 --> 01:19:19,937
Here, take this.
lt's worked out really well.

1249
01:19:19,938 --> 01:19:22,740
You're on your own. We've just split.

1250
01:19:22,741 --> 01:19:25,342
-Damian?
-Enjoy it.

1251
01:19:25,343 --> 01:19:26,877
Tana?

1252
01:19:26,878 --> 01:19:29,580
Tana, come back.
Tana, tell me about it.

1253
01:19:29,581 --> 01:19:32,581
Tana!

1254
01:19:38,590 --> 01:19:40,391
Morning, Tana. How are you?

1255
01:19:40,392 --> 01:19:43,294
To tell you the truth,
l feel pretty shitty,

1256
01:19:43,295 --> 01:19:46,230
with a strong urge to kill someone.

1257
01:19:46,231 --> 01:19:47,798
Who would you like to kill today?

1258
01:19:47,799 --> 01:19:50,799
All the cowards, or chickenshits
who have no character,

1259
01:19:51,736 --> 01:19:54,472
and who basically behave like
bastards.

1260
01:19:54,473 --> 01:19:57,473
So l'd like to dedicate
today's column...

1261
01:19:57,542 --> 01:20:00,211
to all those people who are able
to spend years...

1262
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:02,913
living with someone they don't love
but don't have the courage to admit it.

1263
01:20:02,914 --> 01:20:04,982
Those who can't be sincere
with another person,

1264
01:20:04,983 --> 01:20:07,218
to all those people who...

1265
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:10,219
can cook up pathetic, childish plans.

1266
01:20:11,323 --> 01:20:12,723
So if that description fits you,

1267
01:20:12,724 --> 01:20:14,625
please keep away from Tana Ferro.

1268
01:20:14,626 --> 01:20:17,626
l met a guy who was so uptight and
such a wanker...

1269
01:20:18,663 --> 01:20:20,798
listen to what he did...
it's unbelievable,

1270
01:20:20,799 --> 01:20:22,900
but it's a true story.

1271
01:20:22,901 --> 01:20:25,636
He hired a guy to seduce his wife...

1272
01:20:25,637 --> 01:20:28,472
and get her to leave him,
to avoid acting like a man.

1273
01:20:28,473 --> 01:20:31,473
lt's amazing but men like that exist.
Well, that's all for today.

1274
01:20:33,979 --> 01:20:36,979
So there we had Tana Ferro and
her special ''Mornings are not for me''.

1275
01:20:38,316 --> 01:20:41,316
Thanks, Tana.
And thanks to the hotel Tentaciones,

1276
01:20:41,453 --> 01:20:44,453
a hotel where couples can really get
to know each other.

1277
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:47,157
We'll be back.

1278
01:20:47,158 --> 01:20:50,158
Tana...

1279
01:20:52,364 --> 01:20:55,364
So you were already separated?

1280
01:20:56,434 --> 01:20:59,336
-No.
-Yes.

1281
01:20:59,337 --> 01:21:01,438
-And you're with...?
-l'm not with anybody.

1282
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:04,341
-l'm alone. That's all in the past.
-No, it isn't.

1283
01:21:04,342 --> 01:21:07,342
And since we're both here...

1284
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:11,715
we should both tell the truth.

1285
01:21:11,716 --> 01:21:13,150
-Right?
-Of course.

1286
01:21:13,151 --> 01:21:16,120
-We should be frank, right?
-Of course.

1287
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:17,555
So l need you to tell me...

1288
01:21:17,556 --> 01:21:19,957
if you slept
with that guy Kepelsky or not.

1289
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:21,792
-Yes, l slept with him.
-Tell the truth.

1290
01:21:21,793 --> 01:21:24,161
l slept with him.
lt was after we split, of course.

1291
01:21:24,162 --> 01:21:25,963
-Tell the truth, no, tell the truth.
-OK.

1292
01:21:25,964 --> 01:21:27,865
-He's like this all the time...
-lf we go on like this...

1293
01:21:27,866 --> 01:21:29,300
-He's like this all the time...
-lf we go on like this...

1294
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:30,534
l'm not going to talk anymore.

1295
01:21:30,535 --> 01:21:33,535
lf you refuse to tell the truth...
it makes things very hard.

1296
01:21:33,805 --> 01:21:35,673
This is a joke, Blanca.

1297
01:21:35,674 --> 01:21:38,674
Well, of course it's a joke.

1298
01:21:41,479 --> 01:21:44,479
What l will say,
and that's why l came...

1299
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:47,983
is that in the last 2 years...

1300
01:21:48,753 --> 01:21:50,220
l've felt very lonely.

1301
01:21:50,221 --> 01:21:53,221
l'm not talking about a day, a week
or a month, but 2 years.

1302
01:21:56,261 --> 01:21:59,261
Because when the person you choose
to spend your life with...

1303
01:21:59,864 --> 01:22:02,864
to have a family with...
to keep you company,

1304
01:22:05,337 --> 01:22:08,337
starts making things difficult...

1305
01:22:08,573 --> 01:22:11,573
it's not very pleasant for anyone,
at least not for me.

1306
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:18,280
And when l tried...

1307
01:22:19,384 --> 01:22:22,384
to change things, l fantasised
about us becoming parents.

1308
01:22:25,890 --> 01:22:28,890
l would've like to hear that,
but you never said it.

1309
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:34,231
-Did l never tell you?
-You never said so.

1310
01:22:34,232 --> 01:22:36,133
No, just a moment...
That's not true, no.

1311
01:22:36,134 --> 01:22:38,369
No, just a moment...
That's not true, no.

1312
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:40,237
Tell the truth. Don't lie.
What's the doctor going to say,

1313
01:22:41,573 --> 01:22:43,207
-So we never spoke?
-Never.

1314
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:46,208
OK. Fine. Even so you had no right...

1315
01:22:47,312 --> 01:22:50,312
to give up and spend all day indoors...

1316
01:22:50,915 --> 01:22:52,750
Tana...

1317
01:22:52,751 --> 01:22:55,751
lt was too much, wasn't it?

1318
01:22:57,722 --> 01:23:00,424
Alright, l acted badly,

1319
01:23:00,425 --> 01:23:02,059
but what l did turned out
pretty well for you.

1320
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:05,060
but what l did turned out
pretty well for you.

1321
01:23:06,331 --> 01:23:09,166
You got going again.
You see, Blanca?

1322
01:23:09,167 --> 01:23:12,167
Well... look at her.
Look at yourself. You're more beautiful,

1323
01:23:13,338 --> 01:23:15,939
you feel better.

1324
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:18,940
So what l did... to a certain extent...
didn't go too badly...

1325
01:23:21,980 --> 01:23:24,980
You never knew the talent you had
to do things.

1326
01:23:27,085 --> 01:23:30,085
And when you began to change,

1327
01:23:33,591 --> 01:23:36,591
l fell in love with you
all over again.

1328
01:23:38,196 --> 01:23:40,831
l began to feel what l had felt
at the very beginning...

1329
01:23:40,832 --> 01:23:43,832
when we started going out together,

1330
01:23:48,473 --> 01:23:51,473
and l wanted to stop everything,
Tana, but couldn't.

1331
01:23:54,012 --> 01:23:57,012
lt could happen to anyone.

1332
01:23:58,116 --> 01:24:01,116
That's why l say...

1333
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:09,458
lf you still love me, l'm here.

1334
01:24:15,734 --> 01:24:18,734
l want you to come backto me.

1335
01:24:21,973 --> 01:24:24,973
l want you at my side again.

1336
01:24:27,979 --> 01:24:30,979
How does that sound to you, Tana?

1337
01:24:36,654 --> 01:24:39,654
l don't know. The thing is that...

1338
01:24:40,558 --> 01:24:43,558
l don't know. l had no problem
with him, honestly.

1339
01:24:44,996 --> 01:24:46,997
l mean...

1340
01:24:46,998 --> 01:24:49,998
l was in a bad way, obviously.
And...

1341
01:24:52,070 --> 01:24:55,070
l just don't know. l still loved you,

1342
01:24:57,509 --> 01:25:00,509
but other things that don't include
you have happened to me.

1343
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:04,615
l always thought that at 30...

1344
01:25:04,616 --> 01:25:07,616
l would be settled professionally,

1345
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,687
at ease with myself,

1346
01:25:10,688 --> 01:25:13,524
but perhaps
it's onlyjust happening.

1347
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:16,525
l'm sorry, l know you would've
liked it to happen earlier...

1348
01:25:16,728 --> 01:25:19,530
Well... it's late, l don't know.

1349
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:22,531
But l'm not that old, 30 something.

1350
01:25:23,301 --> 01:25:26,301
But maybe it's only now
l can start thinking...

1351
01:25:26,404 --> 01:25:29,404
or could have started thinking
about having kids,

1352
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:32,309
although l haven't the slightest idea
about how to work a microwave,

1353
01:25:32,310 --> 01:25:35,310
let alone look after a kid,

1354
01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:38,980
but... l could've started thinking.

1355
01:25:42,387 --> 01:25:45,387
Uh... perhaps l see things
differently to him.

1356
01:25:45,723 --> 01:25:48,723
l don't think people can be happy
all the time,

1357
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:52,260
least of all couples.

1358
01:25:54,132 --> 01:25:56,733
But it's not very brave...

1359
01:25:56,734 --> 01:25:59,734
to run off
after the first little crisis.

1360
01:26:03,508 --> 01:26:05,742
What l liked
about being married to you...

1361
01:26:05,743 --> 01:26:08,743
is that l thought...
l was the one in everything,

1362
01:26:11,449 --> 01:26:14,449
even with my screwed up personality,

1363
01:26:15,987 --> 01:26:18,987
with the swearing, the cellulitis...

1364
01:26:19,123 --> 01:26:22,123
with all that is bad in me.

1365
01:26:22,527 --> 01:26:24,928
Or l thought you did.

1366
01:26:24,929 --> 01:26:27,929
Or l thought you did.

1367
01:26:32,470 --> 01:26:35,470
But, well, l was wrong.

1368
01:26:38,343 --> 01:26:40,544
And now you talk about sex...

1369
01:26:40,545 --> 01:26:42,346
l'd never thought that it was
that important.

1370
01:26:42,347 --> 01:26:45,347
lt's only now l see
how important it is.

1371
01:26:46,484 --> 01:26:49,484
Love for me was being able to...

1372
01:26:49,954 --> 01:26:51,889
l feel ashamed to say this, but...

1373
01:26:51,890 --> 01:26:54,890
sitting on the sofa reading
the Sunday paper...

1374
01:26:55,059 --> 01:26:57,995
l thought that was part
of being in love...

1375
01:26:57,996 --> 01:26:59,863
Or taking you a tea
when you were ill in bed.

1376
01:26:59,864 --> 01:27:02,864
Me too.

1377
01:27:05,036 --> 01:27:06,837
l imagine you must have formed...

1378
01:27:06,838 --> 01:27:09,473
some ideas about yourself too, right?

1379
01:27:09,474 --> 01:27:12,474
Your fears? l don't know.

1380
01:27:14,212 --> 01:27:16,914
Why the surprise? What fears?

1381
01:27:16,915 --> 01:27:18,815
Why that shocked expression?
l don't get it.

1382
01:27:18,816 --> 01:27:21,816
-l'm not shocked.
-But... l never ever criticised you.

1383
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:28,990
Fear of everything,
of losing your business, of your dad,

1384
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:31,595
of me, because you did all this
for a reason.

1385
01:27:31,596 --> 01:27:33,864
Fear of fear, because you're a coward.

1386
01:27:33,865 --> 01:27:36,366
Fear paralyses you...

1387
01:27:36,367 --> 01:27:37,567
and makes you do
those dumb things you do...

1388
01:27:37,568 --> 01:27:40,170
l don't know if you sawwhat he does
with his tongue, Blanca,

1389
01:27:40,171 --> 01:27:43,171
that drives me crazy.

1390
01:27:53,418 --> 01:27:56,418
l can't say any more because
l'm very angry.

1391
01:27:59,958 --> 01:28:02,125
lt helps me to speak, to understand
what our problems are...

1392
01:28:02,126 --> 01:28:05,126
lt helps me to speak, to understand
what our problems are...

1393
01:28:05,263 --> 01:28:07,898
or were,

1394
01:28:07,899 --> 01:28:10,899
although we can't do anything
about it now. lt helps me.

1395
01:28:14,238 --> 01:28:17,238
Well...

1396
01:28:17,742 --> 01:28:20,742
ln that case...
you'll have to try...

1397
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:24,379
to retain the
good times you did have...

1398
01:28:25,616 --> 01:28:28,085
that you surely did have...

1399
01:28:28,086 --> 01:28:31,086
and separate on the best terms.

1400
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:38,760
Excuse me.

1401
01:28:40,631 --> 01:28:43,433
Yes, l...

1402
01:28:43,434 --> 01:28:46,434
lt'd be important for me...

1403
01:28:46,671 --> 01:28:49,671
to have another session,
what do you say?

1404
01:28:52,610 --> 01:28:54,911
Why not take a few days...

1405
01:28:54,912 --> 01:28:57,912
to think it over before you ring me?

1406
01:29:00,618 --> 01:29:03,618
-No, l don't know.
-OK.

1407
01:29:04,022 --> 01:29:06,590
How much do l owe you?

1408
01:29:06,591 --> 01:29:09,591
-240.
-How much?

1409
01:29:11,329 --> 01:29:13,196
How much?

1410
01:29:13,197 --> 01:29:16,197
240. Those are my fees.

1411
01:29:16,334 --> 01:29:19,334
-Have you got...?
-Yes, l do, wait.

1412
01:29:19,804 --> 01:29:22,172
-Have you got anything?
-What, don't you have it?

1413
01:29:22,173 --> 01:29:24,875
Yes, but l don't know if it's enough.

1414
01:29:24,876 --> 01:29:27,876
How much have you got?

1415
01:29:29,180 --> 01:29:31,481
l've got 200 here.

1416
01:29:31,482 --> 01:29:34,482
-l've got 100. Let me have that.
-Hey, hang on, Tenso.

1417
01:30:43,921 --> 01:30:45,922
Hello.

1418
01:30:45,923 --> 01:30:48,923
Hello?

1419
01:31:10,882 --> 01:31:13,882
What do you want?

1420
01:31:14,619 --> 01:31:17,619
l wanted to know how you were.

1421
01:31:22,660 --> 01:31:25,660
l received the summons.

1422
01:31:25,830 --> 01:31:28,830
You knew it was coming.

1423
01:31:31,602 --> 01:31:34,602
Yes, l knew.

1424
01:31:34,839 --> 01:31:37,774
l thought you were going to warn me.

1425
01:31:37,775 --> 01:31:40,775
Yes, l warned you.

1426
01:31:45,616 --> 01:31:48,616
l imagined you were going
to act differently.

1427
01:31:56,260 --> 01:31:59,260
lt hurts...

1428
01:32:05,503 --> 01:32:08,503
-l have to sign...
-Yes... then we all sign.

1429
01:32:09,607 --> 01:32:12,607
We'll worry about that
at the end ofthe hearing.

1430
01:32:13,945 --> 01:32:16,945
-Do we sign together?
-Yes, all together.

1431
01:32:18,616 --> 01:32:20,984
-Polsky and Ferro.
-But if l don't...

1432
01:32:20,985 --> 01:32:22,953
Polsky and Ferro.

1433
01:32:22,954 --> 01:32:25,954
The secretary's a little late.
Come back in two hours.

1434
01:32:26,524 --> 01:32:29,524
-What did he say?
-The secretary's a little late...

1435
01:32:30,561 --> 01:32:33,561
-Has it been postponed?
-No... it hasn't.

1436
01:32:34,632 --> 01:32:37,632
Where are you going?

1437
01:32:42,807 --> 01:32:45,807
What?

1438
01:32:47,411 --> 01:32:50,411
-Are you staying?
-Yes.

1439
01:32:58,322 --> 01:33:01,322
-You can't smoke here, can you?
-l don't know. Smoke if you want.

1440
01:33:26,183 --> 01:33:29,183
l'll be back.

1441
01:33:39,463 --> 01:33:42,463
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

1442
01:33:45,102 --> 01:33:48,102
-Yes?
-A ham and cheese roll.

1443
01:33:48,239 --> 01:33:50,440
There's no cold meat left.
Something sweet?

1444
01:33:50,441 --> 01:33:53,441
No, thanks.
A coffee when you can.

1445
01:34:02,053 --> 01:34:05,053
Excuse me... can l?

1446
01:34:05,222 --> 01:34:08,222
Of course.

1447
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:12,160
Want some?

1448
01:34:13,431 --> 01:34:15,799

-Yes, l'll have some.
-Ah...

1451
01:34:37,588 --> 01:34:40,588
How long to go?

1452
01:34:41,992 --> 01:34:44,828
-An hour.
-An hour?

1453
01:34:44,829 --> 01:34:47,829
That's a lot.

1454
01:34:52,937 --> 01:34:55,937
What shall we do?

1455
01:34:59,110 --> 01:35:02,110
That always happens.

1456
01:35:12,890 --> 01:35:15,890
-Shall we talk?
-Let's talk.

1457
01:35:18,162 --> 01:35:19,496
How are things? Are you well?

1458
01:35:19,497 --> 01:35:22,497
-Diego ''Tenso'' Polsky.
-''Tana'' Ferro, pleased to meet you.

1459
01:35:22,533 --> 01:35:25,533
-How are you?
-At your service.

1460
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:37,647
Polsky, Ferro.

1461
01:35:37,648 --> 01:35:40,648
Polsky, Ferro.

1462
01:35:41,385 --> 01:35:44,385

01:37:25,689 --> 01:37:28,689
Stop, stop...!

1466
01:37:38,202 --> 01:37:41,202
l didn't know what l was doing.

1467
01:37:49,146 --> 01:37:52,146
What a surprise!

1468
01:38:17,641 --> 01:38:19,576
People are looking... they're staring.

1469
01:38:19,577 --> 01:38:22,577
They pay their taxes, that's all...

1470
01:38:25,249 --> 01:38:28,249
Forgive me, forgive me...
