1
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:51,472
<i>I want to go over
to my place...</i>

2
00:03:51,605 --> 00:03:54,888
<i>and start,
you know, getting it on...</i>

3
00:03:55,022 --> 00:03:56,978
<i>I was terrible.</i>

4
00:03:57,106 --> 00:03:57,971
<i>Yeah?</i>

5
00:03:58,107 --> 00:04:00,144
<i>Did you ever, uh...
take ballet?</i>

6
00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:01,222
<i>Be thankful.</i>

7
00:04:01,358 --> 00:04:04,143
<i>Do you have
a quarter for them?</i>

8
00:04:04,275 --> 00:04:05,851
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

9
00:04:28,406 --> 00:04:29,982
<i>Well, what about me?</i>

10
00:04:32,156 --> 00:04:34,148
<i>You'll see.</i>

11
00:04:34,283 --> 00:04:36,569
<i>A lot of fun you are.</i>

12
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,441
<i>You're supposed
to tease me...</i>

13
00:04:38,575 --> 00:04:40,483
<i>give me hints,
make me guess, you know.</i>

14
00:04:55,705 --> 00:04:57,363
<i>Oh, look.
That's terrible.</i>

15
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:00,068
<i>He's not
hurting anyone.</i>

16
00:05:03,248 --> 00:05:04,824
<i>Neither are we.</i>

17
00:05:05,915 --> 00:05:06,946
<i>Oh, God.</i>

18
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:10,414
<i>Every time I see
one of those old guys...</i>

19
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:13,113
<i>I always think
the same thing.</i>

20
00:05:13,251 --> 00:05:15,206
<i>What do you think?</i>

21
00:05:15,335 --> 00:05:17,076
<i>I always think...</i>

22
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:20,244
<i>that he was once
somebody's baby boy.</i>

23
00:05:20,377 --> 00:05:21,752
<i>Really, I do.</i>

24
00:05:21,878 --> 00:05:24,747
<i>I think he was once
somebody's baby boy...</i>

25
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:27,498
<i>and he had a mother
and a father who loved him...</i>

26
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,419
<i>and now there he is...</i>

27
00:05:29,546 --> 00:05:31,123
<i>half dead
on a park bench...</i>

28
00:05:31,256 --> 00:05:33,745
<i>and where are
his mother or his father...</i>

29
00:05:33,881 --> 00:05:35,919
<i>all his uncles now?</i>

30
00:05:36,048 --> 00:05:39,166
<i>Anyway, that's
what I always think.</i>

31
00:05:39,299 --> 00:05:41,669
How's he
doing up there?

32
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,755
<i>When they had
the newspaper strike...</i>

33
00:05:43,883 --> 00:05:46,207
We're gettin' better than 40%.

34
00:05:46,343 --> 00:05:48,499
How about second position?

35
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,924
It's not so good.

36
00:06:11,682 --> 00:06:14,634
Uh-oh. What
have we here?

37
00:06:14,766 --> 00:06:17,718
Come on, babies,
wet your lips there.

38
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,224
Give me some tongue.

39
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,725
Just a little tongue.

40
00:06:20,851 --> 00:06:22,013
Come on.

41
00:06:24,936 --> 00:06:27,935
How about a nice
wet French kiss now?

42
00:06:28,062 --> 00:06:30,432
Come on.
A nice wet one.

43
00:06:30,562 --> 00:06:32,518
Pay attention
to your recordings.

44
00:06:35,438 --> 00:06:37,310
She's coming in
loud and clear.

45
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,810
<i>Look, Mark.
Do you see him?</i>

46
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,476
<i>The man with the hearing aid
like Charles.</i>

47
00:06:42,607 --> 00:06:44,479
<i>There with
the shopping bag.</i>

48
00:06:44,607 --> 00:06:46,479
Well, that's it for Paul.

49
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:47,982
They spotted him.

50
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,601
Give me the phones.

51
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:52,981
<i>He's been following us all around.</i>

52
00:06:53,109 --> 00:06:55,645
<i>It's nothing. Don't worry about it.</i>

53
00:06:55,777 --> 00:06:58,526
<i>We're spending too much time
together here.</i>

54
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:00,525
<i>No. Let's stay
just a little longer.</i>

55
00:07:23,784 --> 00:07:25,158
I got burned, Harry.

56
00:07:25,284 --> 00:07:26,659
She looked at me.

57
00:07:26,785 --> 00:07:28,159
I know. We heard.

58
00:07:28,285 --> 00:07:29,660
Oh, did we hear.

59
00:07:29,786 --> 00:07:32,026
What do you think?

60
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:35,448
I got some
good pieces, maybe 25%.

61
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,822
Paul, I'll call you
in a couple days...

62
00:07:42,955 --> 00:07:44,283
if I need you.

63
00:07:44,414 --> 00:07:47,283
Paul, you going
to the convention tomorrow?

64
00:07:47,415 --> 00:07:48,280
You bet.

65
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,537
Hey, how about
you, Harry?

66
00:07:50,624 --> 00:07:51,655
Yeah. Maybe.

67
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:54,625
Little party like we did
two years ago?

68
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,615
Huh?

69
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,948
Hey, Stan?

70
00:07:57,084 --> 00:07:58,458
See you, Harry.

71
00:07:58,584 --> 00:07:59,580
Okay.

72
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,575
Here.

73
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,288
He's a nice guy
for a cop.

74
00:08:10,421 --> 00:08:11,914
<i>You go.</i>

75
00:08:12,047 --> 00:08:14,203
<i>I'll stay here a while.</i>

76
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:17,207
Who's interested
in these two anyway?

77
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:19,710
I don't know for sure.

78
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,215
The Justice Department?

79
00:08:21,341 --> 00:08:22,964
No.

80
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:25,331
I figure it must be
the Infernal Revenue.

81
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:28,335
Their tapes always
put me to sleep.

82
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:31,300
Since when are you
here to be entertained?

83
00:08:31,426 --> 00:08:34,129
Sometimes it's nice to know
what they're talking about.

84
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,128
I don't care what
they're talking about.

85
00:08:37,261 --> 00:08:40,544
All I want is
a nice, fat recording.

86
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:45,902
Hello, Mr. Caul.

87
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:48,730
And happy birthday.

88
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,912
Happy birthday, Harry.

89
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:37,739
Happy birthday.

90
00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:14,001
Hello.

91
00:11:14,135 --> 00:11:16,173
Hello, uh,
Mrs. Evangelista?

92
00:11:16,302 --> 00:11:17,167
Uh, yes.

93
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,708
This is Harry Caul
from upstairs.

94
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,800
Uh, uh...

95
00:11:21,928 --> 00:11:22,959
Yes.

96
00:11:23,095 --> 00:11:24,374
Well...

97
00:11:24,512 --> 00:11:26,089
Thank you very much.

98
00:11:26,221 --> 00:11:27,085
Thank you.

99
00:11:27,221 --> 00:11:28,845
Uh-huh.

100
00:11:28,972 --> 00:11:31,378
Yes, well,
you're really very nice.

101
00:11:31,472 --> 00:11:33,380
Yes.

102
00:11:33,473 --> 00:11:34,670
Uh, but...

103
00:11:34,807 --> 00:11:36,430
I know, uh...

104
00:11:36,557 --> 00:11:39,306
Yes, I found it. Yes.

105
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:42,846
But what I wanted to talk
to you about was, uh...

106
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,974
How did you put it
in the apartment?

107
00:11:46,101 --> 00:11:48,507
Uh-huh.

108
00:11:48,643 --> 00:11:50,385
Right.

109
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:53,678
Well, what about the alarm?

110
00:11:55,062 --> 00:11:56,471
Oh, you did?

111
00:12:00,313 --> 00:12:01,178
Well...

112
00:12:01,313 --> 00:12:02,178
uh...

113
00:12:02,313 --> 00:12:05,182
I thought I had
the only key.

114
00:12:05,314 --> 00:12:06,262
Uh-huh.

115
00:12:08,731 --> 00:12:11,813
Well, what emergency
could possibly...

116
00:12:11,941 --> 00:12:13,315
All right.

117
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:14,306
Yes.

118
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:17,310
Well, see, I would
be perfectly happy...

119
00:12:17,442 --> 00:12:19,813
to have all
my personal things...

120
00:12:19,943 --> 00:12:21,815
burned up in a fire...

121
00:12:21,944 --> 00:12:24,314
because I don't
have anything personal.

122
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:25,819
Nothing of value.

123
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,817
Nothing personal
except my keys...

124
00:12:27,945 --> 00:12:31,146
which I would like
to have the only copy of...

125
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,309
Mrs. Evangelista.

126
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,978
Mrs. Evangelista...

127
00:12:36,114 --> 00:12:38,982
how'd you know
it was my birthday?

128
00:12:39,114 --> 00:12:41,485
Nah. I don't remember
telling you.

129
00:12:41,615 --> 00:12:45,824
Would you like to take
a guess how old I am?

130
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:48,818
44. Well,
that's a very good guess.

131
00:12:48,951 --> 00:12:50,324
Mrs. Evangelista...

132
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:55,572
as of today, my mail
will go to a post office box...

133
00:12:55,703 --> 00:12:58,571
with a combination on it
and no keys.

134
00:12:58,703 --> 00:12:59,651
Goodbye.

135
00:14:19,182 --> 00:14:20,426
Morning, Harry.

136
00:14:20,557 --> 00:14:21,422
Morning.

137
00:14:21,558 --> 00:14:23,216
There's an article
in here...

138
00:14:23,349 --> 00:14:24,428
about the convention.

139
00:14:24,558 --> 00:14:25,932
It mentions your name.

140
00:14:26,058 --> 00:14:27,931
You're one
of the notables...

141
00:14:28,059 --> 00:14:29,433
who's going
tomorrow night.

142
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:31,929
I told them
I'd be there.

143
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,470
Listen to this here.

144
00:14:34,685 --> 00:14:36,143
Listen.

145
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,640
"Among those
pre-eminent in the field...

00:14:48,815 --> 00:14:52,394
Listen to this.

153
00:14:52,523 --> 00:14:55,143

will be William P. Moran...

Since when did William P. Moran
of Detroit, Michigan...

156
00:14:59,609 --> 00:15:01,434
become pre-eminent
in the field?

157
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,440
Oh, he's very big there.

158
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:05,310
You want some coffee?

159
00:15:07,652 --> 00:15:10,023
He's the guy
that told Chrysler...

160
00:15:10,153 --> 00:15:13,235
that Cadillac was
getting rid of its fins.

161
00:15:13,362 --> 00:15:14,642
It was a while ago...

162
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:17,778
but it was a big thing
at the time.

00:16:28,548 --> 00:16:32,128
<i>I don't know what I'm going

182
00:17:02,015 --> 00:17:03,555
<i>Well, what about me?</i>

183
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:06,680
<i>You'll see.</i>

184
00:17:06,807 --> 00:17:09,676
<i>Whoo! A lot of fun
you are.</i>

185
00:17:09,808 --> 00:17:11,681
<i>You're supposed
to tease me...</i>

186
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:13,183

187
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:15,182

188
00:17:15,311 --> 00:17:16,684
<i>Does it bother you?</i>

189
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:17,675
<i>What?</i>

190
00:17:17,811 --> 00:17:19,718
<i>Walking around
in circles.</i>

191
00:17:21,978 --> 00:17:25,392
<i>Oh, look. That's terrible.</i>

192
00:17:25,521 --> 00:17:27,393
<i>He's not hurting anyone.</i>

<i>Every time I see one

196
00:17:47,527 --> 00:17:50,146
<i>Every time I see one
of those old guys...</i>

197
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,767
<i>I always think
the same thing.</i>

198
00:17:52,903 --> 00:17:54,277
<i>What do you think?</i>

199
00:17:54,403 --> 00:17:58,564
<i>I always think he was once
somebody's baby boy.</i>

200
00:17:58,696 --> 00:18:00,319
<i>No, really, I do.</i>

201
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:03,315
<i>I think he was once
somebody's baby boy...</i>

202
00:18:03,447 --> 00:18:06,114
<i>and he had
a mother and a father...</i>

203
00:18:06,239 --> 00:18:07,614
<i>who loved him...</i>

204
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,605
<i>and now there he is...</i>

205
00:18:08,741 --> 00:18:10,364
<i>half dead
on a park bench...</i>

206
00:18:10,491 --> 00:18:12,861
<i>and where are his
mother or his father...</i>

207
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,366
<i>all his uncles now?</i>

208
00:18:14,492 --> 00:18:18,023
<i>Anyway, that's what
I always think.</i>

209
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:22,024
<i>I always think how, when
they had the newspaper strike...</i>

210
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,447
<i>more of those
old guys died.</i>

211
00:18:24,577 --> 00:18:28,193
<i>50 of them froze
to death in one night.</i>

212
00:19:06,421 --> 00:19:07,287
Good afternoon.

213
00:19:07,422 --> 00:19:08,796
May I help you?

214
00:19:08,922 --> 00:19:11,837
Yes.
Extension 746, please.

215
00:19:11,964 --> 00:19:13,375
One moment, please.

216
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:15,955
Director's office.

217
00:19:16,091 --> 00:19:18,414
Uh, yes,
this is Mr. Caul.

218
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:21,966
I have the material.

219
00:19:22,092 --> 00:19:23,964
I'm calling
for an appointment.

220
00:19:24,093 --> 00:19:25,123
I'm sorry.

221
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,128
The director has already
left for the day.

222
00:19:28,261 --> 00:19:29,967
We'll call you back
tomorrow morning.

223
00:19:30,094 --> 00:19:32,465
May I have
your telephone number, please?

224
00:19:32,595 --> 00:19:33,969
I'm at a payphone...

225
00:19:34,095 --> 00:19:36,466
and I don't have
a home telephone.

226
00:19:36,596 --> 00:19:38,339
Hold on
one moment, please.

227
00:19:44,598 --> 00:19:45,463
Mr. Caul?

228
00:19:45,598 --> 00:19:46,463
Yes?

229
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:47,973
2:30 tomorrow afternoon.

230
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:49,474
2:30 in
the afternoon?

231
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,468
Is that
payment in full?

232
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,010
Whatever was arranged.

233
00:19:55,601 --> 00:19:56,975
Thank you very much.

234
00:19:57,101 --> 00:19:58,429
I'll be there.

235
00:21:16,914 --> 00:21:17,778
Harry?

236
00:21:17,913 --> 00:21:18,779
Hello, Amy.

237
00:21:18,914 --> 00:21:22,162
I didn't think
you were coming.

238
00:21:26,207 --> 00:21:29,621
I brought
some wine, um...

239
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,618
someone gave me
as a birthday present.

240
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:37,335
I didn't know
it was your birthday.

241
00:21:37,461 --> 00:21:38,834
You want some?

242
00:21:38,961 --> 00:21:39,991
Yeah.

243
00:21:40,128 --> 00:21:41,407
I do.

244
00:21:52,298 --> 00:21:54,205
How old are you,
Harry?

245
00:21:56,423 --> 00:21:57,454
42.

246
00:22:02,091 --> 00:22:02,956
Sweet.

247
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,630
Does something special
happen between us...

248
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,134
on your birthday?

249
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,754
Like what?

250
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:14,593
Something personal.

251
00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:19,091
What?

252
00:22:20,471 --> 00:22:23,304
Like, uh, telling me
about yourself...

253
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,587
your secrets.

254
00:22:42,477 --> 00:22:44,384
I don't have any secrets.

255
00:22:47,812 --> 00:22:49,849
I'm your secret.

256
00:22:49,979 --> 00:22:51,852
You do have
secrets, Harry.

257
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,259
I know you do.

258
00:22:53,396 --> 00:22:54,345
No.

259
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,352
Sometimes
you come over here...

260
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,353
and you don't tell me.

261
00:22:58,481 --> 00:23:01,349
Once I saw you
up by the staircase...

262
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:02,346
hiding...

263
00:23:02,482 --> 00:23:04,106
watching...

264
00:23:04,233 --> 00:23:06,188
for a whole hour.

265
00:23:11,067 --> 00:23:14,434
You think you're going
to catch me at something.

266
00:23:14,568 --> 00:23:16,110
You know?

267
00:23:16,236 --> 00:23:19,436
I know. A woman
can always tell.

268
00:23:21,154 --> 00:23:24,686
You have a certain way
of opening the door.

269
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,523
First the key
goes in real quiet...

270
00:23:29,656 --> 00:23:32,524
and then the door
comes open real fast...

271
00:23:32,656 --> 00:23:35,655
like you think you'll
catch me at something.

272
00:23:48,411 --> 00:23:51,279
Sometimes I even think
you're listening to me...

273
00:23:51,411 --> 00:23:54,196
when I'm talking
on the telephone.

274
00:23:55,704 --> 00:23:57,577
What are you
talking about?

275
00:23:57,705 --> 00:23:59,079
I don't know.

276
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:00,580
I just feel it.

277
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:02,282
Really, I do.

278
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:21,452
Why are
you singing that?

279
00:24:22,877 --> 00:24:24,288
It's pretty.

280
00:24:32,714 --> 00:24:34,171
What's the matter?

281
00:24:34,297 --> 00:24:35,790
Nothing.

282
00:24:35,881 --> 00:24:38,287
It's just that, uh...

283
00:24:38,423 --> 00:24:41,375
somebody else
was singing that today.

284
00:24:41,507 --> 00:24:43,083
A girl?

285
00:24:43,216 --> 00:24:44,378
Yes.

286
00:24:44,508 --> 00:24:45,670
Who is she?

287
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,174
No. No. It isn't...

288
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,166
I'm jealous.

289
00:24:48,301 --> 00:24:49,165
No.

290
00:24:49,301 --> 00:24:50,675
Just somebody at work...

291
00:24:50,802 --> 00:24:52,259
and she, uh...

292
00:24:54,178 --> 00:24:56,050
She reminded me of you.

293
00:25:02,346 --> 00:25:04,218
Where do you work, Harry?

294
00:25:05,514 --> 00:25:07,718
Oh, different places,
different...

295
00:25:07,847 --> 00:25:09,471
jobs, you know?

296
00:25:10,931 --> 00:25:14,049
I'm kind of, uh,
a musician, you see.

297
00:25:14,182 --> 00:25:15,345
Oh.

298
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:20,721
Freelance musician and, uh...

299
00:25:20,851 --> 00:25:22,308
Uh-huh.

300
00:25:26,019 --> 00:25:27,393
Where do you live?

301
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:30,388
Why can't I call you
over there?

302
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:33,140
'Cause I don't
have a telephone.

303
00:25:35,855 --> 00:25:37,347
Do you live alone?

304
00:25:42,606 --> 00:25:45,474
Why are you asking me
all these questions?

305
00:25:46,649 --> 00:25:48,308
'Cause it's your birthday.

306
00:25:51,775 --> 00:25:55,640
I don't want people asking me
a lot of questions.

307
00:25:56,777 --> 00:25:58,649
I want to know you.

308
00:26:02,278 --> 00:26:03,984
Yes, I live alone.

309
00:26:05,446 --> 00:26:06,310
Oh.

310
00:26:07,863 --> 00:26:11,146
I don't feel like
answering any more questions.

311
00:26:18,949 --> 00:26:20,526
Your rent is due.

312
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,697
Here's the money for it.

313
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:56,415
You never used to ask
a lot of questions.

314
00:26:56,542 --> 00:27:00,406
Harry, I was so happy
when you came over tonight.

315
00:27:00,543 --> 00:27:03,078
When I heard you
open the door...

316
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:05,616
my toes were dancing
under the covers.

317
00:27:05,753 --> 00:27:10,625
But I don't think I'm going
to wait for you any more.

318
00:28:24,689 --> 00:28:27,309
I have a package
for the director.

319
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,313
All right.
I'll take it.

320
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,060
No. I'm supposed to
hand it to him personally.

321
00:28:32,192 --> 00:28:33,565
I have
an appointment.

322
00:28:33,692 --> 00:28:35,066
Are you Mr. Caul?

323
00:28:35,192 --> 00:28:36,566
Yes, I am.

324
00:28:36,692 --> 00:28:39,062
A Mr. Caul is here.
All right.

325
00:28:39,193 --> 00:28:40,568
Make yourself comfortable.

326
00:28:40,694 --> 00:28:43,064
The director's assistant
will be right down.

327
00:29:22,121 --> 00:29:24,989
There are some nice
Christmas cookies I made. Want one?

328
00:29:25,122 --> 00:29:26,151
They're good.

329
00:29:26,288 --> 00:29:27,698
No, thanks. I...

330
00:29:56,379 --> 00:29:57,754
What do you see?

331
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,254
Oh, not much.

332
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,248
Here's your money...
$15,000 cash, as you asked.

333
00:30:02,381 --> 00:30:03,755
These are our tapes?

334
00:30:03,881 --> 00:30:06,417
I had an arrangement
with the director.

335
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:08,919
I was to give those
to him personally.

336
00:30:09,049 --> 00:30:11,419
I understand.
He's not here this afternoon.

337
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,423
He's out of the country.

338
00:30:13,551 --> 00:30:17,212
He asked me to get the tapes
and give you the money.

339
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:42,056
I guess I can just
wait on this.

340
00:30:48,184 --> 00:30:52,049
Now, look, don't get involved
in this, Mr. Caul.

341
00:30:52,186 --> 00:30:55,101
These tapes
are dangerous.

342
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:58,097
You heard them.
You know what I mean.

343
00:30:58,229 --> 00:30:59,971
Someone may get hurt.

344
00:31:09,648 --> 00:31:12,137
Mr. Caul,
be careful.

345
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,095
<i>Well, what about me?</i>

346
00:33:09,221 --> 00:33:10,594
<i>You'll see.</i>

347
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,589
<i>Whoo!
A lot of fun you are.</i>

348
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:30,256
<i>Who started
this conversation anyhow?</i>

349
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:32,841
<i>You did.</i>

350
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:34,766
<i>I did not.</i>

351
00:33:34,893 --> 00:33:37,762
<i>Yes, you did.
You just don't remember it.</i>

352
00:33:44,438 --> 00:33:46,393
<i>Pretend like
I just told you a joke.</i>

353
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,720
<i>Ha ha ha ha.</i>

354
00:33:51,564 --> 00:33:53,307
<i>Does it bother you?</i>

355
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,305
<i>What?</i>

356
00:33:54,441 --> 00:33:56,431
<i>Walking around
in circles.</i>

357
00:33:56,566 --> 00:33:59,767
<i>Oh, look.
That's terrible.</i>

358
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,816
<i>He's not
hurting anyone.</i>

359
00:34:02,943 --> 00:34:04,400
<i>Neither are we.</i>

360
00:34:06,818 --> 00:34:08,360
<i>Oh, God.</i>

361
00:34:08,486 --> 00:34:11,852
<i>Every time I see
one of those old guys...</i>

362
00:34:11,987 --> 00:34:14,357
<i>I always think
the same thing.</i>

363
00:34:14,487 --> 00:34:15,861
<i>What do you think?</i>

364
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:17,860
<i>Yeah, what do you think?</i>

365
00:34:17,988 --> 00:34:21,153
<i>I always think
that he was once some...</i>

366
00:34:23,906 --> 00:34:27,238
Hey, Harry, what do you say
we take a break?

367
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:30,945
We'll go to Al's Transbay.
I'll buy you a beer.

368
00:34:31,074 --> 00:34:32,817
No. I want to
finish this.

369
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:35,321
I thought you turned
those tapes in.

370
00:34:35,451 --> 00:34:37,442
Stan, be quiet,
will you?

371
00:34:40,035 --> 00:34:42,903
<i>Do you think
we can do this?</i>

372
00:34:43,036 --> 00:34:44,909
<i>I'm tired of drinking
anyhow.</i>

373
00:34:45,037 --> 00:34:46,909
What a stupid conversation.

374
00:34:47,037 --> 00:34:49,407
Stan, please.
I'm trying to work.

375
00:34:49,538 --> 00:34:51,363
<i>I'm tired
of mostly everything.</i>

376
00:34:51,496 --> 00:34:52,871
<i>Tired of me?</i>

377
00:34:52,997 --> 00:34:55,949
<i>Tired of you...
but not today.</i>

378
00:34:57,414 --> 00:35:00,448
What the hell they talking about,
for Christ's sakes?

379
00:35:00,582 --> 00:35:03,450
Stanley, please,
I'm trying to get this done.

380
00:35:03,582 --> 00:35:05,455
All right.
Don't get excited.

381
00:35:05,584 --> 00:35:08,286
Well, I'm getting fed up.

382
00:35:08,376 --> 00:35:09,537
About what?

383
00:35:09,667 --> 00:35:12,417
About your asking me questions
all day long.

384
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:14,872
Jesus.

385
00:35:15,003 --> 00:35:17,077
Don't say that.

386
00:35:17,212 --> 00:35:18,752
Well, for Christ's sakes!

387
00:35:18,878 --> 00:35:20,751
Stan, don't say that
again, please.

388
00:35:20,879 --> 00:35:22,751
Don't use that word
in vain.

389
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,289
It bothers me.

390
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,290
What's the matter, Harry?

391
00:35:29,882 --> 00:35:31,671
Your work's
getting sloppy.

392
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:38,664
<i>Later in the week,
Sunday maybe.</i>

393
00:35:38,801 --> 00:35:41,041
<i>Sunday definitely.</i>

394
00:35:42,384 --> 00:35:44,920
We'd have
a much better track...

395
00:35:45,051 --> 00:35:47,376
if you'd paid more attention
to the recording...

396
00:35:47,511 --> 00:35:49,881
and less to what
they were talking about.

397
00:35:50,012 --> 00:35:53,212
Why do questions about
what's going on bother you?

398
00:35:53,346 --> 00:35:56,214
I can't explain
the personal problems of my clients.

399
00:36:01,806 --> 00:36:03,347
<i>Jack Tar Hotel.</i>

400
00:36:05,683 --> 00:36:06,547
<i>3:00.</i>

401
00:36:06,682 --> 00:36:09,349
<i>Room 773.</i>

402
00:36:09,474 --> 00:36:11,714
If you filled me in
once in a while...

403
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:12,763
Ever think of that?

404
00:36:12,892 --> 00:36:15,215
It has nothing to do
with either of us.

405
00:36:15,351 --> 00:36:17,390
It's curiosity,
goddam human nature.

406
00:36:20,561 --> 00:36:22,932
Listen, if there's
one sure-fire rule...

407
00:36:23,062 --> 00:36:24,934
I've learned
in this business is...

408
00:36:25,062 --> 00:36:27,930
I don't know anything about
human nature or curiosity.

409
00:36:28,063 --> 00:36:30,931
That's not part
of what I do.

410
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:33,731
This is my business,
and when I'm...

411
00:36:42,191 --> 00:36:43,566
I'll see you later.

412
00:37:00,279 --> 00:37:03,147
<i>I think he's been
recording my telephone.</i>

413
00:37:09,281 --> 00:37:10,740
<i>I love you.</i>

414
00:37:10,866 --> 00:37:13,734
<i>We're spending too much time
together here.</i>

415
00:37:13,866 --> 00:37:16,651
<i>No. Let's stay
just a little longer.</i>

416
00:37:31,704 --> 00:37:34,489
<i>I think he's been
recording my telephone.</i>

417
00:38:54,434 --> 00:38:57,005
<i>He'd kill us
if he got the chance.</i>

418
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:21,558
<i>He'd kill us
if he got the chance.</i>

419
00:40:09,203 --> 00:40:12,071
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

420
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:18,490
It's been three months
since my last confession.

421
00:40:20,372 --> 00:40:21,403
I...

422
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:27,950
These are my sins.

423
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:34,077
I've taken
the Lord's name in vain...

424
00:40:34,208 --> 00:40:35,916
on several occasions.

425
00:40:39,085 --> 00:40:39,998
I...

426
00:40:44,211 --> 00:40:47,578
On a number of occasions, I've
taken newspapers from the racks...

427
00:40:47,712 --> 00:40:50,083
without paying for them.

428
00:40:50,213 --> 00:40:51,078
I...

429
00:40:56,381 --> 00:41:00,044
have deliberately taken pleasure
in impure thoughts...

430
00:41:00,132 --> 00:41:01,376
and...

431
00:41:02,675 --> 00:41:05,294
I've been involved
in some work...

432
00:41:05,425 --> 00:41:07,795
that I think
will be used...

433
00:41:07,926 --> 00:41:10,296
to hurt these
two young people.

434
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:12,501
It's happened to me before.

435
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:15,504
People were hurt
because of my... my work.

436
00:41:15,637 --> 00:41:18,505
I'm... I'm afraid
it could happen again...

437
00:41:18,637 --> 00:41:21,506
and I... I was in no way
responsible.

438
00:41:21,638 --> 00:41:23,047
I'm not responsible.

439
00:41:23,138 --> 00:41:27,050
For these and all the sins
of my past life...

440
00:41:27,139 --> 00:41:28,549
I am heartily sorry.

441
00:41:40,267 --> 00:41:42,058
Hi. Can I help you?

442
00:41:42,143 --> 00:41:44,513
You could explain
your system to me.

443
00:41:44,644 --> 00:41:46,516
Mr. Caul,
I'm Jim Storey.

444
00:41:46,644 --> 00:41:48,054
How do you do?

445
00:41:48,145 --> 00:41:50,978
Come in and take a look
at the system.

446
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:52,976
This is for
the surveillance...

447
00:41:53,104 --> 00:41:54,976
of telephone
communication systems.

448
00:41:55,104 --> 00:41:56,135
I see.

449
00:41:56,272 --> 00:41:57,137
Now available.

450
00:41:57,272 --> 00:41:59,144
Here's the new LT 500.

451
00:41:59,272 --> 00:42:03,812
If you're in surveillance,
you belong into the LT 500.

452
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:05,647
You can hear...

453
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:09,353
and know exactly which door
has been violated.

454
00:42:09,484 --> 00:42:12,352
And you got your local alarms
on the doors...

455
00:42:12,485 --> 00:42:14,356
which I'm sure
you've heard.

456
00:42:14,485 --> 00:42:15,728
It's quite noisy.

457
00:42:15,859 --> 00:42:18,231
It has a Super 8mm
camera in here...

458
00:42:18,361 --> 00:42:20,233
and the dot,
the 10:00 dot...

459
00:42:20,361 --> 00:42:23,230
will show exactly what
the camera sees on the back.

460
00:42:23,362 --> 00:42:25,234
It's a magazine-loaded
camera.

461
00:42:25,362 --> 00:42:26,476
Super 8mm...

462
00:42:26,613 --> 00:42:27,987
<i>William P. Moran.</i>

463
00:42:28,113 --> 00:42:31,065
<i>William P. Moran
of Detroit, Michigan.</i>

464
00:42:31,197 --> 00:42:33,650
<i>House courtesy telephone,
please.</i>

465
00:42:37,115 --> 00:42:39,983
That's your automatic
recorder actuator.

466
00:42:40,116 --> 00:42:42,238
It undetectably
starts the recorder...

467
00:42:42,367 --> 00:42:44,323
when the phone is lifted...

468
00:42:44,451 --> 00:42:48,316
and shuts it off
when the receiver is put back.

469
00:42:48,451 --> 00:42:49,316
What?

470
00:42:49,452 --> 00:42:51,656
It's real nice,
you know.

471
00:42:51,785 --> 00:42:53,907
It's not your old-fashioned
voice actuator...

472
00:42:54,037 --> 00:42:55,909
you know,
always starting the recorder...

473
00:42:56,037 --> 00:42:57,411
when nobody
was talking...

474
00:42:57,537 --> 00:42:59,493
or shutting it off
in the middle...

475
00:42:59,621 --> 00:43:00,995
of an important
conversation.

476
00:43:01,121 --> 00:43:02,912
Is it like
the Moran actuator?

477
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,913
The Moran E-27
is a copy.

478
00:43:05,998 --> 00:43:08,748
I won't let him even
smell my equipment any more.

479
00:43:08,874 --> 00:43:10,248
You in surveillance?

480
00:43:10,374 --> 00:43:11,239
Yeah.

481
00:43:11,374 --> 00:43:13,246
Law enforcement
or private operator?

482
00:43:13,374 --> 00:43:14,288
Private.

483
00:43:14,417 --> 00:43:17,783
You mind if I take
your name and address...

484
00:43:17,918 --> 00:43:19,292
for our mailing list?

485
00:43:19,418 --> 00:43:20,995
Harry Cau...
Harry Caul?

486
00:43:21,127 --> 00:43:22,501
I didn't recognize you.

487
00:43:22,627 --> 00:43:25,495
Say, I wonder,
would you take a Model 510-A?

488
00:43:25,628 --> 00:43:27,915
Free of charge.
Just to test it.

489
00:43:28,045 --> 00:43:29,918
You know, say,
in return for...

490
00:43:30,046 --> 00:43:33,412
that we could print
in our flier that you use it.

491
00:43:33,546 --> 00:43:35,917
I build all my own equipment.
Thank you.

492
00:43:36,048 --> 00:43:39,413
Maybe we could take a picture
of you by our booth.

493
00:43:39,548 --> 00:43:41,835
It would be a great honor
for Specter.

494
00:44:27,018 --> 00:44:28,891
<i>This is not
helping crime.</i>

495
00:44:29,019 --> 00:44:30,428
<i>It's helping justice...</i>

496
00:44:45,982 --> 00:44:48,897
That may be affixed to
the subject's automobile...

497
00:44:48,982 --> 00:44:50,061
Slide.

498
00:44:50,191 --> 00:44:53,024
and will transmit
a pulsating tone signal...

499
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:54,014
Slide.

500
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:55,525
which is
highly detectable.

501
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:57,393
Harry, good to see you.

502
00:44:57,526 --> 00:44:58,806
Beautiful suit.

503
00:44:58,944 --> 00:45:00,317
You like it?
It's French.

504
00:45:00,443 --> 00:45:01,688
Oh.

505
00:45:01,819 --> 00:45:04,688
Let's go get a drink
and talk.

506
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:07,688
Requiring no knowledge
or skill in electronics.

507
00:45:07,821 --> 00:45:09,776
Come on.
It's a bore.

508
00:45:12,446 --> 00:45:15,315
The TA-30 may be
installed and concealed...

509
00:45:15,447 --> 00:45:18,896
under the dash
in a matter of seconds.

510
00:45:19,032 --> 00:45:22,897
Hey, come on. There's somebody
I want you to meet...

511
00:45:23,033 --> 00:45:24,407
a competitor of yours.

512
00:45:24,533 --> 00:45:25,908
Hey, Bernie,
old buddy.

513
00:45:26,034 --> 00:45:27,408
Yeah, Paulie,
what's up?

514
00:45:27,534 --> 00:45:29,821
This is Harry Caul.
William P. Moran.

515
00:45:29,951 --> 00:45:31,326
Harry Caul,
my pleasure.

516
00:45:31,452 --> 00:45:32,825
My friends
call me Bernie.

517
00:45:32,952 --> 00:45:34,943
I heard a lot
about you.

518
00:45:35,078 --> 00:45:36,820
Bernie just moved in
from Detroit.

519
00:45:36,953 --> 00:45:39,323
He's the fella
that let Chrysler know...

520
00:45:39,453 --> 00:45:41,326
Cadillac was
discontinuing its fins.

521
00:45:41,454 --> 00:45:42,698
I heard.

522
00:45:42,829 --> 00:45:45,200
You're a tough man
to get ahold of.

523
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:48,697
I've been wanting
to talk to you for a long time.

524
00:45:48,831 --> 00:45:50,738
Take five.
We'll get a drink.

525
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,948
Maybe in
a couple minutes.

526
00:45:53,082 --> 00:45:55,868
Honey, sweetheart,
show time, all right?

527
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,780
I'd appreciate if you stuck around
for the demonstration.

528
00:45:59,875 --> 00:46:02,411
Um, ladies
and gentlemen.

529
00:46:02,542 --> 00:46:04,250
Ladies and gentlemen.

530
00:46:04,377 --> 00:46:06,913
Ladies and gentlemen,
what we have here...

531
00:46:07,044 --> 00:46:09,912
is the Moran S-15
harmonica tap.

532
00:46:10,045 --> 00:46:12,415
This electronic marvel
can be installed...

533
00:46:12,545 --> 00:46:14,915
in a matter
of two minutes.

534
00:46:15,046 --> 00:46:18,911
Notice here it has its own
nickel cadmium power source...

535
00:46:19,047 --> 00:46:21,916
so it cannot be detected
on the line.

536
00:46:22,048 --> 00:46:24,252
Once installed,
it can be phoned...

537
00:46:24,382 --> 00:46:26,787
from any telephone
in the world...

538
00:46:26,882 --> 00:46:28,257
Singapore, Karachi,
even Moscow.

539
00:46:28,383 --> 00:46:31,417
I say Moscow 'cause
you look Russian, sir...

540
00:46:31,551 --> 00:46:32,924
with the beard.

541
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:34,923
Just dial the target's
phone number...

542
00:46:35,051 --> 00:46:36,924
pause before
the last digit...

543
00:46:37,052 --> 00:46:39,422
blow the harmonica tone
into the phone...

544
00:46:39,552 --> 00:46:40,927
press the last digit.

545
00:46:41,052 --> 00:46:44,419
The phone will not ring
in the target's house.

546
00:46:44,553 --> 00:46:45,928
Instead, the receiver...

547
00:46:46,054 --> 00:46:48,923
will be turned into
an actual room microphone...

548
00:46:49,055 --> 00:46:51,378
thus enabling surveillance
to take place.

549
00:46:51,514 --> 00:46:54,382
And now, by way of
an actual demonstration...

550
00:46:54,514 --> 00:46:58,889
we've installed one of these units
in my very own home.

551
00:46:59,015 --> 00:47:01,386
I will now dial
that number.

552
00:47:01,517 --> 00:47:02,381
Thank you.

553
00:47:07,351 --> 00:47:10,101
I pause before
the last digit.

554
00:47:11,977 --> 00:47:12,890
Harmonica.

555
00:47:17,186 --> 00:47:19,427
I dial the last digit.

556
00:47:22,689 --> 00:47:25,557
You will note the phone
does not ring.

557
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:28,060
<i>Can we get away?</i>

558
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:30,560
<i>I don't know. Maybe I can.</i>

559
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:32,266
<i>Where's
your husband?</i>

560
00:47:32,399 --> 00:47:34,474
<i>He's out
at a convention.</i>

561
00:47:35,858 --> 00:47:37,730
<i>When will
he be back?</i>

562
00:47:37,858 --> 00:47:39,233
<i>Not until late.</i>

563
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,729
April Fool.
Just a little joke, folks.

564
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,732
That shows you
the possibilities...

565
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,733
<i>Larry Peterson Burns.
Telephone call.</i>

566
00:47:45,861 --> 00:47:48,231
Thank you. The demonstration
is concluded.

567
00:47:48,362 --> 00:47:51,645
I'd like you to take some
literature on your way.

568
00:47:51,738 --> 00:47:54,523
What did you think of that?
You like it?

569
00:47:54,655 --> 00:47:56,029
That's a good item.

570
00:47:56,155 --> 00:47:58,147
Good for
the catalog suckers, huh?

571
00:47:58,281 --> 00:48:00,651
Here you go, Harry.
Have a free pen.

572
00:48:00,782 --> 00:48:01,646
You, too, Paulie.

573
00:48:01,781 --> 00:48:03,440
I'd rather have
a free drink.

574
00:48:03,574 --> 00:48:05,150
Hey, me, too.

575
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:07,155
Stanley, do me
a favor, huh?

576
00:48:07,283 --> 00:48:09,155
Mind the booth,
all right?

577
00:48:09,284 --> 00:48:11,156
That's what
I pay you for.

578
00:48:11,284 --> 00:48:14,448
Just a couple of minutes
to get a drink.

579
00:48:14,576 --> 00:48:16,035
Hi, Harry.

580
00:48:16,161 --> 00:48:17,902
Hi, Stan.

581
00:48:18,036 --> 00:48:18,901
That's right.

582
00:48:19,036 --> 00:48:21,608
You two used to
work together, huh?

583
00:48:24,204 --> 00:48:27,653
That son of a bitch
stole my latest idea.

584
00:48:27,789 --> 00:48:30,159
A lot of nice ladies
are here tonight.

585
00:48:30,289 --> 00:48:32,079
Forget it.
She's a part-time nun.

586
00:48:32,206 --> 00:48:34,079
Hey, Harry,
where you going?

587
00:48:34,207 --> 00:48:35,664
Go on without me.

588
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:37,662
I'm going to
talk to Stan.

589
00:48:37,749 --> 00:48:40,155
We'll meet you at
the chrome-dome exhibit.

590
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:41,571
Don't be long, Harry.

591
00:48:52,212 --> 00:48:55,458
Since when are you
working for Moran, Stanley?

592
00:48:58,712 --> 00:49:00,254
Since yesterday.

593
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:01,624
Mm-hmm.

594
00:49:01,713 --> 00:49:03,088
Listen, that wasn't serious.

595
00:49:03,214 --> 00:49:05,620
That was just
a stupid argument.

596
00:49:05,715 --> 00:49:07,089
That wasn't it, Harry.

597
00:49:07,214 --> 00:49:09,087
It's just time
I moved up.

598
00:49:09,216 --> 00:49:12,084
I don't want you
telling him about my things.

599
00:49:12,216 --> 00:49:13,626
It's not ethical.

600
00:49:13,716 --> 00:49:17,083
There's not much you
ever let me in on.

601
00:49:17,217 --> 00:49:19,623
Okay. I'll show you
some of the stuff.

602
00:49:19,718 --> 00:49:21,626
You won't
show me anything.

603
00:49:21,719 --> 00:49:23,093
You'll keep it
to yourself.

604
00:49:23,219 --> 00:49:24,926
You know damn well
you will.

605
00:49:25,052 --> 00:49:27,459
No, really, Stan,
wait a while.

606
00:49:27,596 --> 00:49:29,467
Will you
think about it?

607
00:49:29,596 --> 00:49:33,673
Don't do this
to me now.

608
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,095
Some guy's
following me.

609
00:49:38,223 --> 00:49:40,095
Who?

610
00:49:40,223 --> 00:49:41,633
I don't know.

611
00:49:41,724 --> 00:49:44,758
It has something to do
with the assignment last week.

612
00:49:44,891 --> 00:49:49,265
I don't know what it's about,
but I don't like it.

613
00:49:49,392 --> 00:49:52,556
Okay, all right.

614
00:49:52,685 --> 00:49:55,221
Thanks, Stan.

615
00:49:59,228 --> 00:50:01,136
This is junk.

616
00:50:24,943 --> 00:50:27,314
<i>You have reached
a disconnected number.</i>

617
00:50:27,444 --> 00:50:30,526
<i>Will you please
make sure you...</i>

618
00:50:38,739 --> 00:50:39,651
Information.

619
00:50:39,738 --> 00:50:42,653
Number for
Amy Fredericks, please.

620
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:44,114
It's a new listing.

621
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,147
One moment, please.

622
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:54,564
Sir, I see no listing
for Amy Fredericks.

623
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:56,242
Thank you.

624
00:51:20,207 --> 00:51:22,079
What are you
doing here?

625
00:51:22,208 --> 00:51:25,076
Take it easy.
I'm just a messenger.

626
00:51:25,208 --> 00:51:27,081
I brought you a drink.

627
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:29,081
Why are you
following me?

628
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:31,580
I'm not following you.
I'm looking for you.

629
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:33,168
There's
a big difference.

630
00:51:33,293 --> 00:51:35,665
How'd you know
I was here?

631
00:51:35,795 --> 00:51:37,869
It's a convention
of wiretappers...

632
00:51:38,004 --> 00:51:40,837
Oh, excuse me... surveillance
and security technicians.

633
00:51:40,963 --> 00:51:42,336
It was a snap.

634
00:51:42,462 --> 00:51:45,545
I'm not giving those tapes
to anybody but the director.

635
00:51:45,672 --> 00:51:47,794
I know
what you told me.

636
00:51:47,923 --> 00:51:49,581
All right,
what's the message?

637
00:51:49,715 --> 00:51:52,832
We want you to deliver the tapes
on Sunday, 1:00.

638
00:51:52,966 --> 00:51:54,339
The director
will be there.

639
00:51:54,466 --> 00:51:57,038
He'll accept the tapes
from you, in person.

640
00:51:57,175 --> 00:51:59,546
You tell him
I'll think about it.

641
00:52:15,638 --> 00:52:16,551
Hey, Paulie!

642
00:52:16,638 --> 00:52:19,009
Come on!
Come on, let's go!

643
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:22,007
Lurleen and Millard,
get in the back there.

644
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:23,550
Stanley, get in front!

645
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:26,556
I'm trying to dress up
the boss, okay?

646
00:52:26,641 --> 00:52:28,015
Take one out here.

647
00:52:28,141 --> 00:52:30,713
Bernie, it's a
come-as-you-are party.

648
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:34,299
Wait a minute!
All the girls up front!

649
00:52:34,435 --> 00:52:36,556
I think
you take a right...

650
00:52:36,643 --> 00:52:37,971
then a left...

651
00:52:38,102 --> 00:52:40,805
Sons of bitches!
Those smart asses!

652
00:52:40,936 --> 00:52:43,556
Who the hell they think
they're tangling with?

653
00:52:43,645 --> 00:52:45,683
Easy, we're going
to have a party.

654
00:52:50,022 --> 00:52:51,301
Millard, make them stop.

655
00:52:51,439 --> 00:52:52,469
Relax, honey.

656
00:52:52,606 --> 00:52:54,976
Paul's the best tail man
in the country.

657
00:52:55,106 --> 00:52:56,978
Meredith, do you
hear that?

658
00:52:57,107 --> 00:52:58,020
Ha ha.

659
00:53:02,109 --> 00:53:02,973
Make-4, 111.

660
00:53:03,108 --> 00:53:04,483
I'm driving east
on Lombard.

661
00:53:04,609 --> 00:53:08,651
I'd like a rolling
10-28 on...

662
00:53:08,776 --> 00:53:11,977
California 5-6-0...

663
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:14,398
Boy Adam Lincoln.

664
00:53:14,529 --> 00:53:16,852
What are you calling
for a 10-28 for?

665
00:53:16,987 --> 00:53:18,646
Thanks.

666
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:25,988
Hey, Willie Sanchez...
3365414th Street...

667
00:53:26,115 --> 00:53:27,488
162 pounds...

668
00:53:27,615 --> 00:53:30,186
5' 101/2" shit head!

669
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:45,816
Want me to pick
that lock for you, Harry?

670
00:53:45,953 --> 00:53:47,825
Hey, this'll be
the bar.

671
00:53:47,953 --> 00:53:49,328
It's freezing
in here.

672
00:53:49,454 --> 00:53:50,781
Oh, boy, Harry.

673
00:53:50,912 --> 00:53:51,777
Okay.

674
00:53:51,913 --> 00:53:54,781
All right,
the bar is now open.

675
00:53:54,913 --> 00:53:55,779
Stanley.

676
00:53:55,914 --> 00:53:56,778
Yes, sir.

677
00:53:56,914 --> 00:53:58,787
How about
a little music?

678
00:53:58,915 --> 00:54:01,285
The man wants
a little music.

679
00:54:01,415 --> 00:54:03,904
Harry, you got
a nice shop here.

680
00:54:19,545 --> 00:54:22,912
<i>I was rereading Dear Abby
the other night.</i>

681
00:54:23,046 --> 00:54:26,412
There was a letter from a fella
called "Lonely and Anonymous."

682
00:54:26,546 --> 00:54:28,419
I think it was Harry.

683
00:54:28,547 --> 00:54:30,585
Hey!

684
00:54:31,965 --> 00:54:32,877
Ahh.

685
00:54:33,006 --> 00:54:34,832
Where's
the club soda?

686
00:54:36,549 --> 00:54:39,038
Let me tell you
something about Harry Caul.

687
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:40,419
There you go.

688
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:42,625
I know you heard this
a thousand times...

689
00:54:42,759 --> 00:54:44,549
but let me
say it again.

690
00:54:44,676 --> 00:54:46,051
Here's to Harry...

691
00:54:46,177 --> 00:54:47,550
the best, bar none.

692
00:54:47,677 --> 00:54:49,051
I'll drink to that.

693
00:54:49,177 --> 00:54:50,421
Best what?

694
00:54:50,511 --> 00:54:53,379
The best bugger
on the West Coast.

695
00:54:53,511 --> 00:54:56,380
Who's the best bugger
on the East Coast?

696
00:54:56,512 --> 00:54:57,377
Me.

697
00:54:57,513 --> 00:54:59,385
I'll drink to that, too.

698
00:54:59,513 --> 00:55:00,675
I'll bet you will.

699
00:55:00,805 --> 00:55:02,464
I'll bet
you will.

700
00:55:05,389 --> 00:55:09,764
It's funny we never bumped
into each other in New York.

701
00:55:09,891 --> 00:55:11,265
Why is that funny?

702
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:13,846
We're in the same
business, same city.

703
00:55:13,976 --> 00:55:16,381
I figure we'd bump
into each other.

704
00:55:16,476 --> 00:55:18,846
I didn't know
you came from New York.

705
00:55:18,977 --> 00:55:21,845
Are you kidding?
Harry's famous in New York.

706
00:55:21,978 --> 00:55:25,012
You know the only one
I couldn't figure out?

707
00:55:25,145 --> 00:55:29,009
The welfare fund
back in '68.

708
00:55:29,145 --> 00:55:31,018
How'd you know
about that?

709
00:55:31,147 --> 00:55:33,019
Everybody
in the biz knew.

710
00:55:33,147 --> 00:55:35,517
Nobody knows
how you did it.

711
00:55:35,647 --> 00:55:36,845
Hmm?

712
00:55:36,981 --> 00:55:39,387
How'd you do it,
Harry?

713
00:55:39,482 --> 00:55:40,395
Harry.

714
00:55:40,482 --> 00:55:41,394
Hmm?

715
00:55:41,482 --> 00:55:42,857
10 cents a dance.

716
00:55:42,983 --> 00:55:43,847
Come on.

717
00:55:43,982 --> 00:55:44,896
Ooh.

718
00:55:50,443 --> 00:55:51,605
You all right?

719
00:55:51,735 --> 00:55:53,109
You hurt yourself?

720
00:55:53,235 --> 00:55:55,026
No. Don't worry
about my head.

721
00:55:55,153 --> 00:55:57,025
It happens
all the time.

722
00:55:57,153 --> 00:55:59,523
When I was
a little baby...

723
00:55:59,653 --> 00:56:03,020
I loved to love to bang my head
up against the wall.

724
00:56:03,154 --> 00:56:06,521
Sometimes I still feel
like doing it. It's comforting.

725
00:56:06,656 --> 00:56:08,528
I tapped
my first telephone...

726
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:11,026
when I was
12 years old...

727
00:56:11,156 --> 00:56:12,318
12 years old.

728
00:56:12,449 --> 00:56:15,815
It was a hallway payphone
where I lived.

729
00:56:15,950 --> 00:56:18,818
For six months,
they didn't know who it was.

730
00:56:18,951 --> 00:56:21,819
My father, he was
proud as hell.

731
00:56:21,951 --> 00:56:23,325
He was beaming.

732
00:56:23,451 --> 00:56:24,447
Yeah, boy.

733
00:56:24,577 --> 00:56:27,279
"That Bernie's got a real brain,"
he said.

734
00:56:27,411 --> 00:56:30,244
From then on,
it's been all uphill, Harry.

735
00:56:30,370 --> 00:56:34,317
I got contacts you
wouldn't believe.

736
00:56:34,455 --> 00:56:36,778
Here. Well,
bring them over.

737
00:56:40,289 --> 00:56:41,663
Take a cab over.

738
00:56:41,789 --> 00:56:44,658
Nothing's sacred
with you, is it, Harry?

739
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:46,662
Sure. The more,
the merrier.

740
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:49,824
We'll be here
all night.

741
00:56:49,958 --> 00:56:51,748
Oh! You son of a...

742
00:56:51,876 --> 00:56:54,744
Ha ha ha ha!

743
00:56:54,876 --> 00:56:56,286
What's the matter,
Harry?

744
00:56:56,376 --> 00:56:58,285
Can't you
take a vacation?

745
00:56:58,376 --> 00:57:01,293
When are you getting
a new scrambler, Harry?

746
00:57:01,377 --> 00:57:04,081
This went out
with the Trojan War.

747
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:07,294
Come on.
I want to hear all about you.

748
00:57:07,379 --> 00:57:09,287
Really obsolete,
you know that?

749
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:11,750
Harry got himself
a girlfriend.

750
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,705
Watch out, Harry.

751
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:15,249
Where are you from?

752
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:17,705
New York.

753
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,709
I used to live
in New York.

754
00:57:20,841 --> 00:57:23,247
First I worked
as a receptionist...

755
00:57:23,342 --> 00:57:26,257
and then I got
promoted to secretary.

756
00:57:26,342 --> 00:57:29,258
And then I was promoted
to gal Friday...

757
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:31,713
and special assistant
to the boss...

758
00:57:31,844 --> 00:57:33,752
and then I married him.

759
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:54,428
Do you live
far from here?

760
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:03,013
Harry?

761
00:58:03,144 --> 00:58:06,012
Are you
still married?

762
00:58:06,144 --> 00:58:08,016
Oh, I don't know.

763
00:58:08,145 --> 00:58:09,519
Probably.

764
00:58:11,646 --> 00:58:13,518
I guess
maybe I am.

765
00:58:13,646 --> 00:58:15,933
Last time I heard...

766
00:58:16,063 --> 00:58:18,931
Well, he was trying to
scrape up enough money...

767
00:58:19,064 --> 00:58:20,937
to buy another
hardware store.

768
00:58:21,065 --> 00:58:22,308
Yeah.

769
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:26,269
And I ended up out here
in San Francisco, unemployed...

770
00:58:26,399 --> 00:58:29,268
which is the entire story
of my life...

771
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,770
up until tonight.

772
00:58:45,571 --> 00:58:48,440
Here's to you.
Salute.

773
00:58:48,572 --> 00:58:51,441
You don't like me
very much, do you?

774
00:58:51,573 --> 00:58:54,441
You don't want to
talk to me or anything.

775
00:58:54,574 --> 00:58:55,983
I didn't say that.

776
00:59:08,577 --> 00:59:10,947
Something is
on your mind.

777
00:59:11,077 --> 00:59:12,949
I wish you'd tell me.

778
00:59:13,078 --> 00:59:14,452
I really do.

779
00:59:14,579 --> 00:59:17,412
I wish that you'd feel
that you could talk to me...

780
00:59:17,538 --> 00:59:19,908
and that we
could be friends.

781
00:59:20,038 --> 00:59:23,736
I mean aside from
all of this junk.

782
00:59:45,878 --> 00:59:48,202
Would you, um...

783
00:59:48,338 --> 00:59:52,414
If you were a girl who'd
waited for someone...

784
01:00:00,049 --> 01:00:03,663
You can trust me.

785
01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:09,418
Well, you never
really knew...

786
01:00:09,550 --> 01:00:12,419
when he was going to
come to see you.

787
01:00:12,551 --> 01:00:14,922
You just lived
in a room alone...

788
01:00:15,053 --> 01:00:17,339
and you knew
nothing about him.

789
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:19,342
And if you loved him...

790
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:21,342
and were
patient with him...

791
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:24,338
and even though
he didn't dare ever...

792
01:00:24,471 --> 01:00:27,837
tell you anything
about himself personally...

793
01:00:29,973 --> 01:00:32,343
Even though he may
have loved you...

794
01:00:32,474 --> 01:00:34,346
would you...

795
01:00:34,474 --> 01:00:36,844
Would I what?

796
01:00:36,974 --> 01:00:38,349
Would you...

797
01:00:39,975 --> 01:00:42,511
Would you
go back to him?

798
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,349
Well, how would I know...

799
01:00:49,478 --> 01:00:52,761
How would I know
that he loved me?

800
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:03,349
You'd have
no way of knowing.

801
01:01:15,901 --> 01:01:17,276
Hey, Harry!

802
01:01:17,402 --> 01:01:20,768
Did you hear the one about
the broad who busted Vegas?

803
01:01:20,902 --> 01:01:22,810
She wore
a see-through blouse.

804
01:01:46,909 --> 01:01:49,279
Where are
you going?

805
01:01:49,410 --> 01:01:52,195
Hey! Hey!

806
01:02:21,876 --> 01:02:24,365
You know something,
Harry?

807
01:02:24,502 --> 01:02:27,251
12 years ago, I recorded
every telephone call...

808
01:02:27,377 --> 01:02:29,250
made by the
presidential nominee...

809
01:02:29,379 --> 01:02:31,251
of a major
political party.

810
01:02:31,379 --> 01:02:32,753
I don't want to say
which party.

811
01:02:32,879 --> 01:02:35,250
Everywhere he went,
that's where I was.

812
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:37,122
Coast to coast,
I was listening.

813
01:02:37,255 --> 01:02:39,127
I'm not saying I elected...

814
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:41,709
the president of
the United States...

815
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:44,127
but you can draw
your own conclusions.

816
01:02:44,257 --> 01:02:46,746
I mean, he lost.

817
01:02:46,883 --> 01:02:48,755
Harry, tell them
about the time...

818
01:02:48,883 --> 01:02:50,838
you put the bug
in the parakeet.

819
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:51,832
Parakeet?

820
01:02:51,967 --> 01:02:53,294
No kidding.

821
01:02:53,425 --> 01:02:56,294
Harry one time actually
put a microphone...

822
01:02:56,426 --> 01:02:57,801
in a little
parakeet.

823
01:02:57,927 --> 01:02:59,301
Is that right?

824
01:02:59,427 --> 01:03:01,751
Parakeets don't happen
to be my thing...

825
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:04,257
but I sure would
like to know...

826
01:03:04,387 --> 01:03:07,256
how you did
the teamster local back in '68.

827
01:03:07,388 --> 01:03:08,762
What was that?

828
01:03:08,888 --> 01:03:11,756
Don't you get papers
in Chicago, Millard?

829
01:03:11,889 --> 01:03:13,264
Probably
out on strike.

830
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:15,676
It was all over
the front pages.

831
01:03:15,807 --> 01:03:18,177
Harry was working
for the attorney general.

832
01:03:18,307 --> 01:03:21,176
You didn't know
I knew, did you?

833
01:03:21,308 --> 01:03:23,678
The president of
this teamster local...

834
01:03:23,808 --> 01:03:26,179
set up a phony
welfare fund.

835
01:03:26,309 --> 01:03:29,676
I mean, you correct me
on the details, Harry.

836
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:32,180
I may be
a little fuzzy.

837
01:03:32,310 --> 01:03:34,183
Only two people
seemed to know...

838
01:03:34,312 --> 01:03:36,184
the president
and his accountant.

839
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:38,599
They only talked about it
on fishing trips.

840
01:03:38,729 --> 01:03:40,104
On a private boat...

841
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:42,683
That was the only place
they talked details.

842
01:03:42,814 --> 01:03:44,851
That boat was bug-proof.
That's a fact.

843
01:03:44,981 --> 01:03:47,351
They wouldn't strike up
a conversation...

844
01:03:47,481 --> 01:03:50,349
if there was another boat
on the horizon.

845
01:03:50,482 --> 01:03:52,853
That didn't stop Harry,
did it?

846
01:03:52,982 --> 01:03:54,357
No, he recorded
everything.

847
01:03:54,483 --> 01:03:56,189
Nobody knows
how you did it though.

848
01:03:56,317 --> 01:03:58,190
Caused a hell of
a scandal.

849
01:03:58,318 --> 01:03:59,561
Why?

850
01:03:59,693 --> 01:04:02,182
No reason.
Three people were murdered.

851
01:04:02,318 --> 01:04:06,479
Harry's a bit too modest
to tell us how he did it.

852
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:11,192
It had nothing
to do with me.

853
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:13,692
I just turned in
the tapes.

854
01:04:13,821 --> 01:04:16,145
The president thought
the accountant talked.

855
01:04:16,281 --> 01:04:18,153
Nobody really
knows for sure.

856
01:04:18,281 --> 01:04:19,656
Three days later...

857
01:04:19,782 --> 01:04:22,650
they found the accountant,
his wife, and kid...

858
01:04:22,782 --> 01:04:25,651
naked and tied up
in the house...

859
01:04:25,782 --> 01:04:28,652
Hands and feet
tied up with rope...

860
01:04:28,783 --> 01:04:31,154
all the hair on their bodies
shaved off.

861
01:04:31,285 --> 01:04:33,655
The heads were found
in different places.

862
01:04:33,785 --> 01:04:35,159
They killed them?

863
01:04:35,285 --> 01:04:36,660
No. They
gift-wrapped them.

864
01:04:36,786 --> 01:04:38,658
This is
ancient history now.

865
01:04:38,786 --> 01:04:40,161
Harry, how'd you do it?

866
01:04:40,287 --> 01:04:43,653
What they do with the tapes
is their business.

867
01:04:43,787 --> 01:04:47,652
Next thing I knew,
you moved out of New York.

868
01:04:47,788 --> 01:04:50,159
It had nothing
to do with me.

869
01:04:50,289 --> 01:04:52,659
Come on, show and tell.
How'd you do it?

870
01:04:52,789 --> 01:04:54,828
For God's sake,
tell him.

871
01:04:59,791 --> 01:05:01,166
Turn it off, Stan.

872
01:05:01,292 --> 01:05:02,489
What for?

873
01:05:02,625 --> 01:05:04,830
Stan, turn it off.

874
01:05:04,959 --> 01:05:06,998
They ought to hear this.

875
01:05:07,127 --> 01:05:09,165
It's the best thing
you've ever done.

876
01:05:12,795 --> 01:05:15,082
What was that, Stan?

877
01:05:16,921 --> 01:05:21,580
Well, it's the assignment
that Harry did this week.

878
01:05:21,714 --> 01:05:23,088
It'll make history.

879
01:05:23,214 --> 01:05:24,589
Yeah?

880
01:05:24,715 --> 01:05:28,081
There's no moment between
human beings that I cannot record...

881
01:05:28,216 --> 01:05:31,747
and there's no method
that I cannot figure out.

882
01:05:31,883 --> 01:05:34,751
I could figure out
any of Harry's schemes, right?

883
01:05:34,884 --> 01:05:37,503
Come on, come on.
Try me.

884
01:05:37,634 --> 01:05:40,503
Let me give him
the assignment, Harry.

885
01:05:40,635 --> 01:05:42,792
Yeah.

886
01:05:47,804 --> 01:05:51,170
This is a quad
in the center of the city.

887
01:05:51,305 --> 01:05:53,675
These are steps,
benches all around.

888
01:05:53,805 --> 01:05:55,180
It's 12:00 noon...

889
01:05:55,305 --> 01:05:57,178
which means
that it's lunchtime...

890
01:05:57,306 --> 01:06:00,175
for the people working
in these offices.

891
01:06:00,307 --> 01:06:02,179
They're walking, talking,
having lunch...

892
01:06:02,307 --> 01:06:03,682
and it's crowded.

893
01:06:03,808 --> 01:06:05,182
Naturally.
Come on, Stan.

894
01:06:05,308 --> 01:06:08,177
Okay. Two people are constantly
moving in circles...

895
01:06:08,309 --> 01:06:10,181
in and out
of the crowd.

896
01:06:10,309 --> 01:06:12,881
We don't know whether
they'll sit down or what.

897
01:06:12,977 --> 01:06:15,182
They're convinced
they can't be recorded...

898
01:06:15,311 --> 01:06:18,678
because they're in a crowd
and constantly moving.

899
01:06:18,812 --> 01:06:20,186
Yet, they're the target.

900
01:06:20,312 --> 01:06:22,599
The assignment is
to get everything they say.

901
01:06:22,729 --> 01:06:24,686
How would you do it?

902
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:26,686
One system
won't do it.

903
01:06:26,814 --> 01:06:28,686
I could've
told you that.

904
01:06:28,814 --> 01:06:30,189
Why didn't you?

905
01:06:30,315 --> 01:06:32,187
Go on,
figure it out.

906
01:06:32,315 --> 01:06:34,105
You get to
their clothes first.

907
01:06:34,232 --> 01:06:35,607
You pre-rig
their clothes.

908
01:06:35,733 --> 01:06:37,605
There's no way
of telling...

909
01:06:37,733 --> 01:06:39,013
what they're
going to be wearing.

910
01:06:39,151 --> 01:06:41,521
Get somebody to
bump into them.

911
01:06:41,651 --> 01:06:44,934
Get a drunk to plant
a pin mike on them.

912
01:06:45,069 --> 01:06:47,225
They've been bugged before.
It's too risky.

913
01:06:47,361 --> 01:06:48,605
I got it.

914
01:06:49,819 --> 01:06:52,604
You hire a lip-reader
with binoculars.

915
01:06:52,737 --> 01:06:55,605
No. The client wants
their actual voice.

916
01:06:55,738 --> 01:06:57,611
Why?

917
01:06:57,739 --> 01:06:59,528
So he can
believe it.

918
01:06:59,656 --> 01:07:02,026
All right.
I'll figure it out.

919
01:07:02,156 --> 01:07:05,108
I don't know.
It must've been an expensive show.

920
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:06,615
Who was so interested?

921
01:07:06,741 --> 01:07:08,115
Yeah, was it us?

922
01:07:08,241 --> 01:07:09,106
Who's us?

923
01:07:09,242 --> 01:07:10,106
Federal government.

924
01:07:10,241 --> 01:07:11,106
Private party.

925
01:07:11,242 --> 01:07:14,110
It would take
at least four passes.

926
01:07:14,243 --> 01:07:16,115
I did it in three.

927
01:07:16,243 --> 01:07:19,111
Three? That's very nice.
What did you use?

928
01:07:19,243 --> 01:07:20,618
Three-stage directional
microphones...

929
01:07:20,744 --> 01:07:23,613
with Mosfet amplifier
of my own design.

930
01:07:23,745 --> 01:07:26,614
We got another 20% conventionally
just tailing them.

931
01:07:26,746 --> 01:07:27,611
Paul did.

932
01:07:27,746 --> 01:07:30,532
It was beautiful.
It really was.

933
01:07:30,663 --> 01:07:33,034
It was
a work of art.

934
01:07:33,164 --> 01:07:35,535
You should have
seen it, though.

935
01:07:35,665 --> 01:07:37,122
These new microphones
are just incredible.

936
01:07:37,248 --> 01:07:39,039
I couldn't believe it
myself.

937
01:07:39,166 --> 01:07:41,038
We were 200 yards away.

938
01:07:41,166 --> 01:07:42,541
It was absolutely
readable.

939
01:07:42,666 --> 01:07:44,788
I broke in a couple
of newsreel cameramen.

940
01:07:44,917 --> 01:07:46,291
You should have
been there, Bernie.

941
01:07:46,417 --> 01:07:47,697
What did they do?

942
01:07:47,835 --> 01:07:50,122
They took the cross hairs
of the telescope...

943
01:07:50,252 --> 01:07:52,622
and lined it up
on the mouths...

944
01:07:52,752 --> 01:07:55,621
No. The boy and the girl.
What did they do?

945
01:07:55,753 --> 01:07:57,128
Oh, I don't know.

946
01:07:57,254 --> 01:07:59,624
But it was beautiful,
something to see.

947
01:07:59,754 --> 01:08:01,128
Yeah.
Sounds very pretty.

948
01:08:01,254 --> 01:08:04,123
I'd like to take
a look at that mike, too.

949
01:08:04,255 --> 01:08:05,630
There it is.

950
01:08:05,756 --> 01:08:07,130
Oh.

951
01:08:07,256 --> 01:08:10,373
I always said
we should be partners, Harry.

952
01:08:10,507 --> 01:08:14,123
You're the best, but you
and me together, that'd be tops.

953
01:08:14,258 --> 01:08:18,039
I need a quick look at
your plans and devices.

954
01:08:18,176 --> 01:08:20,083
I got all the
manufacturing plants.

955
01:08:20,218 --> 01:08:23,051
We could make a fortune
selling to Uncle Sam.

956
01:08:23,177 --> 01:08:26,045
Did you hear about
the fag wiretapper...

957
01:08:26,178 --> 01:08:29,046
who could only tap
a Princess phone?

958
01:08:29,178 --> 01:08:30,092
No.

959
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:35,552
Made that up
yourself, huh?

960
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:38,051
It's pretty funny.

961
01:08:38,181 --> 01:08:39,555
Can I cut in?

962
01:08:39,681 --> 01:08:42,549
He's got a hell
of a sense of humor.

963
01:08:42,681 --> 01:08:44,554
I'm talking about
making millions...

964
01:08:44,683 --> 01:08:46,555
he's making
with the jokes.

965
01:08:46,683 --> 01:08:47,548
Come on!

966
01:08:47,683 --> 01:08:49,057
Thanks a lot.

967
01:08:49,183 --> 01:08:51,056
What do you say,
Harry?

968
01:08:51,185 --> 01:08:53,555
How about going
into a partnership?

969
01:08:53,685 --> 01:08:56,553
I could use a partner,
so could you.

970
01:08:56,686 --> 01:08:58,059
50-50, how about it?

971
01:08:58,186 --> 01:08:59,893
I don't need
anyone.

972
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:01,394
That's all right.

973
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:04,388
I do pretty good
on my own, anyway.

974
01:09:04,521 --> 01:09:07,887
You got to give credit
where credit's due, right?

975
01:09:08,022 --> 01:09:08,887
Abracadabra, Harry.

976
01:09:09,022 --> 01:09:10,894
See, I'm number two,
Harry.

977
01:09:11,023 --> 01:09:12,895
I have to try harder.

978
01:09:13,023 --> 01:09:16,021
<i>Would you, um...
If you were a girl...</i>

979
01:09:16,149 --> 01:09:17,523
<i>who'd waited
for someone...</i>

980
01:09:17,649 --> 01:09:19,023
<i>You can trust me.</i>

981
01:09:19,149 --> 01:09:22,516
Harry, that's you and me
when we were out there.

982
01:09:22,650 --> 01:09:24,522
What? No shit.
Ha ha ha.

983
01:09:24,651 --> 01:09:28,017
It's the Moran Super P-7
pen mike and transmitter.

984
01:09:28,152 --> 01:09:29,314
That's terrific!

985
01:09:29,444 --> 01:09:31,316
The bugger
got bugged, huh?

986
01:09:31,444 --> 01:09:32,819
He got you,
Harry.

987
01:09:32,944 --> 01:09:35,814
<i>And if you loved him
and were patient with him...</i>

988
01:09:35,945 --> 01:09:39,027
<i>and even though
he didn't dare ever...</i>

989
01:09:39,154 --> 01:09:42,319
<i>tell you anything about
himself personally...</i>

990
01:09:42,447 --> 01:09:43,822
Hey, touch, Harry.

991
01:09:43,948 --> 01:09:46,318
That's wild.
When did you do that?

992
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:50,313
How do you like it?
What do you think?

993
01:09:50,450 --> 01:09:55,404
<i>Would you...
Would you go back to him?</i>

994
01:09:55,534 --> 01:09:58,616
I think you better
turn it off and get out.

995
01:09:58,743 --> 01:10:02,608
Are you kidding? It's just
a joke, for Christ's sakes.

996
01:10:02,744 --> 01:10:06,110
Bernie, Harry don't like you
to say "Christ's sakes."

997
01:10:06,244 --> 01:10:09,576
Well, I'm sorry, Harry.
Are you crazy, too, Stanley?

998
01:10:09,704 --> 01:10:10,569
What's wrong?

999
01:10:10,704 --> 01:10:12,576
Let's have
a party here.

1000
01:10:12,705 --> 01:10:14,079
Paul,
it's getting late.

1001
01:10:14,206 --> 01:10:15,912
Come on,
take it easy.

1002
01:10:16,039 --> 01:10:16,904
Come on.

1003
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:17,904
Hey, Millard.

1004
01:10:18,039 --> 01:10:19,912
Know what
these things cost?

1005
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:21,414
This cost 1,500 beans.

1006
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:23,413
On the house,
from me to you.

1007
01:10:26,042 --> 01:10:27,997
Very nice to meet you.

1008
01:10:30,001 --> 01:10:31,459
It's only a joke.

1009
01:10:31,585 --> 01:10:32,959
Meredith?

1010
01:10:33,085 --> 01:10:34,459
He's got no sense
of humor.

1011
01:10:34,586 --> 01:10:36,956
No. I'm going to
stay here.

1012
01:10:37,086 --> 01:10:37,999
Paul!

1013
01:10:39,587 --> 01:10:40,831
Okay.

1014
01:10:44,088 --> 01:10:45,664
I forgot my bag.

1015
01:10:47,922 --> 01:10:49,297
Harry, I'm
really sorry.

1016
01:10:49,423 --> 01:10:50,963
I didn't mean
anything.

1017
01:10:51,089 --> 01:10:52,464
Come on, Stan.

1018
01:10:52,590 --> 01:10:54,462
See you Monday, Harry.

1019
01:10:54,590 --> 01:10:57,542
You want us to
put the lights out?

1020
01:11:16,555 --> 01:11:17,419
Night, Harry!

1021
01:11:17,554 --> 01:11:19,925
Yeah.
Goodnight, Harry.

1022
01:11:24,890 --> 01:11:26,265
<i>What do you think?</i>

1023
01:11:26,390 --> 01:11:29,259
<i>I don't know what
I'm going to get him...</i>

1024
01:11:29,391 --> 01:11:30,421
<i>for Christmas yet.</i>

1025
01:11:30,558 --> 01:11:31,933
<i>He's already
got everything.</i>

1026
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:41,924
Harry, are you going to give me
a hard time tonight?

1027
01:11:43,645 --> 01:11:45,019
Harry!

1028
01:11:45,145 --> 01:11:46,425
Harry!

1029
01:11:46,562 --> 01:11:47,936
Come on.
Come back.

1030
01:11:48,062 --> 01:11:49,935
Turn it off.

1031
01:12:03,566 --> 01:12:05,107
She's frightened.

1032
01:12:05,233 --> 01:12:06,940
This is where
she's frightened.

1033
01:12:07,068 --> 01:12:09,438
<i>I don't know what
I'm going to get him...</i>

1034
01:12:09,568 --> 01:12:10,943
<i>for Christmas yet.</i>

1035
01:12:11,068 --> 01:12:12,609
This is no ordinary
conversation.

1036
01:12:12,736 --> 01:12:14,608
<i>He doesn't need anything any more.</i>

1037
01:12:14,736 --> 01:12:16,360
It makes me feel...

1038
01:12:16,487 --> 01:12:20,351
<i>I haven't decided
what I'm going to get you yet.</i>

1039
01:12:20,487 --> 01:12:21,352
Something.

1040
01:12:21,488 --> 01:12:22,862
Forget it, Harry.

1041
01:12:22,988 --> 01:12:24,362
It's only a trick.

1042
01:12:24,488 --> 01:12:25,863
What?

1043
01:12:25,988 --> 01:12:26,901
A job.

1044
01:12:27,031 --> 01:12:29,354
You're not supposed
to feel anything.

1045
01:12:29,489 --> 01:12:31,861
You're just
supposed to do it.

1046
01:12:31,990 --> 01:12:33,365
That's all.

1047
01:12:33,491 --> 01:12:34,356
Relax, honey.

1048
01:12:34,491 --> 01:12:36,862
<i>A lot of fun you are.</i>

1049
01:12:36,992 --> 01:12:38,366
<i>You're supposed
to tease me...</i>

1050
01:12:38,492 --> 01:12:40,365
<i>give me hints,
make me guess.</i>

1051
01:12:40,493 --> 01:12:41,357
<i>You know.</i>

1052
01:12:42,493 --> 01:12:43,867
<i>Does it bother you?</i>

1053
01:12:43,993 --> 01:12:44,858
<i>What?</i>

1054
01:12:44,994 --> 01:12:46,866
<i>Walking around
in circles.</i>

1055
01:12:49,495 --> 01:12:53,359
<i>Oh, look,
that's terrible.</i>

1056
01:12:53,496 --> 01:12:55,369
<i>He's not
hurting anyone.</i>

1057
01:12:58,997 --> 01:13:00,372
<i>Neither are we.</i>

1058
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:04,863
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1059
01:13:04,998 --> 01:13:05,863
"Oh, God."

1060
01:13:05,999 --> 01:13:09,366
Listen to the way
she says "Oh, God."

1061
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:12,531
Come here.

1062
01:13:12,668 --> 01:13:15,287
<i>Every time I see
one of those old guys...</i>

1063
01:13:15,418 --> 01:13:18,287
<i>I always think
the same thing.</i>

1064
01:13:18,419 --> 01:13:20,291
<i>What do you think?</i>

1065
01:13:20,419 --> 01:13:21,794
<i>I always think...</i>

1066
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,835
<i>that he was once
somebody's baby boy.</i>

1067
01:13:26,921 --> 01:13:28,579
<i>Really. I... I do.</i>

1068
01:13:28,713 --> 01:13:31,581
<i>I think he was once
somebody's baby boy...</i>

1069
01:13:31,714 --> 01:13:35,578
<i>and he had a mother
and a father who loved him.</i>

1070
01:13:35,715 --> 01:13:39,580
<i>And now there he is,
half dead on a park bench...</i>

1071
01:13:39,716 --> 01:13:42,086
<i>and where are his
mother or his father...</i>

1072
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:44,089
<i>all his uncles now?</i>

1073
01:13:44,217 --> 01:13:46,587
<i>Anyway, that's what
I always think.</i>

1074
01:13:48,927 --> 01:13:50,301
<i>I always think...</i>

1075
01:13:50,427 --> 01:13:52,797
<i>how, when they had
the newspaper strike...</i>

1076
01:13:52,927 --> 01:13:53,792
<i>in New York...</i>

1077
01:13:53,928 --> 01:13:55,800
<i>more of those
old guys died.</i>

1078
01:13:55,928 --> 01:13:58,299
<i>50 of them froze
to death in one night.</i>

1079
01:13:58,429 --> 01:14:00,800
<i>Just because there were
no newspapers?</i>

1080
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:03,300
<i>Really.
Keeps them warm.</i>

1081
01:14:03,431 --> 01:14:05,338
<i>Well, that's terrible.</i>

1082
01:14:06,932 --> 01:14:09,053
<i>Who started this
conversation, anyhow?</i>

1083
01:14:11,432 --> 01:14:12,807
<i>You did.</i>

1084
01:14:12,933 --> 01:14:14,307
<i>Did not.</i>

1085
01:14:14,433 --> 01:14:15,761
<i>Yes, you did.</i>

1086
01:14:15,892 --> 01:14:17,883
<i>You just don't
remember it.</i>

1087
01:14:19,392 --> 01:14:22,261
<i>Pretend like I just
told you a joke.</i>

1088
01:14:25,894 --> 01:14:27,767
<i>Where did you
hear that?</i>

1089
01:14:27,895 --> 01:14:29,269
<i>That's my secret.</i>

1090
01:14:30,896 --> 01:14:33,765
<i>Later in the week.</i>

1091
01:14:33,897 --> 01:14:34,761
<i>Sunday, maybe.</i>

1092
01:14:36,898 --> 01:14:38,770
<i>Sunday, definitely.</i>

1093
01:14:40,898 --> 01:14:42,771
<i>The Jack Tar Hotel.</i>

1094
01:14:44,899 --> 01:14:47,270
<i>3:00. Room 773.</i>

1095
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,687
<i>Look, Mark.
Do you see him?</i>

1096
01:14:49,817 --> 01:14:51,690
<i>The man with the hearing aid
like Charles.</i>

1097
01:14:51,818 --> 01:14:53,015
<i>No. Where?</i>

1098
01:14:53,151 --> 01:14:56,020
<i>Right there,
with the shopping bag.</i>

1099
01:14:56,152 --> 01:14:58,025
<i>He's been following us
all around...</i>

1100
01:14:58,152 --> 01:15:00,274
<i>and he's following
us close.</i>

1101
01:15:00,404 --> 01:15:03,272
<i>It's nothing.
Don't worry about it.</i>

1102
01:15:11,906 --> 01:15:12,771
Angel...

1103
01:15:14,407 --> 01:15:16,196
<i>God, it will be so good...</i>

1104
01:15:16,324 --> 01:15:19,192
<i>to be finished
with all this.</i>

1105
01:15:19,324 --> 01:15:20,735
<i>I love you.</i>

1106
01:15:21,826 --> 01:15:23,200
It's all right,
baby.

1107
01:15:23,326 --> 01:15:24,654
It's all right.

1108
01:15:24,785 --> 01:15:26,657
<i>We're spending too much
time together here.</i>

1109
01:15:26,785 --> 01:15:29,654
<i>No. Let's stay
just a little longer.</i>

1110
01:15:33,412 --> 01:15:34,739
"Kill us."

1111
01:15:35,829 --> 01:15:38,698
He'd kill them
if he had a chance.

1112
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:41,319
<i>He'd kill us
if he got the chance.</i>

1113
01:15:41,455 --> 01:15:43,327
Oh, God.
What have I done?

1114
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:46,324
I have to destroy
the tapes.

1115
01:15:46,456 --> 01:15:49,325
I can't let it
happen again.

1116
01:15:49,457 --> 01:15:52,326
<i>I better get back.
It's almost 2:00.</i>

1117
01:15:52,458 --> 01:15:53,702
<i>Oh, please, don't go.</i>

1118
01:15:53,834 --> 01:15:56,916
A family was murdered
because of me.

1119
01:15:58,334 --> 01:15:59,247
I know.

1120
01:16:00,336 --> 01:16:01,709
I know, Harry.

1121
01:16:01,836 --> 01:16:03,246
Everything
will turn out.

1122
01:16:04,836 --> 01:16:07,705
Oh, God.
There's no protection.

1123
01:16:07,837 --> 01:16:10,207
I follow them
wherever they're going.

1124
01:16:10,338 --> 01:16:11,712
And I can hear them.

1125
01:16:11,838 --> 01:16:13,035
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

1126
01:16:13,172 --> 01:16:15,163
<i>Oh, wait, you have
something in your eye.</i>

1127
01:16:15,298 --> 01:16:16,162
<i>Yeah?</i>

1128
01:16:16,297 --> 01:16:17,672
<i>You really don't.</i>

1129
01:16:17,798 --> 01:16:20,168
<i>I just wanted
to kiss you.</i>

1130
01:16:20,299 --> 01:16:21,673
I forgive you.

1131
01:16:21,799 --> 01:16:23,173
I forgive you,
darling.

1132
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:25,623
I forgive you.

1133
01:17:55,656 --> 01:17:56,522
<i>Listen.</i>

1134
01:17:56,657 --> 01:17:59,407
<i>Listen. My name
is Harry Caul.</i>

1135
01:18:01,324 --> 01:18:02,866
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1136
01:18:04,826 --> 01:18:06,863
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

1137
01:18:06,992 --> 01:18:10,857
<i>I... I know you don't
know who I am...</i>

1138
01:18:10,994 --> 01:18:12,368
<i>but I know you.</i>

1139
01:18:13,995 --> 01:18:16,614
<i>There isn't much
to say about myself.</i>

1140
01:18:16,745 --> 01:18:17,610
<i>I...</i>

1141
01:18:27,748 --> 01:18:29,904
Sick when I was a boy.

1142
01:18:31,249 --> 01:18:34,615
<i>I was very sick
when I was a boy.</i>

1143
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:38,615
<i>I was paralyzed in my left arm
and my left leg.</i>

1144
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:40,457
<i>I couldn't walk
for six months.</i>

1145
01:18:40,585 --> 01:18:43,951
<i>One doctor said that
I'd probably never walk again.</i>

1146
01:18:46,753 --> 01:18:48,459
<i>My mother...</i>

1147
01:18:48,586 --> 01:18:51,455
<i>My mother used to
lower me into a hot bath.</i>

1148
01:18:51,587 --> 01:18:53,460
<i>It was therapy.</i>

1149
01:18:55,088 --> 01:18:56,286
<i>One time the doorbell rang...</i>

1150
01:18:56,422 --> 01:18:58,793
<i>and she went down
to answer it.</i>

1151
01:18:58,923 --> 01:19:00,119
<i>I started sliding down.</i>

1152
01:19:00,256 --> 01:19:01,631
<i>I could feel the water.</i>

1153
01:19:01,757 --> 01:19:04,625
<i>It started coming up
to my chin, to my nose.</i>

1154
01:19:04,758 --> 01:19:06,131
<i>When I woke up...</i>

1155
01:19:06,257 --> 01:19:09,126
<i>my body was all greasy
from the holy oil...</i>

1156
01:19:09,258 --> 01:19:11,131
<i>she put on my body.</i>

1157
01:19:11,259 --> 01:19:13,630
<i>I remember being
disappointed I survived.</i>

1158
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:14,956
<i>When I was 5...</i>

1159
01:19:15,093 --> 01:19:17,878
<i>my... my father introduced me
to a friend of his.</i>

1160
01:19:18,010 --> 01:19:20,879
<i>For no reason,
I hit him in the stomach.</i>

1161
01:19:21,011 --> 01:19:22,884
<i>He died a year later.</i>

1162
01:19:24,054 --> 01:19:26,922
<i>He'll kill you
if he gets a chance.</i>

1163
01:19:30,180 --> 01:19:32,847
<i>I'm not afraid of death.</i>

1164
01:19:39,683 --> 01:19:41,970
<i>I am afraid of murder.</i>

1165
01:20:40,157 --> 01:20:41,021
Meredith?

1166
01:20:45,658 --> 01:20:46,523
Hey.

1167
01:21:31,379 --> 01:21:32,243
Bitch.

1168
01:21:49,592 --> 01:21:51,962
Good morning.
May I help you?

1169
01:21:52,092 --> 01:21:53,466
Yes. Extension 765, please.

1170
01:21:53,592 --> 01:21:55,002
One moment,
please.

1171
01:21:56,593 --> 01:21:57,837
Director's office.

1172
01:21:57,969 --> 01:22:01,300
I'd like to speak to
the director's assistant, please.

1173
01:22:01,428 --> 01:22:03,466
Mr. Stett.
Uh, Mr. Martin Stett.

1174
01:22:03,595 --> 01:22:05,467
Mr. Caul is on the line.

1175
01:22:05,595 --> 01:22:07,005
One moment, please.

1176
01:22:10,097 --> 01:22:11,969
I'm sorry. That's
impossible now.

1177
01:22:12,097 --> 01:22:13,969
Can we get
back to you?

1178
01:22:14,097 --> 01:22:16,421
No, I-I-I have
to talk to him.

1179
01:22:16,556 --> 01:22:18,429
Can we have
your name again?

1180
01:22:18,557 --> 01:22:19,422
Caul.

1181
01:22:19,557 --> 01:22:21,928
Would you mind
spelling that?

1182
01:22:22,058 --> 01:22:24,428
C-A-U-L. Caul.

1183
01:22:24,559 --> 01:22:26,431
I'm putting you
on hold.

1184
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:32,430
Mr. Caul, we'll get
right back to you.

1185
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:34,930
No. You don't have
my telephone number.

1186
01:22:35,061 --> 01:22:35,926
Hello?

1187
01:23:29,992 --> 01:23:30,857
Yes?

1188
01:23:30,993 --> 01:23:32,864
Mr. Caul? This is
Martin Stett.

1189
01:23:32,993 --> 01:23:34,865
How did you get
this number?

1190
01:23:34,993 --> 01:23:36,866
We prepare dossiers
on everyone...

1191
01:23:36,993 --> 01:23:39,364
who comes in contact
with the director.

1192
01:23:39,495 --> 01:23:41,865
You know that means
we've been watching you.

1193
01:23:41,995 --> 01:23:43,369
We have the tapes.

1194
01:23:43,495 --> 01:23:44,870
They're perfectly safe.

1195
01:23:44,996 --> 01:23:48,861
The director was anxious
to hear them as soon as possible.

1196
01:23:48,996 --> 01:23:51,367
You seemed to be...
I don't know... disturbed.

1197
01:23:51,498 --> 01:23:54,366
I couldn't risk
you destroying our tapes.

1198
01:23:54,498 --> 01:23:56,869
You understand,
don't you, Mr. Caul?

1199
01:23:56,999 --> 01:24:00,697
Our tapes have nothing
to do with you.

1200
01:24:00,833 --> 01:24:02,705
Why don't you
come over now...

1201
01:24:02,834 --> 01:24:04,207
and bring
the photographs?

1202
01:24:04,334 --> 01:24:05,613
The director's here...

1203
01:24:05,751 --> 01:24:08,121
and he's prepared
to pay you in full.

1204
01:25:28,981 --> 01:25:32,347
<i>Every time I see
one of those old guys...</i>

1205
01:25:32,482 --> 01:25:33,855
<i>I think
the same thing.</i>

1206
01:25:35,482 --> 01:25:37,354
<i>What do you think?</i>

1207
01:25:37,483 --> 01:25:41,525
<i>I always think that he
was once somebody's baby boy.</i>

1208
01:25:41,651 --> 01:25:45,231
<i>Really. I... I do.</i>

1209
01:25:45,359 --> 01:25:48,027
<i>He was once somebody's
baby boy...</i>

1210
01:25:48,111 --> 01:25:51,642
<i>and he had a mother
and father who loved him...</i>

1211
01:25:51,778 --> 01:25:53,152
<i>and now, there he is...</i>

1212
01:25:53,279 --> 01:25:55,316
<i>half dead
on a park bench.</i>

1213
01:25:55,445 --> 01:25:57,816
<i>And where are his mother
or his father...</i>

1214
01:25:57,946 --> 01:25:59,440
<i>all his uncles now?</i>

1215
01:26:00,947 --> 01:26:03,732
<i>Anyway, that's what
I always think.</i>

1216
01:26:05,615 --> 01:26:06,989
<i>I always think...</i>

1217
01:26:07,115 --> 01:26:09,983
<i>how, when they had
the newspaper strike in New York...</i>

1218
01:26:10,116 --> 01:26:11,740
<i>more of those
old guys died.</i>

1219
01:26:11,867 --> 01:26:14,735
<i>50 of them froze to death
in one night.</i>

1220
01:26:14,868 --> 01:26:17,154
<i>Just because there were
no newspapers?</i>

1221
01:26:17,285 --> 01:26:19,441
<i>Really.
Keeps them warm.</i>

1222
01:26:19,577 --> 01:26:21,484
<i>Sounds terrible.</i>

1223
01:26:22,744 --> 01:26:26,075
<i>Who started this
conversation anyhow?</i>

1224
01:26:27,995 --> 01:26:28,944
<i>You did.</i>

1225
01:26:29,079 --> 01:26:30,987
<i>Did not.</i>

1226
01:26:31,121 --> 01:26:33,990
<i>Yes, you did.
You just don't remember it.</i>

1227
01:26:35,289 --> 01:26:38,158
<i>Oh, Mark, it's all right.
We can talk.</i>

1228
01:26:38,290 --> 01:26:40,162
<i>I can't stand it.</i>

1229
01:26:40,290 --> 01:26:42,328
<i>I can't stand it
any more.</i>

1230
01:26:42,457 --> 01:26:45,077
<i>You're going to
make me cry.</i>

1231
01:26:46,334 --> 01:26:49,202
<i>I know, honey,
I know. Me, too.</i>

1232
01:26:49,334 --> 01:26:50,199
<i>No, don't.</i>

1233
01:26:50,335 --> 01:26:51,199
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1234
01:26:51,334 --> 01:26:53,326
You want to
hear that again?

1235
01:26:53,461 --> 01:26:55,831
You want it
to be true!

1236
01:26:55,961 --> 01:26:57,667
No, I don't.

1237
01:26:57,795 --> 01:26:59,668
I just
want you to know...

1238
01:26:59,796 --> 01:27:01,288
whatever
you need to know.

1239
01:27:01,421 --> 01:27:02,583
That's all.

1240
01:27:02,713 --> 01:27:04,751
Your money's
on the table.

1241
01:27:06,839 --> 01:27:09,754
<i>Do you think we can do this?</i>

1242
01:27:11,048 --> 01:27:13,419
<i>I'm tired of drinking anyhow.</i>

1243
01:27:14,882 --> 01:27:16,957
<i>I'm tired of
mostly everything.</i>

1244
01:27:17,092 --> 01:27:18,465
<i>Tired of me?</i>

1245
01:27:18,592 --> 01:27:19,966
<i>Tired of you...</i>

1246
01:27:20,092 --> 01:27:21,585
<i>but not today.</i>

1247
01:27:22,968 --> 01:27:24,461
<i>Later in the week.</i>

1248
01:27:24,593 --> 01:27:26,833
<i>Sunday, maybe.</i>

1249
01:27:29,303 --> 01:27:31,508
<i>Sunday, definitely.</i>

1250
01:27:36,805 --> 01:27:39,341
<i>The Jack Tar Hotel.</i>

1251
01:27:39,472 --> 01:27:40,337
<i>3:00.</i>

1252
01:27:40,473 --> 01:27:43,175
<i>Room 773.</i>

1253
01:27:43,307 --> 01:27:45,677
<i>Look, Mark,
do you see him...</i>

1254
01:27:45,807 --> 01:27:48,177
<i>the man with the hearing aid
like Charles?</i>

1255
01:27:48,307 --> 01:27:49,256
<i>No. Where?</i>

1256
01:27:49,391 --> 01:27:52,509
<i>Right there, with
the shopping bag.</i>

1257
01:27:52,642 --> 01:27:54,799
Please count
your money outside.

1258
01:27:54,934 --> 01:27:57,305
<i>He's been following us all around.</i>

1259
01:27:57,435 --> 01:27:59,722
<i>He was
following us close.</i>

1260
01:27:59,852 --> 01:28:02,424
<i>It's nothing.
Don't worry about it.</i>

1261
01:28:16,649 --> 01:28:19,019
<i>God, it will be so good...</i>

1262
01:28:19,149 --> 01:28:21,519
<i>to be finished
with all this.</i>

1263
01:28:24,150 --> 01:28:25,560
<i>I love you.</i>

1264
01:28:28,902 --> 01:28:31,770
These are the pictures
you asked for.

1265
01:28:31,903 --> 01:28:34,308
<i>We're spending
too much time together here.</i>

1266
01:28:34,445 --> 01:28:36,815
<i>No. Let's stay
just a little longer.</i>

1267
01:28:36,945 --> 01:28:39,019
What will you
do to her?

1268
01:28:39,154 --> 01:28:41,690
<i>...kill us if he got the chance.</i>

1269
01:28:44,655 --> 01:28:47,570
<i>I think he's been
recording my telephone.</i>

1270
01:28:49,657 --> 01:28:52,572
<i>Listen, I'd better get back.
It's almost 2:00.</i>

1271
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:54,572
<i>No, please don't
go back there.</i>

1272
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:56,489
<i>Not just yet.</i>

1273
01:28:56,616 --> 01:29:00,861
<i>All right.
All right, honey. I won't.</i>

1274
01:29:04,994 --> 01:29:06,368
15,000 bucks.

1275
01:29:06,494 --> 01:29:10,739
That's not bad for a day's work,
is it, Mr. Caul?

1276
01:29:10,871 --> 01:29:12,945
What'll he do
with them?

1277
01:29:15,372 --> 01:29:16,402
We'll see.

1278
01:29:25,583 --> 01:29:29,411
<i>...kill us if he got the chance.</i>

1279
01:29:39,586 --> 01:29:43,712
<i>Later in the week.
Sunday, maybe.</i>

1280
01:29:46,463 --> 01:29:48,335
<i>Sunday, definitely.</i>

1281
01:29:51,631 --> 01:29:53,289
<i>The Jack Tar Hotel.</i>

1282
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:56,831
<i>3:00.</i>

1283
01:29:56,965 --> 01:29:58,956
<i>Room 773.</i>

1284
01:30:01,050 --> 01:30:02,211
Uh...

1285
01:30:02,342 --> 01:30:06,123
I wonder if you could give me
room 773.

1286
01:30:06,260 --> 01:30:08,297
773?

1287
01:30:09,677 --> 01:30:11,633
That is occupied, sir.

1288
01:30:15,012 --> 01:30:17,880
The rooms are all
basically the same, however.

1289
01:30:18,013 --> 01:30:18,961
Well...

1290
01:30:22,222 --> 01:30:25,091
Do you have a room
that would be, uh...

1291
01:30:25,223 --> 01:30:26,597
adjoining, uh...
close by?

1292
01:30:26,723 --> 01:30:28,382
Adjoining, just...

1293
01:30:28,516 --> 01:30:30,257
Yes, I do.

1294
01:30:30,391 --> 01:30:31,304
You do.

1295
01:34:42,205 --> 01:34:45,039
I'm tired of this lying,
all right?

1296
01:34:55,083 --> 01:34:57,121
<i>I can't stand it.</i>

1297
01:34:57,250 --> 01:34:59,538
<i>I can't stand it
any more.</i>

1298
01:34:59,668 --> 01:35:02,038
<i>You're going to make me cry.</i>

1299
01:35:02,169 --> 01:35:04,918
<i>I know. Me, too.</i>

1300
01:35:05,044 --> 01:35:06,288
<i>No, don't.</i>

1301
01:35:06,419 --> 01:35:08,411
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1302
01:35:08,546 --> 01:35:10,121
No idea!

1303
01:35:10,254 --> 01:35:12,126
This is horrible...

1304
01:35:15,463 --> 01:35:16,838
<i>I love you.</i>

1305
01:36:08,561 --> 01:36:12,009
Aah!

1306
01:36:13,895 --> 01:36:16,728
<i>Aah!</i>

1307
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:25,763
<i>It was stated that Nixon
would not deliver...</i>

1308
01:36:25,899 --> 01:36:28,684
<i>the State of the Union
message in person...</i>

1309
01:36:39,610 --> 01:36:41,850
<i>Will you cut that out?</i>

1310
01:36:41,985 --> 01:36:44,854
<i>How can you yell
at me like that?</i>

1311
01:36:44,986 --> 01:36:46,361
<i>And in my condition.</i>

1312
01:36:46,487 --> 01:36:49,854
<i>You're not fit to be
the father of my child.</i>

1313
01:36:49,988 --> 01:36:51,362
<i>Oh, what is this?</i>

1314
01:36:51,488 --> 01:36:53,360
<i>I'm trying
to act like Wilma.</i>

1315
01:36:53,488 --> 01:36:55,147
<i>Well, you're
overdoing it.</i>

1316
01:36:59,490 --> 01:37:01,232
<i>All right.
Pull over.</i>

1317
01:37:03,449 --> 01:37:04,943
<i>What's the big rush?</i>

1318
01:37:05,075 --> 01:37:07,280
<i>I'm taking my wife
to the hospital.</i>

1319
01:37:07,409 --> 01:37:08,783
<i>She's having
a baby.</i>

1320
01:37:08,909 --> 01:37:10,616
<i>I got to
hand it to you.</i>

1321
01:37:10,743 --> 01:37:12,022
<i>You got intestinal
fortitude.</i>

1322
01:37:12,160 --> 01:37:13,155
<i>Sit down, Fred.</i>

1323
01:37:13,286 --> 01:37:17,032
<i>You're wearing a groove
in the floor.</i>

1324
01:37:17,162 --> 01:37:18,536
<i>Look at Wilma
out there.</i>

1325
01:37:18,662 --> 01:37:20,534
<i>How can she be so calm...</i>

1326
01:37:20,662 --> 01:37:23,530
<i>when she knows
what I'm going through?</i>

1327
01:37:23,663 --> 01:37:25,037
<i>How are you, Fred?</i>

1328
01:37:25,164 --> 01:37:27,534
<i>How do you
think I am?</i>

1329
01:37:27,664 --> 01:37:29,536
<i>Betty, you go out there...</i>

1330
01:37:29,664 --> 01:37:31,905
<i>and tell Wilma
if she doesn't...</i>

1331
01:41:51,190 --> 01:41:52,268
Wait. Richard!

1332
01:41:52,356 --> 01:41:54,147
I want to see
the director.

1333
01:41:54,274 --> 01:41:55,850
He's not in today.

1334
01:41:57,067 --> 01:41:59,472
I'm afraid you'll
have to leave now.

1335
01:43:58,014 --> 01:43:59,388
Let's clear an aisle.

1336
01:43:59,515 --> 01:44:00,888
Let these people
through.

1337
01:44:01,014 --> 01:44:02,389
Come on,
clear the way.

1338
01:44:02,515 --> 01:44:03,889
We'll answer your
questions upstairs.

1339
01:44:04,015 --> 01:44:05,390
Let these
people through.

1340
01:44:05,516 --> 01:44:07,009
Let these
people through.

1341
01:44:07,141 --> 01:44:08,421
Just one question.

1342
01:44:08,559 --> 01:44:09,553
No, please.

1343
01:44:09,683 --> 01:44:12,302
Do you suspect foul play
in the accident?

1344
01:44:12,434 --> 01:44:14,260
What about your
corporate control?

1345
01:44:14,393 --> 01:44:16,265
Will your stock
now give you...

1346
01:44:16,393 --> 01:44:17,259
controlling interest?

1347
01:44:17,394 --> 01:44:20,013
What kind of insurance
do you have?

1348
01:44:20,145 --> 01:44:21,341
That's
an unfair question.

1349
01:44:26,146 --> 01:44:28,018
<i>What do you think?</i>

1350
01:44:28,146 --> 01:44:31,015
<i>I don't know what
I'm getting him for Christmas.</i>

1351
01:44:31,147 --> 01:44:33,517
<i>He's already
got everything.</i>

1352
01:44:33,648 --> 01:44:36,599
<i>Doesn't need anything any more.</i>

1353
01:44:39,482 --> 01:44:42,517
Do you feel there's an enemy
within the company?

1354
01:44:45,359 --> 01:44:47,232
<i>He's not hurting anybody.</i>

1355
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:50,027
<i>Neither are we.</i>

1356
01:44:50,152 --> 01:44:52,476
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1357
01:44:52,611 --> 01:44:53,476
...drunk driving?

1358
01:44:58,238 --> 01:44:59,516
<i>I can't stand it.</i>

1359
01:44:59,654 --> 01:45:02,688
<i>I can't stand it
any more.</i>

1360
01:45:02,822 --> 01:45:03,900
Aah!

1361
01:45:06,031 --> 01:45:06,979
Take it!

1362
01:45:07,115 --> 01:45:08,773
<i>Take it!</i>

1363
01:45:13,908 --> 01:45:16,232
<i>Do you think we can do this?</i>

1364
01:45:16,367 --> 01:45:18,275
<i>Later in the week.</i>

1365
01:45:18,409 --> 01:45:21,242
<i>Sunday, maybe.</i>

1366
01:45:21,368 --> 01:45:24,237
<i>Sunday, definitely.</i>

1367
01:45:24,369 --> 01:45:26,160
<i>The Jack Tar Hotel.</i>

1368
01:45:27,495 --> 01:45:28,360
<i>3:00.</i>

1369
01:45:28,495 --> 01:45:30,533
<i>Room 773.</i>

1370
01:45:33,955 --> 01:45:36,870
<i>He'd kill us
if he got the chance.</i>

1371
01:46:10,131 --> 01:46:11,374
Hello.

1372
01:46:13,132 --> 01:46:14,375
Hello.

1373
01:47:08,145 --> 01:47:09,473
Hello.

1374
01:47:17,022 --> 01:47:18,137
Hello.

1375
01:47:18,273 --> 01:47:20,976
We know that you know, Mr. Caul.

1376
01:47:21,107 --> 01:47:23,976
For your own sake,
don't get involved any further.

1377
01:47:24,108 --> 01:47:25,980
We'll be listening
to you.
