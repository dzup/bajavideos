1
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:45,100
What would happen if you knew
that you were never going to die?

2
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,544
That there's no way to stop
existing?

3
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:54,485
What would happen if
you knew that?

4
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:57,687
So real such as touching
or seeing...

5
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,488
What would happen if you knew
that this doesn't end up here?

6
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:07,027
That we come back many times...

7
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,331
And we forgot every
time we come back...

8
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:16,573
This time I remember
everything from the beginning...

9
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:21,147
But it seems that nobody
listens to me...

10
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:26,349
This was the day that
my family helped me...

11
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:36,424
The great path is not so difficult

12
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:42,264
For those that don't have any preferences.

13
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:48,232
When both love and hate are absent.

14
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:57,345
Everything becomes
clear and illuminated

15
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:04,148
However if you make the
slightest distinction,

16
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:11,423
the sky and the earth will
become distant forever.

17
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:24,976
If you want to see the truth, don't hold
any opinions in favor or against.

18
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:35,619
The struggle between what
you like and dislike,

19
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:40,659
It's a mind's sickness.

20
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:49,459
The struggle between what you
like and dislike,

21
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:53,621
It's a mind's sickness.

22
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:05,439
It's a society's sickness.

23
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:14,379
It's my disease and yours too.

24
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:34,706
Hello

25
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:35,969
Who are you with?

26
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:41,147
I've just got out from
the shower... I'm coming

27
00:04:41,182 --> 00:04:44,048
- Are you pulling my legs?
- No.

28
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,652
Come on... Come on... COME ON!

29
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:59,953
Mom. She always in trouble
she never tells me about them.

30
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,461
As if I didn't know what was happening.

31
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,324
I know she can't pay the bills,

32
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,361
that's why I never ask her
for anything.

33
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:11,235
I don't want to be
another problem for her.

34
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:15,071
I don't know what to do
so that she doesn't worry.

35
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:33,958
That's why... keep on moving...
if you're already in heaven...

36
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,674
I love her anyway... she is my mom.

37
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:03,679
My princess, you go to work every day...
Just one day without working...

38
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:06,025
You've worked yesterday already

39
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:06,924
I have to go.

40
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,059
Stay here with El Mono.

41
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,564
Come on! They're gonna kill me...
kill me... they're they're gonna kill me

42
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,500
Who's gonna kill you, you're so
heavy metal. Come here!

43
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:17,094
Ow! I'm leaving.

44
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:20,652
No. No. Come here!
Where are you going?

45
00:07:20,687 --> 00:07:23,301
Come here, stay here with little Mono.

46
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:44,587
It's my sister, you idiot.

47
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:54,736
So, are you staying here with
me, or you are not darling?

48
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:03,147
Dogo! Dogo!

49
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:05,650
How's it going?

50
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,084
When are you going
to give me the money?

51
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,754
- I still don't know.
- Are you going to give me the money back?

52
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:10,655
I don't know... it's not
up to me Laura

53
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,716
You can't just say "I don't know"...
I need an answer... your mom has called me.

54
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,993
My mom? Don't you
get how this works?

55
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:18,019
What do you want, a guarantee
signed by a public notary?

56
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,323
No... I'm just asking you.
Are we really friends?

57
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,468
Yeah... so what?

58
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,370
So, you gotta know something,
some kind of intuition of what's going on...

59
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:29,242
it's the only thing that I'm asking you...
just tell me more or less what's going on...

60
00:08:29,277 --> 00:08:31,107
What's going on?! Laura,
the world is a mess,

61
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:34,974
or at least it seems that, but the cosmic
order has everything under control.

62
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,414
You're such an idiot.

63
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:39,350
Am I?

64
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:40,986
What's wrong with you?
Do you like see me suffering?

65
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,588
Am I making you suffer?
You suffer all by yourself!

66
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:44,188
You're not telling me anything...

67
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:46,353
I'm involved in this mess and you...
you turn all into a mystery.

68
00:08:46,388 --> 00:08:48,483
Ok, I've heard you Laura, call
me tomorrow to see if I've got news...

69
00:08:56,168 --> 00:09:00,605
Close to my house lives a girl
that sucks your dick for 5 bucks.

70
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,576
I've known her since she was a kid,
that's why she doesn't charge me if

71
00:09:03,611 --> 00:09:05,409
I wanna touch her tits.

72
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:09,710
She lives two houses from my
dealer so when I go to buy pot I meet her.

73
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:12,583
She says to me... "Boy".

74
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:14,586
What are you listening to Camilo?

75
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:17,251
Good morning... Shall I
turn this a bit down?

76
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,649
Yes... please!

77
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:29,090
Ahh... this turned bad...
What do you drink, Cami? Milk?

78
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,003
- Yes
- There's none left...

79
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:32,027
Well...

80
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,474
It's got hop.

81
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:46,448
Is this the guy of the glycerin soaps?

82
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:57,186
- So... How are you doing at school?
- Fine

83
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:59,330
- Fine?
- Yeah

84
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,063
Are you gonna give me a kiss?

85
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:09,707
My aunt Ama lives in her own world...
she doesn't

86
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:15,442
think God lives in ours...
because it's unsafe... uncertain.

87
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,140
But there's something about her
I like,

88
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:22,118
beside she's always cleaning...
her smell.

89
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:30,785
- Ok Auntie, I have to go to school
- Go, go. Don't be late.

90
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,330
Your overall is a disaster...

91
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:55,076
- Which way did she come from?
- No... I didn't see her when she arrived

92
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:00,024
What's going on?

93
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,894
Everyday you ask
the same thing...

94
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:03,694
Which way did your daughter come from?!

95
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:05,492
I don't know anything about your daughter...

96
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:23,012
Juli, give me another double
coffee with three croissants...

97
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:34,358
- Dogo
- What's up Mono?

98
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:37,365
Everything's good man?
A bit weird, isn't it?

99
00:11:37,367 --> 00:11:39,330
Where did you sleep man?

100
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:43,529
At the Jack Sparrow Hotel. Where
am I going to sleep asshole? At home!

101
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:45,797
At your house?

102
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:51,538
Yeah. Don't you smoke a morning joint?
Change your face...

103
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,778
Who is it?

104
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:56,805
Who's following you? What's up man?
You prick.

105
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:20,270
Ama... what are you doing?
You didn't have to do that.

106
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:24,669
Just helping you a little bit...
I saw Camilito.

107
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:26,703
Did he go to school?

108
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:28,074
Yes

109
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:37,181
Don't you work today?

110
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,180
They're on vacation.

111
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,760
Don't say... so nice... travelling abroad.

112
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,293
And you... you're not
going to the store today?

113
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,019
Are you ok Lau?
What's wrong?

114
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,749
I can't do it, I can't, I can't afford

115
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:21,732
I can't afford anything,
the telephone,

116
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:26,405
my mobile phone, not even
Camilo's books. I owe two months rent...

117
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,705
they're going to cut off the water...

118
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,605
the water! How is it possible
that they cut off the water?!

119
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,012
Doesn't it come from the
river, the sea, the rain

120
00:13:33,047 --> 00:13:34,206
...and I have to pay 200
pesos per month?!

121
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,617
And, they never came to install
the water meter!

122
00:13:37,652 --> 00:13:39,420
I don't have the time to go there
and ask for it.

123
00:13:39,422 --> 00:13:40,785
The credit I asked to paint
the house

124
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,623
I couldn't pay it back in time and now the
expenses, the taxes, the interest

125
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:47,251
from I don't know what...
they're going to take it out of my salary...

126
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:50,325
what do I do?
Have you got any money to lend me?

127
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:55,566
Have you got any
money to lend me?

128
00:13:58,604 --> 00:13:59,536
Can you see?

129
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,011
I don't forget

130
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,570
I owe you already from the
three previous times I've asked you.

131
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,649
And, if you lend me some
now, you won't see the money again.

132
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,082
It's the way it is. Who's gonna
lend me money? No one.

133
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,420
What do I do?

134
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:27,665
- Work
- I work 10 hours a day!

135
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:33,070
- 1,500 pesos per month... it's not enough.
- I make 1,400

136
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,471
You live in the countryside.
You don't pay rent,

137
00:14:36,473 --> 00:14:39,471
you don't have a child!
This is the city.

138
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,585
The suburbs are not the same
as the countryside...

139
00:14:44,587 --> 00:14:49,585
...and Dogo, doesn't he help you?

140
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:54,623
- Yeah, he made me ask your Mom again
- And?

141
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,732
I gave it to your brother to do
some business... which are going to fail.

142
00:14:59,767 --> 00:15:04,032
Laura, don't say that, he
never fails on these things.

143
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:15,639
- You better pray.
- Laura, everything's going to be fine.

144
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,352
- Well, I have to go to work.
- Yes.

145
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:33,395
Look, the guy with long hair left this
plant for you... poor thing, it's so dry...

146
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,663
so I put it into water to see if it revives.

147
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:49,008
- Can I read you something darling?
- Yes, my love.

148
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:52,383
The great path is not difficult
for those who don't have preferences...

149
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:56,188
When both love and hate are absent,
everything becomes clear and illuminated...

150
00:15:56,223 --> 00:16:00,059
However, if you make the slightest
distinction, the sky and the earth will

151
00:16:00,094 --> 00:16:03,429
become distant forever.
If you want to see the truth,

152
00:16:03,464 --> 00:16:06,730
never have opinions in
favor or against. The struggle...

153
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:10,569
between what one likes and what one
doesn't like is the sickness of the mind

154
00:16:10,604 --> 00:16:19,529
Don't take too long to wake up
The scorpion will sting, will sting

155
00:16:19,564 --> 00:16:28,454
Its poison doesn't know how
to wait, like the sun and the moon,

156
00:16:28,489 --> 00:16:37,362
the wind, the pen, the earth, the skin.

157
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:43,133
We have designed a
game so we kill each other.

158
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:47,298
A kind of fight for power
yourself to squeeze yourself into being.

159
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:53,101
It's important that you're
ok in order to see clearly...

160
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:57,012
Who loves you, who will kill you.

161
00:16:57,216 --> 00:17:01,954
It's important that you're
ok in order to see clearly...

162
00:17:01,989 --> 00:17:07,688
Who loves you, who will kill you.

163
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,367
...with an endless variety
of shadows and tones...

164
00:17:36,402 --> 00:17:39,182
...with an endless variety
of shadows and tones...

165
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:47,263
My Grandma is really crazy. She had kids
all over the place. My Aunts and my Dad...

166
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:50,233
...can you dial Lucia for me?
... have different fathers.

167
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:56,573
- Hello.
- Hi Damian?

168
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:59,736
- Her new boyfriend helps her a lot...
- How are you? This is Billy speaking...

169
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,597
- Yeah I know.
- Is Lucia there?

170
00:18:02,632 --> 00:18:05,016
...and, he's a millionaire...

171
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:07,079
I was specting to talk with her.

172
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:11,981
- You want to talk to her?
- No... she does

173
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:17,254
Oh... Lu... you've got a phone call.

174
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:24,164
Mom

175
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:29,231
- How are you, my darling?
- Hi Mom

176
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:34,072
- Your brother?
- Umm, I haven't seen him.

177
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:37,174
Can you tell him I'm looking
for him? That he should call me.

178
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:38,946
Yes

179
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:43,579
- Good... Love you
- Love you too mom

180
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,359
- Bye sweetie.
- Kisses

181
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:14,013
Hi, I'm Homer. You have
a text message. Wanna beer?

182
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:30,000
...Camilo put it on.
- Homer

183
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:39,077
If you're not going to kiss the earth
It'll do the same when you fall on your face

184
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:43,580
I grew up with Mommy saying
"I warned you, don't touch that", but...

185
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:48,687
Without the power to stop it, the internal
power is your temple and the patience and

186
00:19:48,722 --> 00:19:56,061
the spirits will protect you
The wasps' nest has moved,

187
00:19:56,096 --> 00:19:59,715
I'm the salamander elf,
mounted in the whirlpools.

188
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:03,300
Oh, God gave me the word and for
this he came.

189
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:07,174
Mission completed.
I told him and I'm telling...

190
00:20:07,176 --> 00:20:11,174
...him, flowing.
I found the way to go in life.

191
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,126
When somebody asks you,

192
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:39,537
with great sincerity; Where can I find God?
Don't try to evade the question.

193
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:50,579
Tell them that God is inside them.
And if they ask you... Where inside me?

194
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:59,555
Well... you must search inside...
forth from But where should we search?

195
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:06,392
In your heart. Yes, of course.

196
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:10,559
But in which part of my heart?

197
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:20,074
Do you want a vision of God?
A clear signal from the Creator?

198
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:25,614
Abandon your wishes... Shake them away.
Look at yourselves into the mirror...

199
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:34,185
For this we've got our mind,
a spirit with will power,

200
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:45,094
The worst enemy in this race
of finding God Is desire.

201
00:21:53,312 --> 00:22:03,950
Be free, Be divine.
Althought sometimes it's difficult.

202
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:26,010
- Let's go and look for him man
- Where?

203
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:33,408
- Don't know... what do I know... to a park
- I can't believe he did this to me

204
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:41,991
- What? This guy makes deals with cops.
- A lot of drugs. It was bound to happen...

205
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:44,761
- What? Is this your first time?
- For what?

206
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:50,000
That they got you so easily,
that they fucked with you like this.

207
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:52,494
Welcome to the club!

208
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:05,450
- Where did you sleep Mono?
- When you get your proud touched,

209
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:07,418
you start bothering me and your sister...

210
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:10,122
No... where did you sleep? Nothing else...
just answer me where did you sleep.

211
00:23:10,157 --> 00:23:10,986
Where I always sleep.

212
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:18,023
Dogo... don't be afraid...
I'm trembling too.

213
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:24,365
Let's go... let's do it.

214
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:28,562
How Christ loves us, no one...

215
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:33,777
He guides us like stars.
He's my body.

216
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:43,187
The bread of our love.
Nourish us... I will nourish your love.

217
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:55,198
He is my blood, come
and drink, because I am life,

218
00:23:55,233 --> 00:24:04,309
I am love, your eternal love, take us Lord.
How Christ loves us, no one ever knew

219
00:24:04,344 --> 00:24:09,008
how to love. He guides us like stars...
He's...

220
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,452
Ama... Ama...

221
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:24,628
what are you doing?

222
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:32,262
Hello? Hi Dad... yeah...
I couldn't find the phone... yeah... yeah.

223
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:36,705
Martin get out. Martin please
get out of the bathroom.

224
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,916
Luci, stop messing around and
come out... Camilo just got here... Come on.

225
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:42,878
Luci... my beautiful Aunt Luci...
she's the only one that looks

226
00:26:42,913 --> 00:26:48,128
at me straight in the eyes and
talks to me as if I were her equal.

227
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:55,407
You little twerp... Do you
know how much I love you?

228
00:26:55,614 --> 00:27:01,075
She's like a mom, I know she loves
me like my mom and dad do.

229
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:06,253
I know but it's better because
she's not my mom... and I have fun.

230
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:13,995
Yeah, she's a little bit weak,
but we are all a bit lost...

231
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:24,339
- And your mom?
- I don't know.

232
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:25,976
And what about grandpa?
No hug for him?

233
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:31,646
Grandpa isn't really my grandpa...
but Luci loves me so much that he thinks

234
00:27:31,681 --> 00:27:37,282
I'm his grandson, neither my dad or my
mom are his kids, but no one argues,

235
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:41,582
he's really convinced... so,
he's my grandpa.

236
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,093
He takes care of Luci so
much that he doesn't let her breathe.

237
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,689
- Would you like a banana milk shake?
- Yeah!

238
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:12,590
What?

239
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,152
Did you talk to me?

240
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:22,565
I have to go downtown to pay

241
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:27,537
some bills from your father...
I mean, because of the dinner tonight.

242
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:29,936
I'm also going downtown...

243
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,138
Oh... Ok. And Belen?

244
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:39,612
I'll pick her up. If you want I can
drive you home after that... around 7 or 8.

245
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:42,178
No, that's ok... Thanks.

246
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:46,703
It's strange you didn't go away...
You love travelling.

247
00:28:46,738 --> 00:28:50,185
Yeah, but not with my parents.
Can you bring me some wine?

248
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:54,459
- Wine? At midday?
- Ama, please, can you relax...

249
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,463
Sorry... I'll bring you
some in a sec

250
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:14,014
I'm not going to be able
to give it back to you.

251
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:17,250
It doesn't matter. Take it.

252
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:25,118
Living like this sucks

253
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:31,100
- t's weird...
- I can't get out of it.

254
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:37,633
What if you leave... I don't know...
Go to another town, another place?

255
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:41,469
I can't. First I have to solve
the problem with the bank...

256
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,986
How are you doing?

257
00:29:57,228 --> 00:30:02,689
In love... Behind a glass.

258
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:08,572
It makes me think of
something else... I think

259
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:14,071
But every time it comes
back even stronger, doesn't it?

260
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:22,077
- What?
- The reality that you believe in

261
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:30,451
- From where?
- For me it comes back like ethereally.

262
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:41,204
- What?!
- I don't know if it really matters...

263
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:44,124
What doesn't matter, that I don't
understand anything you're saying

264
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,009
...or whatever it is that
you're talking about?

265
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:47,009
It doesn't matter.

266
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:53,106
And I'll tell you more...
Cañas is gonna be Boca's coach...

267
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:54,675
look who's coming.

268
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:59,054
- Look at those characters!
- They're here!

269
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:03,326
What's up man!

270
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:07,031
Dear Monito... How are you big man?
Always insisting with the guitar.

271
00:31:07,066 --> 00:31:10,057
Yeah, of course! I support you.

272
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:17,207
Dogo, brother, Everything cool?
Check that you've got a bill to pay...

273
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:26,282
- Julio!
- How's that going?

274
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:29,445
- Yeah... wait a sec...
- Yeah, ok.

275
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:33,613
- How's everything going Cami?
- Yeah, everything's fine

276
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:38,429
Should I go on with the
music or go on with the...?

277
00:31:38,464 --> 00:31:40,260
Keep on going with music.

278
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:43,100
Oh man what a morning. What's up?

279
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:46,659
Ok. Look.

280
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,036
120 pesos plus...

281
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:54,045
no, no, ok... but you know that this guy
cancelled the old bill he had

282
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,379
Ok, it's ok that he pays
the old bill he owed

283
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:59,110
but he also has to pay the new one...
it's 500 bucks!

284
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:01,514
Yeah fine, but you tell things as
if they were easy to say at night.

285
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,654
No, I'm not telling you that the night is
easy, I'm just asking you to charge people!

286
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,281
It's nice that you make
friends, but charge them!

287
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:10,054
Look at the cash register
It's empty man. Nothing but papers.

288
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:11,388
You don't have any
money left to pay?

289
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:14,226
I don't have nothing. I'm broken.

290
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:15,966
Ok, I'll charge him, I'll charge him but
let's see how we solve the problem now

291
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:19,629
Come on, just do it, put your face and,
charge them it's over! It's enough...

292
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:22,438
it seems easy to talk in the morning
about what happened yesterday night.

293
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:24,035
Ok, I'll come tonight... done.

294
00:32:24,037 --> 00:32:27,035
You will see that this
chat we're having...

295
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:28,334
Is this guy coming tonight?

296
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:31,215
He's coming but he said that this
week he'll pay 50% of what he owes

297
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,409
Yeah.

298
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:40,053
- Isn't it dangerous?
- Well... it depends.

299
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:43,323
- On what?
- On the point of view, Laura... for you it

300
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:47,732
could be horrible, but for me,
I couldn't give a shit...

301
00:32:47,767 --> 00:32:49,529
Anyway, it's not a matter
of life or death, is it?

302
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,335
- Family!
- You were just missing this guy...

303
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,099
...to complicate things right now.
- I feel like home here.

304
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,304
That's what you feel like.

305
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,041
What, I can't even speak?

306
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:03,040
You don't know that the first
thing you have to do to be here

307
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:04,315
- Yeah, I was gonna do it!
- Give it to me man.

308
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,716
- Everything in its time.
- Give it to me.

309
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:08,946
- This is how you're gonna be buddy.
- Now we can chat.

310
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:14,715
Mono, we're gonna be clear... I don't
want to have any problems because of you...

311
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:20,598
And I don't want you to put my daughter
at any risk. Do what you know doing,

312
00:33:20,633 --> 00:33:23,624
- This comes out naturally?!
- Stop with your bullshit.

313
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:25,601
It comes out naturally?

314
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:28,696
- Yeah, music comes naturally out of me.
- Fine, then break up with your girlfriend.

315
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:33,074
- What could be so horrible to me?
- That he doesn't show up...

316
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:36,771
- Is that possible?
- I don't know.

317
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:43,710
You set up the deal, you are
responsible for it... get angry... move...

318
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:47,091
Push them into the rhythm...
I'm going crazy. I need an answer!

319
00:33:47,126 --> 00:33:49,082
You don't seem to get
how serious this is for me!

320
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:52,487
It seems to me that you don't
understand anything about anything Laura.

321
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,228
What is it that I don't understand?

322
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:56,799
You come, you want to do some
business with someone...

323
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:59,067
...you don't even know,
you want to take it all,

324
00:33:59,069 --> 00:34:02,067
fast and on top of that
you want me to worry

325
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:06,543
about my mom finding this out?
You're Heidi! Do you listen to yourself?

326
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:12,440
Do you listen to what you're saying? Are you
even aware of who we're dealing with?

327
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:17,121
Do you think I'm Ricky <<the Marvellous>>?
That we are dancing at the cumbia disco?

328
00:34:17,156 --> 00:34:18,281
Push them into the rhythm?!

329
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,452
Serious?! Do you know what's serious?

330
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:25,362
Do you understand
that we are slaves of a sinister power?

331
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:32,667
That they're capable of destroying their
own Twin Towers and kill their own people?

332
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:37,397
In order to invent an enemy!
They have all the scientists in the world

333
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:41,002
putting chips and shit in mobile phones
but they still don't know how are

334
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,378
they gonna save us from this
ecological social disaster...

335
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:50,253
that is serious Laura! That's serious!

336
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:57,693
The USA is a bluff Laura it's a lie.

337
00:34:57,728 --> 00:35:00,424
They're gonna fall in any moment.
Everything is gonna fall down at any time.

338
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:04,934
- Can I play a song for her?
- We don't have to deal with this guy.

339
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:09,040
Can't I sing her one song? I wrote it
for her. One little song... then I'll leave.

340
00:35:09,075 --> 00:35:09,972
I'm with you...

341
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:19,472
- Go go go...
- Yeah!

342
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:21,712
- I'm leaving... I'd prefer to
resolve this little issue.

343
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:41,137
And the gods will dance at our side
And we'll erase the past,

344
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:50,103
and heaven will run side by side.
Like a dance, for two people in love.

345
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:59,757
And fly and enjoy and feel.
And abandon the laws of fear,

346
00:35:59,792 --> 00:36:07,465
painting you with the color
of the sunrise... eternal flower

347
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,532
What does that have to do with it?

348
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:13,102
How can you ask me this? All the governments
know the exact moment...

349
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:15,105
that any person on earth will go to have
a shit, Laura. They have total impunity,

350
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:20,077
they can change anything with the press...
so, it just gets worst,

351
00:36:20,112 --> 00:36:21,579
out of control...
Can you see the huge paradox?!

352
00:36:21,614 --> 00:36:22,612
I don't know what a paradox is.

353
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:23,045
A paradox Laura is controllable
and uncontrollable at the same time.

354
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:31,053
And the gods will dance at our side,
and we'll erase the past,

355
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:39,587
and the heaven will run side by side.
Like a dance, for two people in love.

356
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:53,277
Poison get out of me, cause it burns
Poison get out of me, you're burning me.

357
00:36:53,312 --> 00:36:55,308
A paradox is controllable
and uncontrollable at the same time.

358
00:36:55,343 --> 00:36:57,305
...they control everything,
but they can't control anything.

359
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:01,085
You know why? Because man
Man never learned how to control himself,

360
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,519
he never learned how to
observe, never learned how to love...

361
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:08,081
All this technological strength, all this
high level science is right here... ok?

362
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:12,461
...the atomic power that illuminates
the world is an atomic bomb Laura,

363
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:15,171
it's a double-bladed sword,
Do you understand? Has...

364
00:37:15,173 --> 00:37:20,171
...this power has to be supported
by a spiritual power.

365
00:37:20,206 --> 00:37:24,275
But right now, humanity is like this...
There is no spirituality Laura.

366
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:26,140
The world is on the verge of
self-destruction at any moment...

367
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:29,647
Right side of the body, left side of
the brain... left side of the body,

368
00:37:29,682 --> 00:37:33,382
right side of the brain...
now what? They've mixed up

369
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:36,079
chemistry with computers.
Do you know what does that mean?

370
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:38,417
It's lethal and wonderful
at the same time.

371
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,925
...and it's normal that with
all these problems I have,

372
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,190
I don't give a shit about my
mom's 10 grands, Laura

373
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:51,259
Have you forgotten that I
have Mono's sound system?

374
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:58,134
What does Mono have to do with it?
What does he have to do with us Laura?

375
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:00,344
If your friend doesn't
show up today...

376
00:38:00,346 --> 00:38:02,344
I'll sell all the equipment...
and you can go

377
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:05,650
to hell with the whole group of
assholes you are surround with.

378
00:38:05,685 --> 00:38:07,413
Why do you insult Laura?
I knew you were gonna

379
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:09,017
come out with this...

380
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:12,945
don't fuck with me Laura!

381
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:20,995
Put that away, put that away.
Get me out of this mess.

382
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:24,599
What did you think? That I was going to give
you all that money without being covered?!

383
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:33,643
Poison, get out of me, cause it burns

384
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:39,412
Mono is like a bee. He looks
evil... but he makes honey...

385
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:46,182
he's got something special, magical...
he's like Maradona with a guitar.

386
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:51,956
He should be playing the guitar
in a stadium, but he doesn't want to.

387
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:56,298
He prefers to play for my
aunt... I would do the same.

388
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:06,899
One thousand nights I was
crying, dancing to your shadow.

389
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:11,682
Wait Laura, don't you realize that
what you're saying is irrational?

390
00:39:11,717 --> 00:39:14,913
What does Mono have
to do with our business?

391
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:17,455
Laura, do you know what would
happen to him if he can't play,

392
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:18,487
if he doesn't make music?

393
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:22,618
And do you what can happen to me?! I'll
sell everything today! I need the money now!

394
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,660
Calm down! Calm down!

395
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,965
So, I'll have to kill you if these
guys don't show. I'll have to kill you then?

396
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,336
You couldn't kill a fly... behind
those tattoos and your mean face...,

397
00:39:31,371 --> 00:39:34,637
you're just a little shit that
doesn't asume his life... Let's see,

398
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,677
how are you gonna kill me?
With Zen poems?

399
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:39,677
With that gun you've never
used in your life?

400
00:39:39,712 --> 00:39:41,338
With quantum physics?
I can't tolerate you anymore!

401
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:42,211
Laura can you calm down!

402
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:43,337
If that money doesn't appear today,
I'm selling...

403
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,737
...everything...
who do you think you are?

404
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:46,314
Laura!

405
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:54,247
That's it, Monito, you're done.
We heard enough enough

406
00:39:56,093 --> 00:40:00,325
Ok... he turned into a pumpkin.
Dogo! I'm done.

407
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:05,096
Let's go.

408
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,098
Camilo! Camilo!

409
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:20,543
Dad... That's the way he is.
I love him so so much...

410
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:27,158
he says he's a Samurai... that's why he
never takes his gun out... it's strange,

411
00:40:27,193 --> 00:40:31,754
a Samurai here in the neirborhood...
he says that it's a sword.

412
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:36,691
If he takes it out it's to kill or die...
I know that's how it is...

413
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:40,499
he's not uncertain...
he brought me up...

414
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:45,675
what I want more than anything in life,
is that he never takes his sword out...

415
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:53,182
What's the matter? Is it Mom?
She is getting worse...

416
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,581
...you know that her dad...
her dad died because...

417
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:02,281
...he couldn't find his ID...
do you understand?

418
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:06,358
- No
- He couldn't find his ID

419
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:12,094
...and he died from a heart attack... do you
get it? They're all crazy in her family.

420
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:17,132
- Is there any problem?
- No

421
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:18,738
Karma, isn't it?

422
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:29,017
Did you do my...
what is it called?

423
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:31,771
- Huh?
- What was it called the...

424
00:41:31,806 --> 00:41:33,756
- Astrology chat.
- Did you do mine?

425
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:37,287
No, tomorrow morning I'll
bring it for you for sure.

426
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:40,190
It shows the future
and everything right?

427
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:48,305
I'm totally into it? Personality, the sun,
the moon... Can you explain it to me?

428
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,705
- Yeah, we sit down together
and I explain it to you.

429
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:55,210
- 50 pesos
- We take it off your bill.

430
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:06,423
Man... you have to be strong, strong.
You don't get poisoned with the things

431
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:11,241
...that happen around. Are you listening?
You must fly high man.

432
00:42:11,276 --> 00:42:16,025
You don't care about me or your mother.
Are you listening to me?

433
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:24,073
If we live or we die, it doesn't
matter... you must fly high, high...

434
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:29,246
so that stones can't reach you... if I shoot
you, it shouldn't reach you... can you hear?

435
00:42:29,281 --> 00:42:30,148
I'm just like him...

436
00:42:30,183 --> 00:42:30,982
Are you Istening to me?

437
00:42:31,017 --> 00:42:31,782
My word is worth it...

438
00:42:31,817 --> 00:42:32,781
Give me your word

439
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:34,685
That's why it's so hard to give it to him.

440
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,482
Camilo, do I have your word?

441
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:40,588
But he's my dad, I want him to be happy.

442
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:55,306
You have breakfast, milkshakes...
we take off the astrology chart.

443
00:42:55,341 --> 00:42:59,572
- Perfect. Awesome... thanks.
- When can you pay me back?

444
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:04,581
If I'm still alive, or if I'm not
in a mental institute,

445
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:06,581
next week I promise I'll
pay you back.

446
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:08,450

447
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:22,463
Cami. That Homer
ring tone is great.

448
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:30,005
Let's go. Thank you.

449
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:43,717
Martin please... Martin! You know that
your father doesn't want you to... Martin!

450
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:53,562
Ama, do me a favor, why don't you
call him and tell him that

451
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:56,266
I'm taking his car... then, right after
don't forget to tell him about the Jacuzzi,

452
00:43:56,301 --> 00:43:57,468
...he'll love that... come on!

453
00:43:57,503 --> 00:43:58,765
- Fine!
- Oh yeah?

454
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:00,536
It doesn't matter, I'm going to call him.

455
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:04,974
Are you going to call him? Ok but...
tell him everything, I'll wait for you here.

456
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:14,210
No Martin! No Martin! Martin please no!

457
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:19,390
- Ama just get in please.
- No Martin, this is bad, really bad.

458
00:44:19,425 --> 00:44:22,057
- Ama
- This is a bad omen Martin.

459
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:24,728
- A bad omen?
- No, no, you don't have any idea Martin...

460
00:44:24,763 --> 00:44:28,132
- What?
- Please... this is bad, this is really bad.

461
00:44:28,167 --> 00:44:30,134
- I see death. I see death everywhere.
- Where?

462
00:44:30,169 --> 00:44:31,400
- I see death.
- Where?

463
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:35,394
This is all bad... everything's
really bad... no Martin please no!

464
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:36,472
Come on Ama.

465
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:41,706
No this is bad. I see death. I see it
everywhere. Martin... no, Martin... no!

466
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:48,018
- What are you doing? Ama!
- This is bad, this is really bad,

467
00:44:48,053 --> 00:44:50,219
- Ama!
- No! No! This is bad! No! No!

468
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:53,190
- What are you doing?
- This is bad! This is really bad!

469
00:44:53,225 --> 00:44:55,157
- Stop! Stop! Stop!
- No! No!

470
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,786
- Stop! Stop!
- No! This is bad! This is really bad!

471
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,899
- Stop!
- This is really bad!

472
00:45:01,934 --> 00:45:04,682
- Wait, stop!
- This is bad!

473
00:45:04,717 --> 00:45:07,431
Ama!!! Look at me! Look at me!

474
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:13,098
It's over, it's over, it's over...
it's over.

475
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:20,344
Ama! Let's get up,
let's get up... come here come here.

476
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:26,088
What happened? Are you ok?

477
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,124
Your sweater

478
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:28,613
Let's go...

479
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:25,273
Dogo... Dogo... Kill him!
Dogo kill him. Kill him!

480
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:29,508
Come on Camilo!

481
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:39,748
Kill him! Kill him!

482
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,329
Come on Camilo! Shoot the ball...

483
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:55,401
Kill him!

484
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:07,247
Kill him Dogo!

485
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:11,520
- Come on Dogo, it's over, it's done.
- Dogo!

486
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:16,057
Come on! Come on Camilo!
Kill him! Kill him!

487
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:19,186
GOAL!!!!

488
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:45,620
It's an energy normalizer.
If energy circulates really fast,

489
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:50,794
...it'll contain it, if the energy doesn't
circulate it will bring it to circulate.

490
00:48:50,829 --> 00:48:54,286
- So, it stabilizes energy then?
- Exactly... yes yes yes yes

491
00:48:54,431 --> 00:49:00,028
- OK. Thank you very much miss.
- The place where you put it is the key.

492
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:02,037
- Do you understand?
- Thanks.

493
00:49:02,072 --> 00:49:03,198
- You're going to love it!
- Thank you.

494
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:09,669
- Laura Lavot?
- No.

495
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:18,179
Of course... she comes in the morning.

496
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:20,979
- Oh ok ok.
- Why?

497
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:26,118
Look, it's actually not good news...
the bank garnished her wages...

498
00:49:26,596 --> 00:49:28,359
...can I leave the document with you?

499
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:32,698
- Sure...
- Your ID?

500
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:39,973
- Oh, I didn't bring it.
- Ok, no problem. Just tell me your name.

501
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:46,543
Laura... yeah, we have the
same name... she's Lavot, I'm Fidalgo

502
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:55,214
Laura Fidalgo... like the one on TV...
the dancer... the dancer Laura Fidalgo?

503
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:10,433
- Ok. What's your ID number.
- Yeah it's 22984515

504
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:15,206
- Good. Can you sign here for me please?
- Ok

505
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:30,257
Yeah there. Done. Great.
This is for you.

506
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:34,719
So, tell her to communicate
with the court ASAP.

507
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:38,067
- Yes yes yes yes I'll tell her.
- Thank you very much.

508
00:50:38,402 --> 00:50:39,164
Bye.

509
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:19,574
Stop it Luci!
You're gonna damage yourself...

510
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:26,979
Your dad's coming!

511
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:36,991
Stop idiot... you're going
to burn your brain... stop

512
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:44,597
- What's happening?
- The truth is I don't know what's going on.

513
00:51:56,313 --> 00:52:04,049
Martin? Ama... I'm here at the church.
What should I do, wait for you here?

514
00:52:05,222 --> 00:52:10,159
When you're here you'll
call me? Ok. I'm going inside.

515
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:31,605
I have to turn on the sprinklers
Ok. I'm going inside. Hurry up.

516
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:36,582
Lucia! Lucia! Lucia God damn it.
Did I take care of you badly?

517
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:41,723
Did I raise you badly?
What did I do to you?

518
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:48,030
Ok. OK. I'm hanging up
cause I'm inside... bye bye.

519
00:52:58,441 --> 00:53:01,103
How can you reject my love?
Now that I go to your temple

520
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:20,530
and ask you forgiveness.
How can you reject my love?

521
00:53:20,565 --> 00:53:27,571
Lu! Lu! Stop stop stop stop stop!

Stop stop stop a sec damn it stop!

523
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:33,200
Now that I go to your temple
and I sing for you gospel, gospel, gospel.

524
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:53,430
Luli, Luli I know what you do
when you lock yourself in the toilet...

525
00:53:53,465 --> 00:53:57,161
come here, let me talk to you.
You're going too far.

526
00:53:57,601 --> 00:54:03,139
No! Stop! You're going to hurt yourself
damn it! Stop! I know what you do.

527
00:54:03,174 --> 00:54:08,276
You're going to far,
to a place of no return...

528
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:17,320
How can you reject my love? Now that
I go to church and I ask your forgiveness.

529
00:54:17,355 --> 00:54:19,618
Your brother fills your head
against me...

530
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:28,054
you have to talk to me,
my little girl... Lu... Lu... Lu!

531
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:33,959
How can you reject my love?

532
00:54:35,038 --> 00:54:37,598
Do you know why your brother
fills your head against me?

533
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:41,302
Answer me daughter.
Answer me damn it!

534
00:54:42,646 --> 00:54:43,977
Hymns

535
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,445
Your brother wants to fuck you!

536
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:00,220
No. You didn't do it, did you?

537
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:05,695
Tell me you didn't. Luci no,

538
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:13,104

541
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:30,104

00:55:30,139 --> 00:55:31,650
I love you too.

543
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:36,864
Give it to me Dad... fuck me

544
00:55:36,899 --> 00:55:40,265
it doesn't matter... nothing

545
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:49,111
What?! What are you doing?!
No no no no no no no no no no.

546
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:55,445
Get out of here! Get out of here!
Go away! Go away!

547
00:55:55,752 --> 00:56:00,623
You son of a bitch!

548
00:56:00,658 --> 00:56:06,528
Go! Go! Go! Go away!
Go away!

549
00:56:59,182 --> 00:57:13,495
Martin? What? I didn't hear you.
Where? The street? Let's see... wait...

550
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:21,136
Luci? Luci? I'll call you right back.

551
00:57:24,007 --> 00:57:26,976
Luci! Luci what happened?

552
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:29,535
What did you do?

553
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:35,977
Ama... don't... I don't know
if I have AIDs...

554
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,598
Luci! Luci what happened
to you?

555
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:52,399
Who did this to you?
Him? What happened?

556
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:58,441
No, I dropped an acid and I
wanted to touch the ground...

557
00:57:58,476 --> 00:58:02,935
but... how can they put grass into a cage?

558
00:58:10,053 --> 00:58:13,147
How can they put a square in a cage?

559
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:15,390
What are you doing here Ama?

560
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:20,086
I was in the church.

561
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:27,369
Let's take her Mono?

562
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:41,572
Ama!

563
00:58:42,252 --> 00:58:43,583
Ah Martin.

564
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,348
And that spaceship?

565
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,658
It's my sister, she collided

566
00:58:48,693 --> 00:58:50,091
against the railings.

567
00:58:51,094 --> 00:58:52,118
Wow, so what?

568
00:58:52,629 --> 00:58:53,755
Are we going to the hospital?

569
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:55,129
No, to the bar.

570
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:56,426
Ok, we'll see you there.

571
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:05,541
Ow!

572
00:59:05,576 --> 00:59:06,341
Sorry!

573
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:08,003
Ow! You idiot!

574
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:17,052
Was it a UFO?

575
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:49,982
Very good!

576
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,157
No, no isn't there any water?
I'm thirsty.

577
00:59:54,192 --> 00:59:55,715
No. They don't sell it here.

578
00:59:56,225 --> 00:59:57,385
But I saw some

579
00:59:58,027 --> 00:59:59,594
At mass don't they drink wine?

580
00:59:59,629 --> 01:00:02,532
Yeah, but that's something else...
it's a sip.

581
01:00:02,567 --> 01:00:05,092
You can drink it in sips! Cheers!

582
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:08,969
In sips

583
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:17,111
Besides, didn't Jesus get
drunk all the time?

584
01:00:17,146 --> 01:00:21,344
Come fish, come bread, come
wine... it was like that, wasn't it?

585
01:00:25,154 --> 01:00:29,559
The truth is I love this place...
whose is it? Your sister's?

586
01:00:29,594 --> 01:00:31,059
It's her father's.

587
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:33,528
Oh I see, and your brother?

588
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:36,064
No... no he didn't come.

589
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:37,899
He's not the one who plays the guitar?

590
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:39,699
No, no, he didn't come he didn't come.

591
01:00:41,537 --> 01:00:42,731
Well, cheers.

592
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:45,602
In sips.

593
01:00:45,637 --> 01:00:46,731
Sips.

594
01:00:48,845 --> 01:00:50,463
The pasta...

595
01:00:50,498 --> 01:00:52,081
Yes, pasta!

596
01:00:52,116 --> 01:00:53,446
Great.

597
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:56,809
She's the one from the railing.

598
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:58,517
Ah, you don't say.

599
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:02,022
Hey baby.

600
01:01:06,195 --> 01:01:07,459
Would you like some cheese?

601
01:01:07,494 --> 01:01:08,724
Yes please... a little more.

602
01:01:12,068 --> 01:01:12,625
Ok.

603
01:01:14,537 --> 01:01:16,266
That's enough, thank you.

604
01:01:19,475 --> 01:01:20,499
Got a light?

605
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:25,105
Thanks

606
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:28,611
Pretty nice isn't it?

607
01:01:30,153 --> 01:01:31,677
Thanks man.

608
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:37,782
Your other sister's pretty too...
nice... nice family.

609
01:01:41,564 --> 01:01:43,759
You're saying that we're
gonna lose respect?

610
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:50,139
If you respect yourself... I don't
know where you left the great macho...

611
01:01:50,174 --> 01:01:52,539
the dog... that... wild animal?
What happened...?

612
01:01:53,676 --> 01:01:58,045
Dogo is because of a soccer
team, it has nothing to do with dogs.

613
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:00,648
Hey Santa Claus!

614
01:02:00,683 --> 01:02:04,210
What's up man. Take this,
they almost sold it for scrap metal.

615
01:02:05,088 --> 01:02:06,680
You have no idea how much I
needed this today.

616
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:17,523
This guy is phenomenal
and his brother is a fag.

617
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:22,238
You don't think I'm capable of killing?

618
01:02:22,273 --> 01:02:23,569
Today you couldn't.

619
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:26,740
When you were little you liked
bowtie pasta,

620
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:29,245
and you asked for bowties
bowties bowties, I remember.

621
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,543
Yes, but I knew about
the point of pasta after.

622
01:02:32,381 --> 01:02:34,349
When? If you never cooked.

623
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:38,182
How much does it worth getting
dirty in a bottomless Karma man?

624
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:42,356
10 grand? 10 grand to kill someone?

625
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:46,579
It's the money for your girl,
it's your mom's... it's your kid's...

626
01:02:46,614 --> 01:02:50,767
your honor... the whole neighborhood
is talking shit about you.

627
01:02:50,802 --> 01:02:52,249
Let them come get to me man.

628
01:02:52,284 --> 01:02:53,697
Why did you forgive him man?

629
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:56,663
Cause I have a spiritual practice.

630
01:02:57,206 --> 01:02:59,375
Because the Great Path is not
difficult for those

631
01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:01,577
that don't have preferences...
understand?

632
01:03:01,612 --> 01:03:02,744
No.

633
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:03,546
You know, you're never
gonna understand.

634
01:03:03,581 --> 01:03:04,376
No.

635
01:03:05,248 --> 01:03:07,048
It's something you'll never get.

636
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:13,022
You know what, I don't wanna
understand anything of yours. Little dog.

637
01:03:57,733 --> 01:04:03,187
We're not more than one more.

638
01:04:03,222 --> 01:04:08,642
Under this sun, above this earth.

639
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:10,611
About to burst!
About to burst...

640
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:24,158
Mmmmm... it smells good...
homemade food... hands of mom,

641
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:32,430
of grandma, of my Aunt Ama, maybe
a dad too, not my dad, but... smells good.

642
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:39,108
Camilo! Have you seen
your birth certificate?

643
01:04:39,143 --> 01:04:40,234
No.

644
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:48,574
We're going on a trip. Here, this is
your bag, pack your clothes.

645
01:04:53,589 --> 01:04:55,557
No, you can't travel like that.
Go take a shower, now!

646
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:59,210
What?! Wait, come here
come here.

647
01:04:59,245 --> 01:05:00,693
Why are you looking at me like that?

648
01:05:01,998 --> 01:05:03,295
Why are you looking at me like that?

649
01:05:06,535 --> 01:05:07,263
How?

650
01:05:08,771 --> 01:05:10,329
What did you do?

651
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:12,473
Nothing.

652
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:16,604
What did you do? What do you think,
that I don't realize?

653
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:19,231
Come here you little shit!

654
01:05:19,266 --> 01:05:21,249
You think I don't realize?

655
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:23,343
That you've hidden
your birth certificate?

656
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:26,386
You hide it from me? You shit.

657
01:05:45,741 --> 01:05:50,974
My love, forgive me, forgive me...

658
01:06:39,095 --> 01:06:40,227
Get out man.

659
01:06:40,262 --> 01:06:41,595
What's it with you man?

660
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:42,798
- Get out Mono!
- What's up?

661
01:06:42,833 --> 01:06:43,698
Stop

662
01:06:43,733 --> 01:06:47,303
You stay calm... stay here...
what the fuck is up man?

663
01:06:47,338 --> 01:06:48,102
Go away Mono.

664
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:50,122
- What you're going to hit me?
- Let me talk to my sister.

665
01:06:50,157 --> 01:06:52,108
What you're going to hit me?
Are you gonna hit your sister?

666
01:06:52,143 --> 01:06:53,476
You can't take care of your
fuckin family man...

667
01:06:53,511 --> 01:06:54,442
Get out of here man!

668
01:06:54,477 --> 01:06:58,112
- ¡¡Get out!!
- Me? Hit me! Fuckin asshole!!

669
01:06:58,147 --> 01:07:00,649
Get the fuck out of here now!
Now!! Get the fuck out of here.

670
01:07:00,684 --> 01:07:02,549
Fuck you! Mother fucker!!

671
01:07:06,422 --> 01:07:09,323
I don't want you to live like
this any more Luci!!!

672
01:07:09,592 --> 01:07:12,161
I don't want you to
live like this anymore!!!

673
01:07:12,196 --> 01:07:15,324
Idiot... wake up!!!
Wake up!! Damn it!!

674
01:07:16,265 --> 01:07:18,165
I love him! What should I do?

675
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:25,371
Listen to me, listen to me...

676
01:07:25,674 --> 01:07:26,340
What?

677
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:29,276
Listen... go away, together... tomorrow,
you guys get away from here.

678
01:07:29,979 --> 01:07:30,711
But where?

679
01:07:30,746 --> 01:07:34,350
Far... I want you to leave
this place now, Luci.

680
01:07:34,385 --> 01:07:35,180
What about you?

681
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:37,451
I'd die without Camilo.

682
01:07:37,486 --> 01:07:40,189
Me too, I'll die without Camilo.

683
01:07:40,224 --> 01:07:42,350
You're going to die anyway!

684
01:07:45,027 --> 01:07:47,723
Luci... go... just go Luci, please.

685
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:52,557
Leave this place... please!
Promise me.

686
01:07:53,369 --> 01:07:54,468
Did you talk with Mono?

687
01:07:54,503 --> 01:07:57,097
Mono doesn't matter, he'll do it.

688
01:08:02,044 --> 01:08:04,376
Give me your word Luci.

689
01:08:05,648 --> 01:08:07,240
Yes.

690
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:34,543
It's not that I don't want to,
it's what I want to do most!

691
01:08:34,578 --> 01:08:38,414
That's the problem... I'm not
PHD in administration...

692
01:08:38,449 --> 01:08:42,214
I can't. I just can't do it.

693
01:08:45,688 --> 01:08:52,116
Strong... strong... high...
high but really high!

694
01:08:53,562 --> 01:08:58,556
Where stones can't reach me,
if they shoot me, they won't reach me...

695
01:08:59,535 --> 01:09:01,366
I gave him my word.

696
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:09,111
The bills of this building for example...
what's this that I have to pay for

697
01:09:09,146 --> 01:09:12,098
a lawsuit that happened with
the last administration?

698
01:09:12,133 --> 01:09:15,015
When I didn't even live in the
building. What about gas?!

699
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:20,317
Why do I have to pay for gas?
I don't get it. Anyway, gas is ok.

700
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:25,594
The birth certificate? The number
they gave Camilo when he was born.

701
01:09:25,629 --> 01:09:28,620
It's his number... why do
I have to pay for it?

702
01:09:29,265 --> 01:09:39,231
Another!! Another one!!
Another! Yes! Yes! There's

703
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:41,735
She's OK.

704
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:50,583
Yes, yes! Very good Luci!

705
01:10:09,338 --> 01:10:13,672
Ok, this song is dedicated to
my friend Dogo, my spiritual brother.

706
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:18,406
He should have been born in China or
Tibet, but he was born in Buenos Aires.

707
01:10:18,647 --> 01:10:25,119
But above all, he's a great friend, a
great person... after Luci.

708
01:10:25,154 --> 01:10:31,115
For any president in particular,
but for all the government in general,

709
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:36,398
the thought of the people is like a river,
when the water stagnates,

710
01:10:36,433 --> 01:10:39,231
the Dengue fever grows.

711
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:44,505
Dengue, Dengue!!

712
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:51,178
Dengue, Dengue!!
Dengue, Dengue!!

713
01:10:51,213 --> 01:10:56,241
He is like Dengue fever. He's our president.

714
01:10:56,518 --> 01:10:59,214
He's Dengue fever he's our president.

715
01:10:59,488 --> 01:11:02,189
He is like Dengue fever, he's our president.

716
01:11:02,224 --> 01:11:07,196
And he says "blah" and he says "blah" and
he says "blah blah blah, blahbity blahbity

717
01:11:07,231 --> 01:11:09,630
blah blah blah blahbity blahbity blah".

718
01:11:18,507 --> 01:11:21,293
It lives in the stagnant water of a town.

719
01:11:21,328 --> 01:11:24,044
He lives in the stagnant water of town.

720
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:27,132
He lives off your hunger, lives off
your blood, he is like Dengue fever.

721
01:11:27,167 --> 01:11:30,185
He lives off your hunger, lives off
your blood, he is the Dengue fever.

722
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:33,351
He is the Dengue fever,
he's our president.

723
01:11:33,386 --> 01:11:36,483
He is like Dengue fever,
he's our president.

724
01:11:37,092 --> 01:11:39,390
He is the Dengue fever,
he's our president

725
01:11:47,102 --> 01:11:49,738
And he says "blah" and he says
"blah blah blah blahbity blahbity...

726
01:11:49,773 --> 01:11:52,070
<<... blah blah blah blahbity
blahbity blah".

727
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:05,310
Yeah... it was bound to happen.

728
01:12:22,204 --> 01:12:25,401
What are you doing here? Go away.

729
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:45,720
Bye, take care.

730
01:12:46,495 --> 01:12:48,554
Bye Luci.

731
01:12:48,831 --> 01:12:51,356
Good luck good luck good luck!

732
01:12:52,568 --> 01:12:54,034
I love you.

733
01:12:54,069 --> 01:12:56,537
Take care of yourself.

734
01:13:09,251 --> 01:13:11,947
Here you have the check for table
8 and the table outside.

735
01:13:13,589 --> 01:13:15,157
And I have the money from Danny's
birthday party,

736
01:13:15,192 --> 01:13:16,725
you just have to give me
10 pesos for my trip.

737
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:17,623
Ok.

738
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:19,361
Can I use the phone?

739
01:13:19,396 --> 01:13:20,194
For what?

740
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:21,228
To talk to Camilo.

741
01:13:21,263 --> 01:13:22,881
This phone isn't for fooling around.

742
01:13:22,916 --> 01:13:24,465
But he's asking me to go to his house.

743
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:27,094
So go... or his father should go,
why is he calling you?

744
01:13:45,621 --> 01:13:52,394
Martin what are you doing?
Are you crazy? Crazy, get off!

745
01:13:52,429 --> 01:13:54,555
How many secrets do we
have? What's one more?

746
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:55,462
Secrets?

747
01:13:55,497 --> 01:13:58,364
Yeah, secrets, one more, one less...

748
01:13:59,835 --> 01:14:01,001
Martin get off.

749
01:14:01,036 --> 01:14:02,254
What do you mean get off?

750
01:14:02,289 --> 01:14:03,472
You have a girlfriend...

751
01:14:03,507 --> 01:14:04,461
Ahh yeah.

752
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:06,368
Do you like me?

753
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:11,076
I'm crazy about you Ama,
I always have been, really.

754
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:15,111
It's in your contract that you
have to attend to me isn't it?

755
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:16,383
No!

756
01:14:16,418 --> 01:14:17,718
Why no? Yes, yes yes!

757
01:14:17,753 --> 01:14:18,754
No no get off... Martin get off.

758
01:14:18,789 --> 01:14:20,016
- Why get off?
- Get off.

759
01:14:20,088 --> 01:14:21,188
I'm dying to do this.

760
01:14:21,223 --> 01:14:22,713
Get off... let me go... no.

761
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:25,391
Ama Ama come here.

762
01:14:26,495 --> 01:14:29,898
Let me go, No no no!

763
01:14:29,933 --> 01:14:33,301
Ama Ama! Come here!

764
01:14:33,502 --> 01:14:34,332
Get off.

765
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:36,003
Why?

766
01:15:48,644 --> 01:15:50,110
Why do you do that shit?

767
01:15:50,145 --> 01:15:52,247
Hey! It's food for the monster.

768
01:15:52,282 --> 01:15:54,414
What monster?

769
01:15:54,449 --> 01:15:59,716
The monster that we have
inside... Watch... eat monster eat!

770
01:16:03,025 --> 01:16:05,474
It makes you live in a total illusion man.

771
01:16:05,509 --> 01:16:07,924
And you? How's it
going at your house?

772
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:10,993
With the condensed
milk and diet cookies?

773
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,161
What's up? You're a really
special guy, are you?

774
01:16:17,272 --> 01:16:18,204
No.

775
01:16:19,975 --> 01:16:21,567
You're a little suspicious too.

776
01:16:22,444 --> 01:16:25,696
Look, a cricket... very good luck!

777
01:16:25,731 --> 01:16:28,948
We're gonna have good luck today!

778
01:16:31,153 --> 01:16:32,119
You believe in that?

779
01:16:32,154 --> 01:16:33,553
Yeah, I believe in that, sure.

780
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:36,519
- In the cricket here? In this moment?
- Yeah.

781
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:41,489
- Well, should we go?
- Let's go.

782
01:16:44,299 --> 01:16:46,668
- Auntie!
- Cami? What happened?

783
01:16:46,703 --> 01:16:47,600
Mom...

784
01:17:00,415 --> 01:17:01,550
What are you doing here?

785
01:17:01,585 --> 01:17:03,017
Get out of here.

786
01:17:05,153 --> 01:17:06,704
You want to take my son away?

787
01:17:06,739 --> 01:17:08,221
Do you think I don't realize?

788
01:17:08,256 --> 01:17:11,159
He talks about you all the
time. Get out of here.

789
01:17:11,194 --> 01:17:16,153
Get out! Get out! Get out!

790
01:17:38,787 --> 01:17:39,947
Call grandma.

791
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:51,283
What did we do Martin?

792
01:18:54,763 --> 01:18:56,390
We made love.

793
01:18:59,334 --> 01:19:01,203
Martin we did something
that's not right.

794
01:19:01,238 --> 01:19:02,295
No, it was fine.

795
01:19:10,512 --> 01:19:15,211
What did we do?
What did we do?

796
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:22,958
That's 39 years working
for your father... 39 years of

797
01:19:22,993 --> 01:19:24,619
service... do you understand
what that is?

798
01:19:33,635 --> 01:19:39,665
On his couch, where he
watches TV! I can't believe this!

799
01:19:40,142 --> 01:19:41,374
I can't believe this!

800
01:19:41,409 --> 01:19:43,710
No, but don't think of it
like that, it's useless.

801
01:19:43,745 --> 01:19:46,012
I betrayed your girlfriend,
I betrayed your family,

802
01:19:46,181 --> 01:19:49,309
I betrayed everyone,
everyone I betrayed.

803
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:53,615
- Nobody is going to find out.
- Martin, I changed your diapers!

804
01:19:55,123 --> 01:20:00,083
It's sacrilegious... We're working
for the fallen...

805
01:20:01,263 --> 01:20:02,195
I knew it

806
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:03,530
Fallen from what Ama?

807
01:20:03,565 --> 01:20:06,625
I knew it! I knew it! I felt it
when I was in the Jacuzzi.

808
01:20:06,768 --> 01:20:10,670
I felt it, I felt it. What did I do?

809
01:20:38,266 --> 01:20:44,034
But, it takes away your energy,
creative energy, divine energy,

810
01:20:45,707 --> 01:20:47,800
you're a musician man, a poet!

811
01:20:49,244 --> 01:20:51,508
Why do you have to bust
my balls so much?!

812
01:20:58,186 --> 01:21:04,182
For Luci... I'm going to miss her,
I'm gonna miss her so much man.

813
01:21:06,161 --> 01:21:07,992
I don't know for how long I'm
not going to see her...

814
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:13,133
For her you have preferences huh?
Am I your blood brother or what?

815
01:21:13,802 --> 01:21:14,701
Yeah, so?

816
01:21:14,736 --> 01:21:16,601
So, do you trust me or not?

817
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:19,472
More than anyone in the world.

818
01:21:19,507 --> 01:21:21,270
That's what I wanted to hear brother!

819
01:21:31,052 --> 01:21:33,714
Let's go.
Let's go in, let's go!

820
01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:52,404
Auntie...
Auntie...

821
01:21:55,744 --> 01:21:57,109
Auntie...

822
01:22:05,387 --> 01:22:08,720
...it's grandma.
- Hi mom.

823
01:22:29,277 --> 01:22:30,403
Get off.

824
01:22:30,812 --> 01:22:32,302
- Nothing happened.
- Get off.

825
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:34,177
Get off Martin, get off, get off!

826
01:22:40,055 --> 01:22:41,656
Everything is ok, nothing happened.

827
01:22:41,691 --> 01:22:43,256
Get off, don't touch me.

828
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:47,284
Fine but nothing happened here, relax,
everything is ok, there's no problem for me.

829
01:22:50,498 --> 01:22:52,466
Do you know what it means
to me to loose my virginity?

830
01:22:57,072 --> 01:22:58,403
What do you mean with virginity?

831
01:22:59,607 --> 01:23:01,176
Hello. Satan has arrived.

832
01:23:01,211 --> 01:23:02,700
Wait wait wait stop

833
01:23:03,111 --> 01:23:05,045
Give me the money... give me
the money! Let's go!

834
01:23:05,146 --> 01:23:06,546
Where's your daddy's money man?

835
01:23:06,581 --> 01:23:09,049
You be quite... you understand
me... shut up.

836
01:23:09,084 --> 01:23:12,110
I don't know. I don't have
money here! I don't know.

837
01:23:16,157 --> 01:23:17,624
Stop it! Stop it!

838
01:23:18,226 --> 01:23:20,160
You shut up! I'm gonna look.

839
01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:22,380
Get it out of this guy
where the money is.

840
01:23:22,415 --> 01:23:24,099
There's no money here
man, there's no money.

841
01:23:24,134 --> 01:23:25,361
Where is it?

842
01:23:26,601 --> 01:23:27,431
You stay calm.

843
01:23:27,502 --> 01:23:29,537
Take this take this.
I don't have money man.

844
01:23:29,572 --> 01:23:30,520
Where is it?

845
01:23:30,555 --> 01:23:31,469
Stop it!

846
01:24:09,744 --> 01:24:11,244
Take it man, take my watch.

847
01:24:11,279 --> 01:24:12,744
I'm going to fuck you up.

848
01:24:13,214 --> 01:24:16,217
What watch man? What watch?
Where? What are you thinking?

849
01:24:16,252 --> 01:24:17,616
Stop. There's no money here.

850
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:20,186
You wanna remember
me for the rest of your life?

851
01:24:20,221 --> 01:24:22,746
I don't want your wallet.
Where is your father's safe?

852
01:24:23,024 --> 01:24:23,992
- Get off.
- You shut up.

853
01:24:24,027 --> 01:24:24,959
Enough!

854
01:24:49,584 --> 01:24:51,551
- Stop! No!
- Stop! Stop, stop.

855
01:24:51,586 --> 01:24:53,288
You stay calm or I'll
fuck you up, ok?

856
01:24:53,323 --> 01:24:55,017
We can go to the ATM man.

857
01:25:21,082 --> 01:25:24,152
Come on... I'm really crazy man!
Let's go, cause I love this!

858
01:25:24,187 --> 01:25:25,551
Give me the money, come on!

859
01:25:27,689 --> 01:25:29,491
Stop man, stop! Stop, really!
Stop for a second.

860
01:25:29,526 --> 01:25:34,562
You wanna raise my baby man?
Come on bitch!

861
01:25:34,597 --> 01:25:35,328
Stop please!

862
01:25:35,363 --> 01:25:39,033
Come on! Give me the money man,
don't be stupid... look look how I fuck her.

863
01:25:39,068 --> 01:25:41,703
No don't do that, you
don't have to do that.

864
01:25:41,738 --> 01:25:42,635
Come on! Come on!

865
01:25:42,770 --> 01:25:44,761
Go and look around. Look!

866
01:25:45,006 --> 01:25:46,064
Enough stop stop!

867
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:50,134
Shut up! Shut up!

868
01:25:52,347 --> 01:26:00,220
Without any today when
finally I find the silence...

869
01:26:00,755 --> 01:26:02,956
Stop you don't have to
do this man, please!

870
01:26:02,991 --> 01:26:07,394
You want to see blood?!
I'm going to tattoo her ass.

871
01:26:07,962 --> 01:26:11,489
Ah Ama! You cut me girl!

872
01:26:13,668 --> 01:26:21,404
It's like being a distant star.

873
01:26:22,443 --> 01:26:31,613
So much light without a
destiny, navigating in lonelyness.

874
01:26:35,156 --> 01:26:36,908
Blood! Blood!

875
01:26:36,943 --> 01:26:38,625
Stop man stop!

876
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:40,753
Blood! Blood! I like blood! Come here!

877
01:26:40,995 --> 01:26:42,053
Stop!

878
01:26:42,564 --> 01:26:43,496
Yeah, come on! You like it. Yeah!

879
01:26:43,631 --> 01:26:44,597
Stop man, stop man!

880
01:26:44,632 --> 01:26:48,329
This is your fault man!
This is for the money! Now take it!

881
01:26:49,337 --> 01:26:50,668
Stop, stop, stop man stop!

882
01:26:57,745 --> 01:27:00,942
Come and go...

883
01:27:38,086 --> 01:27:40,680
What would happen if you knew
that you were never going to die?

884
01:27:42,190 --> 01:27:44,215
That there's no way to stop existing?

885
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:50,322
Why there are childs born in a golden
chair and others born on a wheelchair?

886
01:27:51,666 --> 01:27:57,332
Can the sea be unfair?
Is there anything before?

887
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:21,654
This was the day that my
family helped me...

888
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:28,301
They helped me to decide
that this is my last time...

889
01:28:33,775 --> 01:28:37,370
Everything's going to be
all right... Stay calm, Camilo.

890
01:28:38,546 --> 01:28:40,207
I'll be right back to get you.

891
01:28:46,254 --> 01:28:49,951
No!! Dogo no!
He didn't do anything to me...

892
01:28:53,161 --> 01:28:56,722
It was his blood!! His blood!

893
01:28:59,767 --> 01:29:01,894
Mono, mono, mono

894
01:29:10,244 --> 01:29:12,235
- ¡Ama!
- No.

895
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:48,715
No! It's useless. It's useless.

896
01:29:50,518 --> 01:29:54,511
People reincarnate in groups.
I'll find you. I have a son!

897
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:36,295
Billy is strange. He's
different and kind...

898
01:30:40,334 --> 01:30:41,699
He helped my Grandma...

899
01:30:42,403 --> 01:30:44,166
...and now he's going to help us...

900
01:31:52,707 --> 01:31:55,198
Go... Go with your grandma.

901
01:31:56,277 --> 01:31:57,403
Camilo!

902
01:32:36,751 --> 01:32:38,651
You're so young,

903
01:32:41,756 --> 01:32:44,384
I know lots of things
happened to you...

904
01:32:46,527 --> 01:32:52,466
But I swear, that it's
possible to be happy...

905
01:33:24,365 --> 01:33:26,162
They couldn't return.

906
01:33:31,339 --> 01:33:35,036
Maybe now my mom and my
dad can forget about themselves...

907
01:33:36,310 --> 01:33:39,336
And get born again in a luckier body...

908
01:33:44,118 --> 01:33:46,484
What gives life to the sea and the sky?

909
01:33:49,090 --> 01:33:51,285
To come and go feels just like the sea...
It's open to everybody...

910
01:33:53,461 --> 01:33:55,326
It's open to everybody...

911
01:33:57,632 --> 01:34:01,591
And always, just thinking about this,
makes me happy...

912
01:34:05,339 --> 01:34:07,569
Although here, they choose to
see it in a different way...

913
01:34:28,763 --> 01:34:48,446
Move! If you're already in heaven...
Move! If you're already in heaven...

914
01:34:48,749 --> 01:34:57,179
If you want to be like that,
no one can stop you.

915
01:34:58,492 --> 01:35:07,366
If you want to be like that,
no one can stop you.

916
01:35:08,102 --> 01:35:17,500
That's why, move. If you're
already in heaven.

917
01:35:18,379 --> 01:35:27,287
Move... If you're already in heaven.
