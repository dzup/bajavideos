1
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,680
Keep dreamin', brother!

2
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,520
Are you free?

3
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,800
Mylord's offer is tempting,
alas, my heart is taken...

4
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,800
But maybe I can amend that?

5
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,360
Aaah... mylord is
targetting my feelings!

6
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,200
Who must I kill, at this rate?

7
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,320
Nobody, but I must get to the airport.
You think it's possible in 20 minutes?

8
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,400
20 minutes? Leaves me enough time
to finish my sandwich... get on board!

9
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,880
It's a perfect opportunity to test out
some new settings...

10
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,800
let me know what you think!

11
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,120
Do you mind if I put some music on?

12
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,880
No... but get moving!

13
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,800
And there we go...!

14
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,320
Mylord is lucky, the streets of
Marseille are empty in winter...

15
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,000
it's more practical for sightseeing!

16
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,280
Yeah, lucky me...

17
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,000
But all this visiting is
gonna make us late...

18
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,800
fasten your seatbelt please,
I'm gonna have to switch to 3rd gear...

19
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,800
No problem!

20
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,680
You got some change?

21
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,000
Well, no...

22
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,800
Me neither...!

23
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,360
Wasn't that Daniel?

24
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,000
Who else 'd you think?
The Air Force?

25
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,600
Looks like he's in good shape!
The cops won't catch him anytime soon!

26
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,600
I wouldn't be so sure...
Apparently, the cops have a new weapon!

27
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,600
A new weapon? What kind of weapon?

28
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,400
A secret one.

29
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,000
"State Police"

30
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,200
This is boring...

31
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,400
Oh shit! 298 km/h!

32
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,200
Attention!
White cab driving at 298 km/h...

33
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,240
l repeat: 298 km/h!

34
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,800
Roger, we're on it!

35
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,800
l was worried there,
l thought they were asleep!

36
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,960
But that's a cop car!

37
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,520
Oh no, just some old pals...

38
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,600
They're very playful, you know!

39
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,640
Bertrand, get his number
as soon as we're close enough!

40
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,400
Don't worry...

41
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,760
"Go Marseille!"

42
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,480
Hey that's not a plate number!
It's an email!

43
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,680
Ok, game's over.
Hang on!

44
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,360
Hey, why are you stopping?

45
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,200
Are you kidding?
I'm pedal to the metal!

46
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,000
Is that nitro?

47
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,240
Oh no, a friend of mine has a bar...

48
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,000
it's made with Pastis.

49
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,960
If you want, I can give you the address...

50
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,280
You're very kind!

51
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,960
Hold on a second... is that a TGV?

52
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,360
Yeah, it's a good machine...

53
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,600
it's fast in the curves...
but kinda slow in a straight line!

54
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,200
Mamma mia!

55
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,720
Where do I drop you off?

56
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,400
Here!
Right here.

57
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,600
19 minutes 32 seconds!

58
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,280
I'm impressed!
No customer ever managed that...

59
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,200
usually whenever I stop, hop!
...straight in the bag!

60
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,280
Thanks!

61
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,800
You're sure it's the right place?

62
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,160
Absolutely.

63
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,200
Oh, I see...

64
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,000
Well thank you for your cooperation...

65
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,560
Tell me, don't I know you from somewhere...?

66
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,200
If I'd ever met you, I'd remember that!

67
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,120
<i>Bon voyage!</i>

68
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,200
Emilien's never gonna believe me!

69
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,120
Subtitles by Smarties

70
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,600
What's wrong?

71
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,400
Nothing. l had a nightmare.
Go back to sleep, darling.

72
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,520
What the hell are you doing?

73
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,000
Nothing! It's only been 8 months
that I can't sleep!

74
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,720
Because of that gang?

75
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,280
They've been bugging us for 8 months.
8 months! I can't get them off my mind!

76
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,120
I noticed that! I've been trying
to tell you something for 8 months!

77
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,960
I know, I know...  We just can't
get them, no matter how we try!

78
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,360
Did you hear what I said?

79
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,000
Of course!

80
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,160
And I'm glad you mention it,
because 37 hold ups in 8 months...

81
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,800
all dressed up as Santa Claus,
can you imagine that?

82
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,920
And you don't believe in
Santa anymore, right?

83
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,760
I do! I mean, no,
it's not the problem...

84
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,440
Now winter's here and I worry about the
Christmas present they may be preparing!

85
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,880
Speaking of which, I already know
what I'm getting you for Christmas...

86
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,600
Thanks Petra but you can't help me.
I must catch that gang by Christmas!

87
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,680
And me Émilien, l need to talk
to you BEFORE Christmas!

88
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,600
Ok, that's a deal.

89
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,800
What are you doing?

90
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,280
l'm going to the office.

91
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,840
But it's 3 AM!

92
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:03,520
What? Oh yeah... That's ok.
l'll avoid rush hour traffic.

93
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,960
There won't be any traffic for sure!

94
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,800
Good!

95
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,000
See you in the office?

96
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,000
Hello, I'd like to
make an appointment!

97
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,440
Oh - Lily, honey!
You up already!

98
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,040
Yes! I'm awake at 4 AM,
because my man is fixing his car!

99
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,440
But it ain't broken!
lt's winter time.

100
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,800
l am just making some modifications
to make it more stable in the cold...

101
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,800
Listen, could you also install a heater
in my bed when you got time?

102
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,000
It would make me a bit more stable
too, since I'm ALONE in a cold bed!

103
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,600
Except that it's not just in
winter time but all year round!

104
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,600
Don't say that, Lily...

105
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,800
Don't touch me! It'll take me forever
to remove the stains with a scrungie!

106
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,600
Uh... what's a scrungie?

107
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:29,400
A scrungie is used to clean out jugs,
pans and stupid pots - like me!

108
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,320
Don't say that! Let me wash my hands,
I'll be with you in a minute.

109
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,000
Oh no no no dear sir,
that's not how it works!

110
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,800
You wash your hands, then wait an hour
for that "white spirit" stench to vanish

111
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,000
and by then, usually
it's time to go to work!

112
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,560
Gee you're really up and running today!

113
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,440
Look, I woke up two hours ago,
watched you in your sleep for 30 min,

114
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,000
and since I couldn't sleep,
I decided to do something useful

115
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,800
instead of just watching TV!

116
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,800
Daniel! We don't HAVE a TV!

117
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,600
Never mind, it's the
principle that counts!

118
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,200
There's no TV, no stereo

119
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,400
no curtains, no couch, not a single
vase to put some flowers in...

120
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,400
assuming you'd ever offer me flowers...

121
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,200
But we DO have a fridge. It's filled
with motor oil, but we have a fridge!

122
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,160
Lily...

123
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,000
We also have a shower
that smells of gas...

124
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,000
a washer, specially designed
to wash car covers...

125
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,600
a wardrobe, in which
my dresses must fight

126
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,440
for room with host of tires...
- Lily!

127
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:20,880
And finally, a glorious symbol of our
luxurious life, we also own... a garage!

128
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,560
Hey what's wrong with you?
You're getting your period?

129
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,400
No I'm not, that's the whole point!

130
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,080
l just can't live anymore in a garage!

131
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,800
l am a women.
Do you remember what that is?

132
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,200
A woman is not just a smile
and a peachy soft skin.

133
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,480
A women moves, thinks, evolves, and
sometimes would like some comfort!

134
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,640
Oh dear... all this just because
I like to tinker with my car!

135
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,880
That's women for you...!

136
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,560
What's all that fuss about,
white spirit smells good!

137
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,800
Lily, what are you doing?

138
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,480
I'm going back to live with my parents.

139
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,200
What, you're trading a garage
for an army barracks?

140
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,200
Barracks with curtains, a small
garden and flowers on the table!

141
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,120
Lily, this is ridiculous.
You can't leave me like that!

142
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,880
You thought it was funny to
live in here with me!

143
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,800
Yes, but it's not  funny anymore and
I've been trying to tell you for months!

144
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,000
First of all you don't live with ME,
you live with your CAR!

145
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,400
This garage is too small
for both of us!

146
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,280
It's your car or me. Good bye!

147
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,520
Hi there, girls!
Getting the puppies some fresh air?

148
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,440
Hey, take it easy!
What's a little joke between friends...

149
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,680
Well then... Merry Christmas!

150
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,640
But...? What are you doing...?

151
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,240
Did you sleep in here?

152
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,800
No, l was just dozing for five minutes...

153
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,480
Must've been 5 long minutes then,
the folder is stamped on your face!

154
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,800
See, it's the same with trees...

155
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,800
You know, tree stumps?
One circle equals one year?

156
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,000
Well see, I can tell you've
been sleeping for...

157
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,880
...20 years.

158
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,400
Oh, forget it.
Just forget what I said, ok?

159
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,240
Apparently nobody likes jokes
anymore around here...

160
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,600
To think that I signed up because
I thought we'd have some fun...

161
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,600
Stop it or I'm gonna split
your side... with an axe!

162
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,600
Hey guys! I just got some fresh
weed here, want some?

163
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,960
Oh, no, no...
NO! No no no...!

164
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,800
Don't be stupid guys, it's high quality!
Straight from Jamaica!

165
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:15,520
Gosh really, from Jamaic...?
... no! Who'd you think we are?

166
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,000
OK then - your loss.
Bye!

167
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:18,680
Bye...

168
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,000
Tell me...

169
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,800
Hey!
What about some coke?

170
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,600
Rashid...!

171
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,000
Well then, good day to you...

172
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,000
What's that supposed to mean?

173
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,200
And what are all these posters on the wall?

174
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,360
Uh... Bob Marley?

175
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,080
Damnit, this is a police
station, not a squat!

176
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,600
Are you aware that we've been trying
to catch a gang for the past 8 months?

177
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,200
The Santa Claus gang?

178
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,480
Yes, the Santa Claus gang!

179
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Glad you remembered
the name, at least!

180
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,600
37 robberies in 8 months,
and no clue, nothing!

181
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,600
I've searched everywhere...
and nothing, nothing at all.

182
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,520
I feel useless.
A loser.

183
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,000
How about if I... if I ask
Rashid for a little, uh, tonic?

184
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,200
No.

185
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,080
I'm just trying to help here...

186
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,400
How about a little breakfast then?

187
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,400
Just to get some energy back?

188
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,800
OK, let's go have breakfast.

189
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,720
Guess you were a little hungry, eh?

190
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,080
I haven't eaten for days, out of
worrying over this case!

191
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,680
l have these terrible nightmares.

192
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,000
I'm strapped to a chair and a dozen
Santas dance around me...

193
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,000
It's horrible!

194
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,080
Stop it. Stop it, it's horrible!

195
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,800
Your shoe's untied.

196
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,560
Plus it'll be Christmas soon,
they'll be able to hide much better!

197
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,880
That's right! It was easier in July!

198
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,720
Yeah but we didn't catch 'em then...

199
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,000
And now Christmas is coming,
and I know they're up to something.

200
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,800
Something big, to finish
the year with a bang.

201
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
There's one thing that's puzzling me:
why do they dress up as Santa Claus?

202
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,720
Nobody would suspect a Santa!
Look over there...

203
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,800
Santa is nice, he gives presents,
looks dorky in his big red outfit...

204
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,680
It's usually too big...

205
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,120
Or too small...

206
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,200
It's a perfect disguise...

207
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,200
to hide...

208
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,520
a gun!

209
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,600
I can see that you are interested
in our new food processor

210
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,200
it can chop, slice and grind!

211
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,200
Do you have kids?

212
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,000
You there, freeze!
Police!

213
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,680
Don't move!
You are under arrest!

214
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,920
What happened?

215
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,800
I got one, Alain!
It took me 8 months, but I got one!

216
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,000
But how did you know he was a fake,
I mean, a member of the gang?

217
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,400
Have you ever seen a Santa
carry a peacemaker?

218
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,880
A gun! How'd you know?

219
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,280
This dork dropped it!

220
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,200
What a dork!

221
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,480
Yep, dorky for sure.

222
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,040
You're a dork!

223
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,960
The inspector's gonna like this!
Let's go!

224
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,360
Hello boss! Look what I got here!
Shit, where is he when you need him?

225
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,600
You, put your ass down
there and don't move, ok?

226
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,720
Well, until the Chief gets here,
let's just pretend I'm the Chief, ok?

227
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,920
I think that desk fits me, what d'you think?

228
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,520
Hey, you're sure about this?

229
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,520
Bof, he's gone anyway...
And after this catch,

230
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,600
I'm sure we won't remain simple
inspectors much longer, trust me!

231
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,160
Ok Santa, in the meantime you're gonna
tell us how you got a cop's gun...

232
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,400
Who did you steal it from?

233
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,200
Alain, I think that Santa
is looking for an address...

234
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,400
The Marseille region?

235
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,160
Whenever you forget something,
my colleague will use the directory.

236
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:15,920
You got that?

237
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,920
Now about this gun... you know,
there is a registration number here...

238
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,680
All we have to do is
search the database,

239
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,200
and in a few seconds we'll know

240
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,240
which idiot got his weapon mugged!

241
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,400
What a dork!
He stole Gibert's gun!

242
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,400
- lmpossible!
- l swear. Take a look!

243
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,880
Did you know that you stole this
from our favorite commissioner?

244
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,600
Can you explain how
you pulled that off?

245
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,120
Alain...

246
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,000
Maybe it would be easier
if we removed the sticky tape...?

247
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,800
You're right.
That might help.

248
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,360
Émilien?

249
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,000
Co... commissioner!

250
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,600
I'm needed out there...

251
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,440
But why are you dressed up
like that, Commissioner?

252
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,320
l am doing my job, Émilien. I tried
to infiltrate the Santa Claus gang...

253
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,600
but you had to screw up
everything, as usual!

254
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,080
I'm... I'm sorry, Chief, but...!

255
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,800
Why didn't you inform us,
we would all have joined you!

256
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,800
It's not an invasion,
It's an infiltration...

257
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,800
Precise, meticulous
and SOLITARY!

258
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,080
But don't worry Émilien, I'll get
a tailored costume for you.

259
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,400
It includes a cap and a whistle,
so you can infiltrate every crossroad!

260
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,400
And now would you please
unfasten me, so I can kill you?

261
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,560
Of course, Chief.

262
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,160
Shit...
Alain took the key with him!

263
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,040
Hurry up Émilien,
I'm losing patience!

264
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,000
5 minutes, Chief.

265
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,200
Are you Commissioner Gibert?

266
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,560
No, not yet...

267
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,200
I mean, I'm not commissioner yet and
I'm not called Gibert... unfortunately.

268
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,800
I mean, I sure wouldn't want
to be called Gibert, but...

269
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,680
The key, Émilien...!

270
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,720
Right away, Chief!

271
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,600
Are you commissioner Gibert?

272
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,560
Yes I am... wha wha...
wow... what can I help you?

273
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,200
Good afternoon.
My name is Qiu.

274
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,360
Qiu? Coo, how cute! I would queue
for your coo...chie.. uh?

275
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,000
I mean, that's a really
cute name, "Qiu"...

276
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,000
That name from China?

277
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,920
Yes. My mother is chinese,
and my father... swiss.

278
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,800
Aah, l know the place well...
Switzerland, that is.

279
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,880
l am a journalist from
World lnternational.

280
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,960
I am currently working on a big
report about the French police.

281
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,640
l want to follow closely the work of a big
inspector, and l heard you are the biggest.

282
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,000
Err, yeah that's right... 6' 4" and 220 lb,
that's pretty big for the police...

283
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,120
How impressive.

284
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:54,200
Oh? Yes, sure! When I look in the mirror
I often impress myself, me personally...

285
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,000
May I get "embedded"
with you for a few days?

286
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,000
As often and as long
as you want...!

287
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,400
Err, l mean, as long as needed
to conduct your probe.

288
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,400
I like to be in bed too when
I probe err... embedded...

289
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,000
Thank you very much.
Do we start now?

290
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,840
With pleasure...

291
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,600
- Thank you, coochie...!
- You're welcome.

292
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,720
What are you doing, dressed
up as Santa in your office?

293
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,600
Eh? This!
This is a camouflage.

294
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,480
We are trying to catch a gang, whose
members disguise as Santa Claus.

295
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,160
So we have to merge with their universe
in order to penetrate them better...

296
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,480
And the handcuffs?

297
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,200
I have no idea, they're not mine!

298
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,720
So, any further questions?

299
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,200
Come in.

300
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,000
Am I disturbing?

301
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,200
Oh no, in my current state,
nothing can disturb me anymore...

302
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,400
Well since you're alone in your
office and not doing any work,

303
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,960
I'd like to talk with
you for 5 minutes.

304
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,800
Petra, please, not now.
We'll discuss it at home tonight, ok?

305
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,200
At home all think about is your work.
So I thought now that you're at work,

306
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,600
...maybe we could discuss
something about our home!

307
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,600
Not today Petra.
Just not today, ok?

308
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,280
But you've been telling me
''not today'' for 8 months now!

309
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,400
Listen, l am in shit creek up to my neck
so please don't push me down - not you!

310
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,800
What is it this time?

311
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,120
l caught a Santa.
With a gun, can you imagine?

312
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,400
So of course, l thought
he was from the gang!

313
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,000
You don't need to see a Santa
or a gun to think about it!

314
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,200
You're ALWAYS thinking
about that gang!

315
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,000
Yes, but this time there were both:
a Santa AND a gun, so I arrested him.

316
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,600
You disarmed him by yourself?

317
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,000
Well... yes?

318
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,600
Guess he wasn't
from the gang, then.

319
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Unfortunately not...
lt was Gibert, dressed up as Santa.

320
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,480
Sure, just laugh at me.

321
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:40,360
It's the worst day of my life, and you
are laughing instead of cheering me up!

322
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,600
You'd like me to cheer you up?

323
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,280
Why, yes... you could say something nice,
some tender, loving words...

324
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:49,080
for example, tell me some good news.
Just for ONCE today, some GOOD news!

325
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,600
Émilien! l am pregnant.

326
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:52,840
No!

327
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,200
Yes!
How's that for good news?

328
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,200
Well yes, of course....
But how long have you been...?

329
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,600
For 8 months, Émilien!

330
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,800
- No!
- Yes!

331
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,480
Oh... but how did it happen?

332
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,800
I met the Holy Ghost,
8 months ago...

333
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:11,120
8 months? It can't be! I was there,
I would have seen, your belly...

334
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,600
And your breasts...

335
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,800
Aah... so that's why they became so...!

336
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,600
And you... you're gonna keep it?

337
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,720
It's a bit too late
to ask that question!

338
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,560
Well yes, but...
why didn't you tell me?

339
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,960
I've been trying to
tell you for 8 months!

340
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,400
I've placed cauliflowers in every room!
There... and there!

341
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,800
Oh... yeah, l was wondering
about all those veggies!

342
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,800
And I hung up at least 20 echographies.
They are everywhere!

343
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,600
ls it my baby?

344
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,800
Well for now it's mine.

345
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,080
lf you want a share of it,
you'll better wake up!

346
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,560
ls the baby normal?

347
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,480
Good question, when you
know the  father...

348
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,800
but yes, amazingly,
everything is normal!

349
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:06,320
But then... if you're pregnant
and everything is normal...

350
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,560
and you want to keep the baby...
That means I will be a daddy?

351
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:15,760
Yes! What a display of brainpower!
You should consider joining the police.

352
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,080
l am going to be a daddy?

353
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,800
Yes. And this child will need
a super-daddy.

354
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,080
Count on me Petra,
Count on me...!

355
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,960
Lily!

356
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,160
What a fool you are.

357
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,080
What good is your big car now, if you
can't put the woman you love in it?

358
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Rapid test?

359
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,640
Rapid test for what?

360
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,240
Two bars...
What does that mean, two bars?

361
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,560
Hello!

362
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,000
Hello!

363
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,800
Do you have the box
that comes with this?

364
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,280
Let me see...

365
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,280
"Clearblue rapid test".
Hey, isn't that a pregnancy test?

366
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,480
Yes exactly, that's what
I'm anxious to find out!

367
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,200
Aaah, I see... Let me fetch them,
they're right next to the condoms...

368
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,000
Guess what, I'm out of them!

369
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,760
They're in high demand these days.
Women love to make those presents...

370
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,480
... a cute little baby for Christmas!

371
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,600
See, I want to find out if
this is my Christmas present!

372
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,560
Aaah, I see... Just a minute,
let me ask my daughter.

373
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,600
Angel!

374
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,560
She's studying pharmacy,
she knows all that stuff by heart.

375
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,000
You'll see, it's really impressive!

376
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,400
Angel, what's that?

377
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,720
l am so sorry daddy!
I swear I tried to be careful!

378
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,200
But I drank a little too much
and ran out of protections...

379
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,760
But honey! There are condoms here,
I told you to just help yourself!

380
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,200
Yes, but we don't
have his size!

381
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,400
Who did that to you?

382
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,400
I have no idea!

383
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,200
What do you mean, "no idea"!
Doesn't that guy have a name?

384
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,200
l told you, l was drunk!
I can't remember all their names!

385
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,080
Oh my God...!

386
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,600
Oh come on... merry Christmas!

387
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,520
"Where is the police?"

388
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,000
Gentlemen, this is serious.

389
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,000
All the attempts we made to
arrest the Santa Claus gang

390
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,760
including a personal commando
operation carried out by myself

391
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,400
have failed, part of them because
of a over-zealous Émilien...

392
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,680
But nevermind, this is the past!
The future is ours! And we'll do...

393
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,000
what we decided yesterday
to do tomorrow, starting today!

394
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,960
You should write that down.
That's a good one...

395
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,400
Maybe a little twisted,
but I think it sounds good...

396
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,160
Émilien, your shoe's untied.

397
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,600
Yeah, it's just great...

398
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,800
That's good...
Ok... now, where was I?

399
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,600
At "this is serious", Chief!

400
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,000
Yes it IS serious!

401
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,400
And l won't accept any inopportune
mistakes or nauseous deviations!

402
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,600
Don't write that.

403
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,680
I want everything to be perfect,
smooth, "clean"! "Super-clean"!

404
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,280
You see, last summer l attended
a training seminar with the FBI...

405
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,200
so you see, some of the language
stuck... it's a reflex.

406
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,200
Crazy, eh?

407
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,200
... eh?...

408
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,560
So now I am giving you the "go"...

409
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,400
Not having caught the Santa gang
before Christmas is not an option!

410
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,400
Of course this means no
vacations, sick leaves...

411
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,800
Not even an excuse letter
from your parents!

412
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,480
Especially since miss Piu... Qiu,
journalist of the ...... magazine

413
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,400
Is giving us the honor of
following us on this mission.

414
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,800
So I hope she will return to her country
with a good opinion of our police!

415
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,400
The important words to
this mission are:

416
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,200
Concentration, Reflection...
...Action!

417
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,760
The codename for
this mission will be...

418
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,800
<i>Operation "Snow-white"</i>

419
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,800
Uh, that means
"Blanche-Neige" in French...

420
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,400
And guess who'll
play the dwarves...

421
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,960
Yeah... it's awesome...!

422
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,480
So from now on, I want each
and every one of you on alert 24/7!

423
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,000
<i>So is this clear?</i>

424
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,360
<i>Questions?</i>

425
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:05,920
Me!

426
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,280
<i>You?</i>

427
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:06,760
Oui!

428
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,200
Oh?

429
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,440
What's that gift
on your desk, Chief?

430
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,000
A gift?

431
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,000
Ooh! That's very kind.
Is that for my birthday?

432
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,240
Uh, when were
you born, Chief?

433
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:13,960
In July!

434
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,840
Must be for Christmas, then.

435
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,400
Whatever. It's the
intention that counts!

436
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,600
Well there's something new...

437
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,160
Very nice.
Who is it from?

438
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,960
Must be someone
that knows you well!

439
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,280
There's a little button on top...

440
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,000
Yes....?

441
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,400
Put the guns down!

442
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,480
Aah, it's wonderful...

443
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,840
Hey, you Pigs, this is Santa!
If you still believe in me, meet me

444
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,800
at the European Bank for your gifts.
But hurry up, we leave at noon!

445
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,480
Does anyone know
what time it is?

446
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,760
IT'S 5 TO 12, CHIEF!

447
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:03,600
RED ALEEERT!

448
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,960
I said "discreetly"! How am I
supposed to work with such jerks!

449
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,000
Those assholes... no no,
don't write this down, miss Qiu.

450
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,520
It's just a temporary reaction,
typical French - we fight sometimes

451
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,120
... however, we still mean it!

452
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:23,680
Gibert here. Deploy and await my signal.
Let us initiate... uh... well, let's go!

453
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,000
They will probably act like last time,
exit from the back in a fast car...

454
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,960
All we have to do is wait.
We'll catch them by surprise.

455
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,360
Chief... we won't surprise them
since THEY sent us the message?

456
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,240
Look, they sent us a message to fool us,
being certain we'd take it for a joke...

457
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,000
But that's counting without me,
Commissioner Gibert!

458
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,080
Commissioner Gibert is
not falling for their trap!

459
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,200
He is here, on time,
ready to attack!

460
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:45,000
I understand, Chief, but what if the
trap consisted in attracting us here?

461
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,040
Come on, think Émilien, think!
It doesn't make sense,

462
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,600
why would a gang alert the cops when
they are about to commit a crime?

463
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,000
I know, I know, that's
what's worrying me...

464
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,760
They haven't been acting stupidly
during the last eight months...

465
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,640
There's a first time for everything! And
particulary for stupidities, trust me!

466
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,480
Unless...

467
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,600
Unless what?

468
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,240
Unless they are certain
they'll manage to escape?

469
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,800
Hahaha... just let them try!
There's no escaping me, believe me!

470
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,520
Chief!

471
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,080
Yes?

472
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,400
They will have to pass over us
if they want to leave that bank!

473
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,800
What's that thing, there?

474
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,600
lt's... it's a nightmare!

475
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,000
Are you ok, Chief?

476
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,680
I'm fine, I'm fine! What are you
waiting for to start the pursuit?

477
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,200
How are we supposed to
stop a machine like that?

478
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,320
How should I know?
Show some initiative, damnit!

479
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,600
Alain, requisition a car!

480
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,960
That guy's got some nerve!
Why didn't he stop his car?

481
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,400
For a black cop in Marseille?
Fat chance!

482
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,080
Well yeah, but still... he could've
slowed down, at least!

483
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,200
It's OK! It's OK.
I'm used to it.

484
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,560
Chief, maybe we should requisition
one of our own cars!

485
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,000
Good thinking, Émilien.
GET IN THE CARS!

486
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,200
Now this is our new security system.
It's unique worldwide!

487
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,240
It's based on the "ATLAS"
system used by the police.

488
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,160
All you have to do is push this button
and the cops will get here ASAP.

489
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,800
It's really efficient!

490
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,160
Oh shit oh shit!

491
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,400
- Oh shit, my ride!
- Oh shit, my ride!

492
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,400
Maybe I should get off here,
you would lose some weight!

493
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:31,080
C'mon Émilien, your 50 lb won't make
a difference! And you, GO GO GO!

494
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,200
So here we are in the famous
Marseille harbour...

495
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,000
over there it's the "Cannelière",
taking it's name from cannabis...

496
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,800
you know, to make ropes...

497
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:52,000
it was built by King Louis XIV
in 1661 and... watch out!

498
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,160
What the fuck...?
Are you keeping up, son?

499
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,560
Certainly, sir! "...was built by
King Louis XIV in 1661"...

500
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,000
You don't have to follow what
I'm SAYING, you moron!

501
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,000
I'm talking about that big truck
with the big tires, there!

502
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:03,760
Oh dear oh dear...

503
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,760
See, my little coochie,
the problem is the staff!

504
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,800
They don't pay any attention
during recruiting!

505
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,640
For example this lad would make
an excellent swimming instructor,

506
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,680
but now he's in a car chase without
even having a driver's license!

507
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,800
Wha... what's that?
You don't have your license?

508
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,480
Well no, I only joined
the police yesterday!

509
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,560
I don't believe this!

510
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,600
Calm down, Émilien. All he has to do
is follow that big truck over there....

511
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,080
... piece of cake really, even a
swimming instructor could do it!

512
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:33,960
What do I do now?

513
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,800
You follow it, son,
just follow it!

514
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,160
That truck must be drinking
a gallon of gas per mile!

515
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,800
It'll run dry long before us!
I'd say in 5 or 10 minutes...

516
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,760
That's supposing we're
still alive in 5 minutes!

517
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,200
We will, we will...

518
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,760
Maybe we should stop and
apologize to these people...

519
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,560
There's a time for everything, Émilien.
Let's rush first, we'll apologize later...

520
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,000
But we're rather
CRUSHING right now...!

521
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,760
Stop your play on words,
Émilien! That's enough!

522
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,560
Am I supposed to stop now?

523
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,400
Huh? What for?

524
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,000
There's a swimming pool!

525
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,200
Yes, that might be a good...
STOP!

526
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,600
Phew... that was
really close, eh?

527
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,800
Hey! Watch it, there!

528
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,240
I knew we wouldn't
last 5 minutes...

529
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,600
See? That's some good insulation,
that is. Not a single leak!

530
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,560
Um... is this standard
procedure with the police?

531
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,000
Absolutely not! ln most of
cases, the cars leak...

532
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,560
Chief... I... I can't swim!

533
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,200
Oh, don't worry, Alain! We have
a swimming instructor with us...

534
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,880
Ah, my little Daniel!
What a pleasure to see you again.

535
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,600
Oh dear, you don't
look too good...

536
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,160
I think you're spending too much
time with my daughter.

537
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,000
Just kidding! At your age, it's
normal to have some fun...

538
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,400
Have you seen my driver by any chance?
He's running late...

539
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,000
l just saw him at the crossroad.
He'll be here in no time.

540
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,280
Glad to hear it!

541
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,000
Tell me, is Lily here
by any chance?

542
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,800
Yes, she is.
LILY!

543
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,600
I'm sorry darling,
I thought you were upstairs...

544
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,400
It's ok, daddy,
I'm used to it...

545
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,720
Look who is here...

546
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,480
Good morning Lily.
Can we talk for a minute?

547
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,800
Not now.
l have to go see my doctor...!

548
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,440
Can you drop me off Daddy,
it's on your way...

549
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,600
Sure, honey, if my driver
ever gets here...

550
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,240
Now that you mention it,
I thought he had some trouble...

551
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,400
Maybe I could drop you off...
both of you?

552
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,400
Affirmative.

553
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:23,000
It'll teach him to be late.
And now - all aboard!

554
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,840
To the Boulevard Cassini, driver.

555
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,000
Very well, Madam.

556
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,840
Tell me, you are late! Daniel
kindly offered to drive us,

557
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,400
so I'll meet you back at the
barracks after my appointment.

558
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,360
Tell me, didn't you use
to drive a bit faster?

559
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,360
Who, me? Well, there's a lot of people
on the streets this time of year...

560
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,400
and there's a lot of potholes,
so I can't drive very fast...!

561
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,320
Besides, taking things nice and easy
from time to time can't hurt...

562
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,800
Indeed, just so long as I'm not late...

563
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,800
What? What's wrong?

564
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,600
It hurts!

565
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,800
Where, honey?
What's hurting?

566
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,200
My belly...!

567
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,480
Your belly? But that's terrible!
What are we going to do, General?

568
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,800
I have no idea!
Does it hurt very badly, darling?

569
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,560
Noo - o.
It's over now.

570
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,520
It's over?

571
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,120
Yes, it's over.

572
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,600
It's over!
It's over... it's over...

573
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,760
Tell me Daniel, you're really a nervous
wreck today! What's wrong?

574
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,400
lt's because Christmas is nearing...
All those presents... makes me nervous.

575
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,600
l can see that... what's that
thing you got on your ear?

576
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:52,000
Oh that...? Nothing, it's just
a new gadget: a stress-o-meter!

577
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,400
One bar: nothing's wrong.
Two bars: nothing goes!

578
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,560
Well apparently,
nothing goes!

579
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,000
l know! That's why
I'm driving so slowly...

580
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,280
Thank you for driving,
it was a pleasant trip.

581
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,800
See you tonight, darling.

582
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,600
I'll touch a word to my doctor, but
I'm afraid your case is desperate...

583
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,800
Pardon me for intruding,
but I'm running late!

584
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,600
And here we go...

585
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,640
Come in.

586
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,960
Peek-a-boo!

587
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,880
Hello...

588
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,000
AAAH...!

589
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,120
Are you ok?

590
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,320
l'm fine...
I'm fine...

591
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,800
But you see, we're even betrayed
by our own equipment here!

592
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,000
How am I supposed
to work like that?

593
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,280
You should mention this in report.
We cruelly lack funding!

594
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,400
We need more stable chairs,
and taller doors - see?

595
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,800
Oh yeah, and we need
life jackets in our cars!

596
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,280
You were there earlier - blub!
See?

597
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,600
Besides, our shoes could be
more comfortable, too...

598
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,960
My feet hurt terribly!
Ouch!

599
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,560
Maybe if you removed this...?

600
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,080
Oh...?

601
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,880
Wonder who did that,
I hate those practical jokes!

602
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,200
I've had sore feet for six months!
That ain't funny!

603
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,200
You know, this makes
me all tense!

604
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:48,200
Just relax, commissioner!
You are so nervous.

605
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,400
lt's because of that gang,
the Santa Claus gang...

606
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,600
Don't worry about it...
I'm going to take care of you.

607
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,320
You know how to
use that thing?

608
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,200
Yes, a little bit...

609
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:08,000
They delivered it just last week.
Good thing I hid my typewriter!

610
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,200
Just relax, commissioner...

611
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,000
You'll feel better so much better...

612
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,000
You think so?

613
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,920
l am sure.

614
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,600
But now I can't see anything...
is that normal?

615
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,800
Yes, it's normal.
Just relax!

616
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:36,800
That feels so good... eh?

617
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,000
I feel like you're taking
all my worries away...

618
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,800
That's exactly the case...
You'll see...!

619
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,200
I think I'm falling asleep...

620
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,600
l'll wake you up.

621
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,600
That was terrific!

622
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,800
What the fuck do you think you're doing?
You have any idea where you are?

623
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,400
No, where am l?

624
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,720
ln front of the police station!

625
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,960
Oh, really? Looks more
like a garage to me...

626
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,400
Just you wait, buddy...

627
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,400
My respects, general!

628
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,120
At ease!

629
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,000
Thank you Daniel. l'll see you
tonight at home, then.

630
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,320
Oh, Daniel! You're my savior!

631
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,800
Could you do me a favor
and drop me somewhere?

632
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,560
I don't drop my friends, but I can
give you a ride if you want...

633
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,400
l am so glad to see you!

634
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,280
Please, sir?
Has the problem subsided?

635
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,560
Yes, I guess so...

636
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:48,200
Oh, and would you please keep this
parking spot for me, I'll be back...

637
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,400
Right...

638
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,800
Hey, hey, slow down,
I got plenty of time!

639
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:56,760
OK boss!

640
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,480
Daniel, you won't believe
what's happening to me.

641
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,080
Same here, you'll never guess
what's happening to me!

642
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,760
Try to guess... it's something
absolutely unbelievable!

643
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,560
You got promoted?

644
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,400
No it's not about my job,
it's personal... come on, guess!

645
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:06,880
You're getting married?

646
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,000
Better than that Daniel!
I'M GONNA BE A DADDY!

647
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,080
But that's impossible!

648
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,320
Yes it is possible!

649
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,080
Oh, it's wonderful...!

650
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,400
Lily is pregnant too.

651
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,200
No way!

652
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,600
But... that's awesome Daniel,
we'll be daddies together!

653
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:27,600
That's unbelievable... after all these
years of friendship, we'll...

654
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,400
we'll have a child together!

655
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,000
I mean... uh...
I mean, one each...

656
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,000
... but at the same time.

657
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,400
Each of us separately!

658
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,800
Yeah... separately, yes!

659
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,400
How long has she been pregnant?

660
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,200
8 months.

661
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,800
8 months?!
You could've told me earlier!

662
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,000
I only found out this morning!
You're the first one to know.

663
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:50,000
I haven't even told mommy yet!
What about you - how long?

664
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:51,360
2 bars.

665
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:52,800
What do you mean, "2 bars"?

666
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,800
Yeah, that's some new gadget...
you pee on it,

667
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,400
and it tells you how long
you've been pregnant.

668
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,200
And well, it's been
2 bars for her.

669
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,200
Oh yeah? That's cool.

670
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,400
Yeah, it's cool...

671
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,400
Commissioner...?
You've got visitors!

672
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,000
What are you doing, Gibert?

673
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,680
Aaah...!
It's a pleasure to see you again!

674
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,000
Uh... that's nothing...
We were simply... that is...

675
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,200
my colleague... she's Chinese...

676
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,600
She was just showing me
a relaxation technique...

677
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,200
How to get 5 hours of sleep
in 5 minutes... to save time.

678
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,200
It gives you a lot of energy!

679
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:40,000
However, today's class is over.
See you later, Commissioner!

680
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,200
Thanks.

681
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,600
Thanks, my little... Qiu.

682
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,400
So, what can l do for you?

683
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:56,600
She even put cauliflowers everywhere
in my office, but I was so busy...

684
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,600
I didn't even notice that!
How stupid can I be?

685
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,200
Very stupid,
but I had already noticed...

686
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,400
But why cauliflower?

687
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,600
What do I know? But I should at
least have noticed something...

688
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,000
But no, nothing!
I'm such a loser, Daniel...

689
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,400
Oh, stop it. If you were such a loser,
you wouldn't be the father!

690
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,200
You think so?

691
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,800
Of course! Petra
isn't masochistic...!

692
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,080
Thanks.
That's a bit reassuring.

693
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:21,200
Oh, don't be too reassured,
we're still in deep shit!

694
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:22,080
How's that?

695
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:24,200
Well, you're always
chasing thieves...

696
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,400
I'm always tinkering with an engine,
no wonder they're freaking out!

697
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
And I'm not an expert, but a kid
must need some room... and time!

698
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,600
Guess we'll have to change habits and
stop worrying only about our jobs...

699
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:38,480
You're right! We have to watch him
take his first steps, go to school...

700
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,160
I think we have some time
before we get there...

701
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,160
He'll stick his fingers in all the
power outlets before that!

702
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,960
Oh, really? So we'll have
to seal them all up?

703
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:44,800
I suppose so...

704
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,800
Oh...? That's just insane...
How can you prepare for it?

705
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,400
That's some good shit...
Did you get it from Rashid?

706
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,200
Yep... hold on, you know Rashid?

707
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,920
Well yeah, a little...

708
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:00,800
The sun is coming out...

709
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,880
Hey Daniel... Santa riding a scooter,
isn't that a bit weird?

710
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,400
Yeah... he's supposed
to ride a sleigh...

711
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,960
Watch this... he's discreet yet
nervous, that's not normal!

712
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,400
Hey... just 5 minutes ago we agreed
to stop worrying about the job

713
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,000
to spend more time with our kids,
so drop the hot pursuit idea!

714
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,000
Follow him!

715
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,800
Aye aye... Commissioner!

716
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,600
I need verification on a scooter,
registration N 75BM13, over.

717
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,800
It was stolen 2 weeks ago!

718
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,560
Yes! You see,
it pays to persevere!

719
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,400
You better tell Petra about it...

720
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,400
Daniel, we'll just follow it,

721
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,000
localize his HQ and hand the case
over to Gibert. You have my word!

722
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,400
Ok.

723
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,800
You're a real friend,.
What would I do without you?

724
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,000
Screw things up
even more?

725
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,200
Yeah, for sure...

726
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,600
We're losing him!
The first lead I got in 8 months,

727
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,000
and I'm fucking losing it!

728
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,600
Hey, calm down!
There's a solution to every problem.

729
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,800
Daniel, what are you doing...?

730
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,560
Daniel, what's wrong with you...!

731
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,400
You got a better idea
to follow a scooter?

732
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,360
Uh... no!
But we'll get noticed!

733
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,360
Just act naturally,
you'll be fine!

734
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,000
"Act naturally"?
Oh, alright...

735
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,360
So... now that you found his HQ,
you call the Commissioner!

736
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:13,000
Hold on. I screwed up last time,
this time I want to make sure!

737
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:17,160
Hey! You have a Santa, a stolen scooter
and an abandoned storehouse.

738
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,760
What more do you want?
His legal file?

739
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,400
I just want to make sure!
Come on, give me 5 minutes!

740
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Bingo!

741
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,160
Is that enough, or you want to
check if they have real guns?

742
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,600
Nah, that's ok...

743
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,000
But we should find out
how many they are.

744
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,000
Follow me!

745
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:47,200
Will you stop it? You said that you'll
hand the case to the commissioner.

746
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,760
Yes, but the first question he'll ask
will be "how many are they?"

747
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,000
And I need to know if this is their
HQ or only a secondary base.

748
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,600
Come on, just give me 5 minutes!

749
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,160
Émilien, l got a bad feeling
about this. Don't do it!

750
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:17,400
Don't worry, I've seen it in a movie.
You force the body to do what you want.

751
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,200
It's all in your head.

752
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,800
I know, that's what worries me!

753
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,360
If something happens to
me, you call Gibert.

754
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:24,000
Émilien... your shoe's untied!

755
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,120
Oh dear...

756
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:37,600
Hello?

757
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,360
I'm back from my physician,
does that interest you?

758
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,800
Oh yes, if he's a good doctor!

759
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,200
He's an excellent doctor!

760
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:47,120
The prefect's daughter recommended him,
and she had 4 children in 4 years!

761
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,200
Well that's gonna be tough to beat...

762
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:50,800
Yes, especially if we don't
see each other again!

763
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:54,600
Listen Lily. I'll do anything, but
you should give me a chance!

764
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:55,960
So what I propose is...

765
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,600
Why are you whispering like that?

766
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,960
Because of the Santas! They just
pulled Émilen out of the trash can

767
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,400
and I think they're going to...

768
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,400
Lily? Lily!

769
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,400
Oh shit...

770
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,400
But... what are
you doing here?

771
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,000
Guess...

772
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:31,800
You're wasting your time.
Torture me, I won't say a word!

773
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,160
We do not need
to make you talk.

774
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:38,400
We already know everything.
Besides, torture is out of fashion.

775
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,960
There are much more effective
methods to make a man talking.

776
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:43,800
No kidding?

777
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,560
For example, tenderness...

778
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,200
lt can be a very
dangerous weapon.

779
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,760
Tell me, what is a handsome man
like you doing in a place like this?

780
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,000
Just doing my job...
Ah, no! Don't do that!

781
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,160
Yet you are not insensible
to my "arguments"...

782
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,920
Yes I am!
That's my cell phone!

783
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Ah...? Let's have a look...

784
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,400
Oh, what a nice model!

785
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,760
But it's shut off...
I'm going to turn it on.

786
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,000
No!
You can't do that!

787
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,160
I'm out of credits...

788
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,800
That's against basic
human rights!

789
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,800
That's inhuman,
what you're doing to me...

790
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,800
They say hunger justifies the means...

791
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,600
and l am very hungry!

792
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,760
Petra!

793
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,800
Can't answer now because I'm very busy.
Leave your ID and I'll keep you posted.

794
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:52,000
Émilien, it's Petra. l guess you
are on a mission again.

795
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,600
I just wanted to tell you
that I am proud of you.

796
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,800
Of your dedication
to your work.

797
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,400
I know how you put all your
energy in everything you do.

798
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,880
But you should also think about
yourself from time to time.

799
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,000
You should relax a little,
find some pleasure in life.

800
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,400
And maybe we could spend
a little more time together...

801
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:13,000
That's all. Call me back
when you're done. Kiss!

802
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:18,600
Hello Daniel...!

803
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,760
Why are you still here? Have you
seen Émilien, I can't find him!

804
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,160
Actually I have seen him,
he got kidnapped!

805
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,160
Kidnapped?! You're kidding,
what good would that do?

806
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,600
What do I know! They were all disguised
as Santa and loaded with weapons!

807
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:33,200
Dressed as Santa? It must
be the Santa Claus gang!

808
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:34,760
I guessed that much...

809
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,800
Good job, Émilien! He picked up their
trail again - by himself!

810
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:37,560
Actually we BOTH did!

811
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:40,400
They're as good as dead!
I got an infaillible plan!

812
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:41,600
And Émilien?

813
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,000
He'll be fine Daniel, trust me!

814
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,280
Get in the car!

815
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,400
Would you mind sticking around with us?
I got a BAD feeling about this mission!

816
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:53,200
And Émilien?

817
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,400
Ah, Émilien...

818
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,800
Once we find the Santa Claus
gang, we find Émilien...

819
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,800
but... will he still be alive?
Who knows...

820
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:01,800
That's promising...

821
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:11,680
Commissioner!

822
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,000
Ah, good timing!

823
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,000
We're just about to catch
the Santa Claus gang,

824
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,200
we'll throw them right
into the sack, those Santas!

825
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,800
Can... can I come with you, please?

826
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,560
Absolutely not.
It's way too dangerous,

827
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:25,200
and this arrest won't be a pretty
Christmas story, trust me!

828
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:28,800
Oh, Commissioner... please...

829
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,200
Uh...? OK, let's go then,
it's not very far...

830
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,160
Hey!
Follow us, ok?

831
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:49,600
Spread out!

832
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,000
Yep, Christmas time is here!

833
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:02,480
I'm gonna hit them with some
early fireworks, wait and see!

834
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,960
How do you know they are here?

835
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,000
I got my own spies! My brother Jean-
Robert works with the City Sewage...

836
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,800
he took the police exam
with me, but failed...

837
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,080
even though he copied
everything off me!

838
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:15,800
but he messed up the order of the
answers, so he got it all wrong!

839
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,160
You know, that happens all the time!
A friend of mine...

840
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,160
Ok, ok, enough!

841
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,200
Anyway, he called me last night

842
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,600
and told me about suspicious activities
in the mall, so I investigated...

843
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:28,400
And what did I find? A tunnel
between the bank and the mall!

844
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:33,000
Of course! That way they'll steal
the money and spend it right away!

845
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:39,000
No! Sunday, they'll rob the CLOSED bank
and leave by the OPEN mall - as Santa!

846
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,480
Of course! Nobody will notice them
since there are Santas everywhere!

847
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,200
Exactly! And that's why they've been
dressing up as Santa from the beginning

848
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,400
in preparation of that hold-up!
It's the biggest bank in Marseille.

849
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,200
Of course, of course...!
Commissioner, you are a genius!

850
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:52,200
No, no, Alain... I got an inherent
talent, that's true...

851
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,400
but it's really just a
question of training.

852
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,080
It is!

853
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:57,360
Can l make a phone call?

854
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:58,200
Suit yourself!

855
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,800
Oh, ain't that funny,
Émilien's got the same one!

856
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:07,000
Yes.

857
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,240
<i>The stupid cops
found out everything.</i>

858
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,600
<i>Switch to plan B.</i>

859
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,000
- OK!
- OK. Bye.

860
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,000
That's such a nice language...
I mean, Chinese...

861
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,200
It just melts in your ear!

862
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:19,600
Chief, there's activity
in the parking lot.

863
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:23,800
On your marks. If that four wheeled
monster appears, nail it on the spot!

864
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,000
Roger that!

865
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,080
The Christmas vacation is over,
Gibert will make sure of that!

866
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,080
What the hell is that?

867
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,400
Hey, where's that
big monster truck?

868
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,800
They're getting away!
Do something!

869
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,600
l commandeer this vehicle.
Alain, follow me!

870
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:04,400
We have a beautiful view
over Marseille from here.

871
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,160
l see that. ls it quiet,
in wintertime?

872
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,080
Oh yes, very quiet.

873
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,000
STOP!

874
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,040
Commissioner, wait for me!

875
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,600
Stop... in the name of the Law!

876
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,600
Like I told you, Minister,
we are cruelly underfunded.

877
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,600
Indeed... one bike for two
officers, that's too little.

878
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,000
Way too little, yes...

879
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,080
Tell the chopper pilot
we'll be in time.

880
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,200
l will miss you,
my little Émilien...

881
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,600
But because l like you,
I won't make you suffer...

882
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:33,160
Gee, thanks...

883
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:37,800
You will even have the privilege to
know the exact time of your death

884
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:41,440
thanks to this highly precise
device... that's my Swiss side...!

885
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:56,200
This device will set free that ball,
which will swing along the cable...

886
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:59,000
and you'll have the
best seat for the show.

887
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,960
Uh... how much time will I have?

888
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,400
You'll have exactly 5 minutes.

889
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:05,600
Great...!

890
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:09,800
Use your time well to purify
your soul, Émilien...

891
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:13,600
It is important to thoroughly clean
your soul and come to peace...

892
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:16,000
before you face your Maker.

893
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:18,200
Only 5 minutes to clean up that
mess, that's a little tight there...

894
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,000
Focus on the essential, then...

895
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:30,200
I'm keeping your cell
phone as a souvenir.

896
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,400
I am a bit sentimental...

897
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,600
that's my Chinese side.

898
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,200
Clean up my soul...
Yeah, right...!

899
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:00,600
Right here and now, I would
sure appreciate a miracle!

900
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:01,800
Even a small one...!

901
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,200
Oh no, not the ball...!

902
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:12,400
Oh no, not the taxi!

903
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:24,600
Daniel! You can't imagine
what has happened to me.

904
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:28,400
lt was terrible, we must find her!
She took my cell phone...

905
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,400
I mean, they also got
all the money...

906
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,800
but the cell phone... that cell
phone was a gift from Petra!

907
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:36,600
Imagine what would happen if she
calls and a Chinese girl answers...

908
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,800
Uh, Émilien...? Tell me, did I just
save your life or was it a dream?

909
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:42,360
Well, yes... so what? I would've
done the same for you!

910
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,400
Oh yeah? That way I would have died
crushed by a cop car, that's great!

911
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,000
Don't say that. My driving
has improved a lot!

912
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:51,160
But your manners haven't! How about
saying "thank you for saving my life"?

913
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:54,200
If I don't catch that gang,
you saved my life for nothing.

914
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,400
Gibert will kill me because
I screwed up again!

915
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:59,560
We'll find that gang, but first,
tell me: ''Thank you''!

916
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:03,200
Oh yeah? How are we gonna find
it, we don't have a single clue!

917
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:04,400
Say: "Thank you"!

918
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:05,960
THANK YOU!
THERE, ARE YOU HAPPY?

919
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,040
YEAH!

920
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:14,200
l'm sorry, buddy.
I'm so sorry!

921
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:18,000
It's... it's my nerves, I just
can't take it anymore.

922
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,800
The Chinese girl, she...

923
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:24,200
She tortured me for hours,
it's hard to recover from it.

924
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:25,800
She tortured you?

925
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:27,600
Yes. lt was terrible!

926
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,000
What kind of tortures?

927
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:32,000
Oh my, she did things I didn't
even know you could do!

928
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,400
l mean, you can't imagine the things
she did. In fact I'm still sore...

929
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:40,200
I mean, it hurts me just
from talking about it, Daniel.

930
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:42,000
l see.

931
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:47,280
Don't worry... we'll catch that
Chinese chick. Come with me.

932
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,960
Did you see, did you overhear
anything that could help us?

933
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:52,600
No...

934
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:56,000
She was telling about a chopper pilot
set to pick them up somewhere, but...

935
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,600
She had fur on her boots.

936
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:58,600
Fur on her boots?

937
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:00,960
You don't feel anything?

938
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:01,600
No...

939
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:02,800
It's cold...

940
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,000
Oh yeah, you're right...
is that melted snow?

941
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:08,600
Yes. And that means two things.
It's from somewhere high up and nearby.

942
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:12,000
And... since they were wearing fur
boots, they're going back there...?

943
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:13,800
Probably...

944
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,400
But why would they take all that
money on a mountain top?

945
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:17,800
What's on the other side
of the mountain...?

946
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:21,800
Switzerland...

947
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,400
But of course!

948
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:26,200
Daniel, she's half Swiss,
so she knows the place!

949
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,760
They'll travel by car as high as
possible, then ski back down...

950
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,800
and what with all the tourists
there, nobody will notice them!

951
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:33,800
And from the Swiss ski station,
they're taking a chopper to the bank!

952
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,200
That plan is awesome!

953
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:40,000
So now we're looking for a ski station
that's close to the Swiss border...

954
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:43,200
where you can land a chopper
and has a lot of tourists.

955
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,600
- Val d'lsère!
- Val d'lsère!

956
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:56,760
Did you just see something?

957
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,200
No. Absolutely nothing.

958
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:01,400
Sentinel N1, negative.
Nothing to report here.

959
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,200
So where are you going
to spend your holidays?

960
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:06,000
Bof, we haven't decided yet...
Probably in the snow somewhere.

961
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,800
Now we can only hope that we
were right in our deductions...

962
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,160
and their car is around
here somewhere.

963
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:42,200
You look on the right,
I'll look on the left.

964
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:43,000
OK.

965
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:48,000
Émilien, don't tell me you can't
tell your right from your left!

966
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:50,600
Oh, you mean on
YOUR right side!

967
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,400
I'm in front of you,
so that's MY left...

968
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,200
You're not in front of me,
you're sitting besides me!

969
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:57,200
Yes, but I imagined I was sitting
in front of you, and if I was, I...

970
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:58,960
What...?

971
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,200
Daniel! The car!

972
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:01,800
Got'cha!

973
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,000
Let's take a shortcut, turn
right as soon as you can!

974
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:05,160
Why, you know this place?

975
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:08,400
Never mind, all these ski stations
are the same. Turn right, trust me!

976
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:11,200
Tell you what, I'd rather
trust myself and turn... right!

977
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:15,800
Watch out!

978
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:22,400
That was a close one!

979
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,400
What is this road, Daniel?

980
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,200
l don't know,
watch out for signs!

981
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,400
Don't these cars look a bit strange?

982
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:36,200
Nah, they're local plates...
Must be ski instructors...

983
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:37,400
What are those signs saying?

984
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,960
Says "1 min 10 sec, 2nd place"
Isn't that disturbing?

985
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,400
Not at all, we'll do better
on the second lap...

986
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:06,200
Oh shit...

987
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,200
Look, those tracks
are from a ratrack!

988
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:10,200
They must have transferred the
money into it and continued uphill.

989
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,760
We'll never catch them,
the pursuit is over!

990
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:14,200
The pursuit never stops.

991
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:22,800
Daniel, I know you're fast, but
a taxi can't climb a mountain!

992
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,600
Nothing is impossible
to a stout heart!

993
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,800
What do you think about
my winter collection?

994
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:36,800
Oh yeah, not bad at all!

995
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:38,560
Tell me, you've tested this, right?

996
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:39,400
No, never...

997
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:49,200
Hey, it seems to be working!

998
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:50,160
Yeah I guess so...

999
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:52,200
But how are we going to
find them in all that snow?

1000
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:54,560
How about following
their tracks, for example?

1001
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,600
Oh yes, that's a clever idea!

1002
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:02,000
If they manage to escape in a chopper,
is your taxi equipped for that?

1003
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,600
Émilien, don't overdo it! That's
already pretty good, don't you think?

1004
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:07,400
Oh, I'm not complaining! But maybe
I should call the general, then...

1005
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:08,800
What an excellent idea!

1006
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,600
Uh, can I borrow your cell phone?
The Chinese girl still got mine...

1007
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:21,800
Put the money into the rucksacks.
We must leave before sundown.

1008
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:31,600
<i>Back to work!</i>

1009
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
You think they are still there?

1010
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:42,400
That's hard to say...

1011
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:48,200
Hello?

1012
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:51,160
Oh, Émilien! Operation ''Snow-white''
has already started.

1013
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,960
I'll be with you in 10 minutes.
Your Commissioner is with me,

1014
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,800
he insisted to participate
in the operation!

1015
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,400
Oh, no...!

1016
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:00,800
- Commissioner!
- Yes?

1017
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:02,800
Are you sure that's a good idea?

1018
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,960
Alain, l served for 18 months
in the Chasseurs Alpins,

1019
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,160
13th batallion, special forces!
So I know about mountains!

1020
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,400
Alright, but... we are high up here!

1021
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,000
Have you ever seen
snow before, Alain?

1022
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,800
Well... you know,
I'm from around here...!

1023
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:20,000
Ah...? Oh.
Ok then, let's go!

1024
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:22,600
Ok, hit the road!

1025
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:25,560
I'm going to take a look.
Don't want to take chances.

1026
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:26,560
I wouldn't do that
if I were you...

1027
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:27,800
Relax, just give
me 5 minutes...

1028
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:32,000
Damn it - it's always
the same story!

1029
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,880
You were right.
We should stay together.

1030
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:49,800
See that? You could have waited
instead of ruining my carpet...

1031
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:50,880
Take it easy, it's just water!

1032
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:53,760
No, for now it's still snow,
and snow leaves traces!

1033
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:54,960
Alright, I'll clean up
your fucking car!

1034
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,360
Oh yeah? How are you
gonna do that?

1035
01:08:56,400 --> 01:09:00,000
l said, l'll clean it!
How, is my problem!

1036
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:08,200
Come on! Let's go.

1037
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:13,960
You know how to ski?

1038
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
No, but I know
how to drive!

1039
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,600
Damn it!
Follow me!

1040
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:30,760
Hey! lt's a forest, Daniel!

1041
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:31,960
So what? Are you scared in a forest?

1042
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,200
No, I'm scared in a car!

1043
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:39,000
Uh... what... what are
you doing, Daniel?

1044
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:41,200
Well, I think I can put
the tires back on now...

1045
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,600
There, we localized the chopper!
Get ready!

1046
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:53,560
Chief! Are you sure that...?

1047
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:57,000
Shut up Alain, I checked everything
myself this time. I'll be just fine!

1048
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:58,880
Ok boys, here we go!

1049
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:21,600
What happened?

1050
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:28,200
Wait for me-e-aah!

1051
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:41,360
I think the cord is
a little too short...

1052
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,200
Of course it's too short!

1053
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Wait, you can't do that!

1054
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:48,200
Oh yeah? Watch me!

1055
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:52,000
There we go.

1056
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,600
Wait for me...!

1057
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:07,800
And here comes Hans Gerhardt,
from Austria, he's the number 10...

1058
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,400
in a great shape this season...

1059
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,000
Are you sure we're on the road?

1060
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,400
I think that as long as we
follow these poles, we're good...

1061
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:20,000
After his record in Kitzbühl and
on this optimal race track,

1062
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:23,200
it's hard to think of anybody
that could outrace him...

1063
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:31,000
He has set a record
on all intermediary times...

1064
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:36,800
He is literally flying across
this World Championship...

1065
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,200
This victory cannot escape him...

1066
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:52,320
Ooops - it did. A... taxi...
beats him by a split-second.

1067
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:09,800
lt's too calm...

1068
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,800
You could leave me
a little souvenir...

1069
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,600
Souvenirs aren't allowed
where you're headed to.

1070
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,600
However, you will have
plenty of time to clean up!

1071
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:35,400
Ok, take her away!

1072
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:43,600
Tell me, you don't seem to be very angry
considering she tortured you for hours!

1073
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,360
Well... bygones are
bygones, right?

1074
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:46,800
Sure...

1075
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:49,360
Oh, by the way, you haven't seen
Gibert? Shouldn't he be here?

1076
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:50,600
<i>l'm coming!</i>

1077
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,000
Well yeah, there he is!

1078
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:55,360
O-oh! l am comi-i-ng!

1079
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:58,200
Chief! Be careful when
you're landing!

1080
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:01,400
Oh, don't worry Émilien,
it's just snow...

1081
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:04,000
Banzai...!

1082
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:08,200
Oh dear... the water must
be pretty cool, too!

1083
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:16,600
Hello!

1084
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:19,200
Émilien? My waters broke,
I'm about to give birth!

1085
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:21,360
What, you're giving birth?
Here? Right now?

1086
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:22,760
Well it's gonna take some
time, but hurry up!

1087
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,000
I'm coming Petra!
I'll be there right away!

1088
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,400
Commissioner!
Petra is having a baby!

1089
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:33,200
And guess who's getting
another job...

1090
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:34,400
Daniel!

1091
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:44,800
l'm here, l'm here!
Everything will be fine now.

1092
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,400
I beg you, please don't faint!
It's not the right time for this!

1093
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:51,800
Don't worry, everything be fine.
You hear me? You'll be fine!

1094
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:56,000
Émilien, that's not the right time!
You gotta cope with this!

1095
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:00,000
Watch over the monitor.
You'll see the contractions coming.

1096
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:02,000
- I'll see contractions on a screen?
- Yes.

1097
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:04,800
Watch a screen, watch a screen...
which one shows contractions?

1098
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:05,960
It must be this one...

1099
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:08,000
Yes, it's that one!

1100
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:09,000
Push! Push!

1101
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:10,400
But where do I push?

1102
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,800
Not you! She has to push
at every contraction!

1103
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,000
Contractions!

1104
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:17,600
Push, honey, push, push!

1105
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:19,400
Now breathe, breathe!

1106
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,200
Not you! She has to breathe!

1107
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:25,400
Breathe darling, breathe, breathe!

1108
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:28,000
Contractions!

1109
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:31,160
Push! Push!

1110
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:32,200
Get out of here!

1111
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:35,760
Push! Get it out of here!
Come on, push, push!

1112
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:36,560
Now breathe...

1113
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:40,200
Ok, breathe!
Man the bellows, breathe, breathe!

1114
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:44,560
Ok, one more time,
I can see the head!

1115
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:45,800
The head...?

1116
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:46,800
Contractions, Émilien!

1117
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:51,600
Ok darling, push the head!
Push the head! Push it outta there!

1118
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:52,600
Contractions!

1119
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:54,160
Almost there!

1120
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:58,560
One more time my love, push!
Push! Breathe! Sneeze! Puke!

1121
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:00,200
Ok, now relax.

1122
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:05,000
Relax, relax, relax...

1123
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,800
It's a beautiful baby boy.

1124
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Relax everything...

1125
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:18,800
I'm a daddy...

1126
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,400
Would you like to cut
the umbilical cord?

1127
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:29,200
Maybe we should wait a little
with that if you don't mind...

1128
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,200
What are you doing here?

1129
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,200
Training...

1130
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,000
Why? Are you pregnant?

1131
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:52,000
No, but the woman
l love is pregnant.

1132
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,400
And I want to be ready
when my time comes.

1133
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:59,600
Where did you find a woman stupid enough
to have a baby with a draft of air?

1134
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:03,400
l was very lucky.
And I promised her things.

1135
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:04,800
Like what?

1136
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:09,360
To spend more time with her than with
my car, to become the best of daddies...

1137
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:10,000
And the fridge?

1138
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:10,800
The fridge is empty!

1139
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:14,800
I would also be the best of husbands,
if she agrees to marry me, that is...

1140
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:16,800
And did she believe you?

1141
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:17,800
Not at all!

1142
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,960
In fact, it's the first time in her life
that she made a real mistake.

1143
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:23,400
Because right now,
I was absolutely sincere.

1144
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,800
What men lack is not sincerity,
it's the time to apply it.

1145
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:31,600
The time to make all these
nice words possible.

1146
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:34,800
Lily, would you marry me?

1147
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:38,200
That's easy, now that you made me
pregnant, you feel compelled...

1148
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:39,000
Lily!

1149
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:44,200
In any case, you're not doing it right.
We are very traditional in our family!

1150
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,600
Lily, would you give me the
honour to become my wife?

1151
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:52,800
It depends...

1152
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:54,200
Depends on what?

1153
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:56,600
On how good of
a lover you are...

1154
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:58,760
You got one hour
to convince me!

1155
01:17:58,800 --> 01:17:59,800
You'll never last!

1156
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:01,200
Wanna bet?

1157
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:04,800
"Intensive care"

1158
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:12,800
Émilien...

1159
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:16,600
Émilien!
