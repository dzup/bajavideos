1
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,556
Oh, Sergio!

2
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,921
If you say one word,
I'll kill you.

3
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,698
Don't move.

4
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:26,204
Hello?

5
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,413
<i>Sergio, it's mom.</i>

6
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,680
<i>Baby, are you there?</i>

7
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,783
I'm sorry, I'm busy.

8
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,318
<i>No, wait, please!</i>

9
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:39,188
<i>Baby, you have to talk
to your brother.</i>

10
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,250
<i>I've been calling him for days.</i>

11
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,888
<i>I left messages on his answerphone,
at Carina's, at work,</i>

12
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,260
<i>and he hasn't called.</i>

13
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,231
<i>I don't know what's wrong.</i>

14
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,130
<i>Have you seen him lately?</i>

15
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,998
<i>Or has your wife?
Is Diana there?</i>

16
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,000
<i>Can you ask her?</i>

17
00:02:56,876 --> 00:03:00,312
Yes, she's here,
but she's busy too.

18
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:03,447
Wait, hang on a minute.

19
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:07,377
It's mom.

20
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,026
Hi, mom.

21
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:16,061
<i>Sergio didn't say you were there.</i>

22
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:19,096
<i>Why didn't you call?
Are you in trouble?</i>

23
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:20,722
<i>Is that why?</i>

24
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,868
I'm busy, mom.
I can't talk now.

25
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:25,196
I'll call you later, OK?

26
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,470
<i>Do you promise? Have you had
a row with your brother?.</i>

27
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,009
No, no, I'll call you later.

28
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,135
<i>- I can't talk now.
- Call me, OK?</i>

29
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:36,306
<i>- I will. Love you, mom.
- Bye, love.</i>

30
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,213
Finished?
Thank you.

31
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,485
Sergio, please, calm down.

32
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,546
Keep your mouth shut.

33
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,751
Get dressed, get out

34
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,092
I don't want to see
either of you again

35
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:54,663
ever.

36
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:10,976
You look like shit.

37
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,145
It's over with Diana.

38
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:18,012
Done. I don't want
to talk about it.

39
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,193
Don't ask anything,
I won't tell you.

40
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:31,367
What's up?

41
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:32,797
Nothing.

42
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:34,467
Absolutely nothing.

43
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,573
Hey, I'm the boss in here.

44
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:39,303
We can't talk about soccer

45
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,711
or about politics
because we fight.

46
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:43,873
And now not even
about women?

47
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:45,814
Women, yes,
but not about my separation.

48
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,081
Coffee?

49
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:57,717
CITY IN HEAT

50
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,849
<i>Hello...
you are looking at me?</i>

51
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:38,764
<i>...Five seconds and
look again...</i>

52
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:41,129
<i>One, two, three, four,</i>

53
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,400
<i>five...</i>

54
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:46,303
<i>...You're so beautiful...</i>

55
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:50,038
<i>Why don't I get off my ass and
seduce you, instead of</i>

56
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,839
<i>fantasizing like a 40 year old
bored of his marriage, if I'm</i>

57
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,177
<i>free, a kid. OK, no choice.</i>

58
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:04,614
Sergio, buddy...

59
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:07,989
- Anything else? Coffee?
- No, bring me a...

60
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,357
A handkerchief?

61
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:13,431
A glass of gin
to drown love sorrows?

62
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:17,459
No, bring me a glass of milk
and a piece of strawberry pie

63
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,338
with custard filling,
I'm hungry.

64
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:20,532
Yeah, you do look hungry.

65
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,773
Tony, a glass of milk and
a nice portion of strawberry cake.

66
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,367
She was hot stuff.

67
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,301
Do you look at
what your clients look at?

68
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,343
You want to be my client?

69
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,212
Then pay me now.

70
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:04,646
- There's no credit for strangers.
- How much?

71
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,310
- Hello, Duke.
- Hi, how are you? Tony!

72
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,820
- Are you pregnant?
- Just the opposite, he's on the rag.

73
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:14,286
No, I'm just not in the mood.
Are you all funny today?

74
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:16,991
Duke

75
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:17,788
a coffee.

76
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:20,798
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

77
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,965
I'm not clowning around
like you two, that's all.

78
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,631
I have to hand in this piece
next week.

79
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:30,038
I've got three endings,
but I don't like any of them.

80
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,609
I'm stuck.

81
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:33,939
That's happened before.

82
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,241
It's all right,
there's no problem.

83
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:39,677
Listen to what happened to me.
Just crazy, it'll inspire you.

84
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,080
Duke, come, listen to this.

85
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:43,619
What happened?

86
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,418
Yesterday was my dad's birthday,
so I took flowers to the cemetery.

87
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:49,892
You go to the cemetery?

88
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,361
No, never, but my mom
couldn't go, so I went.

89
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:53,762
Anyway, listen to this.

90
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,629
I was there, and suddenly

91
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:59,535
something appeared,
something supernatural.

92
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:02,436
- The grave opened?
- No, no, you moron.

93
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,209
- A girl.
- Well, girls open too, sometimes.

94
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:27,091
Hello.

95
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,902
These were for my old man,
but he'd have done the same.

96
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:37,237
- You're an expert!
- An expert?

97
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,604
The bastard doesn't even
respect the dead.

98
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,680
Don't you even respect the dead?
Go away, please.

99
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:44,878
No, it's not that.

100
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:48,384
But I respect the living,
like us, more than the dead.

101
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,486
We're just passing through.

102
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:55,954
It's a good opportunity to meet.

103
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,258
I think we've met before.

104
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,001
No! You ruined it!

105
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,035
That's as old as farts!

106
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:08,402
How could you say,
"I think we've met"?

107
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,372
Is that the best you can do?

108
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:13,604
You see, buddy! Pretty girls
aren't all dummies.

109
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:16,580
Didn't you ask her
what sign she was?

110
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:17,842
You're a creative guy.

111
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,646
"Do you come here often?"
"Where did you buy those shoes?"

112
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,414
- Where's your car?
- I don't have one.

113
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:24,750
Let me give you a lift.

114
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,654
I've screwed up your day
and I didn't mean to.

115
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:31,688
Inés.

116
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:33,159
My name is Inés.

117
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:36,432
Marcos.

118
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:37,660
My name is Marcos.

119
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:45,600
- What do you do?
- I've got a workshop.

120
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:50,141
If I invite you there,
will you think I want to rape you

121
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,010
or that I'm being friendly?

122
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:08,526
Well, I told you.

123
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,491
MARCOS' WORKSHOP

124
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,372
- What's that?
- Is it you?

125
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,607
Of course it's me.

126
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,019
I said I knew you.

127
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:33,792
Photos from magazines
look awful

128
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,918
in small frames.

129
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,723
And as my dad was
a social photographer

130
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,467
I use some of the photos
he had on display.

131
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:44,327
I always liked this photo.

132
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,565
I like you since my dad
put you in the store window.

133
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,201
On Santa Fe Avenue.

134
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:51,500
Yes!

135
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,608
Whenever I walked by,
I couldn't stop looking at myself

136
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:56,681
but I was embarrassed too.

137
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,046
I can't stop
looking at you either.

138
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:08,255
He's a nice guy,
but he's fucking lucky too.

139
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:11,760
And in front of the Van Gogh,
... she gave you her flowers.

140
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,961
Your fucking imagination, Duke.

141
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:18,159
We went for tea before,
and talked.

142
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:19,369
For tea before...

143
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:20,232
Before what?

144
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:22,498
We swapped life stories.

145
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,700
Well, she didn't say much.
She doesn't talk about herself.

146
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:27,210
Hysterical. It'll take months
to get her into bed.

147
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,871
No, I thought that too.
But after the tea...

148
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,910
You tasted her muffin.

149
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:33,449
Of course.

150
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,784
You're an expert, Marquito.
Impressive, Master.

151
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:40,450
Tony, bring champagne
and three glasses.

152
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:46,189
No, there's a bit missing.
There wasn't a happy ending.

153
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,693
- She's frigid.
- No, stupid, not at all.

154
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,494
There were sparks flying.

155
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,637
I don't get it.

156
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:55,367
We were like
a couple of castaways

157
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:56,964
after they've eaten
the last coconut.

158
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:59,476
- We finished on a high.
- Don't give up.

159
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:02,513
Stop it, he'll go on in circles.
So, what happened?

160
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:04,879
After all that,
including a shower together

161
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,681
she's getting dressed
and she starts to cry.

162
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:11,915
She says she hadn't felt so good
with a guy in ages

163
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:13,982
that I was wonderful, etcetera

164
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:16,357
that it had all been so good
it reminded her

165
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,259
of the last time
she was in love with a guy.

166
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,764
The guy dumped her
for someone else.

167
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,424
Can you believe
my fucking bad luck?

168
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:26,972
That mixture of good and bad
memories is confusing her

169
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:28,630
so it's best
if we don't meet again

170
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:30,742
until she gets sorted up.

171
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,937
That's how we left it.

172
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:35,578
And to top it off...

173
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:36,942
That's a contradiction.

174
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,251
No, it isn't.

175
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:44,888
I'm looking for someone
who'll teach me to be alone.

176
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,390
With you, I'll never learn.

177
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,785
You'll say it's female hysteria.

178
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,022
I think the girl's nuts.

179
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:55,089
Did she give you any explanation?

180
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:57,860
What I really want
is to have a child

181
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,971
and when I had the chance
I had to get rid of it.

182
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:06,100
That's not a contradiction,
it's a fact.

183
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,313
And it's a fact
that I want to be alone.

184
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:13,416
But I don't know if I can do it.

185
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:25,021
No explanations.
She wants to learn to be alone.

186
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:27,829
Hold it, Tony.

187
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,627
It's all shot to hell.
Bring me some herb tea instead.

188
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:33,162
Incredible.

189
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:36,469
When there's so little love around,
some people just waste it.

190
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,372
Come on, it's not such
a big deal.

191
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,210
You got her number?

192
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,311
No, she asked for mine
and I gave it to her.

193
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:45,750
Her address?

194
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:49,986
No, she asked me to drop her
on the corner.

195
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,182
Yeah, and at the end

196
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,347
she cried and made a scene.

197
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:28,522
No, no, there were no tears.

198
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,997
So as a kid you were in love
with the photo.

199
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,166
Right?

200
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:38,734
I made it up!
How could I be in love with a photo?

201
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:40,795
Come off it.

202
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:51,180
Admit it, the photo
line was great.

203
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,311
Yeah, it was good.

204
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,583
But how can that inspire me?

205
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:58,951
Isn't it original? A love story
that starts in a cemetery?

206
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:02,254
But it's not a love story.
It's the story of a fuck.

207
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:05,329
No, no, hang on a minute.
Not a fuck, three.

208
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:09,391
All right, three but I'm writing
about an immigrant family

209
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,026
fifty years ago, Italians.

210
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,162
So where's the connection?

211
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,763
Adapt it. You said if they could film
Kafka's "The Trial"

212
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:16,773
they could film anything.

213
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,305
You're pissing me off.

214
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:22,244
Did Italian immigrants
not ficky-fick?

215
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:23,337
Did they grow on trees?

216
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:26,111
The three rounds weren't bad.

217
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:27,709
That reminds me of my heyday.

218
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:30,746
How did you feel after?

219
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,251
I don't know. Fine.

220
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,361
You said we should have
a girl in every port.

221
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,862
But you don't bring them
on the ship.

222
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:43,323
Tony, forget about that tea,
stupid.

223
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:46,996
Bring champagne. The machos
at table four are thirsty.

224
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:48,769
I don't know what to do.

225
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,075
I adore Daniel.

226
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,439
Isn't it lovely
that after so long

227
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:56,411
there's still that electricity
between us?

228
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,574
It's great to feel like that.

229
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:03,277
But when you say electricity
do you mean you're in love?

230
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:05,479
No, no.

231
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,218
That part is all over.

232
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,455
I don't want to be in love again.
I suffered too much.

233
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:13,030
Guess what happened on Thursday.

234
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,028
Thursday?

235
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,434
You'll never believe
who asked me out this Thursday.

236
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,270
Let me tell you that first.

237
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,463
You know who called me?

238
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:21,630
Facu.

239
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,971
- Facu who?
- Facundo Peña Alcaráz, who else?

240
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:31,176
I've been going out
with Facundo since Thursday.

241
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:32,648
Listen, if you see him

242
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:35,185
or even call him,
I swear I'll cut your tits off.

243
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,880
You're a nymphomaniac,
you're sick.

244
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:38,853
That's what you are.

245
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,487
Fer!

246
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,720
- Bye, Dolly.
- I'm not Dolly.

247
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:48,161
But I'd like to clone you,
like the sheep, honey.

248
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:52,861
Stop messing with the clients.

249
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,537
With three girls like that one,
I'd make myself a kebab.

250
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,642
If you want a kebab,
the grill bar is on the corner.

251
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:18,759
I'll turn it off.

252
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:21,490
Just a minute.

253
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:23,462
Hang on.

254
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,065
Hello.

255
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:33,369
<i>- What a surprise! How are you?
- Fine, how are you?</i>

256
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,605
<i>- Are you busy?
- Yes, I'm rehearsing.</i>

257
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:36,738
But it doesn't matter.

258
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:40,285
How are you?
Writing a great part for me?

259
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:44,617
I think we've been playing that
since we met, haven't we?

260
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:45,686
You fool...

261
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,787
Listen, Sebas rang me.

262
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:50,657
He wants us all to meet up.

263
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,663
<i>This is Sergio Alvarado.
Please leave a message.</i>

264
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,735
<i>Sergio, this is Sebas.
How are you?</i>

265
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:01,829
<i>I was wondering if we could meet.
You see? I still call you.</i>

266
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:03,272
<i>Why don't we meet at Duke's?</i>

267
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,976
<i>With Vale and Marcos.
You could call them.</i>

268
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:08,945
Smile.

269
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:10,241
<i>I miss you all.</i>

270
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:11,373
We haven't met in ages.

271
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,111
Face to face, I mean.

272
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,246
I think a lot about you all, but...

273
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,750
I'm kind of tied up tomorrow

274
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:25,058
but the day after
we could meet around 8:00.

275
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,828
If you can't make it, call me.
Otherwise, I'll see you then.

276
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,496
All the best, man.
Bye.

277
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,769
He doesn't appear for months
and then...

278
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:37,171
No one's forcing you.

279
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,938
No, I'll be there.
In the Garllington?

280
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:40,873
<i>OK.</i>

281
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,507
And how are you?

282
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:45,947
Jealous.

283
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,484
Are you still rehearsing
with that guy you mentioned?

284
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,088
At least he believes in me.

285
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:54,022
And he's not married.

286
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:55,689
Neither am I.

287
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,294
You separated?

288
00:19:58,263 --> 00:19:58,820
Yeah.

289
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,728
Listen, I spoke to Marcos,
he's definitely coming.

290
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:05,199
Can I ask you something?

291
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,105
Which of the three
do you miss most?

292
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:10,465
Curly.

293
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:12,510
<i>The fat one made me laugh most.</i>

294
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:15,738
I have to go, they'll kill me.

295
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:16,848
See you soon.

296
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,679
<i>- Kisses.
- Same here.</i>

297
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,530
I'm sorry. Can we start again?
Forgive me.

298
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:45,274
Come on.

299
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:05,129
<i>In a café for losers</i>

300
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,125
<i>surrounded by drinkers,</i>

301
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:13,764
<i>a malevo remembers his loves,</i>

302
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:18,870
<i>with tears.</i>

303
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:22,445
<i>Meanwhile, the musicians,</i>

304
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:26,818
<i>caressing their instruments,</i>

305
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:33,488
<i>fill with sad accents
the crowded café</i>

306
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,286
<i>where hardened thieves</i>

307
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:40,661
<i>dream sadly of money.</i>

308
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,667
<i>With your arrogant appearance,</i>

309
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:48,366
<i>you dazzled me,
you filled me with hope</i>

310
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:52,341
<i>like a simple idiot.</i>

311
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:58,473
<i>And in the same way
you made me throw the dagger,</i>

312
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:02,781
<i>and for my final undoing
I stole for your affection.</i>

313
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:04,889
<i>You fooled me like a child</i>

314
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:09,323
<i>but that debt must be paid.</i>

315
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,632
<i>Your end is already written,</i>

316
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:18,601
<i>it's easy to imagine,</i>

317
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,640
<i>very soon you'll end up</i>

318
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:27,103
<i>in the hands of a compadrito.</i>

319
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:31,382
<i>And when that tempting body</i>

320
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:34,715
<i>has finally wilted,</i>

321
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:42,589
<i>some guy will be called onto finish you off.</i>

322
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:45,359
<i>No one wants the banner</i>

323
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:51,096
<i>if the procession is long.</i>

324
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:58,568
<i>Now we'll have today's
main financial news.</i>

325
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:03,036
<i>A new fall on the European markets
has alarmed local firms</i>

326
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:05,706
<i>dealing in the region,
especially in Spain.</i>

327
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:08,316
<i>The paella effect could mean</i>

328
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,615
<i>serious losses for Brazil and Argentina.</i>

329
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:12,814
<i>Yesterday,
two mobile coronary units</i>

330
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:15,860
<i>were called to the Stock Exchange
in Buenos Aires...</i>

331
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:21,890
I'm sick of the news.

332
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,900
Being skint has its advantages,
doesn't it?

333
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:29,101
I don't know.
Sebas is coming tomorrow.

334
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:30,639
The yuppie has appeared.

335
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:32,802
- Great.
- Vale's coming too.

336
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:35,873
Gorgeous Val, that is a treat.

337
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:39,609
Why don't you buy fresh cold-cuts
for us to nibble on?

338
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:42,346
Everything is stale here.

339
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,070
- Go on, give me a coin.
- No!

340
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:05,476
I'll buy you a sandwich
if you want.

341
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,049
- A ham and cheese sandwich.
- And a Coke!

342
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,584
A Coke.

343
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:22,990
What is a letter?
Is that a letter?

344
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,931
No, it's a film script.

345
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:30,700
I write what the characters
say in a film

346
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,066
everything that happens.
That's my job.

347
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,155
Have you ever been to the cinema?
Do you know what a film is?

348
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:52,821
I don't remember.

349
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:55,826
Can I have another?
This won't last long.

350
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:58,327
Finish that one first,
and we'll see.

351
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,594
You've seen TV.

352
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:08,500
There are people, cartoons...

353
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,770
There are smashed cars,
with blood.

354
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:14,411
Yes, there are lots of things.

355
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,073
But in the cinema,
everything suddenly goes dark

356
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:18,172
and there's a machine

357
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:22,514
and it projects from a distance
on a kind of huge sheet.

358
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:24,020
If it's dark you can't see.

359
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:26,419
No, because this machine
I'm talking about

360
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:29,560
projects with lights
on that screen

361
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:32,528
and you see everything
as if it were a dream.

362
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:35,189
I dreamed about my mom once
but I don't remember her face.

363
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:39,899
I don't understand.

364
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:43,374
If you waken,
does the film end?

365
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:47,878
No, in the cinema it's like
dreaming when you're awake.

366
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:52,006
It's as if a guy like me
was telling you his dream.

367
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:55,513
If I tell you a dream about my mom,
could you do it in the cinema?

368
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,247
Could you?

369
00:25:58,156 --> 00:25:59,748
I don't know.

370
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:03,655
I mean, I didn't
really know your mom.

371
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:05,451
I don't know.

372
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,131
You don't remember
what she was like?

373
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:12,197
She killed herself long time ago.

374
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:15,799
But if I tell you about it

375
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:19,774
can you make a mom for me
in the cinema? Can you do that?

376
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,105
Can you?

377
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:24,206
Can you, men?

378
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,008
Yes!

379
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:28,517
No! I don't know, it depends.

380
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,021
A guy would have to come along

381
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:32,680
with a lot of money
and put up the money...

382
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,954
You've got money. You bought me
two sandwiches and a Coke.

383
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,585
But you need a lot of money.

384
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:40,460
Just to go to sleep?

385
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:43,864
No, to make your dream...
The film...

386
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,697
But I dreamed of my mom for free!

387
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:49,136
It isn't that easy.

388
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:50,899
You have to shoot the film,
baby...

389
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:52,840
I'm sorry.

390
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,904
I'm sorry, what's your name?

391
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:59,550
The cops call me Juana Moreno.

392
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:02,611
They bug me all day
at the station.

393
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:06,047
You know what the kids call me?

394
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:08,158
They call me Small-Ass.

395
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:11,258
Will I tell you
why they call me that?

396
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:15,331
No, because then
you'll call me Small-Ass.

397
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:18,433
No, your name is Juana.

398
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:21,834
Listen, Juana,
you come here tomorrow...

399
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:26,239
No, come on Monday,
at this time.

400
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:29,209
- When the sun goes down...
- The sun goes?

401
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:31,412
Sometimes.

402
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,111
You come here
and I'll take you to the cinema.

403
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:41,256
You're a great cooker, boss!

404
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:51,896
If she becomes a regular
I'll kick your ass...

405
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:55,006
And now you tell me, bitch!
Are you going to apologize?

406
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:57,274
Don't you dare turn up!

407
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:59,001
If I get fired because of you,
I'll kill you!

408
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,206
No, leave him alone!

409
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:04,373
Get out of here!

410
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:12,318
Get out of here, son of a bitch!

411
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:26,768
Thank you.

412
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:29,531
Forgive me.

413
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:33,102
Why is a woman like you
with that beast?

414
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:38,047
He lost control.
He's never hit me before.

415
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:38,945
Never?

416
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:41,149
Excuse me.

417
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,352
I have to go, Duke.

418
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:47,050
Are you OK?

419
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:51,791
Take care.

420
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:04,039
What did he call you?

421
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:06,434
I'm Ariel,
but some people call me Duke.

422
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:08,272
It's a long story.

423
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:10,038
I'm Esther.

424
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:15,346
I'll bring you some ice.
That's turning red.

425
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,613
It's all right, thank you.

426
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,789
I insist

427
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:23,726
it's going to look awful.

428
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:25,588
Wait here.

429
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:33,862
What's so funny?
Don't open your mouth!

430
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,580
<i>Why do I want to leave?</i>

431
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,675
<i>He sekems a nice guy.</i>

432
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:50,787
<i>Do I need a thug
who'll beat me up?</i>

433
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,715
<i>Isn't an ordinary man good enough?</i>

434
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:57,055
<i>What the hell do you want, Esther?.</i>

435
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:25,747
- Where is she?
- She left.

436
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:40,493
Why didn't you tell me?

437
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:41,664
You told me
to say nothing!

438
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,498
Dickhead!

439
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,647
Hey, there, gorgeous Val!

440
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:12,985
Ignore that guy.
Come here!

441
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:15,525
You gorgeous baby.

442
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:18,126
It's been so long!

443
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:20,423
- How are you?
- And you?

444
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:22,829
- Fine. What about you?
- I'm fine.

445
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:25,825
How are you?

446
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:27,396
You look

447
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:29,429
absolutely lovely.

448
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:32,799
You dkon't look so bad yourself.

449
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:34,440
It's my style.

450
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:38,614
I'm still pretty, still on my own

451
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:40,308
and still as crazy as ever

452
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:42,682
because, otherwise,
why am I on my own?

453
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:48,418
- How are things?
- Fine.

454
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:49,550
Sorry I'm late.

455
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:54,491
I forgive you.

456
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,230
- Cold, Duke?
- No, lukewarm.

457
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:06,967
I'm going to help Humanity
and kill you.

458
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:11,744
Throw away the toothpick,
vulgar bus boy.

459
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:17,046
He can't take charge,
I'm telling you.

460
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:20,988
- I'll leave it to you.
- That's it.

461
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,592
Where's Sebas?

462
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,354
He should have left work
an hour ago, right?

463
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:28,896
Maybe he went home to change.

464
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:30,456
No, that's in the other direction.

465
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:33,462
Get your bearings.

466
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:35,537
I've got them.

467
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,108
- And your girl?
- What?

468
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:41,110
- Your girl?
- They're all the same.

469
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,974
- I'm asking about yours.
- Hey, hey!

470
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:45,315
Wasn't I the only one here?

471
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,213
But you broke the mould, gorgeous!

472
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:50,416
I went behind the counter,
to get some ice...

473
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:52,853
No, stop, don't tell us yet.

474
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:54,582
Wait for Sebas,
so he can hear it too.

475
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:56,659
Come on, it's a great story.

476
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,159
And we've got his story
with the nutter yesterday.

477
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:03,765
Don't forget your hit
in the cemetery.

478
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:05,700
That has to go on the agenda too.

479
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:10,235
Is it just my impression
or are you all desperate?

480
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:13,071
You're picking up girls
in the nut house, in the cemetery...

481
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:15,635
Duke, where's yours from?

482
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:17,704
She must be a local,
she left without paying.

483
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:29,358
Has Sebas stood us up?

484
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:34,429
- You're sure it was today?
- Yeah, of course.

485
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,592
I'll call him.

486
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,565
- Give me a light.
- Shall I call him?

487
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:41,002
Here.

488
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,140
Marta?

489
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:56,280
Sergio.

490
00:35:58,356 --> 00:35:59,823
No, seriously,
we're waiting for him.

491
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:03,958
What?

492
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:08,957
What?

493
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:19,901
He killed himself.

494
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:22,610
Marta!

495
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:24,847
- What is it?
- He's dead.

496
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:26,383
- Who?
- Sebas.

497
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,712
Marta!

498
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:28,944
Marta!

499
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:01,372
This is a wonderful photo.

500
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:04,276
I asked Sebas to make me a copy.

501
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:06,848
I like to remember
when you were all kids

502
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:10,216
and came here to study.
Do you remember?

503
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,050
Of course.

504
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,620
But that photo
is only two years old.

505
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:16,124
It was Sebas' birthday.

506
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:27,333
I downloaded it from his computer.
He had it under "Testament".

507
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:33,101
Imagine, two weeks ago
he was here having lunch with me.

508
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:36,903
He told me off
because I drank a lot.

509
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:38,981
He told me he was in love.

510
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:42,247
They weren't living together
but he was in love.

511
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:45,083
No one kills himself
if he feels like that!

512
00:38:45,222 --> 00:38:48,248
I don't know, Marta.

513
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:55,990
Maybe it was unrequited love.
I don't know.

514
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:05,702
Forgive me, love,
but my head is full of shit.

515
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,368
I feel like a sewer.

516
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:11,543
Read it. What he's asking for
is silly, but...

517
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:15,349
It's better than
having him up there.

518
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:21,188
I want a different memory
of my son.

519
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:26,959
I feel hatred!

520
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:31,191
A hatred I haven't felt for ages.
It's a hatred

521
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:33,736
that I never knew before, Sergio

522
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:37,205
because it's not aimed at anyone.
It's got no target.

523
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:39,333
It's so strong I feel younger.

524
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:42,277
I want to sleep with a man again.

525
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:45,648
I'd like you to know how I feel.

526
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,446
No, I don't want to sleep with you,
don't worry!

527
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:03,689
- Where's the guy who sits there?
- He's not coming.

528
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:06,266
- Why?
- He can't.

529
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,033
He promised me.
When's he coming?

530
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:16,513
One of these days.
Afriend of his died.

531
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,978
When a friend of mine died
I cried just once.

532
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:25,147
Then I got another friend.

533
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:29,316
Tell him he promised me, OK?

534
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:31,624
I'll be back, OK?

535
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:33,957
He's not to forget, OK?

536
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:34,895
I'll tell him.

537
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:39,963
Doesn't the radio work?

538
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:46,643
- Hello.
- Hello.

539
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:51,041
- How are you?
- Hello.

540
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,548
- Fine?
- Fine.

541
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:54,683
What's that?

542
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,482
It's Sebas.
Will you give him a kiss?

543
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:01,224
He isn't what he was,
but he loves you.

544
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:02,792
Like always.

545
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:04,989
You're all assholes!

546
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,721
Wait, wait!

547
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:09,924
Here, read his will,
it's what he wanted.

548
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:11,864
Go on, read it!

549
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:33,814
But why here?

550
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,183
What happened to him here?

551
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,864
I don't think anything special
happened to him here.

552
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,034
Now, to remember him

553
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:47,037
we won't go to the cemetery,
we'll go camping.

554
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:48,195
This place isn't bad.

555
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:52,642
And why us?

556
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:56,906
You were his best friends,
but me? I never saw him.

557
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:02,010
I didn't see him much either,
but we were still friends.

558
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:04,614
You were at school with him

559
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:07,690
and later on, you and he
dated for two years.

560
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:14,991
So why aren't
all his ex-girlfriends here

561
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:16,691
including the ones
he two-timed me with?

562
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:20,926
You're unforgettable.

563
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:25,604
When I told you

564
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:29,375
he'd never stopped loving you
I wasn't joking.

565
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:33,574
We didn't talk much about you,
for obvious reasons

566
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:37,409
but I'm sure it hurt him
to remember you.

567
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:39,712
He never forgave himself
for leaving you.

568
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:49,958
So all the guys I've dated
and who've left me

569
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,659
are going to leave me their ashes?

570
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:53,236
Great.

571
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:56,339
Don't look at me.
I didn't leave you.

572
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,568
You left me.

573
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:00,769
I left you.

574
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:03,672
But you know why?

575
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:08,646
It was because
Sebas was my best friend

576
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,681
and someone told me

577
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:14,256
he was terribly in love with you

578
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:16,384
and our romance was kind of over,
wasn't it?

579
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:20,955
Not for me.

580
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,704
I'm sorry. In any case,
I won't leave you my ashes.

581
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:36,876
You loved Sebas, didn't you?

582
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:40,746
A lot.

583
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:44,685
The three of you.

584
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:50,553
That's why we're here.

585
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:56,457
Beer?

586
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:58,831
- To Sebas.
- No.

587
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:00,995
I don't think he'd like it.

588
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,206
We'll drink to ourselves,
we're alive.

589
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,714
And may we be sufficiently

590
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:15,708
intelligent to understand
his message.

591
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:17,651
Cheers!

592
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:19,188
What message?

593
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,918
There is none. He went down
with the company, that's all.

594
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:26,463
Marcos is right.
He wanted to bring us together

595
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:28,155
to tell us something.

596
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:31,030
Guys, Sebas

597
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:34,626
wasn't into leaving messages
or giving advice.

598
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:37,467
He didn't believe
in mysteries or fate

599
00:44:37,574 --> 00:44:39,565
or gods who determined life.

600
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:40,974
He was Sebas.

601
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:43,878
And you heard
his friend in the company.

602
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:45,744
If he hadn't killed himself,
they'd have killed him.

603
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:48,114
Maybe that's what he wanted
to tell us.

604
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:54,615
I reckon we can think
1,000 different things

605
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:56,420
about what he wanted to say.

606
00:44:58,395 --> 00:45:00,590
I think we're going to realize
over time.

607
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:07,360
Sebas was right.
This place is lovely.

608
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:11,133
Here, nobody steals
your bronze plaque or your flowers.

609
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:12,537
Yeah, it's nice.

610
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:15,711
The only things you can lose here
are your contact lenses

611
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:18,347
and your virginity.

612
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,647
Val, you still look good.

613
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:24,311
Of course I do, idiot.

614
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:25,878
Nothing's dropped.

615
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:31,053
You'd like a girl with a figure
like this, wouldn't you?

616
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:35,488
You're the one who's showing
your years.

617
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,634
Are you chasing schoolgirls yet?

618
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:42,068
No, I'm not down to that yet.

619
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:46,236
I'm on offer, eh?

620
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:04,521
Does anyone want to say anything?

621
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:08,355
Could he swim?

622
00:46:15,572 --> 00:46:17,972
I can't think of anything
he didn't know already.

623
00:46:20,878 --> 00:46:21,674
Neither can I.

624
00:46:39,763 --> 00:46:41,128
Move! Move, duck!

625
00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:42,826
- Go away!
- Stop that!

626
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:44,059
They're going to eat Sebas!

627
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:45,031
Shoo, shoo!

628
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:47,501
- Get out of here!
- Fucking ducks, scram!

629
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:55,607
They're eating Sebas!

630
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:57,340
Shall I throw the box at them?

631
00:46:57,447 --> 00:46:59,938
No, not the box.
Here, put the lid on.

632
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:02,978
Duck shit.

633
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:06,821
That's what he's going to be.
Duck shit.

634
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:15,162
He'll turn into that.

635
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:18,028
Are you the kind who says
this is half empty, not half full?

636
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:20,796
What else could he turn into?

637
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:23,668
I don't know.
Ducklings, paté...

638
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:28,837
What's so funny?

639
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:34,781
No, but seriously

640
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:37,478
if Marta ever

641
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:39,713
asks how it went

642
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:43,552
don't go into details.
Just say

643
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,594
it was lovely, her son

644
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:51,096
merged with Nature
and with God.

645
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:54,194
Sebas didn't believe in God.

646
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:55,770
Marta does.

647
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:02,341
What did Marta say
about him being in love?

648
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,745
That he wasn't in a relationship
but he was in love.

649
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:11,878
It's odd, Sebas never talked
to Marta about those things

650
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:16,157
Either he lied to her
or he was madly in love.

651
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:20,487
Who drove him so crazy?

652
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:24,826
Fuck off.

653
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:39,710
That's it, it's over.

654
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:42,876
I'll tell you a story.

655
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:45,717
Skip it.

656
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:47,886
I'm all right

657
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:49,489
really.

658
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:54,189
I prefer to think
he's going to become ducklings.

659
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:08,735
Well, anyway...

660
00:49:09,546 --> 00:49:10,979
It was one thing

661
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:13,878
not seeing him because
the bastard never had any time.

662
00:49:14,985 --> 00:49:16,850
It's another not seeing him
because he isn't here.

663
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:22,053
I'll get over it
if we keep seeing each other.

664
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:25,452
And you don't disappear.

665
00:49:29,433 --> 00:49:30,331
Bye.

666
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:11,901
Don't go after them,
they're armed!

667
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:14,010
No, I won't follow them,
don't worry.

668
00:50:14,878 --> 00:50:18,314
It's over now.
Are you all right?

669
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:20,416
- I'm going to...
- No, wait.

670
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:23,610
No, no, fuck them anyway.

671
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:38,530
The show we're rehearsing
has been postponed again, so...

672
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:41,967
I'll have more time.

673
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:51,269
But when you meet at Duke's
I'm usually in the gym

674
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:53,212
or rehearsing.
It's complicated.

675
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:56,648
But I guess there'll be
fewer rehearsals.

676
00:51:01,024 --> 00:51:02,321
I'll try to go.

677
00:51:12,636 --> 00:51:13,660
What's wrong?

678
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:21,210
Apart from the reason
that brought us together

679
00:51:25,515 --> 00:51:27,881
I feel well

680
00:51:29,886 --> 00:51:31,353
I really like it.

681
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:38,289
But it hurts too.

682
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:50,333
One can't rewind, right?

683
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:54,438
Bye

684
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:03,775
Hello.

685
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:07,780
Hello.

686
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:12,515
You were mugged
and then you fainted.

687
00:53:19,262 --> 00:53:20,320
They hit you there.

688
00:53:20,597 --> 00:53:22,565
There was some blood
but I cleaned it off.

689
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:26,731
- Are you all right?
- I remember.

690
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:29,663
I remember.

691
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:37,641
What?

692
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:47,149
I fainted because I was shit scared,
not because of the blow.

693
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:00,563
A whiskey would do me more good.
Could you?

694
00:54:19,556 --> 00:54:21,786
- Thank you, Marcos.
- You're welcome.

695
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:29,827
Is being afraid
a symptom of old age?

696
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:33,202
I'm asking because
a night like this

697
00:54:34,871 --> 00:54:36,771
would have aroused me before.

698
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:42,737
I never met anyone who was
aroused by a mugging.

699
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:44,369
It's kind of weird.

700
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:47,244
I meant, being in
a stranger's house.

701
00:54:50,854 --> 00:54:52,788
And today I'm a dangerous guy.

702
00:54:53,556 --> 00:54:54,716
Why?

703
00:54:57,861 --> 00:55:00,056
Because I'm...

704
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:03,392
I'm very sad,
there's a lot of shit.

705
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:06,567
Well...

706
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:10,169
I really don't want
to sleep on my own.

707
00:55:10,273 --> 00:55:12,673
That's it.
But it's best.

708
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:21,377
- Is the janitor going to kill you?
- No, he won't.

709
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:23,178
He's a sweetheart.

710
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,084
And he's got the hots for me.

711
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:29,582
He nearly had a heart attack
when he saw this dress.

712
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:33,093
It's really late!

713
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:35,424
<i>Who's calling
at this time?</i>

714
00:55:35,565 --> 00:55:36,948
<i>- Jaime!
- Yes.</i>

715
00:55:36,983 --> 00:55:38,332
It's me, Esther.

716
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:41,733
I had my purse stolen.
Could you let me in, please?

717
00:55:41,871 --> 00:55:44,169
<i>Yes, ma'am,
I'll be right down.</i>

718
00:55:45,408 --> 00:55:46,568
Thank you.

719
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:52,307
"Ma'am". I tell him I'm "Miss"
but he insists.

720
00:55:58,088 --> 00:56:00,716
I think you should go now
because

721
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:03,325
he might go crazy with jealousy.

722
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:08,186
It's nice like this, isn't it?

723
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:13,030
No phone numbers, no dates

724
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:14,830
no kisses.

725
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,899
If we meet again,
it'll be by chance.

726
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:23,478
All right.

727
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:24,535
Yes.

728
00:56:25,782 --> 00:56:27,807
- Miss.
- Miss.

729
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:35,448
I'm off.

730
00:56:56,613 --> 00:57:00,913
<i>A veteran of insomnia
I'm prematurely old.</i>

731
00:57:01,117 --> 00:57:05,076
<i>My words get tired,
it's not a manner of speech.</i>

732
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:09,522
<i>I have an Italian guitar.
For the hungry no bread is stale.</i>

733
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:13,788
<i>Mario straightens it out
but it always bends again.</i>

734
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:18,030
<i>To pay for the wedding
and the ring, I sold the car.</i>

735
00:57:18,568 --> 00:57:22,060
<i>An innocent youth,
I auctioned off my freedom.</i>

736
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:27,305
<i>I'm a TVjunkie, with the sound
tumed down at night,</i>

737
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:32,279
<i>so that it won't disturb her,
though she's no longer here.</i>

738
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:51,430
<i>Silly, don't exile me
from your mouth.</i>

739
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:55,297
<i>You're partly to blame,
so mention me again.</i>

740
00:57:56,473 --> 00:58:00,275
<i>Typical of me, always in pain.</i>

741
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:04,440
<i>I get dealt a good hand
and I have to ruin it.</i>

742
00:58:05,582 --> 00:58:08,346
<i>You took great care of me.</i>

743
00:58:08,585 --> 00:58:12,783
<i>You told my mother
you would tame me.</i>

744
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:18,053
<i>My revolution was just for show.</i>

745
00:58:18,228 --> 00:58:20,753
<i>You lost patience</i>

746
00:58:20,964 --> 00:58:23,990
<i>when I was about to weaken.</i>

747
00:58:24,133 --> 00:58:28,968
<i>I was your rabid toy,
your myth in chains.</i>

748
00:58:29,105 --> 00:58:33,235
<i>You had me as an amulet,
a guy for your cross.</i>

749
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:37,869
<i>I've made it up with your picture,
I've kissed it so often,</i>

750
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:41,916
<i>and I cling to it
when there's a blackout.</i>

751
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:46,112
<i>In my insolent guitar
there's a crouching tango:</i>

752
00:58:46,256 --> 00:58:50,090
<i>"Woman you dumped me"
I can't even sing to you.</i>

753
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:55,095
<i>I've ran out of lyrics,
I'm choking on a verse</i>

754
00:58:55,265 --> 00:59:00,965
<i>in which I tell you to go to hell,
then I beg you one more time.</i>

755
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:18,718
<i>Silly, don't exile me

756
00:59:18,855 --> 00:59:23,792
<i>You're partly to blame,

757
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:27,487

<i>I get dealt a good hand

759
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:35,963

760
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:40,509
<i>You told my mother
you would sort me out.</i>

761
00:59:41,978 --> 00:59:45,709
<i>My revolution was just for show.</i>

762
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:48,750
<i>You lost patience</i>

00:59:48,785 --> 00:59:52,687
<i>when I was about to weaken.</i>

764
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:09,661
<i>When I was</i>

765
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:19,715
<i>about to weaken.</i>

766
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:36,657
Sergio told me you left
my son's ashes in a lovely place.

767
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,229
Yes.

768
01:00:39,902 --> 01:00:42,268
It was very pretty.

769
01:00:42,405 --> 01:00:43,429
Thank you.

770
01:00:52,515 --> 01:00:55,718
Is it true that Sebas
told you he was in love

771
01:00:55,753 --> 01:00:57,083
but not with whom?

772
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:58,711
You loved him,
didn't you?

773
01:00:59,922 --> 01:01:01,890
Were you really in love with him?

774
01:01:02,025 --> 01:01:05,188
Yes. I was in love.

775
01:01:06,295 --> 01:01:08,024
What made you change

776
01:01:08,765 --> 01:01:12,257
from being friends
to becoming a couple?

777
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:17,532
Was it a case of affection
combined with horniness?

778
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:21,268
You went from friendship
to love? How was it?

779
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:24,572
That's simplifying it a bit,
but yes.

780
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,115
Why?

781
01:01:29,318 --> 01:01:32,515
Last night I had sex
with an old friend.

782
01:01:32,622 --> 01:01:36,524
It was great!
It started there.

783
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:40,754
You're not violating a sacred place.

784
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:45,161
We started there, but we ended up
in the bedroom, all very proper.

785
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:50,799
You didn't answer me.

786
01:01:52,842 --> 01:01:55,037
Don't you know
who Sebas was in love with?

787
01:01:55,178 --> 01:01:59,114
No, I don't know.

788
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:02,374
You want to know
if he still loved you?

789
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:06,253
Look, if I knew that he did,
I wouldn't tell you

790
01:02:07,256 --> 01:02:11,124
because most women tend to attach
happiness to a memory.

791
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:14,226
And that's no use.

792
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:17,866
Look at me.
I've got loads of memories.

793
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:22,336
But last night, if I'd stayed
attached to them

794
01:02:22,371 --> 01:02:28,708
I would never, ever, have let
such an event happen.

795
01:02:28,845 --> 01:02:30,904
And it isn't a joke, you know?

796
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:33,710
It had been so long...

797
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:36,341
Oh, God, so much time wasted.

798
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:41,656
I'm sorry to tell you all this
but I can't tell my friends.

799
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:45,227
They'd think I was crazy,
they'd judge me.

800
01:02:45,394 --> 01:02:49,990
They'd think I was profaning
the mourning for my son's death.

801
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:52,794
They think that
after a certain age

802
01:02:52,969 --> 01:02:57,303
it's more dignified
to close down that area.

803
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:03,403
I don't understand all this.

804
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:07,080
It's as if my son's death
had wakened me.

805
01:03:08,251 --> 01:03:11,888
I was living because I had
a roof, I was breathing.

806
01:03:11,923 --> 01:03:13,515
I'd get dressed, go out

807
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:17,150
I ate because it was lunchtime,
or suppertime.

808
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:21,594
But I wasn't doing things
because I wanted to live.

809
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:23,829
I was on automatic.

810
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:28,603
I don't know
if it seems stupid but

811
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:31,273
I wasn't alive.

812
01:03:33,075 --> 01:03:35,873
No, it doesn't seem stupid.

813
01:03:45,454 --> 01:03:46,785
The street is jumping.

814
01:03:46,923 --> 01:03:48,322
It's what?

815
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,289
I mean, with women.

816
01:03:52,628 --> 01:03:55,119
Girls are springing up
like mushrooms.

817
01:03:55,198 --> 01:03:58,395
The girls were always there,
but they didn't show anything.

818
01:03:58,501 --> 01:03:59,900
Now, with the heat

819
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:02,230
they reveal more,
but we say this

820
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:06,365
every time the summer begins.
Every year, it's the same.

821
01:04:07,243 --> 01:04:09,234
Look! Look at that short one!

822
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:11,673
I really like the short ones.

823
01:04:11,781 --> 01:04:13,646
So do I.

824
01:04:13,816 --> 01:04:15,716
What is it about short ones?

825
01:04:15,818 --> 01:04:18,184
- I don't know, it's...
- What I like

826
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:22,515
is that everything
is closer together.

827
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:26,353
What sex is Buenos Aires?

828
01:04:26,562 --> 01:04:27,663
I don't get it.

829
01:04:27,698 --> 01:04:28,764
Why do you ask?

830
01:04:28,831 --> 01:04:31,527
I need to know, I'm working.
What sex is Buenos Aires?

831
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:33,569
The obelisk
or the 9 de Julio Avenue canal?

832
01:04:36,806 --> 01:04:39,673
For me it's a girl.

833
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:42,542
A difficult girl

834
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:45,010
wild.

835
01:04:46,849 --> 01:04:49,374
When you don't have her,
you miss her

836
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:53,882
and when you do

837
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:57,992
at times it's great, at times
you'd throw her out the window.

838
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:01,324
You insult each other

839
01:05:02,632 --> 01:05:05,100
but you never say
you don't want to see her again

840
01:05:06,636 --> 01:05:07,864
because you love her.

841
01:05:10,172 --> 01:05:12,504
Of course it's hard to admit it

842
01:05:13,809 --> 01:05:16,334
but she's indispensable.

843
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:18,073
You need her.

844
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:23,752
But when does any real
porteño from Buenos Aires

845
01:05:23,886 --> 01:05:26,480
admit that anyone is indispensable?

846
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:28,557
Just in tangos.

847
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:31,026
But in real life

848
01:05:31,694 --> 01:05:32,558
no way.

849
01:05:33,462 --> 01:05:34,394
A girl.

850
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:36,826
Buenos Aires is a girl.

851
01:05:46,976 --> 01:05:48,534
I was that close

852
01:05:49,745 --> 01:05:50,871
to tears.

853
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:55,440
And I thought I had
a silver tongue.

854
01:05:56,385 --> 01:05:58,452
You should be in Harvard.

855
01:05:58,487 --> 01:06:00,769
Teaching class
and screwing all the girls.

856
01:06:00,804 --> 01:06:03,051
For every girl you screw,
you plant a flag.

857
01:06:07,263 --> 01:06:08,389
I have to piss.

858
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:13,761
Fuck you, anyway.

859
01:06:13,836 --> 01:06:14,564
Hello.

860
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,730
Here's someone indispensable.

861
01:06:25,614 --> 01:06:28,378
- Duke.
- Hello, gorgeous.

862
01:06:28,517 --> 01:06:30,576
- How are you?
- Fine.

863
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:38,657
At that table, we had a lovely
conversation with Sebas.

864
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:42,794
Excuse me.

865
01:06:45,301 --> 01:06:47,201
Going to the washroom
together, like girls?

866
01:06:54,276 --> 01:06:56,005
How are you doing, baby?

867
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,079
I'm doing.

868
01:07:03,719 --> 01:07:06,688
I can't stand it
when she's melancholic.

869
01:07:06,789 --> 01:07:09,314
We all react in our own way.
Can't she do that?

870
01:07:09,492 --> 01:07:12,461
Yes, but she always infects me
with her moods

871
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:14,223
and I was having a good day.

872
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:17,429
- You're an idiot.
- What's up?

873
01:07:17,566 --> 01:07:19,363
Fuck you!

874
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:23,734
Couldn't you aim the other way?

875
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:26,240
They're two grown men.

876
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:29,310
I don't think they mind you
showing how you feel.

877
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:34,181
They want to talk about Sebas too,
but they won't admit it.

878
01:07:44,527 --> 01:07:46,017
Did you catch it
in your zip?

879
01:07:47,663 --> 01:07:48,687
No.

880
01:07:49,965 --> 01:07:51,296
Something similar.

881
01:07:54,703 --> 01:07:56,830
The other day, I saw
your wife in the street.

882
01:07:57,006 --> 01:07:58,473
Ex-wife.

883
01:08:00,476 --> 01:08:02,239
- Was she alone?
- Yes.

884
01:08:03,946 --> 01:08:05,038
How is she?

885
01:08:05,281 --> 01:08:06,612
Changed.

886
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:11,684
That's it, changed.

887
01:08:13,456 --> 01:08:14,923
That's very specific.

888
01:08:16,459 --> 01:08:17,391
What does it mean?

889
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:20,918
Has she done her tits,
dyed her hair, become a slut?

890
01:08:20,996 --> 01:08:22,429
Take it easy.

891
01:08:22,531 --> 01:08:25,125
She might be nuts,
but she is his wife.

892
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:26,963
Was.

893
01:08:27,169 --> 01:08:29,535
So now Diana is nuts?

894
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:32,106
Know what I think?

895
01:08:32,141 --> 01:08:33,993
When a girl is crazy about you

896
01:08:34,028 --> 01:08:35,845
she's the love of your life.

897
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,813
But when she dumps you

898
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:39,871
it turns out she's nuts.

899
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:42,679
Isn't that so, Duke?
It's odd.

900
01:08:42,751 --> 01:08:45,345
Things are a bit more complicated.

901
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:26,446
You know my mother says
I look like George Clooney?

902
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:28,022
- Who?
- George Clooney.

903
01:10:28,123 --> 01:10:29,556
Yeah, yeah.

904
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,187
A dead ringer.

905
01:10:33,362 --> 01:10:34,727
He's more like Ray Charles.

906
01:10:34,797 --> 01:10:35,923
Do you need anything?

907
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:38,226
- Is that your girlfriend?
- No, she's a friend.

908
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:43,569
Can you behave yourself?

909
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:48,369
- Are we going to the cinema tomorrow?
- I was here the other day.

910
01:10:48,477 --> 01:10:50,035
- And the next one.
- I know, but...

911
01:10:53,048 --> 01:10:55,516
- Yeah, the old guy told me.
- Anyway...

912
01:10:55,718 --> 01:10:58,380
Now you've got another friend.

913
01:10:58,687 --> 01:11:01,178
That girl lives around here,
on the street

914
01:11:01,290 --> 01:11:03,724
in an abandoned car.
She's homeless.

915
01:11:03,826 --> 01:11:07,853
He's so good-hearted
he's almost an idiot.

916
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:10,228
He'll never get rid of her.

917
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:13,291
Is she crazy?
I mean, really crazy?

918
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:17,064
Once I saw her giving a cop
a really rough time

919
01:11:17,139 --> 01:11:18,800
out in the street.

920
01:11:18,907 --> 01:11:21,034
I've always wanted to do that.

921
01:11:21,176 --> 01:11:23,110
We all have.

922
01:11:23,212 --> 01:11:25,146
So, shall we meet tomorrow?

923
01:11:26,181 --> 01:11:27,341
When the sun goes down.

924
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:33,887
- Your girl's lovely.
- Behave yourself.

925
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:35,446
She isn't your girl?

926
01:11:35,591 --> 01:11:39,083
- You want to screw her?
- No. See you tomorrow.

927
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:41,196
Come here, Romeo.

928
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:42,957
The nutter's a nice girl.

929
01:11:43,732 --> 01:11:44,858
Shut up.

930
01:11:46,068 --> 01:11:48,195
- I'll tell you a story.
- You asked if she was crazy?

931
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:49,464
- That girl?
- Yes.

932
01:11:50,572 --> 01:11:53,439
Up until a few years ago

933
01:11:53,542 --> 01:11:57,069
there was a little flower stall
on the corner there.

934
01:11:58,747 --> 01:12:00,977
The flower seller would
come here for a coffee.

935
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:03,699
He was a quiet guy,
he never bothered anyone.

936
01:12:03,734 --> 01:12:06,316
A nice, quiet guy.
And one day she appeared.

937
01:12:12,394 --> 01:12:13,884
- Will you give me one?
- No, no.

938
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:16,520
- Come on, just one.
- No, no.

939
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:20,101
Give me one, just one.
From there.

940
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:21,693
No, that one.
Here.

941
01:12:24,773 --> 01:12:26,172
- That one too.
- No.

942
01:12:40,656 --> 01:12:43,489
Hey, she just gave him a kiss,
that's all.

943
01:12:43,592 --> 01:12:45,116
No, she didn't kiss him.

944
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:47,592
She went down his throat.

945
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:48,856
And it wasn't the only time.

946
01:12:48,964 --> 01:12:51,956
She'd appear behind him,
by surprise.

947
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:55,195
She'd push her tongue
down his throat and run off.

948
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:58,233
And poor Riqui
was really disgusted.

949
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:07,443
And then she disappeared.

950
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:10,746
From that very moment, Riqui

951
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:13,377
began to wither

952
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:16,913
like a bunch of flowers
that wasn't sold.

953
01:13:17,993 --> 01:13:19,221
I don't know.

954
01:13:19,361 --> 01:13:22,330
For me, stalking is
a kind of strange way

955
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:24,922
of being with someone,
but it was all poor Riqui knew.

956
01:13:27,936 --> 01:13:30,336
I'll never forget the last time
I spoke to Riqui

957
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:32,601
there, at that table.

958
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:34,934
<i>Know what I did the other day?</i>

959
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:36,234
I put up a sign
saying that at 4:00 p. m.

960
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:40,745
The time she always came

961
01:13:40,849 --> 01:13:43,579
I'd give away jasmine
to all the women.

962
01:13:45,521 --> 01:13:48,752
The jasmine all disappeared
but she never came.

963
01:13:48,891 --> 01:13:51,086
She probably can't read.

964
01:13:51,193 --> 01:13:52,626
I thought that too.

965
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:57,493
No, it's me. I'm an idiot.

966
01:13:57,633 --> 01:14:00,830
The one time a girl likes me,
I screw it up.

967
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:06,708
At first I'd wait for her,
so she wouldn't surprise me.

968
01:14:09,044 --> 01:14:10,909
Now I miss waiting for her.

969
01:14:12,147 --> 01:14:14,581
I smell jasmine
and my nose bleeds!

970
01:14:17,986 --> 01:14:19,214
Why didn't you tell me before?

971
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:22,746
I'm not sure, but I think
I'm the only person he told.

972
01:14:23,992 --> 01:14:25,823
And I always wanted

973
01:14:25,928 --> 01:14:27,987
to keep that thing
about the secret of confession.

974
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:31,262
How did it end?

975
01:14:51,253 --> 01:14:54,120
When the police and ambulance came
to take away the body

976
01:14:55,991 --> 01:14:57,822
I never in my life

977
01:14:57,893 --> 01:15:00,885
saw anyone lay into the cops
like that girl did.

978
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:02,725
Never.

979
01:15:02,931 --> 01:15:05,331
They wanted to grab her
but she got away.

980
01:15:05,467 --> 01:15:09,733
Now they know her,
they know she isn't dangerous

981
01:15:09,872 --> 01:15:11,169
so they leave her alone.

982
01:15:11,907 --> 01:15:15,536
But it seems that
after that accident

983
01:15:16,712 --> 01:15:19,203
the girl lost it completely.

984
01:15:20,782 --> 01:15:26,687
I just thought you should know
a bit more about her

985
01:15:26,788 --> 01:15:29,052
before you take her out.

986
01:15:29,258 --> 01:15:32,989
She's obviously a woman
who arouses wild passions.

987
01:15:36,431 --> 01:15:38,797
After that, it started to rain.

988
01:15:40,235 --> 01:15:44,035
But I mean, rain a lot,
an awful lot.

989
01:15:44,139 --> 01:15:46,403
And it didn't stop raining
until the next day.

990
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:48,567
And suddenly she appeared.

991
01:15:48,644 --> 01:15:52,102
And she looked at me

992
01:15:53,949 --> 01:15:55,246
knowing that I knew.

993
01:15:56,184 --> 01:15:59,176
Riqui had died
in a ridiculous way

994
01:15:59,288 --> 01:16:00,721
a noble way.

995
01:16:00,856 --> 01:16:04,257
- For love.
- Yes, he died for love.

996
01:16:04,426 --> 01:16:06,986
And we were the only ones
who knew it.

997
01:16:07,129 --> 01:16:09,620
Like a novel, isn't it?

998
01:16:11,266 --> 01:16:13,359
Loving a lot isn't enough.

999
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:16,236
But that's the small print

1000
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:18,364
they don't read to you
when you're born.

1001
01:16:20,676 --> 01:16:24,305
Did I tell you my mother thinks
I look like George Clooney?

1002
01:16:24,546 --> 01:16:26,810
This guy's an asshole!

1003
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:57,802
- What's up?
- I wanted to talk to you.

1004
01:16:59,047 --> 01:17:01,675
Don't you have
one of those new inventions?

1005
01:17:04,086 --> 01:17:04,575
You open it, it's got buttons.
It's a "telephone".

1006
01:17:05,487 --> 01:17:06,681
Come in.

1007
01:17:12,494 --> 01:17:14,223
- What's up?
- Know what?

1008
01:17:16,598 --> 01:17:18,759
I came to tell you we did wrong

1009
01:17:18,934 --> 01:17:21,095
in telling Valeria not to go away.

1010
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:24,863
Wrong? I don't understand.

1011
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:27,703
She'll fuck us up.
It's happened before.

1012
01:17:30,846 --> 01:17:31,904
What do you mean?

1013
01:17:32,014 --> 01:17:34,448
If anyone can screw up
our friendship, it's her.

1014
01:17:34,549 --> 01:17:36,847
Did you see
how the slut looked at me?

1015
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:39,620
No. Hang on.

1016
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:42,180
The same way
the slut looks at you.

1017
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:44,724
Don't say it like that.

1018
01:17:45,961 --> 01:17:47,451
She's the same as ever.

1019
01:17:47,629 --> 01:17:49,756
She leads you on,
then fucks with someone else.

1020
01:17:49,898 --> 01:17:53,265
I don't care who she screws,
she's not with me.

1021
01:17:53,435 --> 01:17:54,959
But that doesn't mean...

1022
01:17:57,072 --> 01:18:00,098
It's incredible that
you don't want to realize

1023
01:18:00,242 --> 01:18:02,005
that the girl is a slut...

1024
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:03,372
You've said that four times.

1025
01:18:04,446 --> 01:18:06,243
Yes, I did say it four times.

1026
01:18:06,381 --> 01:18:07,871
What do you want to know?

1027
01:18:09,718 --> 01:18:10,878
Why are you being like this?

1028
01:18:12,454 --> 01:18:13,352
You know why I said it?

1029
01:18:16,058 --> 01:18:17,025
To see your reaction.

1030
01:18:19,227 --> 01:18:22,162
And from your reaction,
I see you really care.

1031
01:18:24,633 --> 01:18:25,497
So do something.

1032
01:18:27,069 --> 01:18:28,593
Be responsible
for your own life.

1033
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:33,207
What are you going to say?

1034
01:18:34,476 --> 01:18:36,376
That you and Diana
split up very recently?

1035
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:38,777
That was a non-starter.

1036
01:18:40,782 --> 01:18:42,079
Do you think I'm stupid?

1037
01:18:42,784 --> 01:18:44,217
I just look stupid, that's all.

1038
01:18:48,156 --> 01:18:50,852
Do something so that I can
get her out of my head.

1039
01:18:56,131 --> 01:18:57,223
You're grown up now.

1040
01:18:59,601 --> 01:19:00,727
We're grown up now.

1041
01:19:23,191 --> 01:19:24,180
That's it, Marquito.

1042
01:19:26,194 --> 01:19:27,024
You told him.

1043
01:19:48,116 --> 01:19:48,741
Hello.

1044
01:19:50,552 --> 01:19:51,576
Hello.

1045
01:19:57,292 --> 01:19:59,317
Don't you like me anymore,
or did someone buy it?

1046
01:20:01,329 --> 01:20:02,296
The portrait?

1047
01:20:06,368 --> 01:20:09,166
- Yes, I like you. I took it down.
- As you disappeared, I thought...

1048
01:20:09,271 --> 01:20:11,603
I thought you were right,
it's silly not to see each other.

1049
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:16,744
I have to go to work now
but when I come out you're not here.

1050
01:20:16,912 --> 01:20:19,142
- Your assistant...
- My assistant is rude.

1051
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:20,804
He says you leave early.

1052
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:24,644
Yes, I do leave early,
but I'll tell you what.

1053
01:20:25,153 --> 01:20:28,213
How about if we meet at 7:00
in this bar?

1054
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:29,286
OK.

1055
01:20:30,992 --> 01:20:32,323
Don't get the wrong idea.

1056
01:20:33,295 --> 01:20:34,887
I just want to see what happens.

1057
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:38,594
See you.

1058
01:21:20,976 --> 01:21:22,876
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1059
01:21:23,411 --> 01:21:25,106
- A double coffee, please.
- Right away.

1060
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:30,647
Marcos.

1061
01:21:33,788 --> 01:21:35,756
- What's up?
- You know who that is?

1062
01:21:44,366 --> 01:21:46,129
- Esther.
- Marcos.

1063
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:51,467
Don't say "It's a small world".
I hate that expression.

1064
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:55,565
She's coming.

1065
01:21:58,380 --> 01:21:59,540
You've got it

1066
01:22:00,515 --> 01:22:01,607
that anxious look.

1067
01:22:02,817 --> 01:22:04,375
Sorry,
I made you uncomfortable.

1068
01:22:05,453 --> 01:22:06,681
No.

1069
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:09,383
Go on, I'm still
having a bad time.

1070
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:12,017
Thanks for coming over.

1071
01:22:24,339 --> 01:22:26,739
- Where's Duke?
- He went to do something.

1072
01:22:27,742 --> 01:22:29,642
What's up?

1073
01:22:30,679 --> 01:22:32,010
Nothing.

1074
01:22:33,248 --> 01:22:35,478
I don't owe him any explanation.

1075
01:22:36,551 --> 01:22:38,951
Leave a few of them in peace.
That's Duke's girl.

1076
01:22:40,655 --> 01:22:42,122
Esther is Duke's girl?

1077
01:22:42,590 --> 01:22:43,750
You know her?

1078
01:22:44,859 --> 01:22:47,987
No, well, more or less.
She's a girl with problems.

1079
01:22:48,263 --> 01:22:49,321
The last thing Duke needs.

1080
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:51,432
She's got good legs.

1081
01:22:52,367 --> 01:22:55,427
When she's all dressed up,
she's really something.

1082
01:22:58,373 --> 01:23:00,102
Yes, I know I'm dressed
as a person. So?

1083
01:23:08,516 --> 01:23:09,847
No wise cracks.

1084
01:23:14,322 --> 01:23:15,220
Visitor.

1085
01:23:17,892 --> 01:23:20,360
Didn't she leave the other day
without paying?

1086
01:23:20,562 --> 01:23:23,053
Don't act tough.
This film isn't "The Dirty Dozen".

1087
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:26,190
It could be "An Affair to Remember"
but that's all.

1088
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:28,700
"A Man and a Woman".

1089
01:23:29,304 --> 01:23:31,067
"Deep Throat".

1090
01:23:31,206 --> 01:23:33,731
Don't piss me off.
If you need anything, ask Tony.

1091
01:23:33,908 --> 01:23:37,036
Wait, wait.
Take this for me.

1092
01:23:38,313 --> 01:23:40,110
Don't you want a trolley
to serve a coffee?

1093
01:23:40,715 --> 01:23:41,682
Idiot!

1094
01:23:47,188 --> 01:23:48,985
I thought I wouldn't
see you again.

1095
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:52,687
I came to pay for the other day.

1096
01:23:52,794 --> 01:23:54,261
And for this.

1097
01:23:54,396 --> 01:23:56,227
You don't have to pay anything.

1098
01:23:56,331 --> 01:23:58,458
And you don't have to run off

1099
01:23:59,401 --> 01:24:02,893
because I'll follow you,
wherever you go.

1100
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:16,879
- Hello.
- Hello.

1101
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:21,481
- Sergio, Inés.
- Hello.

1102
01:24:24,426 --> 01:24:25,586
See you later.

1103
01:24:34,936 --> 01:24:36,028
The girl frokm the cemetery?

1104
01:24:36,137 --> 01:24:38,128
A grave matter.

1105
01:24:39,007 --> 01:24:40,031
Can I have a beer?

1106
01:24:42,043 --> 01:24:43,840
I thought you weren't coming.

1107
01:24:46,347 --> 01:24:47,814
- Coffee?
- All right.

1108
01:24:47,949 --> 01:24:50,440
Tony, two coffees!

1109
01:24:53,555 --> 01:24:54,544
Well...

1110
01:24:54,689 --> 01:24:56,782
You know

1111
01:24:58,093 --> 01:24:59,560
I took the photo out of the store

1112
01:24:59,727 --> 01:25:01,524
but I've got it at home.

1113
01:25:07,802 --> 01:25:09,599
What's wrong?

1114
01:25:15,677 --> 01:25:16,974
You were hurt that much?

1115
01:25:20,515 --> 01:25:22,107
Tell me about your place.

1116
01:25:22,984 --> 01:25:25,350
Is this the cafe you told me about?

1117
01:25:26,888 --> 01:25:28,913
Yes.

1118
01:25:30,258 --> 01:25:31,122
That guy

1119
01:25:31,226 --> 01:25:33,660
is Duke,
he owns the place.

1120
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:35,695
It used to belong to his father.

1121
01:25:35,797 --> 01:25:39,233
He was a great guy,
a real phenomenon.

1122
01:25:40,268 --> 01:25:45,331
He was a journalist, a musician.
A weird guy.

1123
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:47,806
One day he had a heart attack
and died.

1124
01:25:47,909 --> 01:25:50,844
Duke took over the place
with his mother.

1125
01:25:50,945 --> 01:25:53,072
He's a bit older than us.

1126
01:25:53,181 --> 01:25:55,149
But we really hit it off with him.

1127
01:25:55,216 --> 01:25:58,413
He used to borrow
our school books.

1128
01:25:58,686 --> 01:26:01,177
We envied Duke because
he didn't go to school

1129
01:26:02,223 --> 01:26:04,691
and he envied us because we did.

1130
01:26:06,794 --> 01:26:08,394
You hardly know me.

1131
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:12,725
As a waitress I'm good,
I've got experience.

1132
01:26:13,601 --> 01:26:14,932
As a person...

1133
01:26:15,069 --> 01:26:17,485
I might let you down.

1134
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:19,902
You're scared to death.

1135
01:26:19,974 --> 01:26:23,205
The guy who hit you
left you scared to death.

1136
01:26:30,985 --> 01:26:32,043
What are yo doing, man?

1137
01:26:36,558 --> 01:26:37,422
Close the curtain.

1138
01:26:37,559 --> 01:26:38,890
I said, close the curtain!

1139
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:40,927
The till!
Open the till!

1140
01:26:43,698 --> 01:26:46,565
Here, put the money in there!

1141
01:26:46,668 --> 01:26:48,636
Hurry up, for fuck's sake!

1142
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:52,433
And nobody act the hero,
I'll take the kid as a hostage.

1143
01:26:52,574 --> 01:26:55,270
No, not the kid!
He's got a family.

1144
01:26:55,343 --> 01:26:58,005
Take me, I own this place
and I'm on my own.

1145
01:26:58,112 --> 01:27:00,205
No, he's not on his own,
he's got me!

1146
01:27:02,784 --> 01:27:04,684
- You volunteer.
- Are you crazy?

1147
01:27:04,752 --> 01:27:06,617
Go on, if he comes over
I'll grab him.

1148
01:27:06,688 --> 01:27:08,451
No, he's a father. Take me.

1149
01:27:09,724 --> 01:27:12,750
You want to drive me crazy?
You think I'm stupid?

1150
01:27:12,894 --> 01:27:13,918
Give me the bag.

1151
01:27:14,462 --> 01:27:15,724
You think this isn't loaded?

1152
01:27:15,863 --> 01:27:18,161
You little fucker, come with me!

1153
01:27:19,867 --> 01:27:21,266
Stop, you're crazy.

1154
01:27:21,369 --> 01:27:22,996
Keep out of this.

1155
01:27:23,104 --> 01:27:24,071
Don't move.

1156
01:27:24,138 --> 01:27:27,335
Take it easy.
Just calm down, please.

1157
01:27:27,442 --> 01:27:30,309
How many people are you going to kill?
They're all skint.

1158
01:27:30,378 --> 01:27:33,142
I'll kill him
for hiding behind a girl

1159
01:27:33,214 --> 01:27:35,045
and to show you it's loaded.

1160
01:27:35,116 --> 01:27:37,846
But we believe you,
we believe it's loaded.

1161
01:27:37,919 --> 01:27:40,046
Just take one hostage.

1162
01:27:41,189 --> 01:27:42,315
Take me.

1163
01:27:45,326 --> 01:27:46,088
I'm alone.

1164
01:27:47,562 --> 01:27:49,154
Why are you fucking me up?

1165
01:27:49,297 --> 01:27:50,764
You want to screw me.

1166
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:53,631
What if I do it to you?

1167
01:27:53,768 --> 01:27:55,235
Hey, stop!

1168
01:28:14,622 --> 01:28:17,022
Please, forgive me.
I've got a family.

1169
01:28:17,458 --> 01:28:20,359
I'm desperate, I lost everything!
Forgive me!

1170
01:28:20,662 --> 01:28:21,924
I left him go?!

1171
01:28:22,030 --> 01:28:23,292
Don't dare.

1172
01:28:23,398 --> 01:28:25,195
He put the gun to my head.
Are you crazy?

1173
01:28:25,333 --> 01:28:26,231
Let him go.

1174
01:28:26,334 --> 01:28:27,301
Let him go.

1175
01:28:35,176 --> 01:28:36,006
I'll kill myself.

1176
01:28:36,177 --> 01:28:39,408
Bastards, my family
have got nothing to eat!

1177
01:28:40,114 --> 01:28:42,048
You don't understand.

1178
01:28:43,484 --> 01:28:44,917
You're all assholes.

1179
01:28:45,753 --> 01:28:49,689
What the hell
could you lot ever understand?

1180
01:28:54,629 --> 01:28:57,325
- 254.
- What?

1181
01:28:58,833 --> 01:29:01,324
He took 254 pesos, Duke.

1182
01:29:34,769 --> 01:29:37,499
I don't know what to say,
because...

1183
01:29:38,806 --> 01:29:42,867
I lost my head there for a moment.

1184
01:29:43,010 --> 01:29:45,672
A second of madness
that put everyone at risk.

1185
01:29:46,781 --> 01:29:49,306
That wasn't the idea.

1186
01:29:56,057 --> 01:29:57,581
I want to apologize.

1187
01:30:02,096 --> 01:30:02,926
That's it.

1188
01:30:03,531 --> 01:30:04,759
Forgive me.

1189
01:30:09,704 --> 01:30:11,695
You're not at all
like my kind of man.

1190
01:30:13,307 --> 01:30:14,740
Of ckourse not.

1191
01:30:16,577 --> 01:30:18,374
That's why you won't get away.

1192
01:30:24,352 --> 01:30:25,944
I don't want to get romantic now.

1193
01:30:28,556 --> 01:30:30,080
Where would you hide a gun?

1194
01:30:30,958 --> 01:30:32,255
I don't know.

1195
01:30:33,895 --> 01:30:35,487
I'd throw it away

1196
01:30:35,663 --> 01:30:38,029
anything but give it to the cops.

1197
01:30:39,434 --> 01:30:41,163
I want to dance.

1198
01:30:43,938 --> 01:30:46,930
I want to dance, otherwise
I'll start crying like an idiot.

1199
01:30:49,143 --> 01:30:51,441
- I was really scared.
- All right.

1200
01:30:55,082 --> 01:30:57,607
But don't dance now,
they'll think you're mad.

1201
01:30:58,152 --> 01:30:59,983
Dont't care. Duke...

1202
01:31:00,154 --> 01:31:02,356
- What?
- Put on some music.

1203
01:31:02,391 --> 01:31:03,618
Something to dance to.

1204
01:31:05,026 --> 01:31:06,687
- All right.
- Or a good tango!

1205
01:31:06,828 --> 01:31:08,853
I want you to hear something.

1206
01:31:08,996 --> 01:31:12,454
Tony, put on that one again.

1207
01:31:21,742 --> 01:31:23,607
Let's dance.

1208
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:27,447
I can't dance to that.

1209
01:31:27,582 --> 01:31:29,174
- Come on!
- No.

1210
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:37,715
And why do they call you Duke?

1211
01:31:38,059 --> 01:31:39,754
Have you got blue blood?

1212
01:31:39,861 --> 01:31:40,953
They tell me "Doo-queh"...

1213
01:31:41,262 --> 01:31:42,490
But's pronounced "Duke".

1214
01:31:42,663 --> 01:31:45,598
I'm a fan of Duke Ellington.

1215
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:47,361
He's an old jazz musician

1216
01:31:47,468 --> 01:31:51,666
a band leader.
That's Ellington playing now.

1217
01:31:53,307 --> 01:31:55,935
That's why it's "Garllington",
for Gardel and Ellington.

1218
01:31:56,043 --> 01:31:57,704
Stupid, but I liked it.

1219
01:31:59,847 --> 01:32:01,906
Are they not going to dance?

1220
01:32:03,584 --> 01:32:05,745
I'm a tango fan, I love it.

1221
01:32:05,887 --> 01:32:07,937
But I don't understand jazz.

1222
01:32:07,972 --> 01:32:09,988
There's nothing to understand.

1223
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:15,119
Is it true
what you said to the thug?

1224
01:32:17,164 --> 01:32:20,292
Tkhat I'm not alone?
That I've got you?

1225
01:32:23,638 --> 01:32:27,335
I can be with someone
but I need my space.

1226
01:32:27,441 --> 01:32:29,306
Let's go slowly.

1227
01:32:30,144 --> 01:32:32,374
I always went too fast.

1228
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:35,014
And I get you
when the brakes are on.

1229
01:32:35,816 --> 01:32:36,874
All right.

1230
01:32:37,685 --> 01:32:39,812
With my luck, if I fell on the floor
I'd miss it.

1231
01:32:42,089 --> 01:32:43,215
I'm still scared.

1232
01:32:43,391 --> 01:32:46,849
It's logical.
He wasn't exactly Santa Claus.

1233
01:32:47,028 --> 01:32:49,656
But it's over now.
And I'm here.

1234
01:32:49,830 --> 01:32:54,961
It isn't much of a guarantee
but I think you needn't be afraid.

1235
01:32:55,870 --> 01:32:57,895
Isn't falling in love with a
photo being afraid of it all?

1236
01:33:29,036 --> 01:33:30,731
Dancing doesn't mean I'm buying.

1237
01:33:53,027 --> 01:33:54,460
Are you sure about this?

1238
01:33:55,963 --> 01:33:56,895
No.

1239
01:33:57,999 --> 01:33:59,466
I'm not sure of anything.

1240
01:34:01,369 --> 01:34:02,495
Look at me.

1241
01:34:04,572 --> 01:34:06,199
I didn't think or decide anything.

1242
01:34:08,776 --> 01:34:11,006
It was when I saw
that guy with the gun

1243
01:34:14,415 --> 01:34:16,315
and I thought
I'd never see you again.

1244
01:34:20,121 --> 01:34:22,715
Until now, you never called
or came around.

1245
01:34:27,662 --> 01:34:29,687
I got used to not seeing you.

1246
01:34:29,864 --> 01:34:31,855
I can live without seeing you.

1247
01:34:33,034 --> 01:34:37,095
But I need to know that
you're somewhere, near

1248
01:34:39,940 --> 01:34:43,171
that at that very minute
you're thinking of me.

1249
01:34:47,448 --> 01:34:49,780
I guess I'll always love you.

1250
01:34:54,588 --> 01:34:56,180
Do you love me?

1251
01:34:58,626 --> 01:35:00,093
To infinity

1252
01:35:01,128 --> 01:35:02,959
and beyond.

1253
01:35:36,530 --> 01:35:39,226
Come in. Can you dance?

1254
01:35:39,366 --> 01:35:41,493
Yes or no?
Well, come in.

1255
01:36:17,371 --> 01:36:19,168
Duke, the cops are here.

1256
01:36:19,306 --> 01:36:22,537
It'd be a crime to stop
this tango. They can wait.

1257
01:36:27,815 --> 01:36:29,282
They can wait there.

1258
01:36:36,891 --> 01:36:38,882
I think they're being assholes.

1259
01:36:39,827 --> 01:36:40,657
You're right.

1260
01:36:43,230 --> 01:36:45,698
Or we're the assholes
and we're at the wrong place

1261
01:36:45,833 --> 01:36:48,427
because they can't be
celebrating a robbery.

1262
01:36:48,602 --> 01:36:50,832
Or can they?

1263
01:36:53,602 --> 01:37:45,333
