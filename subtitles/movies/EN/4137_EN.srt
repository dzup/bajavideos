1
00:01:05,206 --> 00:01:08,903
You are seven years old.
You are a man.

2
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:12,113
Bury your first toy
and your mother's picture.

3
00:02:05,934 --> 00:02:09,802
The mole digs tunnels
under the earth,

4
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,211
Iooking for the sun.

5
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:15,631
Sometimes, he gets to the surface.

6
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,620
When he sees the sun, he is blinded.

7
00:05:27,644 --> 00:05:31,045
Kill me! Kill me, please!

8
00:05:31,147 --> 00:05:33,342
Who did this?

9
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,317
Kill me, please!

10
00:13:28,366 --> 00:13:30,630
Who?

11
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:16,557
Who?

12
00:14:16,673 --> 00:14:19,836
- It was the Colonel.
- How many were there?

13
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:22,895
Another five men.

14
00:14:23,013 --> 00:14:25,140
Where?

15
00:14:25,882 --> 00:14:30,114
At the Franciscan Mission.

16
00:18:48,611 --> 00:18:50,772
The Colonel is not selfish.

17
00:18:50,855 --> 00:18:54,757
He uses women once,
and then gives them to us.

18
00:19:03,201 --> 00:19:06,796
The Colonel
said he'd kill whoever touched me.

19
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:36,987
Who asked for them?

20
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,034
Do not anticipate my wishes.

21
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:36,546
Forgive us!

22
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:43,806
They have no soul.

23
00:23:47,569 --> 00:23:51,665
But sometimes they get bored,
so I hand them the leftovers.

24
00:23:51,773 --> 00:23:54,867
Ask, dogs. Ask!

25
00:24:04,085 --> 00:24:06,053
Stay put, dogs.

26
00:24:13,186 --> 00:24:15,552
Kiss them on the mouth.

27
00:24:36,993 --> 00:24:38,824
Go on,

28
00:24:38,903 --> 00:24:40,700
kiss the other one.

29
00:24:55,503 --> 00:24:58,097
Stay put, dogs!

30
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:12,003
These animals like to watch.

31
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:14,086
They want to look at your breasts.

32
00:25:30,037 --> 00:25:32,028
Eat, dogs!

33
00:29:23,187 --> 00:29:25,519
Who are you to judge me?

34
00:29:27,951 --> 00:29:29,942
I am God!

35
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:41,713
No, not that! Anything, but that!

36
00:29:41,823 --> 00:29:44,291
Lay him down on the ground.

37
00:32:03,264 --> 00:32:06,563
Destroy me. Depend on no one.

38
00:32:09,345 --> 00:32:12,212
Cry, boy, cry!
Cry so he'll have mercy.

39
00:33:49,045 --> 00:33:51,036
It's bitter.

40
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,166
Moses found water in the desert.

41
00:33:56,277 --> 00:33:59,804
But people couldn't drink it,
for it was bitter.

42
00:34:01,758 --> 00:34:04,454
They called the water "Mara".

43
00:34:17,382 --> 00:34:19,316
It's become sweet.

44
00:34:22,628 --> 00:34:26,155
I'll call you Mara,
for you are like bitter water.

45
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:03,800
How are we to live here?

46
00:35:29,028 --> 00:35:30,859
We'll die of thirst.

47
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:34,347
As a hind
longs for the running streams,

48
00:35:34,459 --> 00:35:38,361
so do I long for thee, oh God.

49
00:35:38,496 --> 00:35:42,762
With my soul,
I thirst for God, the living God.

50
00:36:02,336 --> 00:36:03,997
Nothing.

51
00:36:10,386 --> 00:36:11,751
Nothing.

52
00:36:11,871 --> 00:36:16,205
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

53
00:38:07,203 --> 00:38:09,262
- Do you love me?
- Yes.

54
00:38:09,372 --> 00:38:13,809
I don't. So that I may love you,
you have to be the best.

55
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:17,846
Four great gun masters
live in this desert.

56
00:38:17,972 --> 00:38:21,169
You've got to look for them,
and kill them.

57
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,219
The desert is a circle.

58
00:38:24,329 --> 00:38:27,787
To find them,
we'd have to travel in a spiral.

59
00:38:35,732 --> 00:38:38,257
I can't go on! Let's go back!

60
00:38:38,376 --> 00:38:40,844
Whenever I start something,
I finish it.

61
00:39:01,207 --> 00:39:03,266
We'll never find them.

62
00:39:03,376 --> 00:39:06,470
If they are real masters,
they will give us a signal.

63
00:39:06,571 --> 00:39:10,837
We have been walking
for days, months, years.

64
00:39:10,934 --> 00:39:12,663
How can you have such faith?

65
00:39:12,769 --> 00:39:14,498
They await us.

66
00:39:14,604 --> 00:39:16,003
The signal!

67
00:39:38,853 --> 00:39:41,048
You seek the light
in the middle of the day.

68
00:39:41,131 --> 00:39:43,861
I know what you came for.
You'll have to wait to see him.

69
00:39:43,966 --> 00:39:45,661
Just like that woman.

70
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:49,953
The master doesn't want to fight her.

71
00:39:51,866 --> 00:39:55,029
The great master
wants to see you right now.

72
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:59,113
It's strange.
He's always kept them waiting.

73
00:40:04,087 --> 00:40:06,885
After the dune, there's an oasis.

74
00:40:06,965 --> 00:40:09,024
Your woman must wait there.

75
00:40:12,979 --> 00:40:14,844
Let's go!

76
00:40:25,942 --> 00:40:28,410
Give me your gun and hat.

77
00:41:10,003 --> 00:41:12,938
I need no light. I am blind.

78
00:41:20,163 --> 00:41:22,723
Count to three and try to grab it.

79
00:41:23,733 --> 00:41:27,601
One, two, three...

80
00:41:32,392 --> 00:41:33,825
How?

81
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:38,347
I try not to win, but to achieve
the perfect domain.

82
00:41:38,481 --> 00:41:41,507
So as not to fear the bullets.

83
00:41:48,825 --> 00:41:50,793
Shoot!

84
00:41:58,585 --> 00:42:00,985
I bleed little now.

85
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:03,885
I offer no resistance to the bullets.

86
00:42:03,998 --> 00:42:07,798
I let them pass
through the empty spots of my flesh.

87
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:15,024
Do you still want to fight me?

88
00:42:16,044 --> 00:42:17,170
Yes.

89
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:21,263
I don't fear killing you
because there is no death.

90
00:42:21,391 --> 00:42:24,053
I'll let you fire first.

91
00:42:33,311 --> 00:42:36,337
- He's greater than I am.
- You'll win.

92
00:42:36,456 --> 00:42:39,653
Even though I'd win, I'd lose.

93
00:42:40,827 --> 00:42:44,160
I want a winner. Find out how.

94
00:42:44,272 --> 00:42:47,435
Don't fight honestly.

95
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:51,384
Make up something. Cheat him.
There's always a way to win.

96
00:42:51,471 --> 00:42:53,234
Find a way.

97
00:46:48,975 --> 00:46:52,775
I told you so. I said you could win.
I am proud of you.

98
00:46:52,862 --> 00:46:54,989
You have three more masters left.

99
00:47:17,178 --> 00:47:19,146
I know where the second one lives.

100
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:22,688
If you let me come,
I could take you there.

101
00:49:32,421 --> 00:49:33,718
It's here.

102
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:34,829
Wait.

103
00:50:02,393 --> 00:50:06,124
We were waiting for you.
This is what the cards foretell.

104
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:08,755
You are falling. You keep falling.

105
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:12,402
The deeper you fall,
the higher you'll get.

106
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:18,789
Coward, murderer!
The Lord's will is unexplainable.

107
00:50:18,885 --> 00:50:21,854
My son and I must respect you.

108
00:50:23,306 --> 00:50:25,501
You may fight him.

109
00:50:28,945 --> 00:50:30,936
Come closer.

110
00:51:01,586 --> 00:51:04,578
The duel begins this moment.

111
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:09,856
You may shoot when you desire.

112
00:52:07,477 --> 00:52:09,638
Dead.

113
00:52:11,389 --> 00:52:13,823
Technically,

114
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:16,009
you're dead.

115
00:52:16,119 --> 00:52:19,486
I now wish to speak to the dead one.

116
00:52:20,648 --> 00:52:22,377
Follow me.

117
00:52:25,303 --> 00:52:28,739
I began making copper objects.

118
00:52:28,831 --> 00:52:31,265
And thus strengthened my fingers.

119
00:52:35,088 --> 00:52:39,184
I now make delicate things.

120
00:52:39,317 --> 00:52:42,912
I am so strong now that I can play

121
00:52:43,012 --> 00:52:46,914
with this object, without breaking it.

122
00:53:05,084 --> 00:53:07,075
Shoot!

123
00:53:46,108 --> 00:53:49,100
A very delicate shot.

124
00:53:54,492 --> 00:53:57,290
It destroys the precise.

125
00:54:17,965 --> 00:54:22,698
You shoot to find yourself,
I do it in order to vanish.

126
00:54:25,999 --> 00:54:28,900
Perfection is to get lost.

127
00:54:30,003 --> 00:54:32,836
In order to get lost, you have to love.

128
00:54:32,947 --> 00:54:38,476
You don't love. You destroy,
you kill, and no one loves you.

129
00:54:39,621 --> 00:54:42,920
For when you think you are giving,

130
00:54:43,016 --> 00:54:46,508
you are really taking away.

131
00:55:01,643 --> 00:55:04,077
I have given myself to her.

132
00:55:04,187 --> 00:55:06,917
I gave her all.

133
00:55:07,023 --> 00:55:10,015
She's within me.

134
00:55:10,126 --> 00:55:13,618
Her immense love fills me.

135
00:55:23,473 --> 00:55:25,703
What I do and say,

136
00:55:25,809 --> 00:55:29,870
is dictated and sanctified by her.

137
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:34,508
I hate anything that is mine,

138
00:55:34,592 --> 00:55:39,188
for it turns me away
from her divine presence.

139
00:55:50,091 --> 00:55:52,457
Two are better than one.

140
00:55:52,569 --> 00:55:57,063
For if one fell,
the second would help him.

141
00:55:57,182 --> 00:56:02,484
But pity the lonely one,
with no one to help him.

142
00:56:12,797 --> 00:56:17,166
When I did it,
I didn't think it would be any good.

143
00:56:18,645 --> 00:56:22,274
I only tried to do it the best I could.

144
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:49,017
Take your gun again.

145
00:56:49,117 --> 00:56:52,348
My son wishes
to give you one last chance.

146
00:57:50,303 --> 00:57:52,237
PROPHETS

147
00:57:52,322 --> 00:57:57,316
Don't get near him.
Why do you follow us? Get lost!

148
01:00:23,681 --> 01:00:25,774
There was no need to draw your gun.

149
01:00:25,875 --> 01:00:27,900
I do not distrust you.

150
01:00:40,524 --> 01:00:42,515
You have a flute.

151
01:00:42,642 --> 01:00:45,008
We'll know each other by music.

152
01:01:01,194 --> 01:01:03,754
You loath yourself.

153
01:01:03,863 --> 01:01:05,854
You don't wish
to play tricks anymore.

154
01:01:06,941 --> 01:01:09,705
You now want to respect the law.

155
01:01:09,844 --> 01:01:12,711
Some give flowers,

156
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:14,771
others give valuable things.

157
01:01:14,891 --> 01:01:17,860
You bring me your own life.

158
01:01:17,961 --> 01:01:20,054
You don't fear death anymore.

159
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:23,172
That's why you are a dangerous foe.

160
01:01:42,235 --> 01:01:45,898
When you were seven yards
from the corral,

161
01:01:45,988 --> 01:01:49,048
my rabbits began to die.

162
01:01:49,159 --> 01:01:51,753
Almost all of them are dead.

163
01:01:52,771 --> 01:01:55,672
Now that you are here,
not one of them will live.

164
01:02:14,793 --> 01:02:16,818
I made it myself!

165
01:02:16,936 --> 01:02:18,961
See its fineness!

166
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:28,352
I'll take just one shot.

167
01:02:28,464 --> 01:02:31,058
That's all I need.

168
01:02:31,159 --> 01:02:35,061
One bullet, always deadly.

169
01:02:35,171 --> 01:02:37,071
Shoot.

170
01:02:51,546 --> 01:02:54,208
Can you tell which one you shot?

171
01:02:55,350 --> 01:02:58,410
This one is yours.
It's been hit in the head.

172
01:02:58,528 --> 01:03:01,361
This one is mine.
It's been hit in the heart.

173
01:03:04,367 --> 01:03:07,894
The heart, and the head.

174
01:03:10,565 --> 01:03:12,556
Swap them.

175
01:03:15,203 --> 01:03:17,194
It's time.

176
01:04:31,588 --> 01:04:34,022
Too much perfection is a mistake.

177
01:05:05,179 --> 01:05:07,113
You won!

178
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:11,040
Don't leave me! You will be the best.

179
01:05:11,136 --> 01:05:14,037
I'll help you. There's only one left.

180
01:06:43,587 --> 01:06:47,546
You want to fight me?
How will you do it?

181
01:06:47,690 --> 01:06:49,783
I haven't got a gun anymore.

182
01:07:04,282 --> 01:07:08,616
I traded the gun for a butterfly net.

183
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:17,536
You'll have to fight with your fists.

184
01:07:17,629 --> 01:07:21,929
Strike! Strike! Strike!

185
01:08:01,589 --> 01:08:05,958
You see, my net
is mightier than your bullets.

186
01:08:09,397 --> 01:08:15,267
If you shoot again,
it will go back into your heart.

187
01:08:38,628 --> 01:08:41,324
How could you win?

188
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:45,867
For I don't fight, I have nothing.

189
01:08:45,968 --> 01:08:50,462
Even though you cheated,
you couldn't have taken anything.

190
01:08:50,548 --> 01:08:54,109
Yes, I could have taken your life.

191
01:08:54,217 --> 01:08:56,981
Life! I don't care about that.

192
01:08:57,114 --> 01:08:59,605
I'll show you.

193
01:09:04,788 --> 01:09:06,779
You lost.

194
01:11:21,842 --> 01:11:26,939
You won! You are the best.

195
01:11:58,468 --> 01:12:04,065
I have been spilt like water,
and my bones have been dislocated.

196
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:09,009
My heart has turned
to wax and melts within me.

197
01:12:09,088 --> 01:12:12,216
And my tongue sticks to my jaw.

198
01:12:12,349 --> 01:12:15,182
I am laid low in the dust of death.

199
01:12:16,679 --> 01:12:23,243
My God,
why hast thou forsaken me?

200
01:12:23,353 --> 01:12:29,451
Why are You so far from saving me,
from heeding my groans?

201
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:33,919
Oh, my God, I cry in the daytime,
but thou dost not answer.

202
01:12:34,029 --> 01:12:37,590
In the night I cry, but I get no respite.

203
01:14:32,865 --> 01:14:34,856
It's either him or me?

204
01:16:40,242 --> 01:16:44,042
Make thy paths known from me.
Oh, Lord, teach me thy ways.

205
01:16:44,139 --> 01:16:47,233
Lead me in thy truth and teach me.

206
01:16:47,333 --> 01:16:49,893
Thou art God, my savior.

207
01:16:50,003 --> 01:16:53,803
I have waited all day long
for thee.

208
01:16:53,923 --> 01:16:56,915
You'll show the sinners the way.

209
01:16:57,010 --> 01:17:00,741
You'll lead us
through final judgment.

210
01:17:02,524 --> 01:17:04,287
PSALMS

211
01:19:04,237 --> 01:19:06,569
I am not a God.

212
01:19:07,764 --> 01:19:10,631
I am a man.

213
01:19:10,744 --> 01:19:13,372
How long have I been here?

214
01:19:14,430 --> 01:19:17,365
When you got here,
I hadn't yet been born.

215
01:19:17,467 --> 01:19:19,594
I've looked after you
since I was a child.

216
01:19:19,684 --> 01:19:23,176
The old woman says
that you'll free us. Come!

217
01:20:03,630 --> 01:20:07,691
We've been prisoners
here for many years.

218
01:20:07,799 --> 01:20:10,199
That hole is the only way out.

219
01:20:10,294 --> 01:20:14,025
You have to climb
for a few days to get to it.

220
01:20:14,139 --> 01:20:18,098
Outside, down the mountain,
there's a town.

221
01:20:18,203 --> 01:20:20,034
They won't help us to get out.

222
01:20:20,145 --> 01:20:23,205
We are deformed,
due to the continuous incest.

223
01:20:23,308 --> 01:20:25,333
We are repulsive to them.

224
01:20:39,549 --> 01:20:42,450
It must be hard to bring me here.

225
01:20:43,436 --> 01:20:44,926
Why did you do it?

226
01:20:45,053 --> 01:20:47,954
The old lady knows.

227
01:20:48,057 --> 01:20:50,582
She sent for you.

228
01:20:50,693 --> 01:20:52,627
She wants to see you now.

229
01:22:17,839 --> 01:22:22,572
This is not me! This is not my face.

230
01:23:22,077 --> 01:23:27,037
I'll get money and I'll dig a tunnel.

231
01:23:27,167 --> 01:23:31,035
The tunnel will join
the town with this cave.

232
01:23:31,103 --> 01:23:35,164
When I finish it, you'll be free at last.

233
01:23:35,283 --> 01:23:37,683
You'll get out of here!

234
01:24:19,711 --> 01:24:22,908
So, that's the great town!

235
01:28:44,207 --> 01:28:47,108
We'll have to beg.

236
01:31:09,954 --> 01:31:12,047
Fix the curls.

237
01:31:31,091 --> 01:31:33,457
Fix my nails!

238
01:31:47,191 --> 01:31:49,125
Cream!

239
01:32:01,396 --> 01:32:03,523
A fan!

240
01:32:36,707 --> 01:32:42,304
This degenerate
is looking at my legs!

241
01:32:50,563 --> 01:32:54,090
Help, he's embracing me!

242
01:33:01,740 --> 01:33:04,732
You are witnesses!
He's kissed me by force!

243
01:33:08,471 --> 01:33:12,771
Filthy slave! How dare you!

244
01:33:12,861 --> 01:33:16,297
Help, he's raping me!

245
01:33:33,597 --> 01:33:38,591
Stop him! Murderer!

246
01:33:38,687 --> 01:33:41,451
Stop him! Don't let him get away!

247
01:33:41,547 --> 01:33:44,778
Rapist! He's a degenerate!

248
01:33:52,142 --> 01:33:56,806
Murderer, murderer!

249
01:34:29,019 --> 01:34:34,719
Do you think it's worth it
for my people to come here?

250
01:34:39,446 --> 01:34:41,539
This is worse.

251
01:34:45,570 --> 01:34:47,561
I'll keep on digging.

252
01:35:07,117 --> 01:35:09,608
How many meters have we dug?

253
01:35:11,812 --> 01:35:13,803
I dig!

254
01:36:15,376 --> 01:36:17,970
We've lost our audience!

255
01:36:21,189 --> 01:36:24,955
Hey, you monsters! Come here!

256
01:36:32,618 --> 01:36:34,643
We'll pay you a good fee.

257
01:38:37,017 --> 01:38:39,008
Both are dead.

258
01:38:39,970 --> 01:38:42,200
- Who died first?
- This one.

259
01:38:42,307 --> 01:38:44,298
This one is the champion.

260
01:39:43,568 --> 01:39:49,973
You protect us, oh Lord!
You protect us, oh Lord!

261
01:40:39,039 --> 01:40:44,238
God loves us and protects us!

262
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:48,051
If we have faith,
nothing will happen to us.

263
01:40:48,156 --> 01:40:51,853
We must play with our Lord.

264
01:40:51,968 --> 01:40:55,369
Death is our bet.

265
01:40:55,471 --> 01:40:58,167
And let the one
who doesn't have faith, die.

266
01:41:08,260 --> 01:41:11,957
A miracle!

267
01:41:41,519 --> 01:41:44,147
A miracle!

268
01:42:05,559 --> 01:42:07,754
A miracle!

269
01:42:20,241 --> 01:42:22,573
Fear not, it's a blank.

270
01:42:59,896 --> 01:43:02,626
The weapon. It's a miracle!

271
01:43:14,196 --> 01:43:16,494
A miracle!

272
01:43:20,443 --> 01:43:22,308
APOCALYPSE

273
01:43:22,418 --> 01:43:24,682
No one will come anymore.

274
01:43:24,790 --> 01:43:26,951
The circus is over.

275
01:43:27,065 --> 01:43:28,862
I'll go also.

276
01:45:10,311 --> 01:45:12,302
Come in, come in!

277
01:45:16,676 --> 01:45:21,545
As always,
the Decent Women League,

278
01:45:21,654 --> 01:45:26,057
after it's monthly inspection,
greets their husbands.

279
01:45:26,151 --> 01:45:28,949
Everything in here is decent.

280
01:45:35,778 --> 01:45:38,941
Do you want to make some money?
Come, come!

281
01:45:44,178 --> 01:45:46,009
Go down!

282
01:45:47,180 --> 01:45:49,478
Come in!

283
01:46:12,983 --> 01:46:15,679
Do your kissing stunt.

284
01:46:30,716 --> 01:46:33,617
We now want to see the rest.

285
01:46:33,719 --> 01:46:37,120
Undress! The wedding night!

286
01:47:15,479 --> 01:47:18,710
I love you. They do not exist.

287
01:47:18,814 --> 01:47:21,009
There's nobody, but you.

288
01:47:21,126 --> 01:47:24,653
We're alone. Take me, please.

289
01:48:05,510 --> 01:48:08,274
We'll be able to buy dynamite

290
01:48:08,364 --> 01:48:10,855
to keep digging the tunnel.

291
01:48:16,707 --> 01:48:20,473
Hey, why are you hiding?

292
01:48:32,396 --> 01:48:33,988
I am ashamed.

293
01:48:34,099 --> 01:48:36,533
You must be disgusted by me.

294
01:48:36,626 --> 01:48:38,617
You are going to leave me.

295
01:48:43,407 --> 01:48:45,432
No, come with me.

296
01:49:09,324 --> 01:49:11,622
Tell him to marry us.

297
01:49:19,001 --> 01:49:20,662
Go!

298
01:49:23,813 --> 01:49:26,805
We are going to get married, Father.

299
01:50:06,965 --> 01:50:11,698
You can't kill him.
He's doing great things.

300
01:50:24,843 --> 01:50:28,836
He promised he'd dig the tunnel,
so they would be free.

301
01:50:42,978 --> 01:50:47,642
I'll wait until you finish the job.
Then I will kill you.

302
01:50:47,732 --> 01:50:51,964
But I'll be watching you,
so you don't escape.

303
01:52:16,779 --> 01:52:21,045
We'll never finish it.
It takes too much time.

304
01:52:23,560 --> 01:52:26,654
If you want us to go faster,

305
01:52:26,764 --> 01:52:28,755
help us to dig.

306
01:52:31,403 --> 01:52:34,133
And if you want to finish sooner,

307
01:52:37,074 --> 01:52:39,133
help us to beg.

308
01:54:07,580 --> 01:54:09,241
It's hard rock.

309
01:54:09,367 --> 01:54:12,700
We've tried it a thousand times
and we can't do it.

310
01:54:18,842 --> 01:54:20,833
Just a thousand times?

311
01:54:36,385 --> 01:54:39,047
Your pain must be unbearable.

312
01:54:45,428 --> 01:54:50,263
This body feels the pain, not me.

313
01:55:05,422 --> 01:55:08,880
You'll never do it. Stop it!

314
01:55:24,775 --> 01:55:28,438
We've made it! We've made it!

315
01:55:28,522 --> 01:55:31,548
Do not tell them yet.
They are still unprepared.

316
01:56:01,812 --> 01:56:04,337
I cannot kill my master.

317
02:04:25,616 --> 02:04:27,607
