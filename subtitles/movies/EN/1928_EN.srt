0
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,955
Come on, come on!

1
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,949
Not too fast!

2
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,510
Careful, the stairs are slippery.

3
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,399
Are you Batman or Superman?

4
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,073
- Are you okay?
- Yeah!

5
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,190
Wait!

6
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,715
You can start searching.

7
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,389
Find anything, Max?

8
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,953
Nothing.

9
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,595
I think I found it!

10
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,599
Max is getting warm!

11
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,595
- The dogs ran away!
- Call them!

12
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,029
Bijou! Pretzel!

13
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,393
Let's open the envelope.

14
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,039
You didn't catch me!

15
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,393
So... what's written inside?

16
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,796
- Nothing. It's weird.
- Invisible ink!

17
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,234
Daisy got it right.

18
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,719
Pierre, give me your lighter.

19
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,516
They figured it out.

20
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,592
Look, it's the island.

21
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,028
They find it.

22
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,753
There's the bridge.
I know where it is!

23
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,911
Come on, let's find the treasure.

24
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,156
See you later.

25
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,477
See you, can we go there?

26
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,275
Where were you?

27
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,433
I rang the bell 10 minutes ago!

28
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,436
We didn't hear.

29
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,909
- You were playing by the pond.
- No.

30
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,190
We told you
it's dangerous for the kids!

31
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,960
Don't worry.

32
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,599
You're totally irresponsible!

33
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,960
- Which wrapping paper?
- This one.

34
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,949
I found this.

35
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,076
Thanks. Do you have any scotch tape?

36
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,116
Yes.

37
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,839
I hate champagne.

38
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,393
Just toast with us.

39
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,199
A drop then.

40
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,435
That's enough, thanks.

41
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,956
It's your birthday.

42
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,792
At my age, birthdays don't count.

43
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,075
A rare occasion to come together.

44
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,275
A good chance.

45
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,078
It's true,
never get to see you all.

46
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,951
Especially Adrienne.

47
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,038
Me? New York isn't next door

48
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,713
and my job ties me down.

49
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,956
Jeramie lives further away than you

50
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,389
but they come every summer.

51
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,476
We follow you in the press.

52
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,958
A friend of mine sent me
an article from Japan.

53
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,794
It was incomprehensible!

54
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,191
I'm working for Takashimaya
department stores,

55
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,471
designing a line of accessories,
both simple and classical.

56
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,631
It's tough and I'm behind.

57
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,068
To you, on your...

58
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,958
No. Stop it.

59
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,075
We can say it!

60
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,832
On your 75th birthday!

61
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:27,956
Say whatever you want.

62
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,155
Cheers.

63
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,918
The present!

64
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,717
This is from the whole family.

65
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,798
It's nice,
but it wasn't worth the trouble.

66
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,234
Open it before complaining.

67
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,709
What is it?

68
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,910
Look. It's a phone.

69
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,959
There are three phones.

70
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,792
A base and two handsets.

71
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,110
But I don't need three phones.

72
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,029
For your room, for downstairs
and for the studio

73
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,954
or the yard.
So you don't have to run around.

74
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,277
I don't mind running around.
And my phone works fine.

75
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,114
It's too complicated.

76
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,960
I chose a really easy one,

77
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,598
with big buttons.

78
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,518
The manual's multilingual.

79
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,709
No need to memorize it.

80
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,275
Well, thank you...

81
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,272
It's very nice.

82
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,393
You'll have to explain it to me.

83
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,957
- And set it up before you leave.
- Don't worry.

84
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,590
We thought
of something practical too.

85
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,957
Of course it's not very original...

86
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,712
The mohair blanket.
The present for old people!

87
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,194
Perfect for long winter nights
in front of the fire.

88
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,276
And Saturday night TV.

89
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,918
I was just kidding.

90
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,952
It's very nice.
It's pretty and above all, useful.

91
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,635
Thanks again.
Let's sit down to lunch.

92
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,153
Wait. I'll take it.

93
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,430
Look how it suits me.

94
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,158
- What do you think?
- Gorgeous!

95
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,433
Not a real present.

96
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,591
Then I think I know.

97
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,912
Not a surprise either.

98
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,949
The American edition?

99
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,234
They just finished it.
Hot off the press.

100
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,115
Nice, isn't it?

101
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,918
I'm glad they
used the painting we chose.

102
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,951
The lay-out is beautiful.

103
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,272
You can make out the studio.

104
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,710
I expected it next month.

105
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,960
They sent the proofs, but just the text.

106
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,599
Did they hope you'd correct the English?

107
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,909
I couldn't have.

108
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,112
I wanted to correct some references
from the French edition.

109
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,918
The French edition is excellent.

110
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,753
Not the index!

111
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,315
You nagged them to the last minute.

112
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,636
You can't be fussy enough.

113
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,949
Let me see.

114
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,155
Salad?

115
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,391
A little.

116
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,955
Your great-uncle
would have been happy.

117
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,073
You always said
he didn't care about honors.

118
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,274
A nice book,
30 years after his death, in America.

119
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,833
It shows that posterity cares.

120
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,989
Thanks to you.

121
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,198
It's true.
It's the fruit of your work.

122
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,435
You can be proud.

123
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,914
What matters now
is the retrospective.

124
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,757
Have they set the dates?

125
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,470
Yes... July in San Francisco,

126
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,713
November in Chicago,

127
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,956
January in Vienna.

128
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,072
Paris hasn't been decided yet.

129
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,832
Early next year.

130
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,631
Are you going?

131
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,712
San Francisco for sure,
for the opening.

132
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,717
- We'll try to come.
- Us too.

133
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,114
I hope so!

134
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:55,911
We'll be there.

135
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,915
The children too?

136
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,270
Your wine-drinking grandkids?
Will they be in San Francisco?

137
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,951
Look at this picture.
It wasn't in the French edition.

138
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,709
It's here.
It was taken exactly where we are.

139
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,755
Look! He's in the middle.

140
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,753
How funny! What year is it?

141
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,834
Late 60s, I'd say.

142
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,915
Fifties.

143
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,594
Sixties.

144
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,751
Exactly the same table.

145
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,035
- In the same place.
- Let me see.

146
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,273
It's true.

147
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,233
Why change its place?
It's perfect right here.

148
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,276
Who's he?

149
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,948
Let me think...

150
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,590
A friend of Paul's,
a cybernetic sculptor.

151
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,478
He was a big deal.

152
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,111
He's fallen into oblivion.
That's his wife.

153
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,472
Eloise, the snifters!

154
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,039
I moved them.

155
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,428
They were always here!

156
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,398
It wasn't very practical.
I'll get them.

157
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,431
Don't worry.
Let me wipe them off.

158
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,388
- They're fine.
- It'll take a second.

159
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,919
It'll be fine. Sylvie, Pierre!

160
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,959
Take it easy.
This is Grandma's house.

161
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,794
Come see the two Corots
I told you about.

162
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,631
Who's Corot?

163
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,074
A 19th century painter.

164
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,959
He himself gave them
to our ancestor.

165
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,075
What for?

166
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,515
No idea. He was a doctor.

167
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,280
He must have done him a favor.
There's that one too.

168
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,960
One day they'll be yours
and your cousins'.

169
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,235
You'll pass them on
to your kids.

170
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,475
Like them?

171
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,510
They're okay
but not what I like most.

172
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,958
Yeah, it's another era.

173
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,952
What's the name again?

174
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,591
"Puma". Puma sneakers.

175
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,030
Why do they need
to be made in China?

176
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,469
It costs less.

177
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,598
We have five factories there.

178
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,955
I'm in charge of
technical supervision.

179
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,395
I spend my life in airports.
Air China isn't that reliable,

180
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,115
but it's great. The future.

181
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,272
The future is making cheap sneakers

182
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,590
by employing cheap labor?

183
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,711
It's nothing new
and nothing to be proud of. Sorry.

184
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,310
Think whatever you want.
World growth depends on it.

185
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,392
You benefit from it too.

186
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,234
Converse.

187
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,109
Same thing.
And you call those shoes?

188
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,275
Ask Fredaric.
He's the family economist.

189
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,470
So?

190
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,960
America benefits the most.

191
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,793
Angela,
don't you get bored in Shanghai?

192
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,952
With three kids, time flies by.

193
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,596
I help out
with the Christian community.

194
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,714
They need volunteers.
So much poverty. I do what I can.

195
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,476
Can I help?

196
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,472
I'm not that bad off yet.

197
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,076
Just take the phone and the book.

198
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,958
I'll put them in the office.

199
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,519
Get me an ice cube too.

200
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,436
Sure thing!

201
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,278
Be good and don't forget.

202
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,912
I love having you,
but these reunions exhaust me.

203
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,188
You go out of your way.

204
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,511
Not at all. Eloise does everything.

205
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,836
I'm old.
That's what it boils down to.

206
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,392
You're fine.

207
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:17,958
I'm not saying the contrary.
It's just that at seventy-five,

208
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,035
I have to think of what comes next.

209
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,716
Meaning?

210
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,269
What will happen after me.

211
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,475
We still have time.

212
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,749
No... Since you're the eldest
and the only one in France,

213
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,035
you'll manage the estate.

214
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,599
Change the subject.

215
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,034
We have to talk about this.

216
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,475
You're never around, always busy.
You're here now.

217
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:44,078
I have some things to tell you.

218
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,959
First, this is a desk
by Louis Majorelle.

219
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,270
The chair too, but you know that.

220
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,596
You've told me 1000 times.

221
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,952
It's one of a kind.
The Musae d'Orsay wants it.

222
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,516
Same for the armoire
by Josef Hoffman.

223
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,268
In any case,

224
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,070
there are 3 of you.
It'll be divided by three.

225
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,033
We won't touch a thing.

226
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,269
Don't tell me.

227
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,516
Your collection will stay intact.

228
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,157
I've taken care
of preserving Paul's memory.

229
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,632
Because they're my memories,
it's my life.

230
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,469
My youth. I've done what I can.

231
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,473
After me, it's another story.

232
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,197
Ours.

233
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,913
No. You have your life.

234
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,712
No need to become
keepers of his tomb.

235
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,035
We'll do it for you.

236
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,152
I'll be gone. I don't care!

237
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,590
It's all in here.

238
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,718
This is the list
of the most important pieces.

239
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,958
Their certificates of origin,
their approximate values.

240
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,636
They're old appraisals.
You'll have them redone.

241
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,839
And here are the notebooks
of Paul Berthier.

242
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:05,030
Hardly anyone knows about them.
Notes, lots of notes...

243
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,718
I lent them out once,
for an exhibition in Oxford.

244
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,316
They all go together.

245
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,076
Try not to separate them.

246
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,390
It's what Paul requested in his will.

247
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,716
Come see something
in the living room.

248
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,073
I forgot the decorative panels
by Odilon Redon.

249
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,392
This one and the one in the studio.
But be careful.

250
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,397
You can't tell but they've been
eaten away by the humidity.

251
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,034
It has to be restored.

252
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,310
You'll take care of it.

253
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,952
This display case
is also by Majorelle.

254
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,952
It's not at all my cup of tea,

255
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,315
but it's worth something.

256
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,152
I don't care what's worth what.

257
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,635
I'm not an expert or a dealer.

258
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,313
It will all be yours.

259
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,595
But not to sell!

260
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,794
Yes, to sell!

261
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,030
They're museum pieces.

262
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,519
They're not meant to rot
in a house closed most of the year.

263
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,789
When you're gone
the kids will be grown.

264
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,393
They love this house.
We'll come often!

265
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,795
It's their childhoods they love.
But when they're adults,

266
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,030
they'll have better to do than deal

267
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:48,911
with bric-a-brac from another era.

268
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,790
In here are the pieces
of the Degas plaster.

269
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,599
The one you boys broke
when you were kids.

270
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,398
That was a major drama.

271
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,636
It is salvageable?

272
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,230
No, I don't think so.
It's sad but that's life.

273
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,715
This is the last sketch
your great-uncle did.

274
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,434
A view of the garden
from this window.

275
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,039
His chair was there.
At the end he wouldn't move.

276
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,960
I remember. He could hardly speak.

277
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,435
That thing in his throat stank.

278
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,955
Fortunately Eloise took care of him.

279
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,028
He used to scare me.

280
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,279
This one...
I want it to stay in the family,

281
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,475
with you.

282
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,119
In any case,
you're the only one concerned.

283
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,029
Jeramie has his business in China.

284
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,713
As for Adrienne...

285
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,273
she's always on the move.
She never has time for anything.

286
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,632
And you?

287
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,915
How's your work going?

288
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,195
I published a book.
You won't care.

289
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:28,960
Really?

290
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,439
Based on my university class.

291
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,271
University?

292
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,954
I've been teaching for two years.

293
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,636
You told me. It rings a bell.

294
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,075
It's created quite a stir.

295
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,719
Paul Vernon got involved.

296
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,798
Paul Vernon?
The one on the radio?

297
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,710
That's him.

298
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,317
He's eloquent, smart
and has a very good radio voice.

299
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,075
He said my book is full
of unfounded hypotheses.

300
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,313
I'll tell you.

301
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,510
You never read the last one.

302
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,756
It's by my bed. I'll read it.

303
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,837
It'll just bore you.

304
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,956
Wait, I forgot.
That vase by Antonin Daum.

305
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,228
We had the pair. One disappeared.

306
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,913
You've told me several times.

307
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,150
I'm sure Eloise broke it
but she won't admit it.

308
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,953
Even by itself
it's worth quite a lot.

309
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,475
My mother annoyed me.

310
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,948
Why?

311
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,278
She just pretends
that she cares what I do.

312
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,595
I don't think economy is her thing.

313
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,955
Not to hurt you,
but it's not mine either.

314
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,475
Come on, dogs!

315
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,912
She pushed me into it.

316
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,837
I thought your father did.

317
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,235
My father,
God rest his soul, and her.

318
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,510
He was worried about your future.

319
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,948
It's what I wanted.

320
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:51,956
Why did she want to see you?

321
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,949
To talk about her death.

322
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,915
In those terms?

323
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,958
No, about the collections,
my uncle's sketches,

324
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,112
the house afterwards...

325
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,913
She talked about her death.

326
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,393
Like I said.

327
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,720
I think she looks great. Glowing.

328
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,068
But she's 75.

329
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,949
So? She can still live 10, 15 years.
Women live long.

330
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,950
What would happen
if she died tomorrow?

331
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,631
You mean for the house?

332
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,596
Yes.

333
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,790
Nothing. We'd leave it as it is.

334
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,951
Are you sure?
Fredaric and Adrienne live overseas.

335
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,912
Why would they keep

336
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,960
They're attached to it.

337
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,110
I hope so. I'm not so sure.

338
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,234
They come less and less.

339
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,960
If she's not here...

340
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,279
What will that change?

341
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,958
She knows the question will arise.

342
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,309
She's more lucid than you.

343
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,276
Go...

344
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,829
Stop it.

345
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,958
So she mentioned the Daum vase.

346
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,912
As usual. It's an obsession.

347
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,951
When she's not well,
she rehashes that.

348
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,638
She's convinced that I broke it.

349
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,915
It's true that it disappeared
years ago.

350
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,838
I don't care. I found it ugly.

351
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,394
I prefer this one.

352
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,109
You think she's not well?

353
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,429
She's depressed.

354
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,709
She can spend a whole day
without speaking.

355
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,948
She has memory lapses.
She can forget what she just said.

356
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,793
She brought up the inheritance.

357
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,155
It's her only concern.

358
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,957
She wants you to tend
to Paul Berthier's oeuvre.

359
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,960
She says the opposite,
not to burden me.

360
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,109
Do you remember him?

361
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,030
Hardly at all.

362
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,914
He died in '72. How old were you?

363
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,713
I was 10.
I have a few vague memories.

364
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,275
Each visit with him was ceremonious.

365
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,958
He was a wonderful man.

366
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,918
The house was alive then.

367
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,836
It still is.

368
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,916
When you're all here.
Twice a year.

369
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,598
Can I have some paper towel?

370
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,278
Max spilled yogurt on the couch.

371
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,718
- OK, wait a second.
- Thanks.

372
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,597
Give me a hand.
Take out the cake.

373
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,512
If Mom weren't here,
would you still stay?

374
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,754
Tend to the house?

375
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,478
If you keep it.

376
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,592
We will, for the children.

377
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,598
I'd totally forgotten about this.

378
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,277
What is it? Christofle?

379
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,230
Is was Paul's.
It came from his family.

380
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,473
It's like the imprint of a leaf.
It's stunning.

381
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,111
I'd forgotten but...
I dreamt about it one night.

382
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,511
I hid it under my sweater.

383
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,919
I took it away
and ended up in a forest.

384
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,278
It was raining and it turned back
into a plant,

385
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,960
like a lily pad. With roots.

386
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,755
I panicked.
Fortunately I woke up.

387
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,636
The tea set I took it out for you.

388
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,590
It's too small for a large family.

389
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,632
I can't remember whether
it's Georg Jensen or Michelsen.

390
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,755
Let me see.

391
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,148
In any case it's Danish.

392
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,953
It's Georg Jensen.

393
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,957
They did this kind of work,
hammered silver.

394
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,593
I saw you took this out too.

395
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,438
It's less delicate.

396
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,952
You can see the difference.

397
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,190
It inspired my final project
at art school.

398
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,072
I designed
exactly the same thing, or almost,

399
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,596
with flowers on top.

400
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,479
I did well,
but it was pure plagiarism.

401
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,152
I already told you.

402
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,198
The tray and the tea set
will be yours.

403
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,279
That's not what I meant.

404
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,630
They're not objects
that correspond to your lifestyle.

405
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,713
What lifestyle?

406
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,631
You prefer contemporary,
like what you design.

407
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,429
If a piece works, it works.

408
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,397
You're mistaken. Modern or antique,

409
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,477
beauty is beauty. You notice it.

410
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,312
In general you prefer objects

411
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,392
not weighed down by the past.

412
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,915
True.

413
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,439
And I can't see you
using a silver tea service.

414
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,079
True too.

415
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,715
Paul bought this when he
was showing in Copenhagen

416
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,275
in the early sixties.
I went with him.

417
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,473
It didn't go well.

418
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,392
He didn't sell a thing.
The press was bad.

419
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,953
A real disaster.

420
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,950
Sylvie! Pierre!

421
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,792
I keep calling you!

422
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,951
Enough, we're leaving now.

423
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,236
- Go on, kiss your grandmother.
- Come on, let's hurry.

424
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,960
Put this in the back seat.
It's fragile.

425
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,799
Get in the car.

426
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,036
Hurry or we'll hit traffic.

427
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,189
It's already late.

428
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,952
We still have to pack
and close up the apartment.

429
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,070
The plane's at 1 p.m.

430
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,151
You said you'd come.

431
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,313
We have a guest room.

432
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,392
Not in the summer.
It must be unbearably hot.

433
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,268
And I'm too old
for such a long trip.

434
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,512
You're coming to San Francisco
for the show.

435
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,393
You know how nervous
I've been about that!

436
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,388
No, it'll be wonderful.
I know the museum. It's great!

437
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,954
I know, I know... Will you come?

438
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,271
Of course I will.
We'll all be there with you.

439
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,428
See you in September!

440
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,116
Bye.

441
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,193
So long, kids!

442
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,193
Thanks take me by.

443
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,912
Take easy...

444
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,189
Drop me at Place Clichy.

445
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,959
Wherever you want!

446
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,954
Don't forgot apples.

447
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,953
Shall I turn on the light?

448
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,436
Thank you, no.
I'm fine like this.

449
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,391
The kids forgot
the basket of cherries.

450
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,597
Their parents were distracted.

451
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,950
Thinking about their trip back.

452
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,110
Fredaric thought you were gloomy.

453
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,632
Yes. I spoke to him about my death.

454
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,313
It seems normal to.

455
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,839
They have lives of their own.
Heir concerns aren't mine.

456
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,914
A lot of things
will be leaving with me.

457
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,754
Memories,

458
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,839
secrets,

459
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,839
stories that interest
no one anymore.

460
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:11,960
But... there's the residue.

461
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,599
There are objects.

462
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,398
I don't want it to weigh on them.

463
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,078
It's what Paul would have wanted.

464
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,951
Shall I prepare something
for dinner?

465
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,916
No, thank you. I'm tired.

466
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,153
I'll go to bed early.

467
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,395
There's a traffic jam
and I cannot find the parking lot.

468
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,629
They have visitor's parking lot.

469
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,313
Everyone arrived but you.

470
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,948
No problem.

471
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,269
So he hates it?

472
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,949
Not at all. He invited you, right?

473
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,269
Here we are!

474
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,716
Hello, Amalie. Fredaric!

475
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,833
Do you know Paul Vernon?

476
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,029
Shut off your cell.

477
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,234
Fredaric Marly,
to resume your argument

478
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,960
and to push it to its limits:

479
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,076
Economy is a huge sham,

480
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,590
a superstition
like a primitive fetish-object.

481
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,156
And economists are the high priests
of a modern religion

482
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,840
as hollow as any other.

483
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,949
That's about it.

484
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,277
Still, if we read
your book carefully,

485
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,310
it seems that according to
your infinite relativism,

486
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,029
you undermine
your own affirmations.

487
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,795
No, I say that because economy
is the opposite of a science,

488
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,032
any attempt to control it,
no matter how well-intentioned,

489
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,118
is often capable
of totally backfiring.

490
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,316
That's my point.

491
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,791
But you're an economist.

492
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,918
So you consider your own work vain.

493
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,949
I was awful.

494
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,515
Not at all.
I thought you did a great job.

495
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,195
It's technical. Bores people stiff.

496
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,919
It's fascinating!

497
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,236
I disagree.
People tune out after a minute.

498
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,193
Writing this book
has just brought me trouble.

499
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,914
You're wrong. It's well-liked.

500
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,229
No, I'm just lucid.

501
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,919
Stores all over
want you for book-signings.

502
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,199
I'll call you.
Tell me for the book signings.

503
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,275
Okay. No problem.

504
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,193
Bye.

505
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,275
Bye.

506
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,757
My condolences.

507
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,475
Thank you. I appreciate
your having come so quickly.

508
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,073
It's my job.

509
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,276
Your mother
was very much liked in our village.

510
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,709
I know.

511
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,958
She called me last week
about the hunters in the forest.

512
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,953
The wild boars
keep breaking the fence.

513
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,039
I took care of it.
With an electric fence.

514
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,713
We'll do the same.

515
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,279
I prepared the papers.

516
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,835
You have to fill in
the number of the plot.

517
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:02,715
Come on...
I took out a map of the cemetery.

518
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,632
It's small. There's not much space.

519
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,115
We'll expand next year.

520
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:20,600
This area is free.
Plots H4, H5 and H6.

521
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,196
It's surprising how much
the village has changed.

522
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,712
There are a lot of new companies.

523
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,716
Their employees buy locally.

524
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,951
For the peace and quiet, the nature.

525
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,749
And they're close to Paris.

526
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,315
50 minutes from Gare du Nord.
A train every half hour.

527
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,278
Watch out.
There's a hole there.

528
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,956
We had a death last week.

529
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,598
It's those plots.
Afterwards we'll have to expand.

530
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,757
That one? Near the family crypt?

531
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:57,389
There, by that rusty cross,
are three unmarked tombstones.

532
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,919
We'll clean them up.

533
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,949
Over there...

534
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,194
I want to buy the newspaper.

535
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,197
Why?

536
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,079
There's an obituary,

537
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,595
which extracted from Paul's will.

538
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:50,077
It pissed me off that
I don't want them to publish it.

539
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,318
You said she wrote down what
she wanted to say on the diary's cover?

540
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,276
Yes.

541
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,714
I'll leave the pictures to you,
and there's nothing left

542
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,479
from my place.

543
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:22,112
But through you, it can go on beyond me.

544
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,635
I think it's good,
it's her wish for the lifetime.

545
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,835
It's a curse.

546
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:38,278
Of what I'm doing in Japan.
This is a prototype.

547
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,070
Very nice.

548
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,719
You want to see?

549
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,959
It's not finished yet.

550
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,397
This is the saucer.

551
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,953
We start fabrication
in a couple of weeks.

552
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,033
Help yourselves. There's more.

553
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,077
Can you get us some?

554
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,392
Of course. I'll give you a set.

555
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,958
When they come in.

556
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:10,271
I was shocked by Hélène's death.
It was so sudden.

557
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,718
I can't get used to the fact
that she's gone.

558
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,909
She was drained after San Francisco.

559
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,953
Yeah, but it was
incredibly satisfying for her.

560
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,239
She seemed 15 years younger.
She was glowing.

561
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,270
Her conference on Paul's
everyday life freaked me out.

562
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,598
It was totally indecent!

563
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,029
There were things I never knew.

564
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,590
Me too. I was stunned.
Everyone was.

565
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:57,111
She never spoke so freely
in front of us.

566
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,515
But... you think she had

567
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,596
a relationship
with her uncle?

568
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,073
Not at all.

569
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,836
What?

570
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,157
It's not clear.
I'm not so sure.

571
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:15,037
There was something,
but a real relationship? No!

572
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,509
Think what you want.
As always!

573
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,631
Our untouchable mother.

574
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,633
- There was great affection.
- Why always...

575
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,156
Whenever she looked
at a painting of Paul's,

576
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,078
she got immersed in it.
Because she loved him!

577
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:32,710
- Of course she did, but it wasn't...
- It was obvious.

578
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,390
It was pretty explicit.
To me. Unsettling.

579
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,592
- There's more to love.
- More than what to love?

580
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,957
You could see it.
Every painting brought him near.

581
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,832
Do you mean
a sexual relationship?

582
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,712
- Why are you so upset?
- I'm not. That's not the point.

583
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:51,436
- The truth is out!
- She never said it. Never.

584
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,312
A lot goes unspoken in this family,

585
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,272
so now I feel relieved.

586
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:07,796
She tired herself out.

587
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:13,956
She did too much,
always running around.

588
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,595
Above all she achieved something
with the show and lost interest

589
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,393
I think it started much earlier.

590
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,711
She had enough.
She felt diminished and hated it.

591
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,309
Like at her last birthday.
Remember?

592
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,318
She rambled on about the estate.

593
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,955
There was quite a turn-out.

594
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,393
More than I'd have thought.

595
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:46,716
It was a nice ceremony. Simple.
Not too sentimental.

596
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,955
As she'd have wanted it.

597
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,598
The village church
was a good idea.

598
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,557
I'm glad she got the roof fixed!

599
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,596
It was caving in.

600
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,914
We'd all have died!

601
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,596
With the money she left,
the priest will change the boiler

602
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,159
and fix the cemetery wall.

603
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,952
It's a ruin.

604
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,192
I liked that priest.

605
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,912
He spoke about her well.

606
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,152
What are you doing?
Going out?

607
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,913
To meet Pierre.

608
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,393
Is that bad?

609
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,236
Of course not. Go on!

610
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,435
Dad wants us here.

611
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,033
No, you should get out.

612
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,430
Here, I brought you this.

613
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,399
No TV today.
I never watch TV.

614
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,919
Give it to your dad.

615
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,756
He needs it.

616
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,790
This is for Pierre.

617
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,473
No PC today.

618
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,960
Stick it there.

619
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,076
We'll never get him off the Net.

620
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:36,951
We can try.

621
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:37,637
Your design?

622
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,716
Brand new.

623
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,955
Cool!

624
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,958
Go on, before he comes.
You'll get nabbed.

625
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,316
See you later.

626
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,390
Bye.

627
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,636
Lisa? What do I do with this?

628
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,835
Jeramie...
can you get the other quiche?

629
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,949
What's that?

630
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,949
Can I help?

631
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,799
Is that one with bacon?

632
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,953
I think it's a quiche e la quiche.

633
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,749
I guess we should get down
to practical matters...

634
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,834
You're all leaving.
I'll be here

635
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,236
and I'll have some issues
to address.

636
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,950
I've thought it over
from my perspective.

637
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,717
I'm sure there's a point
on which we all agree:

638
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,718
To keep Paul Berthier's memory
and the house alive

639
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,911
with its objects and furniture,

640
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,394
its soul, so we can pass it on
to our children.

641
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,714
Afterwards, it'll be up to them.

642
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,911
We won't be around.

643
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,159
The paintings too?

644
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:49,397
Of course.
He Corots, the Redon panels.

645
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,114
It would be so sad to lose them.
Don't you think?

646
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,030
Sure.

647
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,314
We can use the house
to meet up on vacations.

648
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,396
If you have any.

649
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,273
It'll need work.
It's falling to pieces.

650
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,919
Eloise can stay.
She'll look after the house.

651
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,439
I asked her. She agreed.

652
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,955
Should I set the table?

653
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,276
I know what you're saying.

654
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,190
I can empathize, for Mom...

655
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,960
and Paul Berthier,
who I never knew.

656
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,951
Or can barely remember.

657
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,719
But I understand.

658
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,509
But for us it's going to be
a little more complicated.

659
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,034
I wanted to bring it up
since we're all here.

660
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,958
Angela agrees with me.

661
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:59,916
It's just that they offered
to renew my contract.

662
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,235
I hesitated, but I won't find
a job like that in Europe.

663
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,029
The company's growth is in Asia.
The best potential is

664
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:12,159
Obviously this means
a long-term commitment.

665
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,278
Five years.
I'll be transferred to Peking.

666
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,919
So we'll have to move there.

667
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,275
The winters are freezing cold.

668
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,398
We told the kids
we'd rent a summer house in Bali.

669
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,630
We've looked. There's great stuff.

670
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,269
It's dirt cheap compared to France.

671
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,190
You'll come visit.

672
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,151
- Of course we will.
- Sure...

673
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:47,392
Because... we won't have the opportunity
to come to Europe.

674
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,749
At least not for the next few years.

675
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:53,157
We'll see then.

676
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,318
The kids won't miss it here?

677
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:01,315
The kids?
You know, we speak French at home.

678
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,234
But they're far removed
from the country and culture.

679
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,592
Their school is in English.

680
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,188
Like kids their age,
they're into America.

681
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,151
Next term we're sending Pearl
to San Francisco.

682
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,315
Yes.

683
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,790
So obviously, for us,

684
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:22,433
both in terms of the present
and the future,

685
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,388
the house doesn't
really come into play.

686
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,478
I mean, we won't be able
to benefit from it.

687
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,948
And we'll have expenses.

688
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,031
We need to buy in Peking.

689
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:35,476
The company helps
but I'll have to put in more.

690
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,396
With the Olympics,
real estate has skyrocketed.

691
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,749
I understand.

692
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,110
I didn't realize,
but I understand.

693
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:55,593
This is just our situation,
but we'll let the majority

694
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,716
Of course.

695
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,431
I'll get the roast.

696
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,758
Can I have the cutting board?

697
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,320
With the knife.

698
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,277
- Here it is.
- Over there.

699
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,833
You want a plate?

700
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,958
This is fine.

701
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,951
I guess it's my turn to speak.

702
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,069
Not easy.

703
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:50,278
I had something to say too.

704
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,272
And I thought I had a scoop!

705
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,198
Thanks, Jeramie.
You stole the show from me.

706
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,594
Sorry.
More wine.

707
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:08,390
James and I have known each other
for almost ten years now.

708
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:13,755
I forgot to tell you.
He had to get back to work.

709
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,436
It's true
you don't know him that well.

710
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,910
He's always on his computer.

711
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,951
We met him in San Francisco.

712
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,833
He spent time with Hélène.
She liked him a lot.

713
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,712
We're getting married.

714
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,309
Next March.

715
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,915
It'll be a really small thing.

716
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,597
We haven't decided
on here or the States.

717
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,438
- Stop it!
- What?

718
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,275
My first experience was a disaster
but there's no...

719
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:51,953
We never said "disaster".

720
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,957
- I didn't.
- Neither do I.

721
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,720
We're happy for you.
We just didn't expect this.

722
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,592
Don't rub it in!

723
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,189
Congratulations.

724
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:05,277
This means that a lot of things
will change for us.

725
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,270
First because
we both live in New York.

726
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:13,957
I have my agency
with most of my clients and he...

727
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,594
He's artistic director
of an internet magazine.

728
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,954
He's from Denver, right?

729
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,959
Yes, we spend summers there.

730
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:22,950
I hear it's nice.

731
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:26,908
I'd love to go hiking
with you some time in Colorado.

732
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:33,154
In the end,

733
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,477
I won't make it
more than once a year to France.

734
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:40,110
Maybe once in a while...

735
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:51,000
So... I don't want to take sides

736
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,991
or cast the decisive vote,

737
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,588
but that's where I'm at.

738
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,314
I won't benefit from the house.

739
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,916
But over the years...

740
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,918
it no longer means much to me.
France neither.

741
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,039
So you vote to sell.

742
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,280
Yes, sure. I vote to sell.

743
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,914
You too, Jeramie?

744
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,316
Yes.

745
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,277
You're just being diplomatic.

746
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,948
You could say that.

747
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,918
I wouldn't vote against you.

748
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,235
We're not voting against you either.

749
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:33,314
I gave my point of view.

750
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,516
I want us to agree
and decide what's best for everyone.

751
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:38,949
Want some?

752
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,079
Just a drop.

753
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,959
Wine?

754
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,030
- No, thanls.
- Some more?

755
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,589
Sure. It's very good.

756
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:50,755
Thanks.

757
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,951
- Some more?
- Yes.

758
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,394
Let's make a decision.

759
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,272
It's obvious we're selling.

760
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,759
Since I'm the only one
living in Paris,

761
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,833
I'll have to deal
with the practical stuff.

762
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,716
Obviously I'll keep you posted...

763
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,039
We'll consult on major decisions.

764
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:35,156
There's a whole slew
of furniture, paintings, books...

765
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:40,189
We should see if it's worth
selling it all off at auction.

766
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,715
I know someone who can help...

767
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:47,834
There are some things I'd like
for sentimental reasons.

768
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:51,392
As for the rest,
I don't know what to do.

769
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:54,154
The problem will be the estate tax.

770
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,956
We should try to keep the Corots.

771
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,953
We can't cut them in three.

772
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,799
They're what's most valuable.

773
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,310
If Jeramie needs money,

774
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:12,236
they should be sold first.

775
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,119
- That's my cup.
- Sorry.

776
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,838
Probably best to organize
one big auction.

777
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,918
We can do a catalogue.

778
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,598
"The Paul Berthier Collection".

779
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,951
Pictures, well laid-out,
of what we like most.

780
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,270
To have a trace.

781
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,790
And you know,
I'm more used to this than Fredaric.

782
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:01,479
I can help. He doesn't know much.
He'll make mistakes...

783
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,790
I'll be stuck in China.
If I can help, I will.

784
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,076
But the time difference...

785
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,508
We'll manage.

786
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,435
Fredaric?

787
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:38,951
You're crying?

788
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,035
Don't be ridiculous.

789
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,076
Sorry.

790
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,515
Okay! Everyone's here.

791
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,759
Mr. Lambert will see you shortly.

792
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:22,956
Nice going.

793
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:24,953
I couldn't find a spot.

794
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,314
There's a parking lot.

795
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,395
No problem.
Mr. Lambert is on the phone.

796
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,958
Sorry for the wait.

797
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:51,596
Please, take a seat.
There are enough chairs.

798
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,918
It's all pretty clear. It would have
been more so, if your mother

799
00:50:55,960 --> 00:51:01,080
had taken certain measures
to prepare for her passing.

800
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:06,308
I told her to see a lawyer
but she wouldn't hear of it.

801
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,951
Normal superstition.

802
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,958
The problem is,
you may be taxed to the max.

803
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,519
I looked at the list.

804
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,280
It seems that the bulk
of the estate is here.

805
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,960
The paintings, the furniture...

806
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,272
I'm no expert but some of this
seems very valuable.

807
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:28,950
The paintings alone.

808
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,798
Especially the Corots.

809
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,840
His value on the international market
is hard to call.

810
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,951
And... his subject matter is austere.

811
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:45,958
In any case,
you'll have to get it appraised.

812
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:52,397
The best way to lessen the estate tax,
which will be very

813
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,392
is to donate to the State.

814
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:58,960
The Musae d'Orsay is interested,
in principle.

815
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,960
Hélène said so.
The Majorelle desk...

816
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,474
The Joseph Hoffman armoire too.

817
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,198
They're important pieces.

818
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,038
They come up rarely.

819
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:08,950
They won't let them go.

820
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,953
And we know the curator of
the department of Decorative Arts.

821
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:16,112
Mom's friend.

822
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:20,432
It should work out.

823
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,960
Very well, then.
He'll help present your case.

824
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,712
The museum must then get clearance
from the tax department.

825
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:29,118
There are some sketches
by Paul Berthier, all his notebooks.

826
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,033
We could sell them
in the United States.

827
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,589
It's good to get
international recognition.

828
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,716
I thought I might help.

829
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:41,592
Yes, if you get an export permit.

830
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,950
Otherwise I think you've
all agreed to sell the house?

831
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,718
Yes, we discussed it.

832
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,148
Too much upkeep.

833
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,072
And we don't really need it.

834
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,038
I know a good realtor.
He says he can sell it.

835
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,960
He's selling our place in Paris.

836
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,109
Mr. Rosen.

837
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,515
You've told him?

838
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,633
We've discussed it for a while.
Informally.

839
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,155
What does he say?

840
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,198
It's not his specialty,
but he asked around.

841
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:09,596
It'll sell fast, and well.
He's confident.

842
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,948
You wasted no time.

843
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,190
I don't get it.

844
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:17,593
It was a given.
You counted on it.

845
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:18,755
What was your plan?

846
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:21,070
I had no plan. I love the house.

847
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,275
I thought we all did.

848
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,839
I wasn't doing the math.

849
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,633
That's unfair.
I like the house too.

850
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,634
I have a job
that takes unexpected turns.

851
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,034
Three kids.
I have tough choices to make.

852
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,832
Sorry, I do math.

853
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,315
Can you talk about this later?

854
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,955
So you have Mr. Rosen's number?

855
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:41,950
Of course.

856
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:46,949
At the bottom.

857
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:47,830
Thank you.

858
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,198
Just a second. I'm coming.

859
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:03,714
I have to go. I'll stop by the hotel.
My flight's at 3.

860
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,479
I'll be back in 10 days.

861
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,914
I'll be gone.

862
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,712
So I'll see you when I see you.

863
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:12,960
Tell me for Pearl.

864
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,518
We'll talk it over.

865
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,233
I'll take her on vacation.

866
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,118
Just tell me.

867
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,960
Nothing doing.
Always on the move.

868
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:25,836
Want to get a drink?

869
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:26,951
Sure.

870
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:28,597
There?

871
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:30,915
That's fine.

872
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:34,953
She got that from Mom.

873
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:35,910
What?

874
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,951
Never staying put.

875
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,394
Always wanting to be elsewhere.

876
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,119
She's running from something.

877
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,159
Not us, I hope.

878
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,229
Now that you mention it.
I'm sure...

879
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,913
What do you want?

880
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,396
Coffee.

881
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,274
Hellow.

882
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:57,077
Hellow.

883
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:00,279
- Can we have two coffees?
- Yes.

884
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:08,951
If you don't mind. Mom was the same.

885
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:11,588
Devoted to her uncle because
she hated Dad's radiator

886
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:12,710
She loved him.

887
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:14,911
But she looked down on him.

888
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:18,960
The day after he died
she took on her maiden name.

889
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,270
Berthier sounds better
than Mrs. "Radiator" Marly.

890
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:26,228
That was questionable
but at times Dad was a bit much.

891
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,709
You're wrong.

892
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,512
Rough, but more sensitive than her.

893
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,475
He paid the bills,
was sneered at and kept quiet.

894
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,956
Because... he felt inferior.

895
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,754
She suffocated him with her uncle.

896
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,639
Paul Berthier was a great artist.

897
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,434
Yeah, I don't know.

898
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:47,596
Some stuff is good, others less.

899
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,718
You're wrong.
It's all great. Really.

900
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:51,590
You know,

901
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,396
Thanks.

902
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,270
You knoe what? Don't be angry with me.

903
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,430
It was difficult moving to China.

904
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,278
I thought it was temporary.

905
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,959
To make some quick money.

906
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,713
Now it's your life.

907
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,757
Mine and that of my kids.

908
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:27,950
You won't come back.

909
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,389
No, I don't think so.

910
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,275
Mom knew it.

911
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,469
She felt it.

912
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,836
She told me. I wouldn't listen.

913
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,113
You know the only thing I regret?

914
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:44,715
The two Corots.

915
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,435
Why not keep them?

916
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,271
And buy you out?
It's beyond my means.

917
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,719
I need the money.

918
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:55,949
You're not angry?

919
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:57,756
No.

920
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:58,957
Are you sure?

921
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:04,915
And Eloise?

922
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,236
She'll get the house in order.

923
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,628
Then she'll retire.

924
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,074
As far as I understand,

925
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:14,715
her relatives
have a nice place in the south.

926
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:16,399
She'll live with them.

927
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,190
Good. Glad to hear it.

928
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,916
Strange to imagine
the house being sold.

929
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:28,790
Yeah.

930
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,269
With other people in it...
other routines...

931
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,188
another way of living.

932
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,278
Eloise gone.

933
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,709
Yes. Eloise gone.

934
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,434
- Fine.
- That; s it.

935
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:47,950
See you around.

936
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,718
Were you able to follow?

937
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:26,830
It was fine.

938
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,229
I lost sight of you for a second.

939
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:31,311
You have the key, right?

940
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,475
No.

941
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,956
I gave it to you for the padlock.

942
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,473
No, you didn't.

943
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:38,510
Sorry.

944
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:45,510
I'll shut off the alarm.

945
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:46,470
Remember the code?

946
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:47,516
Yes.

947
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:48,954
I'll hold onto the key.

948
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,279
This way, please.

949
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,710
Here's the vase I told you about.

950
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:09,150
By Daum. It's signed here.

951
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,960
It was one of a pair.

952
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,951
The sketchbooks are this way...

953
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,074
We have to go out
to get to the studio.

954
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,389
Come see the Corots.

955
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,397
Please. And the Redon panels.

956
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:22,954
Just one.
The other's being restored.

957
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,236
It really needed it.

958
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,238
Here they are.

959
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:33,434
I don't know them.
Done in the area?

960
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:37,957
I think so. My mother said
that's where the supermarket is

961
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:39,917
We passed it
we left L'lsle Adam.

962
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,951
- I'll go first.
- After you...

963
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:07,275
Mom listed everything here.
Very well-organized.

964
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,953
These are the sketchbooks.
If you want to look.

965
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,956
I saw some of them
at the Oxford show.

966
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:18,958
But it was far from complete.

967
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:22,594
What do you plan to do?

968
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,393
I'd like to sell them
in New York.

969
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:29,151
I know it won't be easy.

970
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,233
Which is why
they should stay together.

971
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,718
I'm sorry. It's unsettling.

972
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:53,480
First time back
since Hélène died.

973
01:00:58,960 --> 01:00:59,960
We left it intact.

974
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,473
Yes, I can see.

975
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,953
As she did,
ever since Paul died.

976
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:09,838
Everything about him was sacred,

977
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,439
sometimes annoyingly so.

978
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:14,399
She really loved him.

979
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:17,151
You mean she was fond of him?

980
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,595
She was Paul's last great passion.

981
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,953
His last great passion. Mom.

982
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:29,597
Because of the family
they had to keep it a secret.

983
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,794
You were kids.
You wouldn't have understood.

984
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:36,950
I saw them together often.
It was very moving.

985
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:42,957
Your mother was truly happy
back then.

986
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:56,748
#Call Fredaric
to set up the phone#

987
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,910
Majorelle didn't make
many display cases.

988
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:09,235
Yours is the last one to be found
in a private collection.

989
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,273
The key is in the office.

990
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:25,156
Here's the Majorelle desk.

991
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,955
We'll see it better
once it's cleared off.

992
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:30,272
The museum has wanted it
for a while.

993
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:31,958
I think she left the key here.

994
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:36,717
I'm a bit confused.
Where is the Hoffman armoire?

995
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:37,949
Right behind you.

996
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,958
Paul Berthier showed it to me
when he bought it.

997
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:44,948
He was very proud.

998
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,075
He had a good eye.

999
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:49,960
No one cared about
Viennese modernism then.

1000
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,029
It was frowned upon.

1001
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,392
I took the hands.

1002
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,715
- You mind?
- Not at all.

1003
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,515
They have no value.

1004
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,757
Besides sentimental.

1005
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,273
I'll show you the porcelain.

1006
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,272
There's more but...

1007
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:12,957
Mom gave this to me. I'll keep it.

1008
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:24,392
Theodore Haviland,
designed by Suzanne Lalique.

1009
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:25,953
Thanks, I know it by heart.

1010
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:27,915
Full set?

1011
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:29,397
Is it a full set?

1012
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:30,919
Of course.

1013
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:31,949
Are you keeping it too?

1014
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:37,518
No way. Definitely not.

1015
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:20,152
I'm taking this. Here it is.

1016
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,152
You didn't mention these.

1017
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,835
They were always around.
I never noticed.

1018
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:40,918
Monogramed H&Co.
They're by Felix Bracquemond.

1019
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,960
He did very little glasswork
in the 1880s.

1020
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:46,269
They're very nice.

1021
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:49,238
Modern for the time.

1022
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:50,628
Where did you find these?

1023
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:51,596
What?

1024
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:54,156
They're Bracquemond vases!

1025
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,799
They were in a closet.

1026
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:57,308
Not Mom's favorites.

1027
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,311
She never mentioned them.

1028
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:00,799
It wasn't her taste

1029
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,076
but Paul Berthier
appreciated Bracquemond.

1030
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:07,960
The impressionistic vases
may also be his.

1031
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:08,949
Where are they?

1032
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:11,793
On the chimney.
The pseudo-Japanese things...

1033
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:14,713
Have a look
and tell me what you think.

1034
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:16,399
I don't know Bracquemond.

1035
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:19,160
There was a show in Limoges
a few years ago.

1036
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:23,268
The vases
can only strengthen our case.

1037
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:26,589
You think it'll work?

1038
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:28,188
It should.

1039
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:33,238
Hélène and I
often discussed this donation.

1040
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,954
What did she say?

1041
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:40,513
That it was up to you
all to decide, not her.

1042
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:48,069
I don't want to be insistent
with Adrienne but...

1043
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:52,796
I'm skeptical about
the export permit for the notebooks.

1044
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:58,393
Such an important ensemble
shouldn't leave the country.

1045
01:05:58,840 --> 01:05:59,716
Or be broken up.

1046
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,717
She won't be breaking it up.

1047
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:04,273
She's deceiving herself.

1048
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:08,955
She's considering Christie's
in New York.

1049
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,952
That's what she said.

1050
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:12,075
They'll advise her
to sell them by the page.

1051
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:17,713
You have the key to the cabinet.

1052
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,956
Damn, I took it
and left it in my pocket.

1053
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:21,109
Nothing doing,

1054
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:30,274
she used this as her broom closet.

1055
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,710
Look. Rust remover! What's this?

1056
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:36,149
That's Paul's last sketch.

1057
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:39,632
The view from here.
See?

1058
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,791
Mom wanted you to have it.

1059
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:42,949
I know.

1060
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:48,275
And look here. The pieces
of the Degas plaster I mentioned.

1061
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:49,789
Can I have a look?

1062
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:51,639
Of course.

1063
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:03,948
It's in terrible condition!

1064
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,835
Can you help me carry the painting?

1065
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:33,790
I'm coming.

1066
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:44,435
We'll lay it against the wall.

1067
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:50,036
Careful...

1068
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:38,429
I heard you were coming.

1069
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:40,477
Flowers, how nice.

1070
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:44,076
Your mom hated rooms without flowers.

1071
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,756
Empty vases were like death to her.

1072
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:48,791
Asters. They were her favorites.

1073
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:50,918
It's the season.

1074
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:54,389
You took a taxi?

1075
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,596
My nephew has a cab. He drove me.

1076
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:59,237
He wouldn't come in. He's outside.

1077
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:03,951
This packing up is very disturbing.

1078
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:05,149
For me too.

1079
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:06,748
Yes, I can imagine.

1080
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,951
For the family it must be sadder.

1081
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:18,076
I wanted to say...

1082
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:19,915
I'm really sorry.
I didn't want to sell.

1083
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:21,518
But... it's impossible.

1084
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:26,636
I told you before.

1085
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:33,592
Dividing things among us
wasn't easy.

1086
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,960
Your mom suspected it.

1087
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,951
That Jeramie and Adrienne
wouldn't come back to France.

1088
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:40,960
She spoke about it.

1089
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:41,949
What did she say?

1090
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:46,395
That after she died,
the house would have to be sold.

1091
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:50,158
You know she left you some money?

1092
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:54,278
It's the lawyer
who will give it to you.

1093
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,231
He'll get in touch with you.

1094
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:00,950
Call and I'll explain
how you should declare it.

1095
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:05,591
It's stupid paperwork
but you can't push it off.

1096
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:11,712
I want you to keep something of my mom.

1097
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:16,753
A souvenir...
one of her belongings.

1098
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,275
Thanks, but I'd be embarrassed.

1099
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:23,238
Don't be. It's the least we can do.

1100
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:25,949
Okay then.

1101
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:30,155
There's a vase
with big green bubbles.

1102
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:33,718
I can keep putting flowers in it
and think of her.

1103
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:44,710
What's that?

1104
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:48,396
A vase. Fredaric gave it to me.

1105
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:53,952
He said to choose anything.
I couldn't take advantage.

1106
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:58,473
I took something ordinary.

1107
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:00,751
What would I do
with something valuable?

1108
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,951
I agree. It was the right thing to do.

1109
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:21,749
Mr. Marly, follow me.

1110
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:32,918
It's no big deal.
We gave her a scare.

1111
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:36,077
We'll run a few checks
and let her go. Sit down.

1112
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:36,956
Thanks.

1113
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:40,717
But it's serious.

1114
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,599
I'm shocked. I had no idea.

1115
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:45,916
She's serious. A good student.

1116
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:48,599
The store manager
spotted her a while ago.

1117
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,633
These girls
then sell the clothes at school.

1118
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:53,955
Have you noticed anything?

1119
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:58,597
Last night we saw an exhibition.

1120
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:01,718
Contemporary art, very difficult.
She was interested.

1121
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,839
Has she been spending
more than usual?

1122
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,188
Anything beyond her means?

1123
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:11,236
I don't know. Maybe. I can't tell.

1124
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:12,594
I'll ask my wife.

1125
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:16,515
A friend of hers got away
and is still unidentified.

1126
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:20,599
She has lots of... friends...

1127
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:24,759
From the gym. They come and go.
I'm not often home.

1128
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:28,839
My work often takes me overseas...

1129
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:30,916
And to make matters worse,

1130
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:34,910
we found this in her bag.

1131
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:42,278
I won't prosecute for 3 grams.
Too much paperwork.

1132
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,914
We're lucky it's not crack.

1133
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:48,157
But if it happens again,
I'll be less understanding.

1134
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:51,957
She doesn't have a record.
She's a good student.

1135
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,952
Am I making myself clear?

1136
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,197
Fredaric Marly.
Is this a bad time?

1137
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,154
Have you heard anything?

1138
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:19,111
Sorry! I thought it was earlier.

1139
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:24,070
The meeting was pushed off.

1140
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:25,949
I'm on my way there now.

1141
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,960
As we speak. I'll call you afterwards.

1142
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:30,597
Okay?

1143
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:34,915
I promise.

1144
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:37,793
Bye.

1145
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:42,472
Did you call me a cab?

1146
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:48,115
Hello, sir.

1147
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:49,110
Good day, my friend.

1148
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,919
Ladies and gentlemen...

1149
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:55,954
We'll now be turning
to the Berthier bequest.

1150
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:59,398
Mr. Waldemar
is going to tell us about it.

1151
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:02,952
It's a remarkably interesting collection
of Art Nouveau

1152
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:05,594
including these wonderful panels
by Odilon Redon.

1153
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:10,916
These pieces have interested
the Musae d'Orsay for years.

1154
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:15,589
Especially the Majorelle desk,

1155
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:17,631
which you know.

1156
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:21,914
Helene Berthier
once lent it to us for a show.

1157
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:27,796
We're also interested
in this display case by the same

1158
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:30,838
There are three others

1159
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,951
but they're all unfortunately
out of the country.

1160
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:38,317
We also have this vase
by Félix Bracquemond

1161
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:42,792
and these two others
from the Auteuil atelier.

1162
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:47,636
And obviously the two
decorative panels by Odilon Redon.

1163
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:50,718
You each have the list
in front of you.

1164
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:54,793
Why so few pieces by Paul Berthier?

1165
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:58,714
The family doesn't have many at all

1166
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:01,155
and they decided to keep them.

1167
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:04,315
I heard that Adrienne Marly

1168
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:07,960
is selling Berthier's notebooks
at Christie's.

1169
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:09,712
They'll be ripped to shreds.

1170
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:11,598
Something has to be done.

1171
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:16,754
Excuse me, but I spoke with her
recently about this.

1172
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:20,714
That possibility
seems to have been discarded.

1173
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:23,793
On a personal level,
if you'll allow me, sir,

1174
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:26,428
I must voice serious objections.

1175
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:30,275
Concerning Art Nouveau furniture,

1176
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:33,392
it's always the same thing.

1177
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:35,192
We're told
how exceptionally rare it is

1178
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:36,912
and it always ends up
locked in a storage room.

1179
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:38,473
People aren't ready for it.

1180
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,392
Stealing and smoking. Great!

1181
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:41,914
I didn't rat on Aurore.

1182
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:44,793
That would have been.

1183
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:45,960
It's the first time.

1184
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:46,949
Yeah, right.

1185
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:49,195
Sorry.

1186
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:51,390
Okay, it's not.

1187
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:52,510
And honest too!

1188
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:53,709
You smoke pot too.

1189
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:54,955
I don't get caught!

1190
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:56,070
More experience.

1191
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:57,468
No, more careful!

1192
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:59,710
So I'll be more careful.

1193
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:02,428
Start by putting an end
to this crap!

1194
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:08,393
I got it. The cops lectured me
for two hours, thanks.

1195
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:15,148
Anything else to tell me?

1196
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:16,476
Like what?

1197
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:17,959
Let's continue.

1198
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:20,952
Usually when there's
shoplifting plus drugs,

1199
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,599
there's also a guy.

1200
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:25,513
If there's a guy,
tell me before the cops do.

1201
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:33,915
Sort of.

1202
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:37,589
Sort of a guy?

1203
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:38,836
Yes.

1204
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:40,599
And sort of fooling around?

1205
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:42,949
Sort of.

1206
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:45,197
Sort of more?

1207
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:46,715
We're careful.

1208
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:47,472
You're careful.

1209
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:48,914
Totally careful.

1210
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,431
Excellent. Now I feel reassured.

1211
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:55,320
So who is this totally careful guy?

1212
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:56,714
None of your business.

1213
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:09,108
Okay. You don't have to answer.
It's your right.

1214
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:10,713
But it is my business.

1215
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:12,035
You don't know him.

1216
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:14,950
Is he from school?

1217
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:15,950
No.

1218
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:18,117
Let me guess. You met at the gym.

1219
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:19,590
No.

1220
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:26,830
We can never have a serious talk.

1221
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:29,790
Go on, answer.

1222
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:32,269
If you get pulled over, no big deal.

1223
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:33,958
We'll go back to the Police station.

1224
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:45,079
Yeah, great! Slam the door!

1225
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,391
How did it go with the committee?

1226
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,397
So these things interest you now?

1227
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:01,275
Normal. It's all you talk about.

1228
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:03,709
I got your sister out of jail.

1229
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:05,911
Still, couldn't you find out?

1230
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:07,029
I had no time.

1231
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:08,229
So call now.

1232
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:10,948
It's too late to call the curator.

1233
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:14,959
Don't you care what she did?

1234
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:16,639
I know. Her friend called.

1235
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:17,956
To say what?

1236
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:20,151
To flush some weed
down the toilet.

1237
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:23,397
Did you?

1238
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:25,431
Sure. It could have been bad!

1239
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:26,953
For you too, as her legal.

1240
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:45,515
This building contains
our restoration studios.

1241
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:06,755
Over there is cabinet-making,

1242
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:09,952
ironworks there...
and sculpture here.

1243
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:15,959
- Are we interrupting?
- No, come in.

1244
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,234
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

1245
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:20,756
Now here's an interesting piece.

1246
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:23,428
We received it as a donation.

1247
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:29,118
The work Bruno is doing on it
is really amazing.

1248
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:30,918
It's new to me too.

1249
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:33,438
You really have rescued it.

1250
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:36,315
I honestly
didn't think it possible.

1251
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:39,274
Almost over.
We've done the whole place.

1252
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:42,593
We're in Furniture
but I'm losing my group.

1253
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:44,591
Let's see a movie.
Choose something.

1254
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:47,718
I can meet you wherever.
I won't be long.

1255
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,154
Strange seeing it here.

1256
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:08,714
I don't know what to think.

1257
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:09,716
Me neither.

1258
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,439
It's nicely displayed.

1259
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:19,595
It's nicely displayed.

1260
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,313
Who designed that lamp?

1261
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:34,637
What's-his-name. No idea.

1262
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:44,236
Doesn't it seem caged?

1263
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:48,037
No. A lot of people benefit.

1264
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:50,077
Benefit? They walk pass by.

1265
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:52,595
They pass and look.

1266
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:53,949
It's history. For everyone.

1267
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:56,031
Do those vases have a history?

1268
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:59,269
They mean something
with flowers, in a living room.

1269
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:04,912
In natural light. Otherwise
they're disenchanted.

1270
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:06,951
Same goes for paintings then.

1271
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:10,430
Of course. Remember Antonio Bernardi?

1272
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:11,392
Yes.

1273
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:13,909
We visited a private collection
in Switzerland.

1274
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:16,757
In Lugano. I couldn't come.

1275
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:20,960
This financier kept all his paintings
in a modern apartment

1276
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:24,316
with metal shutters
and alarms everywhere.

1277
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,630
He was so proud to show it to us.

1278
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:28,796
Antonio saw one of the paintings

1279
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:30,188
and he went pale.

1280
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:31,753
His ex-wife's portrait.

1281
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,399
- Francesca.
- Yes.

1282
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:34,311
No news of her?

1283
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:36,277
She died. Long ago. Cancer.

1284
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:37,960
For Antonio, she was in prison.

1285
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:40,030
He wanted to haul it away.

1286
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:51,597
Look!

1287
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:52,397
What?

1288
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,191
Oh yeah.

1289
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:58,949
I forgot to tell you.
It's valuable.

1290
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:08,589
There's another one. I gave it to Eloise.

1291
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:13,712
I loved her Christmas card.

1292
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:14,950
It made me cry.

1293
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:16,275
It moved me too.

1294
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:19,835
Did you answer her?

1295
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:22,275
I forgot.

1296
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:25,508
You promised you would.

1297
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:38,439
Come on... let's go.

1298
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:04,515
We shouldn't have sold the Corots.

1299
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:08,390
Forget the Corots!
We couldn't care less!

1300
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:11,398
Stop mulling it over.
It's exhausting!

1301
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:14,716
You'd have bought them out?

1302
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:15,750
Why not?

1303
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:16,836
With what money?

1304
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:18,951
I'd have managed. Taken a loan.

1305
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:19,956
And the house?

1306
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:20,956
Why not?

1307
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,630
You know it was impossible.

1308
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:27,710
Thank you.

1309
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:30,915
Thank you.

1310
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:38,111
Anyway, it's over now.
I sign the sales agreement next week.

1311
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:41,957
The kids want to throw a party
there with friends.

1312
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:46,068
Let them have fun.
We still own it for a month.

1313
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:48,959
Good. They'd have been upset.

1314
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:53,037
Are they spending the weekend?

1315
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:56,949
I don't know.
I think that's what they said.

1316
01:24:57,920 --> 01:24:59,592
They'd better behave.

1317
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:00,950
Why?

1318
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:52,712
Tell me if you need something.

1319
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:53,636
I will.

1320
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:55,313
We'll be in Spain all summer.

1321
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:56,708
Muriel told me.

1322
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:57,955
We'll be back in September.

1323
01:27:58,080 --> 01:27:59,069
Have fun.

1324
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:01,798
You can always call.

1325
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:03,393
I won't bother you.

1326
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:04,709
You have Muriel's cell?

1327
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:05,716
I have.

1328
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:46,390
Got a light?

1329
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:29,391
Every thing ok?

1330
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:33,838
Thanks, it's heavy.

1331
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:40,953
We can drop this all here.

1332
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:44,628
I'll show you the bedrooms.

1333
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:50,433
First floor there's a bedroom.

1334
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:51,589
Bathroom on the left,
toilet on the right.

1335
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:56,150
What are you doing?

1336
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:57,395
For the fire.

1337
01:29:57,960 --> 01:29:59,916
- Where was the wood?
- Out back.

1338
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:02,269
It's the neighbor's.
You've taken a ton.

1339
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:13,595
- What about the music?
- Coming along.

1340
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:14,949
Is there a problem?

1341
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:16,838
You want to try?

1342
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:19,428
You do it!

1343
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:20,709
Take this.

1344
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:30,110
OK?

1345
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:31,435
Where's Richard?

1346
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:33,392
I saw him in the studio.

1347
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:34,277
Thanks.

1348
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:44,155
- Is Richard around?
- He just left.

1349
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:45,793
He went to the pond.

1350
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:46,836
Thanks.

1351
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:58,598
Hey guys, I brought beer.

1352
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:16,952
What's up, guys? Want to share that?

1353
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:26,955
Are you okay?

1354
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:35,755
Let's change the music.

1355
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:18,112
My grandma used to take me here.

1356
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:20,154
I'd help her pick fruit.

1357
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,759
She'd tell me stories.

1358
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:23,915
What kind of stories?

1359
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:26,958
How she did the same thing
with her uncle.

1360
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:32,958
There's a painting of her
as a child picking cherries.

1361
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:36,109
From this angle. No...

1362
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:42,034
That way, because
the house is in the background.

1363
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:44,238
It wasn't hidden by trees yet.

1364
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:45,516
Where's the painting?

1365
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:48,916
A collector has it in Lyon.

1366
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:51,718
We ate at his place once.

1367
01:33:57,160 --> 01:33:59,071
She also said that one day

1368
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:01,950
I'd bring my children here.

1369
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:03,276
When I have kids.

1370
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:08,750
What's wrong?

1371
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:11,949
Are you crying?

1372
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:15,389
My grandmother's dead.

1373
01:34:16,440 --> 01:34:17,634
The house has been sold.

1374
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:29,029
Sylvie! Richard!
We're waiting!

1375
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:31,191
I don't want them to find us.

1376
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:42,789
We have to climb the wall.
