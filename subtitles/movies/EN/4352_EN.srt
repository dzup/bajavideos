1
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,270
Turn around.

2
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,519
Okay, out.

3
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,278
Turn around.

4
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,755
Giorgia stays,
Samantha and herfriend can go.

5
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,674
Strip.

6
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,156
Turn around, slowly.

7
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,155
She'll do fine.

8
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,951
Thank you, dear, you can go.

9
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,709
This is vacant and furnished.

10
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,077
It was remodeled recently...

11
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,796
...but costs double the other,
and two months more advance.

12
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,435
Condominium costs are triple.

13
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,710
Best you know now,
when trucks pass, the place rattles.

14
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,558
You should take the other.

15
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,234
I'll take this.

16
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,392
May I help you?

17
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,877
- Good morning.
- Hi, Matteo.

18
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,710
Hello. Need maid?

19
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,115
- Where are you from?
- Ukraine.

20
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,832
- We don't need anyone.
- Ah.

21
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,031
- If you hear anything...
- Stop now and then and we'll see.

22
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,952
Many thanks.

23
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,034
Thanks.

24
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,029
What can you do?

25
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:24,357
Everything:
Clean, cook, wash, doing...

26
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,197
- Doing ironing.
- Are you ill? Hungry?

27
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,517
No, just need work.

28
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,558
- If you help me, I'll give 20%.
- Who do you take me for?

29
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,876
Better, 30, alright?
I'll give you 30%.

30
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,191
What people these days!

31
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,069
Madame?

32
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,635
Come back through again.

33
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,356
- Sorry.
- Here you are.

34
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,437
Really love strawberries!

35
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,349
- A document, please.
- Yes.

36
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,277
- Give me yourbag.
- Here.

37
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,598
- Irena Yaru...
- Yaroshenko, Irena Yaroshenko.

38
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,996
- This is okay.
- We're sorry, but we must...

39
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,999
What's this?

40
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,512
My savings.

41
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,918
- It goes off, don't know what to do.
- Must be broken.

42
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,076
Our apologies, Madame,
this can happen.

43
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,955
Nello, where are you going?

44
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,834
Are you thirsty?

45
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,637
I know you need ajob,
if you're interested I'm leaving.

46
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,195
- Thanks, but I found one.
- Great!

47
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,393
- I can see for a friend.
- If you want.

48
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,989
- I just got my degree, I'll work
in a lawyer's office. - Congratulations!

49
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,634
You're lucky,
all jewelers here in Velarchi

50
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,229
don't usually take foreigners
into theirhomes.

51
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,238
Gina, would you do it
forthat trifle?

52
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,955
Never! Besides
that stairway's a pigsty.

53
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,594
Okay, I get you!

54
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,789
Excellentjob!

55
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,474
- When do I come?
- Tuesdays and Saturdays.

56
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,673
30 euros a day, 60 a week.

57
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:59,115
- So I give you 40 a week.
- Alright.

58
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,755
- What deposit to open the account?
- 8,000.

59
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,592
I heard you're looking forwork.

60
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,359
My motherneeds help.
Are you interested?

61
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,396
I have full week.

62
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,114
- I can see for a friend.
- Thank you.

63
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,310
Did you polish
the fourth floor doors and name plates?

64
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,233
I shouldn't?

65
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,317
It wasn't yourjob.

66
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,916
But since you work miracles,
you're forgiven.

67
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,030
Thank you and if you need me...

68
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,917
- Gina, Tea's out of vitamins.
- I know, I'll get some.

69
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,915
- Have a good day.
- Bye, Madame.

70
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,876
Stairs, stairs, stairs...

71
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,595
- The elevatorworks.
- Makes me feel panicky.

72
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,518
I can't breathe,
so stairs, stairs...

73
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,597
I live on staircases!

74
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,876
There's another small job.

75
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,674
An apartment's been painted,
needs cleaning, organizing.

76
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,876
- Where?
- Third floor, apt. 6.

77
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,194
- How much should I ask?
- More you ask, the betterforus both.

78
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,228
Alright, so we'll see you on Monday.

79
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,354
Listen...

80
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,279
- Have a good meal.
- Thanks.

81
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,957
I can't stand her silence!

82
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,271
Only talks to her daughter,
she's a grouch with others.

83
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,754
How can she nevertalk?

84
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,071
- Must have problems.
- No shortage there.

85
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,354
- What does Mr. Donato do?
- They have ajeweler's lab.

86
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,469
He's director, she designs and engraves.
She's good, but no company.

87
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,878
If you like, we could go out.

88
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,110
I'm free only
Thursday afternoons and Sundays.

89
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,679
Why not?
Although I know nothing about you...

90
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,629
What's all that ruckus?

91
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,749
It's Valeria.

92
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,509
- Why not work in the outside lab?
- She's separated.

93
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,235
Not all who separate
set up labs in theirhomes!

94
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,910
Before too, what fighting!

95
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,033
There was peace only
when they went to the country.

96
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,835
She did herwhole pregnancy there.

97
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,189
Hello?

98
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,710
Yeah... Me too...

99
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,633
I can't talk right now.
Can I call you back?

100
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,035
Talk to you later.

101
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,996
Stop, thief!

102
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,117
Stop, thief!

103
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,790
Thief!

104
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,994
Be right back.

105
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,952
37!

106
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,197
39!

107
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,639
May I help you?

108
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,359
40!

109
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,395
41!

110
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,989
- Actually I said 8 mm.
- 42!

111
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,475
- 42! Where's 42?
- Me!

112
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,669
- Duplicates of all three
plus the remote. - Alright.

113
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,678
Make a copy of everything.

114
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,792
- Something wrong?
- No.

115
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,438
Meantime, can I pay?

116
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,708
- 60 euros...
- That man's first. - Sorry.

117
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,789
There.

118
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,913
- The short one is out.
I don't have this one. - Are you sure?

119
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,155
It's been ordered.

120
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,791
You'll get me fired.

121
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,592
Wait, maybe there's a way.

122
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,755
- Feeling ill?
- I'm betternow.

123
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,556
I don't like
going to the movies alone.

124
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,309
- Why not go with the girl?
- She wants just cartoons!

125
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,590
Maybe she's too young.

126
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,676
She'll be 4 on Sunday.

127
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,394
If I give her a savings account?

128
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,398
- Bank accounts earn nothing.
- No, that's not the purpose.

129
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,632
Every month
I'll deposit what I can set aside...

130
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,036
...so when she's 18
she'll have a nest egg.

131
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,832
- Like some?
- Yes.

132
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,837
She'll know best
how to make the most of it.

133
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,312
Sorry, what a mess!
I'm sorry!

134
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,669
Don't worry...

135
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,950
That's a future day.

136
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,995
She'll have a nice sum.

137
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,317
Sounds like a good gift.
She'll like it.

138
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,072
Won't breathe a word, I swear!

139
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,395
You'll end up bad, believe me!

140
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,918
It's 3 years now you've been looking
and looking... What for?

141
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,199
Questions right and left...
You're sick!

142
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,874
Just look at that!

143
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,957
Madame, this is Matteo.
Nothing serious...

144
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,754
...you forgot to set the alarm.

145
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,158
Yes, all's okay.
It gave me a scare!

146
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,950
Yes, I'll set it.

147
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,990
Can a real dream exist
among so many nightmares?

148
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:57,316
I'm real! Feel me?

149
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,591
It's me, Nello,
flesh, bones, skin, nerves.

150
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,750
Nightmares can be forgotten.

151
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,075
Trust me, I'll take you away
from all that mess.

152
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,192
Rasaniza.

153
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,389
What?

154
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,792
- Kra-sa-vi-ca!
- Krasavica.

155
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,430
Maybe someday
I can forget my nightmares.

156
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,069
They're mine, it's easier,
but you?

157
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,474
Meaning? Talk plain.

158
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,511
Not enough money.

159
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,154
Now that I finished apt. 6,
you have to help me.

160
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,719
Be patient.

161
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,151
- Hello.
- Hi, Matteo.

162
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,755
How many jewelers
work in theirhomes here?

163
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,554
Except the third floor, all of them.

164
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,953
Don't they need someone to help
around the house...

165
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,759
...or substitute old housekeepers?

166
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,595
It's not easy
and for a foreignerit's even worse.

167
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,757
They all have trusted help.

168
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,752
- Morning!
- Morning!

169
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:13,838
Yourfriend Gina's been there forever,
she'll neverbe sent away.

170
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,754
Stairs, stairs, stairs, stairs...

171
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,355
Hello, Gina!
How did the party go?

172
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,391
Well, just like
every child's birthday:

173
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,352
...the more kids have fun,
the more adults think of old age.

174
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,799
Did she like the gift?

175
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:32,471
- Hermotherwas astonished.
- And the girl?

176
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,192
She didn't understand it.

177
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,595
Taken with hernew toys...

178
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,837
But no matter,
one day she'll realize.

179
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,668
- She got anotherbump on the head.
- What?

180
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,596
She has a rare disease
inhibiting her defense mechanisms.

181
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,110
She's always bruised.

182
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,710
If something falls on her,
she doesn't protect herself.

183
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,435
If she falls,
she doesn't stop herself.

184
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,317
- There must be some cure.
- Doctors say there isn't.

185
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,116
She just has to be careful.
There's worse.

186
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,791
- I have to go now.
- See you later. - Bye.

187
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,150
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

188
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,711
Yes, she'll do fine.

189
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,719
You're Irena?

190
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,989
Yes.

191
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,759
- Sojourner's permit?
- All in order.

192
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,679
- 32... Are you married, children?
- Married, no children.

193
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,715
- Yourhusband?
- He works in Ukraine.

194
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,917
- Can you cook?
- Yes.

195
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,070
What, for example?

196
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,910
Cutlets, pasta with pesto,
spaghetti Bottarga style...

197
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,032
...fruit pies of all kinds.
- How strange.

198
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,308
- Don't you like pies?
- No, the contrary!

199
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,949
- Do you have experience
with small children? - Yes.

200
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,474
- Have you taken care of them often?
- Very often.

201
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,399
You sound perfect!

202
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:38,396
Gina and the porter
have spoken very highly of you.

203
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,550
Let's do a trial period,
then we'll see.

204
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,030
- When do you want me to start?
- Is Monday alright?

205
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,317
Perfect, thank you.

206
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,313
- Ah! One very important thing!
- Yes.

207
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,595
- Can you drive?
- Absolutely!

208
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,835
- Is this okay?
- Better.

209
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,708
- Now into second.
- Yes.

210
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,636
- Did we have to come here?
- Not a soul yesterday.

211
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,159
Turn at the roundabout.

212
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,475
Just go away!

213
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,154
Careful! Want an accident?

214
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,910
I like you! You and me
will do great things together.

215
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,591
So I want a stage name foryou.

216
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,833
Something special.

217
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,548
Giorgia.

218
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,152
Giorgia,
like the song.

219
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,556
#Giorgia, Giorgia. #

220
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,153
Like it?

221
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:01,759
Untie me, even just one hand,
and I'll answer.

222
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,509
You've got great eyes.

223
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,069
Hello?

224
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,520
Hello?
Who is it? Hello?

225
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,428
This is the laundry room.
Sorry forthe mess...

226
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,149
The washerleaks when it spin-dries.

227
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,351
I have to get it fixed.

228
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,958
There's a small problem
with the hood.

229
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,629
When you turn it on from here,
you have to hit it orit won't start.

230
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,796
- Where do I turn off the gas?
- Oh, yeah, sure...

231
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,829
Forthe first weeks...

232
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,236
...can you work on Thursdays too?
- Of course.

233
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,829
Do I change the sheets here
every week too?

234
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:59,430
No, this was Gina's room,
no one sleeps there now.

235
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,909
I work here.

236
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,552
Forno reason whatever
you set foot in here...

237
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,477
...ortouch anything in my absence.

238
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,672
- Even to wash the floor?
- Nothing at all. - Fine.

239
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,829
Slowly!

240
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,515
It's nothing, sweetie.

241
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,438
- You're bad!
- It wasn't on purpose. - I'm sorry.

242
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,471
It's nothing, sweetheart.

243
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,511
I didn't see her...

244
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,559
I neverwant to see her again,
dumbbell!

245
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,468
You got knocked up!
I told you to be careful.

246
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,635
You're all the same!

247
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,639
You said to excite him
even without...

248
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,713
You dirtied my shirt,
you'll pay forit!

249
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,597
The tangler does the untangling.

250
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:02,151
- Madame, excuse me.
- Come in.

251
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,988
The collar of this blouse
is ruined, what do I do?

252
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,911
What can you do? Throw it out.
Too bad, it looked nice on me.

253
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,515
I can turn it around.

254
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,873
- You can do that too?
- It's not hard.

255
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,638
- Hi.
- Hi.

256
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,353
Wait, let me finish
the link on this bracelet.

257
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,118
Irena, the new maid.

258
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,352
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening. Alright.

259
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,278
Daddy! Daddy!

260
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:38,474
- Did you bring me the castle?
- Forgive me, I forgot.

261
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:46,271
- Leave the room, please,
go to the child. - Immediately.

262
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,192
Tea, want a snack?

263
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,674
Tea?

264
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,076
I want to know why!

265
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,872
That's no way to talk!

266
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,797
It is!
I don't recognize anything here!

267
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,949
Loweryourvoice!

268
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,389
What, lowermy voice? Whore!

269
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,715
- How dare you?
- How dare I?

270
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,399
I know you've got
your own friggin' stuff.

271
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,749
Oh, just stop it, please!

272
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,954
Hi, Tea!

273
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:45,758
Are you sorry to see me?
Mommy couldn't come.

274
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,154
Let's go.

275
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,398
You're right, I was a dumbbell.
How can I set things right?

276
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:06,152
- You tricked my mother.
- How?

277
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,990
You can't drive, I'll tell her.

278
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,994
Good, so you'll be rid of me...

279
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,798
...but it's not my fault
you don't know how to fall.

280
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:23,670
I'll tell heryou peek
when she argues with yourfather...

281
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,553
...then you hide and cry.

282
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:30,837
- Hi, Mommy!
- Hello, sweetheart!

283
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,833
How are you?
How did it go?

284
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,279
- Fine.
- Good girl!

285
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,677
Now go with Irena...

286
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,431
...l'm doing urgent work.
See you later.

287
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,557
- Go look in yourroom.
- Why? - Go!

288
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,274
Wow! The princess castle!

289
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:05,238
- Thank you.
- Yourfatherbrought it.

290
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,714
Did you call Daddy?

291
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,713
Sure, I'm not like you
who never calls him.

292
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,793
Irena, the spin-dry!

293
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,955
- So now you can dial Daddy's number!
Good girl! - Yes.

294
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,837
Do you fancy going to the pool
forthe swimming lessons?

295
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,558
Yeah, but I'd rather...

296
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,433
Hello?

297
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,313
One rag's not enough!

298
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,836
- Alright, it's all in order.
- Orthere'll be a lake.

299
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,513
Did you get the pail?

300
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,478
- Did much waterleak?
- None.

301
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,873
- Is this a miracle?
- I changed the rubber...

302
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,915
You're fantastic,
the end of a nightmare!

303
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:09,433
If that's all, I'll clean up
the kitchen and leave.

304
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,039
No, wait.

305
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,029
Yourrelationship
with Tea is betternow.

306
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,357
Could you stay with her
until around midnight?

307
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,750
- Please go, I have no schedule.
- Good.

308
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,478
I know it was you.

309
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,637
- What?
- The present.

310
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,397
Why didn't you tell me?

311
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,395
I thought you'd be happier
to think it was from yourfather.

312
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,718
You changed hair colorthree times...

313
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:08,075
...black when you were born,
then red and, at one year, brown.

314
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,712
Your eyes, black, green, brown!
My goodness!

315
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,711
Know any lullabies?

316
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:25,118
- Lullabies... Yes, one.
- Sing it to me!

317
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,998
- Hiya! Hiya!
- Hello!

318
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:51,070
- You even organized the store room!
- I emptied it because it was flooded.

319
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:54,357
- It's all to throw out.
- Not my things!

320
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,118
Rememberthese?

321
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,749
- It's beautiful!
- It's unrecognizable.

322
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,949
How fantastic!

323
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,275
How did you do it in three days?
It's perfect!

324
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,195
Irena, the towels!

325
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,158
I washed everything,
there was no time.

326
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,074
It's chilly! Thanks.

327
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,674
My compliments, Madame.

328
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,870
May I say,
you have a young girl's body.

329
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,831
That's foolishness!

330
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,428
- Donato, you'll make herfall.
- Yessir, Colonel!

331
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,592
I'm happy you and yourhusband...

332
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,275
Even Tea is much more relaxed.

333
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,797
Rub some cream on my back, please.

334
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,195
Thanks.

335
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,510
We're silly, I formalize with you
and you with me...

336
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,837
Why don't we simply stop it?

337
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,598
As you wish, Madame.

338
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,229
That wasn't a compliment earlier,
you do have a nice body.

339
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,554
Doesn't seem you've everhad a baby.

340
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,634
Tea, careful!

341
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,838
- Don't run like that!
- Don't terrorize her.

342
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,639
If she falls, she'll get up!

343
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,319
We're keeping her
from always getting hurt.

344
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,679
Leave herfree to move.

345
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,115
Isn't there a cure?

346
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,794
She's not ill,
get it in yourheads!

347
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,469
Tea...

348
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,638
Irena, what's yourhusband like?

349
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,436
- My husband?
- You nevertalk about him.

350
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,797
Daddy! Hi!

351
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,155
Drop me at the bus stop.

352
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,668
- We'll take you home.
- Don't bother.

353
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,592
So we can see where you live.

354
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,637
Anothertime, I'll just walk.

355
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,714
Bye-bye!

356
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,198
Oh, come on!

357
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,992
Irena, wait!

358
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:37,237
I'll come with you,
so we can talk.

359
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,151
- Something wrong?
- No, nothing.

360
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:44,150
It was really tough
convincing them to take you...

361
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,358
...many had betterrequisites.

362
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,829
I see, our deal's no good anymore?

363
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:55,153
No, I just thought
you might be a little nicerto me.

364
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,629
Let me help you.
Live around here?

365
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,158
Listen, Matteo:

366
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:06,478
...as of today I'll give you
50% of my salary. Alright?

367
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:10,518
But stay away from me.
Thanks.

368
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,270
I have something important to ask.

369
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,197
Are you up to staying
a week alone with Tea?

370
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:43,552
Before Christmas
I need some time alone.

371
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,910
- You owe me no explanations, alright.
- Good.

372
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,831
You'll have special payment,
of course.

373
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,876
I'll leave you an amount
forthe food shopping.

374
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,514
For any otherneeds
call Mr. Donato at the lab.

375
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,631
- Alright.
- Wait a moment. - Yes.

376
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:01,754
- You can call me at any time.
- It'll be fine.

377
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,234
I'm worried about Tea,
neverlet her out of your sight.

378
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:10,159
Maybe it's betterif she doesn't go
to school. What do you think?

379
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,278
I don't think so,
too many changes...

380
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,918
Is Friday the last day before vacation,
orSaturday? No, Friday.

381
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,273
Don't tell her anything,
she'll ask too many questions.

382
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,950
- One last thing...
- Yes?

383
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,270
It's been a long time
since I went to Villa Robinia.

384
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,597
I'll do it, you try to be happy.

385
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,311
- What did you do?
- Me? Nothing.

386
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,838
Here you are!
I didn't know where else to look.

387
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:54,556
- I told you I would come to class
forher. - She ran off.

388
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,393
I understand that,
it's the rest I don't understand!

389
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,559
They pushed me down the stairs.

390
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:05,075
If this happens again,
you'll be in serious trouble.

391
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,395
- Still hurt?
- Yes.

392
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:13,153
The next time you have to react,
beat them up.

393
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:16,119
What about the story
of the cheek?

394
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,510
If someone slaps you,
they can slap the other cheek too.

395
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,273
That's what the ones
who start the fights say.

396
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:26,798
You must defend yourself,
and protect yourself when you fall.

397
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,395
How?

398
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,993
- If you want to know, you must do
everything I say. - I accept.

399
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,199
Let's shake.

400
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,797
We should celebrate.

401
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,552
- I bet you like strawberries.
- You win!

402
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,154
I knew it.

403
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,672
The pediatrician says I can't eat them.
You won't tell my mother?

404
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,748
I'd betray ourpact.
I keep secrets.

405
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,551
- Hurt you?
- No.

406
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:06,559
- Is this the game of salami?
- Sort of.

407
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:12,949
Get up.

408
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,759
I'll help you.

409
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,395
Good girl!

410
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,199
Up you go!

411
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:26,869
Come on.

412
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,315
By yourself!

413
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,997
Now alone.

414
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,717
Come on, up!

415
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,037
Come on, Tea! Get up!

416
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,232
Good girl. Get up.

417
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,995
- Good.
- I did it, now stop!

418
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:57,759
Get up by yourself!

419
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,197
Up you go!

420
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,788
- You're bad!
- By yourself!

421
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,114
Get up!

422
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:11,355
Again! Get up!
Come on, get up!

423
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,554
Come on, Tea! Come on!

424
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:17,155
- I'll tell my mother, I'll get you fired.
- Will you get me fired?

425
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,997
- Who'll you get fired?
- You're horrible!

426
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,389
You're bad!

427
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,716
- Again!
- You're bad!

428
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,637
Again! Again!

429
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:32,192
- Get up! Get up!
- Stop, please!

430
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,349
- Again!
- Stop it!

431
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:38,753
Get up, come on!
Again! Get up!

432
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,189
Whore! Whore! Whore!

433
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:05,910
Good girl!
See, you can do it?

434
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,235
Why didn't you slap me before?

435
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:11,636
Why didn't you do it before?
You're good, understand?

436
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,319
Come with me.

437
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,190
Tell Mrs. Adacher
she's one payment in arrears.

438
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,231
- I've just paid.
- Oh, sorry.

439
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,239
Here we are.

440
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:39,638
Here's the nicest guest
at Villa Robinia.

441
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,077
Gina, do you recognize me?

442
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,074
It's useless.
If it's not cold...

443
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,272
...she can go out for some air.
It'll do her good.

444
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:04,036
I'm sorry.
I know you'll neverforgive me...

445
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:10,638
...but if I didn't go my way
I'd have died myself.

446
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,034
Understand?

447
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,554
I'll repay you somehow.

448
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:29,235
That's small for a large branch,
put it higher.

449
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:31,316
Sure, Madame President.

450
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,911
Put the star on top.

451
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,635
- Mr. Donato, staying for dinner?
- Well, Madame President?

452
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,434
It won't hurt you
to spend an evening with me.

453
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:46,552
- Want to eat with us?
- I don't think so.

454
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,352
- Daddy, you tell hertoo.
- Don't be a pest.

455
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,279
If I'm the president,
why do you always decide?

456
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,198
Irena, please...

457
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,109
Who taught you to cook so well?

458
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:15,998
No one, I've read lots of recipes.

459
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,309
- I'm still hungry!
- He's hungry!

460
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:55,415
- Now I need 3 kids!
- Me, me!

461
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:58,054
You, you and you!

462
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:00,938
- No, Tea!
- Let her go.

463
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:05,292
Let's help him digest, jump!

464
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:30,571
What a stink!

465
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:47,575
Mommy!

466
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,299
Get up.

467
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:20,254
Get up.

468
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:26,849
Up!

469
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:33,691
It's useless, leave me alone.

470
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:43,774
- Slap me, punch me!
- Please, stop!

471
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:52,095
I'll do everything,
but I want to go out.

472
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:54,691
I can never do it.

473
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:13,498
It's ages since he worked.

474
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:17,010
- Didn't even get his money.
- Where can I look?

475
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:20,013
Who knows?

476
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:34,610
A picture with Santa Claus?
Come on!

477
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:38,136
Smile.
Get closerto Mommy.

478
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:41,770
- But really she's...
- What is it? - Nothing.

479
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:44,169
- Keep still...
- Smile...

480
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:46,176
A nice smile... Done!

481
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:48,259
Hi, sweetie!

482
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:53,450
How are you?
You're so elegant!

483
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:56,852
- Merry Christmas, Madame.
- Thanks, Matteo. - Goodbye.

484
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:58,259
Let me see you.

485
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:03,816
- What's this here?
- Nothing.

486
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:06,016
- What did you do to your arm?
- Nothing.

487
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:07,613
Irena, what happened?

488
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:10,614
It was the rope on the swings...

489
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:13,413
...you know me.
- Yes, honey.

490
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:20,535
- What do I fix?
- I forgot, we're dining out.

491
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:24,335
Thanks, Irena. If you're done,
you can go, we'll talk tomorrow.

492
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:27,732
- Alright. Have a good evening.
- Thanks.

493
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:31,017
- Who'll you eat with tonight?
- With friends.

494
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:35,538
Why don't you everlet me
meet yourfriends?

495
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:38,451
I don't think you'd have any fun.

496
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:42,778
- See you tomorrow?
- Why shouldn't we?

497
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:46,095
Everything is back the way it was.

498
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,856
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

499
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:04,889
Merry Christmas!

500
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:39,889
Who is it?

501
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:44,333
Holy Christ! What happened to you?

502
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:49,531
Come inside.

503
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:52,769
You won't go to the hospital,
orthe police...

504
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:54,449
Sorry.

505
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:57,334
You've got yourself
into some dirty business.

506
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:00,732
Let me stay here a few days.

507
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:05,777
- Want to get me in trouble too?
- Only if you don't help me.

508
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:10,855
I'm sorry,
before daylight you're gone.

509
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:12,939
And forever, hearme?

510
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:17,292
First though, I want to say goodbye
to all the tenants.

511
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:19,770
Just so you get out.

512
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:22,693
So I can tell them
the tale of the dust of gold.

513
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:29,011
What are you?

514
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:32,373
They should've beaten you harder!

515
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:46,899
Come on in.

516
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:50,814
- Like it?
- Day and night in here?

517
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:53,452
Honey, it's foryour own good.

518
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:56,060
Lucrezia will see you get fresh air.

519
01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:57,573
Italian cooking.

520
01:00:57,780 --> 01:01:00,169
- Here.
- Forme? - Mh.

521
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:06,011
- How did you know I love red ones?
- I watch you, study you.

522
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:08,734
Sometimes I have a heavy hand...

523
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,132
...but you're special to me.

524
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:15,130
You have to do me a favor,
I've got a few friends...

525
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:17,735
- But I...
- They're a little peculiar.

526
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:21,375
Then absolute rest,
right to the last week.

527
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:23,457
Who's first?

528
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:36,898
I brought you the medicine...
and some chocolate.

529
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:39,333
Tell Mrs. Adacher...

530
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:42,577
...that I have the flu
and I can't work for a while.

531
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:43,649
Alright.

532
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:56,692
Merry Christmas!

533
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:00,009
Merry Christmas!

534
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:01,652
Hurry!

535
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:28,338
- Not even once?
- No, I always aborted.

536
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:32,139
You mustn't care much foryourself.

537
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:35,252
Too bad, at your age...

538
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:41,058
- What do you mean?
- You can no longerhave children.

539
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:00,778
Excuse me.
Does this go to Velarchi?

540
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:03,015
- Yes, Madame.
- Good.

541
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:18,650
All I know is you have to be careful,
there are too many rumors.

542
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:22,215
The men aren't having fun anymore,
they say you always cry.

543
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:25,570
The winds have changed, Giorgia,
coveryourback.

544
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:29,578
"Mold" is kind and sweet,
but when he doesn't need you...

545
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:32,094
What more could he do?
Get rid of me?

546
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:34,296
We each make of ourlives
what we choose.

547
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:38,458
Don't deny the condemned a last wish.
Give me that name.

548
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:53,374
It's me, it wouldn't open.

549
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:57,292
She's been looking foryou all day.

550
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:00,168
- Need any help?
- No, thanks. - Do you need any doctor?

551
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:03,372
- How's Tea? - You won't believe it,
but she has a fevertoo.

552
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:05,697
She's here, I'll put her on.

553
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:10,690
- Hi.
- What an awful voice!

554
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:15,616
- See, I'm sick like you?
When are you coming back? - Soon.

555
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:21,816
- Why don't you come now? Bundle up.
- I can't, honey.

556
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:27,490
Sing me that song
that I can't understand...

557
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:31,172
...but that makes me sleep so much.
- Alright.

558
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:34,174
- Are you underthe covers?
- Yes.

559
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:08,338
- You're happy this evening.
- Happens.

560
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:11,459
Two guys came asking foryou today.

561
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:15,652
- I said you don't work here anymore.
- Good.

562
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:17,255
There's anotherthing.

563
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:19,848
The family is looking for a new maid.

564
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:22,775
You should cut out.

565
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,572
I've warned you.

566
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:32,530
I feel I'm in a place
where you walk and walk...

567
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:37,608
...but you're always in the same spot.
You can't find the exit, if there is one.

568
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:41,416
Every step you take is a mistake.

569
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:46,015
I've made lots of mistakes...

570
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:48,934
...a lifetime isn't long enough
to pay forthem all.

571
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:53,849
But believing that someone like me...

572
01:06:53,940 --> 01:07:00,129
...could still have a future
was my biggest mistake.

573
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:06,933
That's the reason I should die,
not forthat animal.

574
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:22,172
This is forNello.

575
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:52,816
I'd do it again, I have no remorse,
just fear...

576
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:56,330
...because I thought
I'd settled accounts with my past.

577
01:08:57,460 --> 01:09:00,657
But I guess the past
hasn't settled accounts with me.

578
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:05,451
I've tired you enough fortoday.

579
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:32,579
Thank you, bye.

580
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:36,494
Irena!

581
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:38,494
Hello.

582
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:43,455
- I see you're healed.
- I'm better.

583
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:47,413
This morning's my first time out,
I'd have called this afternoon.

584
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:51,339
How are you?

585
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:54,415
What did you do to yourface?

586
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:57,815
Thinking so much about you,
I fell too.

587
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:08,455
- Have you found a new maid?
- What are yourintentions?

588
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:16,215
- There have been some robberies
in the condominium. - Really?

589
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:19,812
It would be best
if you give me back the keys.

590
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:24,493
- It's foryour own good.
- Of course!

591
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:28,532
- I'm always home, I'll open to you.
- Sure.

592
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:38,497
Want something to drink?

593
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:42,619
Kids, Tea, are you thirsty?

594
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:47,329
I got you a new cartoon.

595
01:10:50,540 --> 01:10:53,054
Can't you see we're playing?
Leave us alone!

596
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:12,613
Why do you treat me so badly?

597
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:15,336
Teach me hide-and-seek.

598
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:20,213
1, 2, 3...

599
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:23,612
...4, 5, 6...

600
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:28,572
...7, 8, 9, 10!

601
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:33,493
Where are you hiding?

602
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:37,496
Where's Tea?

603
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:03,253
Tea, come out!

604
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:07,854
Tea!

605
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:11,769
Tea!

606
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:14,654
Tea!

607
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:34,894
What happened? What's wrong?
Calm down!

608
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:36,849
What's wrong?

609
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:39,052
What happened?

610
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:42,177
They've kidnapped the child.

611
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:44,379
Who?

612
01:12:44,980 --> 01:12:47,369
What are you saying?
Where were you?

613
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:50,850
Answerme!

614
01:12:54,380 --> 01:12:57,099
I won, you couldn't find me!

615
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:04,693
I'm sorry.

616
01:13:08,020 --> 01:13:11,899
- It's over.
- Can I help you?

617
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:20,059
Convince yourmother
to let me stay here tonight.

618
01:13:20,140 --> 01:13:24,258
- You scared of the newspaperman?
- Just to stay with you.

619
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:27,532
Okay, but if she says yes,
can we make peace?

620
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:30,928
We've already made peace, my love.

621
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:38,172
- Hurry, we're late!
- Don't run!

622
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:50,895
Now how do we get to school?

623
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:58,893
You got yourself fired.
I'd have bet.

624
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:01,694
It's been bad news
since you set foot here.

625
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:03,810
Let me stay a few more days.

626
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:06,215
Where do I put you?
It's all flooded downstairs.

627
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:11,135
And I want no trouble,
you're too dangerous.

628
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:15,818
- You're ungrateful.
- I always respected ourpacts.

629
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:18,215
The money? I'll give it back.

630
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:23,136
You neverunderstood,
I love you.

631
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:26,929
The two of us will go far.

632
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:32,379
Already decided
how you'll have me killed?

633
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:35,970
What? You know
I always liked you.

634
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:40,131
Too bad you've become
a little bizarre.

635
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:42,979
Who knows where
we might have wound up!

636
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:48,172
Right where we are now...
the end.

637
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:51,573
- There's still some time.
- Then let's drink.

638
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:55,139
If it's the last time,
I want to get drunk with you.

639
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:19,728
Why do they call you Mold?

640
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:25,129
Here.

641
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:27,737
Take yourhands off me.

642
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:30,849
Sorry.

643
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:38,050
Want me to talk to Mrs. Adacher?
She'll have you back.

644
01:15:40,580 --> 01:15:43,572
I'm too old foryou.
What are you doing?

645
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:46,575
Don't be afraid.

646
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:55,415
- Give a kiss to Daddy.
- Bye-bye.

647
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:07,135
Hi!

648
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:13,416
- How are you?
- I tried, but she's angry, afraid.

649
01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:15,537
- Of what?
- Of you.

650
01:16:18,460 --> 01:16:21,054
- What did you do to my mother?
- Nothing.

651
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:24,449
Aren't you hiding
something from me too?

652
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:29,577
I love you,
I'd do anything foryou.

653
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:31,259
Tea...

654
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:34,059
Thank you.

655
01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:36,852
- Hello.
- Hello.

656
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:38,893
I was just saying hello.

657
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:42,098
- Please...
- I understand.

658
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:45,975
She wants to come back,
but Mommy said no.

659
01:16:48,380 --> 01:16:50,769
You need patience,
that's how my wife is.

660
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:53,295
She'll get overit.

661
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:57,614
It's small,
but brought me so much luck...

662
01:17:57,700 --> 01:18:01,215
I prepared my exams here
and wrote my thesis.

663
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:04,969
The rent's low, so I kept it.
Be great if you took it!

664
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:08,211
- Where do those stairs go?
- A service exit.

665
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:06,094
Shut up!

666
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:12,133
Think it'd be easy
to kill a guy like me?

667
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:15,332
Afew scissor stabs and bye-bye,
like the movies?

668
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:17,650
We can't all be good like you.

669
01:19:26,180 --> 01:19:28,978
Since you ran away,
I've had time...

670
01:19:29,260 --> 01:19:31,376
...to think how to get rid of you.

671
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:34,691
Now, I've got a couple of ideas
how to kill you.

672
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:38,770
- Pick the one you like best
and get it overwith. - In time!

673
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:53,929
I'm more generous than you, Giorgia.

674
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:57,890
If you answerme, I give my word
I'll leave you in peace.

675
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:04,213
- Where's the money?
- What money? I don't know anything.

676
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:13,255
Go! Go!

677
01:20:21,460 --> 01:20:22,973
Don't come in!

678
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:25,449
Please.

679
01:21:33,860 --> 01:21:37,853
I should have known who you were,
that it was blackmail.

680
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:41,574
How much do you want?

681
01:21:43,780 --> 01:21:45,577
I don't want anything.

682
01:21:45,780 --> 01:21:48,977
What are you after?
Friendship and comprehension?

683
01:21:57,180 --> 01:21:58,772
Get this in yourhead...

684
01:21:58,820 --> 01:22:01,414
...l'll neverlet you steal
my daughterfrom me.

685
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:04,937
- Your daughter?
- Yes, she's my daughter.

686
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:12,251
Resign yourself, it's all legal.
You can't do anything.

687
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:16,649
I'm hermotherby all legal rights.

688
01:22:19,420 --> 01:22:20,614
Say an amount.

689
01:22:23,620 --> 01:22:25,690
I don't want
anything from you, Madame.

690
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:29,695
Then leave my daughter alone.

691
01:22:35,740 --> 01:22:38,652
Never show yourface here again!

692
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:58,575
Give back the keys to the car.

693
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:15,494
And these?

694
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:18,139
The house keys.

695
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:22,258
You're a terrible thief too.
You gave them to me already.

696
01:23:26,860 --> 01:23:28,578
Who's the newspaperman?

697
01:23:30,780 --> 01:23:32,293
Go away, Madame.

698
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:41,090
Get lost oryou'll be sorry,
you and whoever's behind you!

699
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:56,415
You're in overyourhead.

700
01:23:56,900 --> 01:24:00,290
You've no idea the money
we could've made on this.

701
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:04,094
- Don't you dare, she's not in this.
- But she's dangerous.

702
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:08,376
Cough up the dough!
One week, oryou're done for!

703
01:24:09,220 --> 01:24:12,974
I know you,
you'll get rid of me anyway.

704
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:16,297
Believe me, sweetheart,
you'd be better off.

705
01:24:19,660 --> 01:24:21,935
I could have done it
lots of times...

706
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:26,378
...but I neverwanted to take her away.

707
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:33,051
I just wanted to be nearher,
that was enough.

708
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:39,454
Watch her grow,
see how she was like herfather.

709
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:45,338
Maybe I should have done
like so many others...

710
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:48,452
...who make a scandal...

711
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:51,368
...and take back what's theirs.

712
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:53,892
Maybe I still could.

713
01:25:13,340 --> 01:25:15,456
Why do you always make me sign?

714
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:20,977
Why do you always make me sign?

715
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:25,458
Hearthat?
It's a few days now.

716
01:25:26,660 --> 01:25:28,378
So she can walk!

717
01:25:29,540 --> 01:25:32,418
It's important she can communicate.

718
01:25:37,420 --> 01:25:40,173
- Do you have an appointment?
- Well, no...

719
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:42,734
...but Mr. Adacherknows me,
I worked forhis wife.

720
01:25:42,780 --> 01:25:45,931
- Look...
- Just 5 minutes, it's urgent.

721
01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:48,699
Alright, I'll see what I can do.

722
01:26:00,900 --> 01:26:02,777
- Are you Irena Yaroshenko?
- Yes.

723
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:06,615
I'm sorry,
but Mr. Adacher can't see you.

724
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:08,019
Has something happened?

725
01:26:24,340 --> 01:26:27,252
Keep going! Again, again!

726
01:26:49,020 --> 01:26:52,092
- Hello, Mr. Adacher.
- Hello.

727
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:55,610
It's good you came,
I'd have looked foryou.

728
01:26:55,740 --> 01:26:58,618
I wanted to come earlier,
but was afraid of disturbing.

729
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:00,292
Don't worry.

730
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:06,129
- How's Tea?
- Not very well.

731
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:09,290
She's jittery,
asks lots of questions...

732
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:13,373
...like, when Valeria will return
from the trip we invented.

733
01:27:13,460 --> 01:27:15,132
Has she missed a lot of school?

734
01:27:15,180 --> 01:27:18,934
She's at my sisters',
but doesn't like being there.

735
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:21,532
She also asks about you.

736
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:26,850
If you like, I could keep her company
a few hours a day...

737
01:27:27,460 --> 01:27:30,896
Actually I wanted to ask you
to return full time.

738
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:34,214
There's a room foryou
in ournew house.

739
01:27:34,260 --> 01:27:37,093
It would make Tea happy.

740
01:28:06,740 --> 01:28:09,777
Giorgia, you really like moving.

741
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:13,179
Those who leave their country
move house a thousand times.

742
01:28:13,220 --> 01:28:15,450
Nice ditty, but cut the bullshit.

743
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:17,374
Where's the money?

744
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:21,418
Who says then you'll let me go?

745
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:25,288
I swore to God
I'd break yourneck...

746
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:27,530
...but if He can turn a blind eye...

747
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:32,014
- Just you and me.
- You never spoke such love.

748
01:28:33,620 --> 01:28:34,609
Too bad.

749
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:44,379
Trust me now?

750
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:55,974
These go in the study,
this needs fixing.

751
01:28:57,900 --> 01:28:58,889
Irena!

752
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:07,614
Hello.

753
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:12,411
- How are you?
- Fine and you?

754
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:15,090
Better, now that I see you.

755
01:29:17,140 --> 01:29:18,937
I'll show you yourroom.

756
01:29:20,420 --> 01:29:23,730
- See how big it is?
- Where's Mommy's room?

757
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:28,938
We'll go later.
How do I arrange yourfurniture?

758
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:33,335
Come on, darling,
we'll invent lots of things.

759
01:29:34,660 --> 01:29:37,732
There's not much to invent,
I want everything like before.

760
01:29:41,380 --> 01:29:43,848
What did you do to yourhands?

761
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:45,409
Irena?

762
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:48,619
It's foryou.

763
01:29:52,140 --> 01:29:54,654
- Are you Irena Yaroshenko?
- Yes.

764
01:29:54,860 --> 01:29:57,135
Come with us to the station.

765
01:29:57,180 --> 01:30:00,570
- Why?
- A communication. - Alright.

766
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:06,294
What's the matter?

767
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:10,499
Nothing!

768
01:30:15,820 --> 01:30:17,014
I'll be right back.

769
01:30:38,660 --> 01:30:41,652
Let me keep this one, please!

770
01:30:42,180 --> 01:30:46,776
What's it to you? I'll work
the whole time, just let me keep it!

771
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:48,458
Leave me alone!

772
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:52,853
Forget it, hearme?

773
01:30:53,980 --> 01:30:55,936
Do you have a license?

774
01:30:56,340 --> 01:30:57,329
Yes.

775
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:22,178
I must have left it home,
but I know the number. RC 3097...

776
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:23,899
...254B.

777
01:31:27,820 --> 01:31:30,095
- Recognize it?
- Yes.

778
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:33,728
And this?

779
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:42,530
How was yourrelationship
with Mrs. Valeria Corsini Adacher?

780
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:43,854
Excellent.

781
01:31:44,540 --> 01:31:46,451
When did you see herlast?

782
01:31:46,580 --> 01:31:48,935
Believe me, I liked her.

783
01:31:49,460 --> 01:31:52,770
But you had violent arguments.
Why?

784
01:31:53,180 --> 01:31:56,695
She wasn't happy with my work,
it happens.

785
01:31:56,740 --> 01:31:59,971
What about yourfingerprints
on the dashboard?

786
01:32:00,180 --> 01:32:03,138
She drove that car everyday.

787
01:32:03,180 --> 01:32:06,058
Counselor, the shoe, the license...

788
01:32:06,180 --> 01:32:08,774
I dropped them.
How's that figure with the accident?

789
01:32:08,900 --> 01:32:10,811
Mrs. Adacher
ran off the road...

790
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:13,050
...because the brakes and the engine
were tampered with.

791
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:15,375
It wasn't an accident,
it's a homicide.

792
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:18,897
I don't even know
where a car's brakes are!

793
01:32:18,980 --> 01:32:21,494
It's obvious
Irena Yaroshenko is innocent.

794
01:32:21,540 --> 01:32:23,735
The evidence is flimsy.

795
01:32:24,620 --> 01:32:25,814
Alright.

796
01:32:34,060 --> 01:32:36,335
What's "alright" mean?

797
01:32:36,620 --> 01:32:38,178
We didn't convince them.

798
01:32:54,100 --> 01:32:55,249
Supervisor!

799
01:33:04,460 --> 01:33:06,530
What place is this?

800
01:33:16,540 --> 01:33:20,010
Five steps from the watering trough,
towards the dog's grave.

801
01:33:20,060 --> 01:33:23,416
- That's where the money is.
- Dog's grave, the trough...

802
01:33:23,460 --> 01:33:25,894
What the hell's this,
a treasure hunt?

803
01:33:25,940 --> 01:33:29,933
- You're close.
- So, you fucker, start digging!

804
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:32,329
Move!

805
01:33:33,340 --> 01:33:39,210
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, there!

806
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:41,218
What can I do with you?

807
01:33:41,820 --> 01:33:43,139
Pick up the shovel!

808
01:33:44,460 --> 01:33:46,337
Yourmother's cunt!

809
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:55,491
He's the guilty one
you're looking for.

810
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:00,699
Believe me now?

811
01:35:01,020 --> 01:35:03,329
Why should he have wanted
to do all this?

812
01:35:07,340 --> 01:35:08,534
To punish me.

813
01:35:09,740 --> 01:35:12,937
Maybe I don't remember,
maybe it's overthere.

814
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:17,253
What do you mean "overthere"?
More this way, more that way...

815
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:20,014
You gotta come up with the money!

816
01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:23,414
Hooker!

817
01:35:33,740 --> 01:35:35,139
He kept us like slaves.

818
01:35:35,180 --> 01:35:37,899
If we didn't bring
the sum he expected...

819
01:35:38,420 --> 01:35:42,208
...he'd hang us naked upside down
and pee on us.

820
01:35:42,740 --> 01:35:44,412
And the gifts?

821
01:35:44,580 --> 01:35:47,333
The times I got pregnant.

822
01:35:48,340 --> 01:35:53,733
It was his way of treating me nice:
Perfume, cell phones, shoes...

823
01:35:54,460 --> 01:35:57,133
And at the end 4 or500 euros.

824
01:35:57,860 --> 01:35:59,373
At the end?

825
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:01,456
When the deal was closed.

826
01:36:01,780 --> 01:36:05,534
Did you know the people
these deals were made with?

827
01:36:05,820 --> 01:36:08,050
No, from the fourth month
I was locked in...

828
01:36:08,140 --> 01:36:10,131
...I didn't see anybody,
he did everything.

829
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:15,337
- Explain that.
- Mold would procure the buyers.

830
01:36:15,660 --> 01:36:21,098
The first time I got pregnant by chance
and he found them at the eighth month.

831
01:36:21,140 --> 01:36:23,096
Afterthat, it was always organized.

832
01:36:23,860 --> 01:36:27,250
- Meaning?
- The buyers chose one of us.

833
01:36:27,660 --> 01:36:30,618
Then, the chosen girl
took no more precautions...

834
01:36:30,700 --> 01:36:34,978
...and got pregnant.
- How many times were you?

835
01:36:35,860 --> 01:36:36,929
Nine.

836
01:36:39,900 --> 01:36:41,618
Nine babies in twelve years.

837
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:47,413
The last one is Tea Adacher.

838
01:36:55,940 --> 01:36:56,929
Push!

839
01:36:59,660 --> 01:37:02,572
Try again, push!

840
01:37:06,700 --> 01:37:10,090
- Good!
- Come on! Good, this way!

841
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:12,137
- Here it comes!
- Here!

842
01:37:13,780 --> 01:37:15,213
Come on, honey!

843
01:37:23,580 --> 01:37:24,808
Good!

844
01:37:28,260 --> 01:37:29,852
Good, you did well!

845
01:37:31,820 --> 01:37:36,018
Show me the baby.
Show me the baby.

846
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:37,408
I'll take it.

847
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:38,899
Show me the baby.

848
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:47,935
Look at it...

849
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:52,209
...and forget it.

850
01:38:17,060 --> 01:38:20,496
How can you be so sure
Tea Adacheris your daughter?

851
01:38:21,180 --> 01:38:24,695
Herbirth date is
three days aftermy delivery.

852
01:38:25,300 --> 01:38:27,973
Usually it takes longer
to registerthem.

853
01:38:28,020 --> 01:38:29,658
That's not sufficient proof.

854
01:38:29,740 --> 01:38:33,210
No one ever saw Mrs. Adacher
during the pregnancy...

855
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:36,178
...there's not one picture of her
with a belly.

856
01:38:36,260 --> 01:38:37,739
Every motherhas one!

857
01:38:38,220 --> 01:38:41,929
Northe analyses you do
when you're expecting.

858
01:38:42,460 --> 01:38:47,409
Absurd, isn't it? Tea doesn't look like
either of herparents.

859
01:38:47,860 --> 01:38:51,853
- In fact she's their adopted daughter.
- What makes you sure?

860
01:38:57,900 --> 01:39:02,178
I saw the adoption certificate,
they kept it in the safe.

861
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:09,090
Tell the judge what yourfeelings were
towards the Adachers.

862
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:15,330
I loved them, they'd given my daughter
the future that I never could have.

863
01:39:15,380 --> 01:39:18,292
How did you find the Adachers?

864
01:39:18,380 --> 01:39:20,450
In Velarchi there are
12 Adacherfamilies...

865
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:23,060
...but they were the only ones
with a child of that age.

866
01:39:23,300 --> 01:39:27,578
How did you discoverthat
the name of the presumed buyers...

867
01:39:28,020 --> 01:39:32,093
...was Adacher?
- The obstetrician told me.

868
01:40:20,820 --> 01:40:24,813
Genna Lucrezia,
do you know Yaroshenko Irena?

869
01:40:24,900 --> 01:40:27,209
They called herGiorgia, right?

870
01:40:28,700 --> 01:40:30,497
Did you tell the judge?

871
01:40:31,740 --> 01:40:33,810
- Yes, I know her.
- Mh.

872
01:40:34,140 --> 01:40:37,496
There's a contradiction
in the statements of you both.

873
01:40:37,540 --> 01:40:41,533
You saw those who chose
and took the children.

874
01:40:41,580 --> 01:40:45,209
I didn't see anyone!
I don't know about any babies.

875
01:40:45,260 --> 01:40:47,820
- You're sick!
- We were at yourhouse...

876
01:40:47,900 --> 01:40:52,576
...you were cooking eggplant,
you said: "Adacher, in Velarchi".

877
01:40:52,660 --> 01:40:57,415
- I can't cook eggplant.
- In your statement you say Adacher.

878
01:40:57,580 --> 01:40:59,536
How did you come to know this name?

879
01:41:00,860 --> 01:41:04,569
She badgered, wanting to know
things I didn't know.

880
01:41:04,780 --> 01:41:08,455
She was unbearable, she wanted me
to convince Mold to talk.

881
01:41:08,860 --> 01:41:11,249
I went one day...

882
01:41:11,980 --> 01:41:14,175
Give that bitch the name!

883
01:41:14,380 --> 01:41:16,769
I don't know the name.

884
01:41:17,820 --> 01:41:20,380
What's the name...

885
01:41:21,100 --> 01:41:22,977
I need an original name.

886
01:41:27,180 --> 01:41:28,169
Adacher.

887
01:41:29,900 --> 01:41:32,050
Say Adacherin Velarchi.

888
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:34,092
So that's what I told you.

889
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:47,609
Can't be,
she just wants revenge.

890
01:42:15,820 --> 01:42:17,139
Oh, gosh!

891
01:42:17,820 --> 01:42:21,859
Your decision to collaborate
was useful...

892
01:42:21,940 --> 01:42:24,898
...but I'm afraid
lots of things can't be overlooked.

893
01:42:25,420 --> 01:42:28,810
I reached my goal,
the rest doesn't matter.

894
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:31,732
You all were great.

895
01:42:33,900 --> 01:42:36,095
I'd like to ask a question...

896
01:42:36,180 --> 01:42:39,536
By now you know all about me.
Go ahead.

897
01:42:40,380 --> 01:42:43,292
Didn't you everthink
about finding your children...

898
01:42:43,540 --> 01:42:47,533
...the others too?
- No, just the last one.

899
01:42:48,540 --> 01:42:51,452
- How come?
- I don't know.

900
01:42:52,860 --> 01:42:55,169
Maybe because I knew
who the fatherwas.

901
01:42:55,780 --> 01:42:59,170
Lately however
I've been thinking of the others too.

902
01:43:00,500 --> 01:43:05,858
All I know's their age,
I make up the rest.

903
01:43:07,300 --> 01:43:12,090
If I hadn't found Tea,
maybe I'd have looked forthem too.

904
01:43:15,180 --> 01:43:16,898
I have something to tell you also.

905
01:43:18,900 --> 01:43:19,889
Go ahead.

906
01:43:21,820 --> 01:43:25,210
The DNA shows
that Tea is not your daughter.

907
01:43:27,060 --> 01:43:30,814
That document was only
a request forfosterage.

908
01:43:31,140 --> 01:43:34,416
You should have noticed
the child's name was missing.

909
01:43:34,820 --> 01:43:36,890
It's a fully legal adoption...

910
01:43:37,260 --> 01:43:39,899
...the natural mother
disappeared after delivery.

911
01:43:41,940 --> 01:43:47,970
The judge has asked me to make you
a very particularproposal.

912
01:43:49,020 --> 01:43:51,488
You've no obligation to say yes.

913
01:44:38,780 --> 01:44:40,850
Sweetie!

914
01:44:44,780 --> 01:44:47,374
Don't you know me?
Are you mad at me?

915
01:44:51,900 --> 01:44:52,889
Forgive me.

916
01:44:57,260 --> 01:45:01,378
I had to go to my country, far away.

917
01:45:02,900 --> 01:45:07,690
You take trips too.
You're not a good nanny...

918
01:45:07,820 --> 01:45:11,096
...before you'd have asked
my mother's permission.

919
01:45:13,300 --> 01:45:15,814
I'm getting old, I forget things.

920
01:45:16,900 --> 01:45:20,688
- Next time ask me.
- Sure, Madame President.

921
01:45:24,780 --> 01:45:25,895
Hey!

922
01:45:27,820 --> 01:45:28,935
What's wrong?

923
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:34,211
I went down, this time
I don't know who to beat up.

924
01:45:35,940 --> 01:45:38,329
Is that why you don't want to eat?

925
01:45:47,220 --> 01:45:50,212
When you fall
and you don't know who pushed you...

926
01:45:50,540 --> 01:45:54,135
...take it out on the first you meet,
but never on yourself.

927
01:45:55,620 --> 01:45:57,929
This time
you didn't bring me a present.

928
01:45:59,660 --> 01:46:04,450
That's true, but I worked
to get you one that's very big.

929
01:46:04,940 --> 01:46:10,492
It's a secret fornow, but in a while
you'll be really surprised.

930
01:46:11,380 --> 01:46:15,089
- How long?
- You'll be a grown, beautiful girl.

931
01:46:17,020 --> 01:46:19,090
Is it possible to wait so long?

932
01:46:20,420 --> 01:46:24,572
Sure, important things
take lots of patience.

933
01:46:25,900 --> 01:46:28,937
So, you have to eat to grow up.

934
01:46:30,740 --> 01:46:34,813
You won't need a nanny
to help you eat...

935
01:46:36,740 --> 01:46:42,770
...to pick your clothes out in the morning.
You'll do everything by yourself.

936
01:46:46,260 --> 01:46:48,455
Are you saying
you won't stay with me?

937
01:46:48,980 --> 01:46:54,179
A maid is neverforever,
sooner orlater she leaves...

938
01:46:56,580 --> 01:46:58,013
...or gets fired.

939
01:47:01,100 --> 01:47:02,897
I haven't fired you.

940
01:47:03,300 --> 01:47:08,215
I know,
but I had to take anotherjob.

941
01:47:12,740 --> 01:47:14,810
Give it up
orfind a way to get fired.

942
01:47:15,940 --> 01:47:19,535
That's hard,
it isn't ajob like the others.

943
01:47:20,460 --> 01:47:24,578
If you hurry and learn to write,
we'll exchange lots of letters.

944
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:29,573
And you'll tell me
how it feels to become a woman.

945
01:47:31,180 --> 01:47:32,579
You should know.

946
01:47:33,900 --> 01:47:36,698
I was too distracted in my life...

947
01:47:38,460 --> 01:47:40,018
