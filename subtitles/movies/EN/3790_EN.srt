 Colo Colo is Chile's most
 popular football club.

 ln the fight against
 the Spanish lnvasion.

00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:19,816
 ln the fight against
 the Spanish lnvasion.

00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:22,986
 Formed ''Garra Blanca''

5
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:27,057
 Formed ''Garra Blanca''

6
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:30,029


7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,997


8
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:34,998

00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:37,302


10
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:40,239

00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,240


12
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:47,644


13
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,882
 Kunta is one ofthe
 founders of Garra Blanca.

14
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:55,018
 Kunta is one ofthe
 founders of Garra Blanca.

15
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:59,256
 He was stabbed 2 weeks ago.
 Today, he goes home.

16
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:21,611
 - Neurosurgery-

17
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:37,461
 What we showed, were
 images taken outside.

18
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,299
 We were not allowed into the
 stadium for the match.

19
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:47,537
 l am the journalist, l am
 who is doing this story.

20
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:52,242
 The topic, in this case, is not...

21
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:55,278
 ... the violence within Garra
 Blanca. lt is not Garra Blanca.

22
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:59,149
 lt is the consequence, for me, that a
 person who wants to follow his team

23
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:03,186
 That for me...
 is the main concern

24
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,990
 That for me...
 is the main concern

25
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:37,087
 Even my head has swollen
 during my stay here.....

26
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,031
 - bye lván
 - bye José

27
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:49,032
 Ok buddy, be well.

28
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:54,271
 Be strong buddy, we
 are bigger than life.

29
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:57,741
 - Take good care of him
 - Thanks.

30
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:03,947
 The pills!, the pills!.

31
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,186
 somebody take the TV set!.

32
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,187
 Will you take it yourself?
 go on, buddy.

33
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,260
 The book?
 The book!

34
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:23,466
 ''Saving Private Kunta''

35
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,771
 To a new reality...

36
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:45,522
 l don't know, l think that...

37
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,558
 l think many things,...

38
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:51,962
 ... what's awaiting me now?.

39
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:55,365
 my mind's blank, l mean...

40
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:15,621
 - ¿uh?

41
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:18,622
 - ¿uh?

42
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:23,159
 - That after 2 weeks
 being on a stretcher and...

43
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:29,332
 ... come out again,
 l don't know, l am scared.

44
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,671
 - But you will go out to be with us.
 - Yes pal, you have to think about it.

45
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,792
 - Savage fight between supporters. -

46
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:06,036
 - Terror after chilean ''Classic'' match. -

47
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:14,878
 - ''Garrero'' left paraplejic... -

48
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:24,621
 What do l tell his family?
 ''Colo Colo coach complains''

49
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,330
 ''l just wanted to
 calm down the fight''

50
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,331
 ''l just wanted to
 calm down the fight''

51
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:43,406
 Kunta is paraplegic now.

52
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:52,882
 We will exterminate
 the ''supporters''

53
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,209
 1, 2, 3...

54
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:36,659
 Wait, the probe, l don't
 know where is it

55
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,965
 ls it below?

56
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:06,156
 l believe that before this l
 didn't care much about myself.

57
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,260
 But now l realize...

58
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,266
 ...that it is important
 to live, l mean...

59
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,267
 ... l believe that l was
 about to die and...

60
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:21,571
 ...if l had died, l had died
 as a martyr for the Garra.

61
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:29,312
 l am alive and l want
 to keep living, l mean

62
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:34,684
 ...l can't give up fighting
 l must be strong and...

63
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:38,721
 l find support in my people.

64
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:42,058
 l mean, l have a small family,

65
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,829
 it's just me and my mom, but...

66
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,166
 ...l think my family is Garra Blanca.

67
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:51,002
 The Garra is my world, l mean...

68
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:54,003
 ...my life is about Garra
 Blanca and nothing else.

69
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:58,575
 Kunta lives for the
 Garra and nothing else.

70
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:01,744
 This is my world and nobody
 is going to take it from me.

71
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:05,181
 And Colo Colo of course, l mean...

72
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:08,618
 ...everything is linked.

73
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:12,355
 Kunta's world without Kunta

74
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:24,133
 Today the ''wonderful kid''
 is going to play at last.

75
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,671
 ''Damn cops'' don't even
 pay their bus tickets.

76
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,910
 Today we can't lose the match.

77
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,982
 Motherfucking Cop

78
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,985
 Garra Blanca jumps
 on their seats...

79
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,189
 ...without police and
 military we are gonna win.

80
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,570
 As you can see,
 the ''L'' and the ''R''...

81
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:05,441
 ...you're gonna say, ¿why?

82
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:08,678
 ln English, obviously.
 ''L'' means left side , left!

83
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:13,283
 And ''R'' means right side.

84
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:18,187
 But, What can we expect
 from our national police?.

85
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,625
 As we can see...

86
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:27,363
 You, don't do it!

87
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,400
 ¿Like that?, NO!
 You don't do that.

88
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:35,307
 lf you don't want to be like them,

89
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:38,308
 learn some English,
 very simple. Left, Right.

90
00:09:57,229 --> 00:10:00,229
 - Hey, where are we going to lunch?
 - Hey boys, have lunch here

91
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:04,033
 - Look, ''Cazuela'' for $900
 - Fried fish with a side for $1500

92
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,838
 Look at that bitch on TV.

93
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,839
 There she is.

94
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:17,549
 -At next wednesday's meeting...

95
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,550
 ...where the associates
 will determine the form...

96
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,556
 ...to administrate the
 bankruptcy ofthe Club

97
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,358


98
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:27,759
 - How much?
 - One Thousand

99
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,760
 - How much?
 - One Thousand

100
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,530
 lt's going to have to
 be bigger for me, then.

101
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:45,441
 Thanks.

102
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:59,522
 The last supper, that was a
 party with the boys...

103
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,494
 lt was the last blast,
 madman Jesus was leaving the city

104
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:08,364


105
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:11,503
 The madman Jesus is illuminated
 because he drank Peyote.

106
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,504
 The madman Jesus is illuminated
 because he drank Peyote.

107
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:17,475
 he had the cocaine,
 and he was selfish.

108
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:19,944
 he had the cocaine,
 and he was selfish.

109
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:22,945
 They said, ''hey bastard, give
 us our grams, give us a blow''

110
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:29,318
 ''we don't care ifyou are the damn
 prophet'', just give us the drug.

111
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,337
 How are you?

112
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:49,338
 how are you doing today?

113
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,476
 We have your canvas.

114
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:58,448
 Yes, we are in the stadium.

115
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:02,287
 What?

116
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:05,288
 lf, we are going to display your canvas.

117
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:09,158
 l love you so much. Bye.

118
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,397
 Kunta Be Strong.

119
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,945
 Attention all the
 ''colocolinos'' in their heart...

120
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,946
 Ce Ache l, ¡CHl!
 Ele E, ¡Le!

121
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:07,683
 Chi Chi CHi, Le Le Le
 Colo Colo de Chile.

122
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:12,054
 Now buy my beads for a buck.

123
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,528
 - The Garra is here very crazy
 -Asshole! Asshole!

124
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,999
 - And we want to be champions
 -Asshole! Asshole!

125
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:26,569
 - To be champions,
 let's jump on our seats

126
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,308
 Let's scream loudly,
 We will be the best.

127
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,834
 Support the Garra Blanca.
 you fuckwits! What's up?

128
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:03,573
 You have to sing, fucking bastards.

129
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:09,147
 Be brave, fuckwits!
 What's up?

130
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:12,148
 We are the Garra Blanca, ''garreros''
 until death, here is my heart.

131
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:16,018
 Are you getting me?, What's up?

132
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:25,161
 Let's scream, guys!

133
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:08,671
 My vice, my passion.
 More than a religion.

134
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:29,525
 My temple.

135
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,438
 Colo Colo reflects
 the marginal world...

136
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:46,008


137
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,813


138
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:50,915
 lt's the way of a higher
 class society man...

139
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,916
 lt's the way of a higher
 class society man...

140
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:57,186
 ...to look at Colo Colo, like a very
 typical and very chilean ''thing''.

141
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:00,389
 But for the people, Colo
 Colo is something bigger,

142
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,026
 it's a passion.

143
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,796
 An extremely popular team.

144
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,797
 Because it represented the
 feeling ofthe excluded ones,

145
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,667
 the ones nobody ever took seriously.

146
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:12,470
 And that, nevertheless, is
 capable of doing great things.

147
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,106
 lf you ask ''Why am l a Colocolino?''

148
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:18,107
 Damn, l don't know, maybe my
 fathertold me to be, l don't know.

149
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:21,177
 Colo Colo is a feeling.

150
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,448
 Colo Colo is a feeling.

151
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:26,250
 You usually get it from your parents.

152
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:27,719
 and that's why it's so deep.

153
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,188
 and that's why it's so deep.

154
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,590
 lt's a belonging sensation.

155
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:35,591
 one loses his rationality,
 and emotions appear.

156
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,929
 one loses his rationality,
 and emotions appear.

157
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,930
 lt reflects the ''radical
 way'' in chilean society.

158
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,835
 ln that angerthat lives.

159
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,836
 ln certain social groups.

160
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:33,816
 For the champions,
 scream from our hearts!''

161
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,320
 The feeling l get
 when l hit my drum.

162
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:15,026
 l know if the stadium is full...

163
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:18,027


164
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,965
 ...waiting for the next ''boom''.

165
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:23,301
 ...waiting for the next ''boom''.

166
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:26,170
 l really enjoy that
 moment, like Phew!

167
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:29,006
 And then people start
 tojump and scream.

168
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:32,007
 l would never change
 that for anything.

169
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,718
 You can't control
 emotions and feelings.

170
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:43,087
 Rational decisions can change,

171
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:46,088
 if there is calculation and benefit.

172
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,126
 But it's not like that
 ifthe feelings appear.

173
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:51,127
 But it's not like that
 ifthe feelings appear.

174
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:00,371
 The poorer and the richer,

175
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,673
 can feel the same passion.

176
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,609
 Passion?

177
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,944
 l hit the drum with passion.

178
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,112
 To win.

179
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:09,213
 To scream.

 lt's Passion, l love Colo-Colo.

182
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:22,860
 Following Colo-Colo is a lifestyle.

183
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:25,861
 That's my life.

184
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,345
 1, 2, 3...

185
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:44,346
 For the champion,
 for the champion.

186
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:47,818
 Let's scream from our hearts.

187
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:50,555
 For the champion,
 for the champion.

188
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:53,257
 Let's scream from our hearts.

189
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:54,492
 1, 2, 3...

190
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:56,360
 attention all the
 ''colocolinos'' hearts

191
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,896
 Ce ache i, Chi, Le
 Chi chi chi, le le le

192
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:01,897
 Colo Colo de Chile.

193
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,971
 The feeling of belonging.

194
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,420
 Hey fucker!,
 how you've been, bro?

195
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,730
 - Did you arrive early?
 - No, we're just arriving now.

196
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,269
 Last night we were
 at Conejo's house.

197
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,204
 We drank to death.

198
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:16,173
 l ''scored'' my ticket.
 An old man gave it to me

199
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:19,174
 come and visit, or l'll
 see you at the beach.

200
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:23,178
 lfyou see Pirata, tell
 him: ''take care ofthe bus''.

201
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:30,753
 Look, there is Juan
 ''Flag'', go easy now.

202
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,758
 Hello!

203
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,759
 Fucking Kunta, l will
 not tell you anything, bro.

204
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:41,430
 - Today l'm back at the stadium.
 - That's good, l'm glad.

205
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,607
 l'm very nervous.

206
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:52,608
 lt is a strange feeling,
 l'm nervous.

207
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:56,178
 4 months have passed.

208
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:59,383


209
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:01,952


210
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:03,888


211
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,923


212
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:08,059
 So now i want to see
 my people again.

213
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,060
 So now i want to see
 my people again.

214
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,706
 Don't take him there, it's
 a mess! tear gas included.

215
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:01,477
 Let's go, let's do this quickly.

216
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:16,492
 - Go in, that way.
 - That way are the tickets.

217
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,263
 - Give me your ticket.
 - We are five.

218
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:22,166
 - But let me enter, man.
 - Easy, easy.

219
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:25,167
 - This is a damn chaos!
 - We are helping you, man!

220
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:43,485
 - l'll return it to you at the end.
 -And how do l do it, captain?

221
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:48,056
 - You will spoil his business.
 - lt's his earnings.

222
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:50,594
 - Look, it's not that bad.

223
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,595
 - l will check it there.
 - Ok, check it if you want.

224
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:59,802
 -Carlos, wait!.
 - What happened, Kunta?

225
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:03,172
 They seized my t-shirts
 and hats. And i don't know why.

226
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,217
 - l smell gas around here.

227
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,953
 - Thanks.

228
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,954
 - Everything all right?
 - Yes.

229
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:25,996
 We'll see them
 come out from here.

230
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,997
 We'll see them
 come out from here.

231
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:56,118
 ''When the team's playing bad,
 the supporters make it win''.

232
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:02,157
 ''We must scream louder
 when we are losing''.

233
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:08,964
 ''That ''huevones'' is
 to have real feelings''.

234
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:16,004
 ''When the team plays bad,
 supporters make it win''.

235
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:26,682
 The love for Colo Colo
 is a never ending one

236
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:30,352
 The true Garrero,
 who loves Colo-Colo,

237
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,556
 never gives up.

238
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:35,426
 Despite that life gives
 You many difficulties,

239
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,328
 you will keep
 loving Colo-Colo.

240
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:39,163
 Be part of something.

241
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:40,764
 Be part of something.

242
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,667
 Not everyone belongs
 to a political party.

243
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:46,668
 Especially ifyou can't
 be an active member.

244
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,606
 Because usually,
 less educated people...

245
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:53,644
 or the poor one, hardly

246
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:56,480
 will have a carreer
 in a political party.

247
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:59,481
 Besides that supposes
 adaptation to the media,

248
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:02,219
 a certain ideology,
 something more elaborated.

249
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,622
 Same thing for religious beliefs.

250
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,490
 But Colo Colo is Forever.

251
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:09,491
 lt means so much, man.

252
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:12,928
 lt goes beyond the
 religion and the politics.

253
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,799
 This, look.

254
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:23,005
 This, this, this.

255
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:26,243
 My underwear too?

256
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:27,845
 lt is the emotional language.

257
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:30,846
 Why some people, can be
 so fanatical for a team.

258
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:33,784
 Why some people, can be
 so fanatical for a team.

259
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:36,153


260
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:39,123


261
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:40,891
 All teams in world represent:

262
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:43,093
 All teams in world represent:

263
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:46,094
 A university, a city,

264
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,601
 a town, a neighborhood.

265
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:53,602
 Colo Colo represents the soul
 of ''people'', the soul of Mapuche.

266
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,677
 Quest for ldentity

267
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:43,151
 Garra Blanca, always have
 been at ''people's side''.

268
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:46,188
 As the same emblem that
 Colo Colo represents for us,

269
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:49,925
 lt represents the whole
 people who have been oppressed,

270
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:51,795
 And, as Garra Blanca, we
 are the voice of the people.

271
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:54,231
 And, as Garra Blanca, we
 are the voice of the people.

272
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:57,232
 The people who fight in
 their villages and streets.

273
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,904
 That movement belongs to the
 people, to the excluded ones.

274
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,905
 That movement belongs to the
 people, to the excluded ones.

275
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,749
 Garra Blanca has a peculiar
 kind of organization.

276
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,753
 lt's unique in these types of groups.

277
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,890
 Because it's a
 horizontal organization.

278
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:26,228
 And the leadership inside the
 Garra Blanca is disputed with force.

279
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:29,099
 Like the Mapuche organizations.

280
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,100
 This represents us because
 we also live in ''community''.

281
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:35,038
 And each ''community'', in their
 neighborhood, is a ''piño''.

282
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,039
 That goes out, that organizes
 themselves and fights day after day.

283
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:47,916
 Mapuches are still fighting
 after 500 years ofwar.

284
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,821
 They will never surrender.

285
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:52,956
 They all gave up against
 the spanish conquest.

286
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,759
 They all gave up against
 the spanish conquest.

287
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,760
 And Colo-Colo represents that.

288
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:01,131
 And Colo-Colo represents that.

289
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:04,132
 We are living historical
 times here in Chile.

290
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:09,206
 This is the first step,

291
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:11,108
 This is the first step,

292
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:13,911
 people will see that Garra
 blanca is not all about vandalism

293
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:15,946
 We are in the street, giving support.

294
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:18,248
 Marrichiweu

295
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:21,249
 Long life to Colo-Colo
 and Garra Blanca.

296
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:28,523
 We are asking you to be at
 the height ofthis historical process.

297
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:34,431
 feeds the oppression
 and the impunity...

298
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:37,401
 feeds the oppression
 and the impunity...

299
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:40,402
 for the police and all
 the repressive system of Chile.

300
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,839
 We are gonna shake
 our fear out today.

301
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:46,908
 Today, we are going to walk with
 the dignity of our ancestors.

302
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:50,581
 without violence
 but strong enough.

303
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:53,550
 without violence
 but strong enough.

304
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:56,551
 Protecting each other

305
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:59,654
 Marichiweu!

306
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:12,836


307
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:14,304


308
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:15,873
 people to walk
 down their own streets.

309
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,774
 people to walk
 down their own streets.

310
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:19,276
 - Think about that,

311
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:20,944
 going to been shown
 all over the world.

312
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:22,913
 going to been shown
 all over the world.

313
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:25,616


314
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,517
 and l hope you're happy, and
 study another carreer, and...

315
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:30,320
 and l hope you're happy, and
 study another carreer, and...

316
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:32,322
 don't have to work like cops.

317
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:34,758
 - You can't walk.
 - Don't forget who we are,

318
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:37,759
 A lot ofyou are Mapuche.

319
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:41,229
 - Just look at your own faces.

320
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:45,066
 - Set free the Mapuche fighters!

321
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,746
 - Set free the Mapuche fighters!

322
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:06,821
 l think the Mapuche warrior
 never surrenders,

323
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:10,091
 and it is what l have
 to demostrate now.

324
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:13,962
 lf l'm an indian, a ''garrero'',

325
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:17,301
 - Now l have to demostrate that.

326
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:20,302
 l want Colo Colo to qualify
 forthe South American Cup and...

327
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:24,105
 to see how l can travel.

328
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:27,344
 Since the first day.

329
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:30,345
 l was blocked out,
 everything fell.

330
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:34,318
 ...for the South American Cup.

331
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,553
 ...for the South American Cup.

332
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:39,554
 And follow Colo-Colo like in the
 past but now on a different way.

333
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:45,393
 l don't know how, but
 l'm gonna be there.

334
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:06,047
 Look at the place.

335
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:30,005
 - Are we ok?
 -Yes, let's go!

336
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:48,723
 When your it's your love you leave,
 out ofyour heart,

337
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:52,594
 When your it's your love you leave,
 out ofyour heart,

338
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:54,731


339
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:56,466
 But when your keep your
 love, and don't project it.

340
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:59,467
 But when your keep your
 love, and don't project it.

341
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:03,104
 Then, what's love for,
 ifwe don't show it?

342
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,575
 But God loves you
 so much, my bro'!

343
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:08,576


344
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:13,314
 But ifyou put your faith with
 God, you will be walking man.

345
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:16,584
 But ifyou put your faith with
 God, you will be walking man.

346
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:21,656
 Put your faith in God,
 as you have for your team.

347
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:24,327
 And you will walk my brother.

348
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:27,328
 l tell you, in the name ofJesus,
 you are gonna walk.

349
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:30,834
 My brothers, good
 afternoon, God bless you...

350
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:33,835
 ...is there anybody who
 wants to buy bubble gum.

351
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:40,608
 l'm keeping the promise l did to
 myselfwhen l went to the hospital.

352
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:43,678


353
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:47,117
 ''l will never change my
 way to follow the team''.

354
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:49,686
 ''l will never change my
 way to follow the team''.

355
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:51,855
 Here l am again!

356
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:54,856
 ...tired as shit, but,

357
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:59,060
 ...here we are.

358
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:16,611
 My body.

359
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:20,317
 l love it.

360
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:23,318
 My heart it's Colo-Colo.

361
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:26,723
 Mapuche, indian.

362
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:29,724
 l love it.

363
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:35,031
 - lt's meat.
 - Beef.

364
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:38,032
 - Alpaca meat.

365
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:46,841
 As you see, l have to
 pay my medical expenses.

366
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,880
 l cannot travel quiet now.

367
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:52,881
 Now, l travel with no
 money, by land on a bus.

368
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:55,986
 On a wheelchair.

369
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,987
 32 hours on the bus,
 and l never got down from it.

370
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:03,057
 Because l'm fucked up.

371
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:06,296
 - Johan Vásquez

372
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:09,297
 - Motherfucker.

373
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:13,303


374
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:16,304
 lost it's players in a plane crash.

375
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:19,707
 lost it's players in a plane crash.

376
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,080
 The only team that
 felt the same pain,

377
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:28,718
 it was Colo-Colo.

378
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,555
 ln that time Colo-Colo
 gave us 4 players for free,

379
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:34,124
 to Alianza Lima.

380
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,793


381
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:39,794


382
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,831
 Because the solidarity
 they showed as team.

383
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:44,832
 Because the solidarity
 they showed as team.

384
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:49,003
 As a social movement.

385
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:52,140
 The gesture of helping us
 in such a difficult moment.

386
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:56,477
 lt's a feeling thatAlianza and
 peruvian people, have on their mind.

387
00:36:57,515 --> 00:37:00,515
 Certainly it is an example for Chile,

388
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:04,285
 that has Colo Colo as
 a symbol in other places.

389
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:07,123
 people are like the peruvian's.

390
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:10,124
 people are like the peruvian's.

391
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:12,629
 ln this case, chilean
 people are colocolino.

392
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,698
 The biggest supporters in Chile.

393
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:17,267
 And Alianza is the same
 for peruvian people.

394
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:20,268
 And Alianza is the same
 for peruvian people.

395
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:22,839
 Those are things that bind us.

396
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,307
 We take this as an example,

397
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:26,876
 that football is not
 about violence

398
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:29,877
 or rivalry.

399
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,816
 lt's a brotherhood thing.

400
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:35,817
 ln this case, between
 peruvians and chileans.

401
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,758
 Brotherhood ofthe excluded

402
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,933
 l come fromArgentina, bro'.

403
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,269
 l'm a fan of Chacarita Juniors,
 l came to see the Garra.

404
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,304
 And with good mood.

405
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:57,274
 lt's been 20 matches
 since l last came.

406
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,542
 They won 19 and
 drew only one.

407
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:02,543
 This will be their 20th victory.

408
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,580
 Let's go Chaca!

409
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:14,689
 Colo Colo is the best
 team in the world!

410
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:17,327
 Super Copa, Like Colo
 Colo there's no other!

411
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:19,929
 Super Copa, Like Colo
 Colo there's no other!

412
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,264
 Who is Chile?

413
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:22,432
 Who is Chile?

414
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:23,700
 Colo Colo!

415
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:25,735
 Who is Colo Colo?
 Chile!

416
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:27,570
 Ce ache i, chi, le.

417
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:29,339
 Chi chi chi, le le le.

418
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,207
 Colo Colo de Chile.

419
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:34,208
 Freedom for Mapuche
 brothers, motherfucking cop.

420
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:48,623
 To everyone, and for Boca
 Juniors supporters especially.

421
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:51,628
 You ''Bosteros'' don't exist!

422
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:54,097
 You don't have balls, motherfuckers.

423
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:57,098
 Garra Blanca and
 Chacarita, brotherhood.

424
00:38:57,968 --> 00:39:00,070
 Colo Colo is the biggest, man

425
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:03,071
 Chacarita brotherhood, dude,
 Chacarita brotherhood, dude.

426
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:07,709
 ''The day l die, l dont know
 what will happen to my body''.

427
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:10,778
 ''But l know that my soul will
 remain here, supporting you''.

428
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:14,048
 There's an article on ''gatito
 Leeb'', a Chacarita player.

429
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,556
 He was asked about
 Chacarita and he said:

430
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:22,557
 When you're in
 your neighborhood.

431
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,260
 You talk to someone
 about Chacarita,

432
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:26,429
 not as a team,

433
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,832
 Like a son, brother, a father.

434
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:31,833
 Like a son, brother, a father.

435
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:38,573
 Come on Chacarita,
 man, let's go Chaca

436
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:41,578
 This is Chacarita's heart.

437
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:43,313
 Here's where it beats louder.

438
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:46,314
 You have Chacarita in your genes.

439
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:50,153
 Chile, Chile, up the arms

440
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:53,154
 We pull politics aside.

441
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:59,093
 Chacarita y Colo Colo, simply one.

442
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:02,263
 We're going to have
 a good relationship.

443
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,439
 This is like what
 happens to us.

444
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,440
 Chacarita y Colo Colo
 chased by the cops.

445
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,750
 Get in the line.

446
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:27,321
 Great brother, Chacarita,
 freedom brother.

447
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:33,129
 - ln the line ''Garrero'' sirs -

448
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:36,130
 Get back, in the line.

449
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,437
 One at a time.

450
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:47,074
 Freedom to Mapuche brothers,
 mapuches rule here in Chile

451
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:53,548
 Thanks Caupolican,
 thanks Lautaro, fuck!

452
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,457
 You'll be able to scream soon.

453
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:06,262
 With orwithout tickets
 You'll be outside.

454
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:08,298
 Esgrima fans are here.

455
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:11,299
 The cops are with them.

456
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:14,370
 We came toArgentina.

457
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:15,572
 So?

458
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:18,508
 Move on, asshole, move!

459
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:20,310
 You see? dude.

460
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:23,311
 - Move, you can't be here

463
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,987

 - Ok, but don't touch me.
 - Move, move!

466
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,428
 - Ok, i'm moving.

467
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:41,429
 - Get out -

468
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:47,902
 - Take this sir out of here.

469
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,228
 Well guys.

470
00:42:12,229 --> 00:42:13,696
 Well guys.

471
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:16,697
 To you from Villa Maipu.

472
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,468
 l'm entering the stadium.

473
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:20,970
 Today we're gonna win.

474
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:23,971
 To the ''garra''.

475
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:30,645
 Can you be here
 with that camera?

476
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:38,388
 Chaca and Colo Colo.

477
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:39,455
 Simply

478
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:42,125
 One

479
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:44,561
 Everywhere, ''G.B.''
 is everywhere.

480
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:47,230
 Look here.

481
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:50,231
 As You received us
 there, We receive You here.

482
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:54,402
 This is ''Tato'' from the ''G.B''.

483
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:11,321
 ... almost after 2 months l 'm here...

484
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:13,356
 ... almost after 2 months l 'm here...

485
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:16,357
 ... and this is as my neighborhood.

486
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:36,110
 Always overthe stadium seat,
 that's our battle-cry.

487
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:41,015
 That represents
 every ''garreros'' feelings.'

488
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,952
 Also, it's a way to say
 ''this is my neighborhood''.

489
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:50,057
 This wall means ''Garra Blanca''
 zone and nobody touches it.

490
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:53,761
 This is a Guinness Record l think.

491
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,267
 dedicated to a football team.

492
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:00,670
 dedicated to a football team.

493
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:03,671
 120mts wide by 2.5 mts
 high. o many square metres

494
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:07,441
 started to keep the streets clean.

495
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:10,079
 started to keep the streets clean.

496
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:13,080
 There always the oldwoman
 who cares a ''shit'',

497
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:17,685
 but We make ''good
 neighbors'' job and...

498
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:21,722
 ...We clean the streets for her.

499
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,660
 At last, all the wall belongs to us,

500
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:28,131
 and it belongs to all
 the neighborhood too.

501
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:31,132
 The next phrase is,
 ''From the Cradle to the Coffin''.

502
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:34,168
 We were born ''colocolinos'' and
 ''colocolinos'' we are gonna die.

503
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:36,806
 The day of my death,
 l want my coffin...

504
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:38,808


505
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:40,810
 A Garrero is born
 and dies ''Colocolino''.

506
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:43,811
 A Garrero is born
 and dies ''Colocolino''.

507
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:51,385
 Dear Lord, Celestial Lord.
 Good faithful friend.

508
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,823
 Companion, Lord.

509
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:56,824
 Look us at this time, Celestial
 Lord, we are going to you, lord.

510
00:44:57,327 --> 00:44:59,996
 By your poweful blood...

511
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:01,898
 ...the Jesus Christ blood.

512
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:04,534
 Which was spilt on the cross.

513
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:07,535
 Please Lord, clean us, Lord.

514
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:11,105
 ...now, in these words, Dear Lord.

515
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:14,408
 ...now, in these words, Dear Lord.

516
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:21,784
 All of us, Lord!

517
00:45:21,785 --> 00:45:24,687
 We want you to receive us, Dear Lord,

518
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:26,355
 with a nice perfum.

519
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:29,225
 You don't see our
 condition, Celestial Lord.

520
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:32,226
 You don't care ifwe are
 drinking or if we are doped.

521
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:35,463
 You don't see that, because the
 heart is more important to you.

522
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,736
 ''Chavito'' rest in peace
 now, he is with Jesus.

523
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:42,505
 He is with you now. Dear Lord.

524
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:44,173
 Make us understand, Lord.

525
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:46,109
 ''Chavito'', now is smiling.

526
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:48,911
 And he doesn't need that we
 remember him with sadness.

527
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:51,681
 We wont remember him
 with distress, my Lord.

528
00:45:51,682 --> 00:45:54,150
 We must remember
 him with happiness.

529
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:57,151
 Because he is with Christ,
 Dear Lord, Celestial Father.

530
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:03,126
 Colo Colo Stadium

531
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:05,728
 Colo Colo Stadium

532
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:08,729
 Chavo's Funeral.

533
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:24,512
 Ohhh, ''Chavo'' don't leave us!

534
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:11,926
 And thanks again brothers.

535
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:15,996
 Like a Garrero!

536
00:47:58,942 --> 00:48:01,942
 - ''Always in our hearts'' -

537
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:57,965
 My son, no!

538
00:49:24,094 --> 00:49:27,094
 Ohhh, ''Chavo'' don't leave us!,
 ohhh, ''Chavo'' don't leave us!

539
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:49,116
 Kunta's Victory

540
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:38,000


541
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:39,335


542
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:40,503
 So many people?

543
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:42,905
 So many people?

544
00:50:42,906 --> 00:50:45,074
 We'll be going on tuesday.

545
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:47,943
 We'll be going on tuesday.

546
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:50,944
 Just for the recent electoral
 fraud they are asking you that.

547
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:00,289
 Thats why they asked you.

548
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:02,191
 Thats why they asked you.

549
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:03,993
 ...They ask you,
 not for another thing.

550
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:06,595
 ...They ask you,
 not for another thing.

551
00:51:06,596 --> 00:51:09,596
 They don't wanna be hostile, but
 now the situation is not so good.

552
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,171
 l wish you luck.

553
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:18,172
 lt would have been better if
 you played against America F.C.

554
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:21,175
 See you later.

555
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,499
 This pussy is afraid!

556
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,968
 What's up, dude?

557
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:21,969
 What's up, Kunta?

558
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:25,038
 Are we getting on the boat?

559
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:32,248
 Look, the ''barra brava'' is afraid!

560
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:35,249
 Look, he doesn't want
 to release his hand.

561
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:38,986
 Tell the others guys to
 come and help and carry me.

562
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:48,962
 How are you going
 to put me there?

563
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:54,902
 Easy, easy.

564
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:03,310
 Now release him, release him!.

565
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:06,713
 Easy, easy.

566
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:10,250
 l'm scared of this thing, man!

567
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:14,087
 Don't worry, to die drowned is
 the worst thing we can expect.

568
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:43,951
 Assault that boat!

569
00:54:36,072 --> 00:54:38,907
 Tomorrow! Tomorrow!
 the holders will come.

570
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:41,610
 With the responsibility
 to defeat Colo Colo.

571
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:44,611
 To take advantage of the
 ''Nacional'' of Santiago.

572
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:47,748
 The game is over

573
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:10,873
 They are electrical touches.

574
00:55:10,874 --> 00:55:13,874
 No pain no game!

575
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,951
 Here in Mexico, today.

576
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:58,087
 l don't know what day it is.

577
00:55:58,088 --> 00:56:00,489
 But i want to dedicate this song...

578
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:02,791
 ...ofthis ''mariachis''...

579
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:05,761
 ...to my mom.

580
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:08,297
 What happened to me.

581
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:10,499
 What happened to me.

582
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,500
 l don't give this to anybody.

583
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:16,670
 l believe that never before...

584
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:19,208
 ...l had never loved my mom.

585
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:22,209
 With my mom always we
 lived away from each other.

586
00:56:22,979 --> 00:56:25,748
 And after what happened to me.

587
00:56:25,749 --> 00:56:28,650
 l understood...

588
00:56:28,651 --> 00:56:31,651
 ...and l felt that l had a mom.

589
00:56:31,921 --> 00:56:34,921
 Before this l didn't have a
 mom, l didn't have a mother.

590
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:38,093


591
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:41,063


592
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:43,732
 After what happened
 to me, l valued her.

593
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:46,733
 After what happened
 to me, l valued her.

594
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:51,972
 And she is the one
 that gives the life.

595
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:55,675
 And she is the one
 that gives the life.

596
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:11,725
 Mom, l love you.

597
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,462
 Mom...

598
00:57:13,463 --> 00:57:15,564
 ...After what happened to me...

599
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:18,467
 ... l realize that l have a mom.

600
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:21,468
 One never realizes,
 what's by my side.

601
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,210


602
00:57:28,211 --> 00:57:29,845


603
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:31,713
 will be the saddest day of my life.

604
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:33,882
 will be the saddest day of my life.

605
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:36,883
 Mom, l love you very much.
 l've never told you.

606
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:40,854
 But indeed, mom,
 l love you, l love you.

607
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:14,122
 For many years already.

608
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:16,391
 For many years already.

609
00:58:16,392 --> 00:58:17,993
 6 years, l think.

610
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:20,562
 That ''Chamagol'' was coming
 to my team (Atlante),

611
00:58:20,563 --> 00:58:23,563
 That ''Chamagol'' was coming
 to my team (Atlante),

612
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
 l started a friendship with him.

613
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:29,371
 Friends who were coming here.

614
00:58:29,372 --> 00:58:32,372
 Friends who were coming here.

615
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:35,677
 2 years or 1 year ago,

616
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:38,113
 that Colo Colo came.

617
00:58:38,114 --> 00:58:41,114
 People of Chile could
 come, to support.

618
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:45,285
 4 years ago l went to
 Chile, to support Colo.

619
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:49,689
 lt has a good story.

620
00:59:01,804 --> 00:59:04,373
 The bus of ''Llaneros
 de la Frontera'', man.

621
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:07,374
 l'm speaking ''mexican'' now.

622
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:13,048
 1, 2, 3.

623
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:16,049
 l believe that on the trips,
 friendship becomes stronger,

624
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:18,253
 Between people whom
 didn't met each other.

625
00:59:18,254 --> 00:59:20,188
 lt makes you know
 much more the person,

626
00:59:20,189 --> 00:59:23,189
 A greeting like brothers.

627
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,994
 A greeting like brothers.

628
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:28,463
 Here on the trips, really.

629
00:59:28,464 --> 00:59:30,065
 You become friends.

630
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:32,734
 Because already
 you live with them.

631
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,336
 l believe that the friendship
 becomes much stronger,

632
00:59:34,337 --> 00:59:37,172
 l believe that the friendship
 becomes much stronger,

633
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:38,840
 lnside the trips ofthe Garra.

634
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:40,676


635
00:59:40,677 --> 00:59:42,678


636
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:45,113
 ''Ponchar''.

637
00:59:45,114 --> 00:59:48,114
 ''Ponchar''.

638
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:59,926
 Cigarrete papers.

639
01:00:15,078 --> 01:00:17,012
 Four goals we are
 going to score you!

640
01:00:17,013 --> 01:00:20,013
 Four goals we are
 going to score you!

641
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:39,368
 To belong to a social
 group, like Garra Blanca.

642
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:41,737
 Travelings, knowing what it means.

643
01:00:41,738 --> 01:00:44,738
 Get money for tickets
 and the other things.

644
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:48,041
 Are experiences that l had to
 live, and l'll never forget.

645
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:51,511
 l'm here with Kunta.

646
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:55,050


647
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:56,551


648
01:00:56,552 --> 01:00:58,820


649
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:01,556
 l never imagined to live.

650
01:01:01,557 --> 01:01:04,359
 l never imagined to live.

651
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,628
 The belong of ''Garra'',
 to live a bankruptcy,

652
01:01:06,629 --> 01:01:08,864
 The belong of ''Garra'',
 to live a bankruptcy,

653
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:11,533
 Being champion, to be
 the scorer ofthe team.

654
01:01:11,534 --> 01:01:13,235
 ... the fact that rival hates you.

655
01:01:13,236 --> 01:01:15,637
 ... the fact that rival hates you.

656
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:17,973
 They are beautiful things.

657
01:01:17,974 --> 01:01:20,974
 And l'll never forget either
 my origins, or what l lived.

658
01:01:21,544 --> 01:01:23,945
 We are here.

659
01:01:23,946 --> 01:01:26,946
 -Are you happy?
 - Yes, How couldn't l?

660
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:30,118
 Go on Colo Colo, damn!

661
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:33,119
 From Mexico to Magallanes.

662
01:01:43,399 --> 01:01:46,399
 We are in Mexico, Motherfucker!

663
01:02:30,446 --> 01:02:33,446
 Fucking asshole!.

664
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,595
 There He is.

665
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:49,596
 There He is.

666
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:51,933


667
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:54,934
 A Colo-Colo fan.

668
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:58,838
 A Colo-Colo fan.

669
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:02,041
 He came with ''Garra Blanca'' friends.

670
01:03:02,845 --> 01:03:04,813
 - Yeah, hello to all my
 Garra Blanca brothers.

671
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:07,814
 - Yeah, hello to all my
 Garra Blanca brothers.

672
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:11,785
 - Hello to Garra Blanca then.

673
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:28,468
 They're things of life.

674
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:31,471
 l don't blame anybody
 for what happened to me.

675
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:35,341
 l do not feel anger towards
 the person who did this to me.

676
01:03:36,679 --> 01:03:39,679
 l've never had it. They
 are things that happened.

677
01:03:42,084 --> 01:03:44,619
 They are twenty years
 following the team.

678
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:47,620
 Colo Colo and Garra
 Blanca are my family.

679
01:03:47,623 --> 01:03:50,623
 The family that l never had.

680
01:03:50,927 --> 01:03:53,927
 l grew up with my mom and a
 stepfather since 9 years old.

681
01:03:55,064 --> 01:03:58,064
 My mom worked herwhole life,
 she left me to the care of others.

682
01:03:59,702 --> 01:04:02,702
 Being the only son in my family.

683
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:06,639
 ''Garra'' and Colo Colo
 become part ofyour life.

684
01:04:07,376 --> 01:04:09,744
 ''Garra Blanca''

685
01:04:09,745 --> 01:04:12,647
 The biggest thing after Colo Colo.

686
01:04:12,648 --> 01:04:15,083
 lt's like your second family.

687
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:18,084
 Your people, your brothers.

688
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:24,490
 Your soldiers who are by your
 side ifyou have to fight.

689
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:28,363
 The most of them
 would give it.

690
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:31,364
 The most of them
 would give it.

691
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:43,877
 Fucking cop!

692
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:49,184
 Get your stick up
 your ass, fucking cop!

693
01:04:49,185 --> 01:04:52,185
 Get your stick up
 your ass, fucking cop!

694
01:05:11,307 --> 01:05:13,608


695
01:05:13,609 --> 01:05:16,444


696
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:19,147
 Other problems appear, as the
 lack of opportunities, for example.

697
01:05:19,148 --> 01:05:22,148
 Other problems appear, as the
 lack of opportunities, for example.

698
01:05:22,385 --> 01:05:24,853
 The segmentation
 ofthe Chilean society,

699
01:05:24,854 --> 01:05:25,954
 ...the people who have
 more anger against the system,

700
01:05:25,955 --> 01:05:27,822
 ...the people who have
 more anger against the system,

701
01:05:27,823 --> 01:05:30,823
 will approach the club

702
01:05:31,727 --> 01:05:34,727
 There is corruption in the police,
 there is corruption in the Military.

703
01:05:35,197 --> 01:05:38,197
 ...Pinochet has around 14
 million dollars hidden.

704
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:40,936
 becomes a feeling...

705
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:43,937
 becomes a feeling...

706
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:47,040
 ...of anger, of
 indignation, of frustration.

707
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:49,311
 ''The sadly famous one''

708
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:52,312
 ''The sadly famous one''

709
01:05:52,315 --> 01:05:55,315
 The sadly famous one?

710
01:05:55,584 --> 01:05:57,986
 And they all speculate,

711
01:05:57,987 --> 01:06:00,987
 Saying that ''Garra
 Blanca'' acted with violence.

712
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:03,558
 Many times,

713
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:06,559
 Garra has acted with violence,
 but for consequence ofwhat?

714
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,230


715
01:06:09,231 --> 01:06:12,133
 ...why ''Garra Blanca'' acted this way.

716
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:15,134
 ...why ''Garra Blanca'' acted this way.

717
01:06:57,013 --> 01:07:00,013
 l'm Garra, l'm Garra,
 l am Garra Blanca!

718
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:18,031
 The society looks at us
 badly, for the violence.

01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:21,636
 moves to the stadium,
 nothing else.

720
01:07:21,637 --> 01:07:24,272
 moves to the stadium,
 nothing else.

721

 in schools.

725
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:37,050
 Violence is present everywhere.

726
01:07:38,087 --> 01:07:41,087
 The Exclusion is an act ofViolence,
 and all of us are responsible for that.

727
01:07:49,532 --> 01:07:52,532
 Many negative things of

01:08:04,346 --> 01:08:06,748


735
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:08,283


736
01:08:08,284 --> 01:08:10,952
 Because...

737
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:13,188
 Because...

738
01:08:13,189 --> 01:08:16,189
 ...to be like that,
 it's not for anybody.

739
01:08:18,294 --> 01:08:21,294
 News.

740
01:08:21,363 --> 01:08:23,765

 to his relatives

745
01:08:40,382 --> 01:08:41,783


746
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:43,184
 And that passion

747
01:08:43,185 --> 01:08:44,385
 And that passion

748
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:47,288

749
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:49,691
 We are mapuches.

750
01:08:49,692 --> 01:08:51,593
 Fighting race.

751

 Until death.

752
01:08:53,329 --> 01:08:56,329
 Marichiweu, marichiweu!

753
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,467

 through the guts.

759
01:09:05,908 --> 01:09:07,308
 through the guts.

760
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:10,309
 Medical diagnoses are serious.

761
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:13,348
 Colo Colo is my god.

762
01:09:13,349 --> 01:09:15,717

 Colo Colo goes beyond players,
 directors or Garra Blanca.

768
01:09:30,466 --> 01:09:32,500
 ''El Pirata'' is still complicated

769
