1
00:01:35,978 --> 00:01:40,015
Europe. France 1917.

2
00:02:00,038 --> 00:02:02,512
The frontline is dangerous, we need 10 more people now...

3
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:06,573
No more ammo!

4
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:08,460
Move it, quick.

5
00:02:16,097 --> 00:02:18,066
Tiansheng, don't be scared.

6
00:02:18,267 --> 00:02:20,005
Calm down, calm down.

7
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,306
We will make it back to China...we can't die here.

8
00:02:23,647 --> 00:02:25,473
Everyone don't be scared, continue forward.

9
00:02:25,517 --> 00:02:26,847
Do not go back, march forward.

10
00:02:30,106 --> 00:02:31,251
My lucky charm.

11
00:02:31,817 --> 00:02:32,784
It will protect you.

12
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:36,053
Brothers, let's move forward.

13
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:37,344
Let's go!

14
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:39,485
Let's go!

15
00:02:56,086 --> 00:02:56,955
Quickly!

16
00:02:57,046 --> 00:02:59,751
Commander, ammo is here.

17
00:03:03,385 --> 00:03:04,760
Why are the French retreating?

18
00:03:08,265 --> 00:03:10,234
Chen Zhen...

19
00:03:10,345 --> 00:03:11,456
Help me.

20
00:03:14,935 --> 00:03:15,804
Chen Zhen!

21
00:03:27,035 --> 00:03:29,047
Germans are here, damn it.

22
00:03:56,144 --> 00:03:57,838
Everyone alright? Anyone hurt?

23
00:03:58,514 --> 00:04:00,350
Chen Zhen, lucky to have you here.

24
00:04:00,434 --> 00:04:01,809
Brother Chen, I'm okay.

25
00:04:01,934 --> 00:04:03,353
Thanks to your lucky charm.

26
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:05,199
Thank heaven, thank god.

27
00:04:15,193 --> 00:04:16,117
I must go home.

28
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:18,827
Tiansheng...

29
00:04:21,453 --> 00:04:23,103
I must go home.

30
00:04:24,243 --> 00:04:25,486
I'll kill all of you!

31
00:04:31,883 --> 00:04:32,752
I must go home.

32
00:04:36,212 --> 00:04:37,313
Everyone get down.

33
00:04:37,463 --> 00:04:39,674
We cannot die here.

34
00:08:15,487 --> 00:08:16,400
Mr. Liu!

35
00:08:27,247 --> 00:08:28,170
Thank you.

36
00:08:28,496 --> 00:08:30,245
- Owner Liu, business is good huh?
- You guys please enjoy.

37
00:08:39,796 --> 00:08:42,919
Boss, look, every night it's like this.

38
00:08:43,095 --> 00:08:45,251
Who would believe there's a war going on?

39
00:08:45,886 --> 00:08:47,261
It's crazy out there,

40
00:08:47,386 --> 00:08:49,453
If they don't come here, then where else would they go?

41
00:08:53,226 --> 00:08:56,481
Everyone, my brother says he has war news from the front.

42
00:08:56,685 --> 00:08:58,797
He says, General Zhuo will defeat Commander Zeng.

43
00:08:59,485 --> 00:09:02,785
There's news that Commander Zeng retreated.

44
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:06,349
If General Zhuo wins, China will be unified.

45
00:09:06,994 --> 00:09:07,907
Not for sure yet.

46
00:09:07,994 --> 00:09:10,954
The British, Japanese are still behind Commander Zeng.

47
00:09:10,955 --> 00:09:13,199
Both do not wish China to be unified.

48
00:09:13,995 --> 00:09:14,918
Are you kidding?

49
00:09:15,124 --> 00:09:16,456
You've been to Taiwan?

50
00:09:16,495 --> 00:09:18,750
Japan invaded Taiwan.

51
00:09:18,794 --> 00:09:20,833
You fight back, and get terminated.

52
00:09:20,834 --> 00:09:21,847
You still want to fight back?

53
00:09:21,965 --> 00:09:23,890
History books won't even record your name.

54
00:09:24,634 --> 00:09:27,615
If this continues, Taiwan will become Japan.

55
00:09:27,675 --> 00:09:31,072
Also, China is not under Chinese control.

56
00:09:31,173 --> 00:09:34,068
Eventually, I think either the Brits or Japanese will win.

57
00:09:34,225 --> 00:09:35,511
Don't forget.

58
00:09:35,644 --> 00:09:38,075
More chaos here, more prosperity for us.

59
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:44,190
Tell her to sing this song.

60
00:10:45,362 --> 00:10:47,243
Kiki, sing us a Japanese song.

61
00:10:50,702 --> 00:10:51,571
Kiki.

62
00:10:59,712 --> 00:11:00,724
Come on, let's go.

63
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,310
Thank you.

64
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,182
Thank you.

65
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:08,638
Very good, very nice.

66
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:11,149
Thank you.

67
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,283
Who are you?

68
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,507
Who do you want?

69
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,539
Officers, don't be angry.

70
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,765
Everyone's my guest today, please save this Lu some face.

71
00:12:19,858 --> 00:12:20,738
Sit, sit

72
00:12:20,778 --> 00:12:21,747
- Ah Wan
- Yes

73
00:12:21,869 --> 00:12:23,564
I am sorry. Please sit down.

74
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,078
I can't take this, Mr. Liu.

75
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:28,723
Brother, you returned from France?

76
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:30,202
Correct.

77
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:31,331
Have a drink.

78
00:12:31,538 --> 00:12:32,462
Thank you Mr. Liu.

79
00:12:59,728 --> 00:13:02,302
Let me ask something...pair is big or three of a kind?

80
00:13:03,608 --> 00:13:04,477
What are you holding?

81
00:13:06,109 --> 00:13:06,987
Three of a kind.

82
00:13:09,908 --> 00:13:12,570
My pair beats your three of a kind.

83
00:13:15,658 --> 00:13:16,538
Come on.

84
00:13:16,578 --> 00:13:17,589
Okay, continue.

85
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,042
Winner winner, chicken dinner

86
00:13:24,628 --> 00:13:25,959
I won.

87
00:13:29,087 --> 00:13:29,967
Again

88
00:13:42,057 --> 00:13:44,487
Tiansheng, taking big risk?

89
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:46,373
Risking my life is okay?

90
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:49,359
Your life? How much is it worth?

91
00:13:49,607 --> 00:13:51,257
Not cheaper than yours!

92
00:13:52,487 --> 00:13:53,355
What did you say?

93
00:13:55,116 --> 00:13:57,448
Your life, is it worth this much?

94
00:14:03,246 --> 00:14:04,621
Then my life is yours now.

95
00:14:06,827 --> 00:14:07,706
Who is scared of whom?

96
00:14:10,296 --> 00:14:11,902
Three of a kind.

97
00:14:14,336 --> 00:14:15,579
It's over for you.

98
00:14:16,296 --> 00:14:17,165
Two Pair.

99
00:14:21,005 --> 00:14:23,074
Pair can beat three of a kind?

100
00:14:23,306 --> 00:14:25,924
Didn't someone say that, moments ago?

101
00:14:26,476 --> 00:14:27,305
You...

102
00:14:27,306 --> 00:14:28,175
Correct?

103
00:14:28,226 --> 00:14:29,138
Sit down...

104
00:14:29,805 --> 00:14:30,685
Okay.

105
00:14:31,055 --> 00:14:33,035
Rules are made by you guys.

106
00:14:33,065 --> 00:14:34,759
Can't take it when someone wins?

107
00:14:35,145 --> 00:14:36,014
Okay.

108
00:14:37,026 --> 00:14:37,895
My brother.

109
00:14:38,856 --> 00:14:41,792
You gave me your money, or your life?

110
00:14:42,155 --> 00:14:43,805
Of course, I need money not life, Mr. Liu.

111
00:14:46,745 --> 00:14:47,614
Okay then.

112
00:14:48,115 --> 00:14:49,216
Drink.

113
00:14:50,165 --> 00:14:51,903
Come on, continue.

114
00:15:01,715 --> 00:15:02,947
Drink too much these couple days.

115
00:15:03,175 --> 00:15:05,605
Can't drink anymore, I have to go back to the hotel.

116
00:15:06,844 --> 00:15:08,307
Don't stay in the hotel anymore

117
00:15:08,504 --> 00:15:09,791
move in here.

118
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:13,093
Don't be a stranger.

119
00:15:13,725 --> 00:15:14,737
Don't mention it.

120
00:15:14,895 --> 00:15:16,544
Okay, thank you Mr. Lu.

121
00:15:28,274 --> 00:15:29,143
You're here?

122
00:15:29,654 --> 00:15:32,722
Didn't you say this room's for me to watch the sunrise?

123
00:15:33,573 --> 00:15:35,686
It's only 3... no sunrise yet.

124
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:39,253
Let me introduce my brother, Qin Tiansheng.

125
00:15:39,874 --> 00:15:40,974
This is Kiki.

126
00:15:43,082 --> 00:15:46,064
Then now you got more brothers than wives.

127
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:48,126
What am I to do?

128
00:15:48,503 --> 00:15:50,935
You are married to me, you should know what to do.

129
00:15:52,343 --> 00:15:56,172
What about other mistresses?

130
00:15:56,173 --> 00:15:59,473
They're one night stands, you're my main chick.

131
00:16:01,644 --> 00:16:03,975
When they are all gone, we can continue this talk

132
00:16:12,392 --> 00:16:13,822
- Have a drink!
- Next time perhaps

133
00:16:14,023 --> 00:16:16,047
I drank a lot tonight, thanks Miss.

134
00:16:17,442 --> 00:16:18,498
He drank a lot, let me.

135
00:16:26,323 --> 00:16:28,115
Then I won't bother you two

136
00:16:28,242 --> 00:16:29,111
I'll go first.

137
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,085
Ah Wan's downstairs, he'll see you out.

138
00:16:35,172 --> 00:16:36,085
Thank you.

139
00:16:43,011 --> 00:16:44,617
Your girlfriend's cold.

140
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:47,012
You interested?

141
00:16:47,682 --> 00:16:50,891
If you have it, take it. I'm afraid you can't control yourself.

142
00:16:50,892 --> 00:16:52,773
That's you, Mr. Liu.

143
00:16:53,811 --> 00:16:54,680
Really?

144
00:16:54,771 --> 00:16:55,639
Good night.

145
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,800
Thank you Mr. Liu.

146
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:00,930
You are welcome.

147
00:17:05,611 --> 00:17:07,129
You hang out with Liu Yiutian now?

148
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,324
If so, you'll be famous.

149
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:13,372
This keeps up, then it will be too dangerous.

150
00:17:13,531 --> 00:17:15,236
This is small part of the plan.

151
00:17:15,581 --> 00:17:19,368
No, getting close to Liu Yiutian is a big part already.

152
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:22,450
He can't trust you that quickly.

153
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,514
Be careful

154
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,592
Liu Yiutian, this person...

155
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,174
You think he can do big things?

156
00:17:27,211 --> 00:17:31,798
Also... he has ties to the underground.

157
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:33,175
After all, he is still Chinese.

158
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,675
Our force is not strong enough...

159
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,927
...to face the Japanese.

160
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,189
We must encourage every single Chinese.

161
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:46,263
The more power Liu Yiutian has, the more valuable.

162
00:17:46,689 --> 00:17:48,252
Thus, if we and the underground...

163
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,109
Established ties...

164
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,892
It will be beneficial to us.

165
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,740
I contacted some sailor brothers from France for help.

166
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:57,778
Don't worry.

167
00:17:57,779 --> 00:17:58,923
Don't forget our school mates.

168
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:02,143
Every Chinese is together on this.

169
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:06,808
But our country cannot be unified.

170
00:18:06,829 --> 00:18:07,697
At least, for now..

171
00:18:09,369 --> 00:18:11,800
I believe we can do it. We can.

172
00:18:31,387 --> 00:18:34,281
Master, why did you start Jing Wu School?

173
00:18:34,308 --> 00:18:36,739
To protect the homeland, Chen Zhen.

174
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:48,447
France. 1917.

175
00:18:48,448 --> 00:18:51,891
Tian Yuan, we almost made it to China.

176
00:18:53,828 --> 00:18:55,247
You stay here and rest.

177
00:18:55,617 --> 00:18:57,497
Tian Yuan will go back to China with us.

178
00:18:58,497 --> 00:18:59,785
Chen Zhen can't go home now.

179
00:19:01,548 --> 00:19:02,966
But Qin Tiansheng can.

180
00:19:04,508 --> 00:19:05,927
China's a battlefield.

181
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,418
I got news from France.

182
00:19:56,465 --> 00:19:58,027
England intercepted news about our troop movement.

183
00:20:00,426 --> 00:20:02,351
Besides me, only 3 of you know.

184
00:20:02,716 --> 00:20:03,596
Who made the mistake?

185
00:20:04,266 --> 00:20:06,378
Sir, I never left base.

186
00:20:22,945 --> 00:20:23,814
You all listen...

187
00:20:24,076 --> 00:20:26,869
Japanese soldiers must have courage.

188
00:20:27,615 --> 00:20:28,485
Yes.

189
00:20:33,244 --> 00:20:35,703
Sisters, boss is here.

190
00:20:35,704 --> 00:20:36,761
Now, bottoms up!

191
00:20:36,915 --> 00:20:37,754
Whose birthday is it?

192
00:20:37,755 --> 00:20:38,899
Whose birthday it is, is not important.

193
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:40,555
What's important is that you invite us for a drink.

194
00:20:40,585 --> 00:20:41,509
Okay, let's drink.

195
00:20:42,545 --> 00:20:43,414
Ah Chi.

196
00:20:44,084 --> 00:20:45,414
Your boss has ways with the ladies.

197
00:20:45,633 --> 00:20:46,822
He is one of the wealthiest in Shanghai.

198
00:20:46,924 --> 00:20:48,344
Wearing white is Wei Wei.

199
00:20:48,385 --> 00:20:49,298
You, come here!

200
00:20:50,225 --> 00:20:51,544
I have to go now...

201
00:20:51,974 --> 00:20:54,131
General Zeng's lover...keep your eyes on her.

202
00:20:54,305 --> 00:20:55,229
He's here!

203
00:20:55,803 --> 00:20:57,090
Not at the battlefield?

204
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:58,786
He's back, at Duy Quinh Place.

205
00:20:58,814 --> 00:21:00,047
Told me to come over.

206
00:21:00,185 --> 00:21:02,252
Shall I call a car for you?

207
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:04,374
No need. He sent a driver.

208
00:21:04,484 --> 00:21:05,585
He will pick me up.

209
00:21:05,775 --> 00:21:06,830
Drink one, then go.

210
00:21:07,194 --> 00:21:08,799
Give her one shot

211
00:21:16,204 --> 00:21:17,073
Hong LAN.

212
00:21:18,414 --> 00:21:19,832
Any left?

213
00:21:19,913 --> 00:21:22,156
Sorry sister Kiki, I just sold out.

214
00:21:22,622 --> 00:21:24,141
I'll go buy one for you, okay?

215
00:21:24,334 --> 00:21:25,203
Okay.

216
00:21:34,922 --> 00:21:35,792
Mr. Qin, see you.

217
00:21:44,932 --> 00:21:46,626
Lady Duy, the General is waiting upstairs.

218
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,602
Okay.

219
00:21:49,483 --> 00:21:54,983
Sir, we have located General Zhuo
and General Zeng of the NE army.

220
00:21:56,022 --> 00:21:59,420
My people are ready, waiting for your orders.

221
00:22:01,823 --> 00:22:03,615
General Zhuo, hello!
Arrived? Hello!

222
00:22:03,702 --> 00:22:05,672
Long time, sit sit.

223
00:22:06,453 --> 00:22:08,464
It's cold outside, let's eat hot pot.

224
00:22:08,491 --> 00:22:09,822
We're just talking nonsense to relax.

225
00:22:18,632 --> 00:22:19,863
General Zeng.

226
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,900
Tell me, your troops against mine... who will win?

227
00:22:28,092 --> 00:22:29,015
You'd win.

228
00:22:30,852 --> 00:22:33,513
What if the Japanese help you.

229
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,615
If so, I would surrender

230
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,072
I only use the Japanese.

231
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:42,296
They are a bunch of bastards.

232
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,985
The Japanese won't give you the time.

233
00:22:50,451 --> 00:22:52,145
Things are critical now.

234
00:22:52,741 --> 00:22:54,666
Some already moved to Europe.

235
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:59,709
Honestly, I don't want to fight the NE army.

236
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:04,610
But, your army can't be helping the China government.

237
00:23:06,381 --> 00:23:07,569
To be direct.

238
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:12,529
If you withdraw, the army is still yours

239
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:14,334
I'll stop fighting immediately.

240
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,245
What do you think?

241
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:21,081
Brother Zhuo, don't force me.

242
00:23:24,981 --> 00:23:28,148
This reply, is what you want to say to all of China?

243
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,228
General Zhuo.

244
00:23:32,939 --> 00:23:36,018
General Zeng, forgive me for not seeing things.

245
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:38,392
He trusts you...admires you.

246
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:41,775
Won't you believe in him?

247
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,288
Let me tell you.

248
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:57,268
If he doesn't want to be Japan's dog...

249
00:23:58,468 --> 00:24:00,206
Then he has only got one option.

250
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:03,179
Negotiation.

251
00:24:08,388 --> 00:24:13,757
Brother, it's not easy, to get to where China is today.

252
00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:15,921
Victory is in sight.

253
00:24:19,649 --> 00:24:23,915
Brother Zhuo, I need time to tell everyone.

254
00:24:24,948 --> 00:24:25,818
Give me 7 days.

255
00:24:27,698 --> 00:24:28,567
Okay

256
00:24:30,198 --> 00:24:31,486
7 days is okay.

257
00:24:33,117 --> 00:24:33,986
If...

258
00:24:34,917 --> 00:24:36,930
If they don't listen...

259
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:42,520
Next time we meet, it will be on the battlefield!

260
00:24:43,707 --> 00:24:45,863
We two, will always be brothers.

261
00:24:46,507 --> 00:24:47,376
Bottoms up!

262
00:25:24,915 --> 00:25:25,786
Give me some money.

263
00:25:26,087 --> 00:25:27,594
Easy, give me some money.

264
00:25:27,667 --> 00:25:28,580
Get lost!

265
00:25:44,845 --> 00:25:45,813
Your majesty!

266
00:26:09,825 --> 00:26:10,924
Thank you.

267
00:26:23,044 --> 00:26:24,056
Protect the General!

268
00:26:27,555 --> 00:26:28,468
Protect the General!

269
00:27:19,053 --> 00:27:20,802
One more skilled fighter

270
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:30,990
1,2,3,4

271
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,061
5,6

272
00:28:21,231 --> 00:28:23,574
Who is driving that fast? Even the police don't drive that fast.

273
00:28:24,361 --> 00:28:25,229
Do I know who?

274
00:28:40,621 --> 00:28:41,545
Let's go see.

275
00:28:42,831 --> 00:28:44,392
Who? Me?

276
00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:48,051
Is it me every time? Hurry and go!

277
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,119
You go!

278
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,090
Me?

279
00:28:54,261 --> 00:28:55,547
Come here, come here.

280
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,352
Make way!

281
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,330
Useless fellow...

282
00:29:12,859 --> 00:29:15,104
Search the crime scene, see who's alive.

283
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:17,132
Go look over there, okay.

284
00:29:22,949 --> 00:29:23,961
Go and get killed.

285
00:29:38,258 --> 00:29:39,128
Who are you?

286
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,407
You need not know.

287
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:44,536
You. Why did you save me?

288
00:29:44,678 --> 00:29:46,329
I didn't want to save you. I had no choice!

289
00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:49,008
I want to say one thing to you.
"Don't work with the Japanese!"

290
00:29:49,268 --> 00:29:51,700
Don't dig your own grave!

291
00:29:58,358 --> 00:29:59,821
Did General Zhuo send him?

292
00:29:59,938 --> 00:30:01,874
No, he isn't that type of person.

293
00:30:03,908 --> 00:30:05,603
Then who else knows you're back?

294
00:30:12,578 --> 00:30:15,790
Your Majesty, my men practice day and night.

295
00:30:15,918 --> 00:30:17,525
Why want to assassinate his son?

296
00:30:18,418 --> 00:30:21,035
I'm not interested in helping you
handle this Zhuo, he's not worth much.

297
00:30:21,047 --> 00:30:22,378
He only commands the NE army.

298
00:30:22,508 --> 00:30:23,739
Only the NE army, what can they do?

299
00:30:23,877 --> 00:30:25,670
What is important, is what Tokyo wants.

300
00:30:26,587 --> 00:30:30,137
Only to see China surrender...
To us, that's beneficial.

301
00:30:30,138 --> 00:30:31,788
When General Zeng dies.

302
00:30:32,807 --> 00:30:35,007
War between General Zeng and Zhuo can't be avoided.

303
00:30:35,227 --> 00:30:36,272
Just that we messed up.

304
00:30:37,057 --> 00:30:39,356
Can't believe a pro fighter appeared.

305
00:30:39,557 --> 00:30:43,781
We don't need to dwell on this.

306
00:30:44,646 --> 00:30:46,252
Right now what's important is...find out who he is!

307
00:30:47,567 --> 00:30:48,436
Hurry and investigate.

308
00:30:56,536 --> 00:30:59,473
A person appeared to fight the mighty Japan!

309
00:30:59,826 --> 00:31:01,069
Let us unite!

310
00:31:01,536 --> 00:31:03,506
Many characters are good for us.

311
00:31:04,536 --> 00:31:06,286
We will help with all we got.

312
00:31:07,457 --> 00:31:08,556
Read all about it!

313
00:31:09,256 --> 00:31:11,456
Read all about it!

314
00:31:11,626 --> 00:31:13,881
Mysterious man appears to fight back Japan!

315
00:31:19,966 --> 00:31:22,396
How Tai, don't wear black clothes all day.

316
00:31:22,425 --> 00:31:23,394
Wanna scare people to death?

317
00:31:23,516 --> 00:31:24,704
Talking about me?
Then who else?

318
00:31:24,806 --> 00:31:27,005
Can you guys guess who this mysterious guy?

319
00:31:27,306 --> 00:31:29,187
I know who he is!

320
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:35,950
You sound confident, are you?

321
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:38,208
He didn't escape from the psychiatric ward.

322
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:40,065
This person is here among us.

323
00:31:44,905 --> 00:31:45,828
Why are you so sure?

324
00:31:46,284 --> 00:31:49,904
All of Shanghai knows.
I know everything going on in that ward!

325
00:31:50,704 --> 00:31:52,905
You better be careful, maybe you are tired.

326
00:31:54,376 --> 00:31:57,993
Head of a psych ward, scared of someone with a brain?

327
00:31:59,254 --> 00:32:00,124
Maybe...

328
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:04,979
What happened last night?

329
00:32:05,095 --> 00:32:05,965
You stupid chink!

330
00:32:06,006 --> 00:32:07,941
Where were you yesterday?

331
00:32:08,424 --> 00:32:11,303
You can't believe the news, there's no truth in the paper.

332
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,141
Do you know what happened? Who is the mysterious guy?

333
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,133
General.

334
00:32:14,184 --> 00:32:15,835
That is weird. We received the same news.

335
00:32:15,895 --> 00:32:17,544
We came to the scene right away.

336
00:32:17,605 --> 00:32:20,523
We got there, bodies everywhere.

337
00:32:20,524 --> 00:32:21,393
There's 17,18...

338
00:32:21,484 --> 00:32:22,232
Bodies everywhere...

339
00:32:22,233 --> 00:32:22,892
Over there 10...

340
00:32:22,893 --> 00:32:24,049
Who knows, guns started firing.

341
00:32:24,154 --> 00:32:26,585
You were holding me!

342
00:32:27,734 --> 00:32:28,834
When we were behind the car, We fired back!

343
00:32:29,034 --> 00:32:31,873
Then we split up...

344
00:32:31,905 --> 00:32:33,102
I'm on the right, he's on the left

345
00:32:33,203 --> 00:32:34,435
I kept firing till I'm out...

346
00:32:34,533 --> 00:32:37,122
Then what?

347
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:37,822
Out of bullets, at a moment like this...

348
00:32:37,823 --> 00:32:38,978
I jumped from the hood of the car...

349
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:41,493
Then I jumped to the other side!

350
00:32:41,494 --> 00:32:42,462
I thought I was dead meat...

351
00:32:42,584 --> 00:32:45,883
But I got over in one jump.

352
00:32:46,293 --> 00:32:48,724
You think I'm a pig?

353
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:50,032
Listen to me!

354
00:32:50,213 --> 00:32:52,875
Working too openly is not wise

355
00:32:52,923 --> 00:32:54,442
I think if I pulled the hat down...

356
00:32:54,594 --> 00:32:56,705
Nobody would notice me!

357
00:32:56,763 --> 00:32:59,655
I'm a bad-ass, isn't that right?

358
00:32:59,682 --> 00:33:01,465
You think you are that mysterious guy?

359
00:33:01,723 --> 00:33:04,066
Look at yourself!

360
00:33:04,183 --> 00:33:06,296
You look like a pig!

361
00:33:07,894 --> 00:33:09,454
You stupid chink!

362
00:33:09,772 --> 00:33:11,334
Not Chink, it's Chinese.

363
00:33:11,442 --> 00:33:13,499
Whatever, you stupid Chink!

364
00:33:19,283 --> 00:33:20,295
Here's the money...

365
00:33:22,572 --> 00:33:23,540
This is good...

366
00:33:25,122 --> 00:33:28,379
I can go eat with the superiors.

367
00:33:28,623 --> 00:33:31,832
Yes, brother, we're here...

368
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:33,207
Every month it's gonna be like that.

369
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:45,959
Stop staring, you want one too?

370
00:33:52,852 --> 00:33:54,964
Luckily, you're not here yesterday.

371
00:33:55,192 --> 00:33:57,941
If not, dressing like this is scary as heck.

372
00:34:00,651 --> 00:34:02,664
Don't joke, I have a gun...

373
00:34:02,691 --> 00:34:03,440
Gun

374
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:05,366
Then why didn't you appear earlier yesterday?

375
00:34:06,531 --> 00:34:08,545
Am I not looking for the right opportunity?

376
00:34:09,111 --> 00:34:10,584
- What did you find out?
- I investigated it all.

377
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,860
None of the dead guys had any records.

378
00:34:13,121 --> 00:34:15,320
Let me ask you, who's at that bottom of this

379
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,757
I don't know.

380
00:34:16,951 --> 00:34:19,339
How are you gonna find a suspect from the dead bodies?

381
00:34:19,582 --> 00:34:20,955
General Zeng returned to Japan.

382
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,688
And Wei Wei?

383
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,157
But yesterday, General Zeng was courageous.

384
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,780
Preparation is being done at the restaurant.

385
00:34:29,881 --> 00:34:31,586
Money?

386
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:38,770
Next time, be careful. Don't drag me in again.

387
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:47,881
Any one suspicious lately?

388
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,069
One new shareholder appeared.

389
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,401
A very suspicious individual.

390
00:34:57,659 --> 00:34:58,572
Continue.

391
00:34:59,529 --> 00:35:01,190
His name is Qin Tiansheng.

392
00:35:01,579 --> 00:35:05,749
Just back from France.

393
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:08,022
Mr. Lu...

394
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:10,519
even invited him to be a shareholder of the night club.

395
00:35:13,379 --> 00:35:14,248
And you?

396
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:21,625
My mission is to stay close and retrieve Intel from the British.

397
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:25,671
But more people come in and out everyday

398
00:35:27,848 --> 00:35:30,511
I'll pay more attention to this Tian Yuan.

399
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:32,258
Sorry.

400
00:35:48,537 --> 00:35:50,045
Next time, don't come back without any Intel.

401
00:35:50,908 --> 00:35:52,239
You better watch yourself

402
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:58,234
I'm sorry.

403
00:36:05,048 --> 00:36:06,423
Wei Wei

404
00:36:08,637 --> 00:36:10,562
I thought I would never see everyone again.

405
00:36:10,757 --> 00:36:12,693
This is for you.

406
00:36:13,467 --> 00:36:14,985
It's perfume and cosmetics.

407
00:36:15,387 --> 00:36:16,586
Only sold in Shanghai

408
00:36:16,727 --> 00:36:17,960
I have this.

409
00:36:18,098 --> 00:36:18,977
Thank you.

410
00:36:19,397 --> 00:36:20,454
Thank you everyone.

411
00:36:21,397 --> 00:36:22,310
Oh yeah.

412
00:36:24,186 --> 00:36:25,517
You told me to bring it.

413
00:36:30,407 --> 00:36:33,707
These bracelets...I keep 1, you keep 1.

414
00:36:41,417 --> 00:36:42,836
This is from your mom.

415
00:36:45,916 --> 00:36:47,434
You are my best friend.

416
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:52,209
Alright, hurry, go go.

417
00:37:17,776 --> 00:37:19,063
Get me a box of cigarettes.

418
00:37:19,156 --> 00:37:20,212
Yes.

419
00:37:27,415 --> 00:37:28,559
Very nice to meet you.

420
00:37:38,044 --> 00:37:38,874
Sir

421
00:37:38,875 --> 00:37:40,030
enjoy your stay, OK.

422
00:37:42,595 --> 00:37:43,926
You dare mess at Mr. Lu place?

423
00:37:44,005 --> 00:37:44,884
It wasn't me

424
00:37:44,885 --> 00:37:46,579
Kiki, your cigarette.

425
00:37:49,384 --> 00:37:50,263
Excuse me.

426
00:37:50,264 --> 00:37:51,134
Bottoms up.

427
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:53,013
We are ready.

428
00:38:01,604 --> 00:38:04,354
Mr. Lu, who's the guy with glasses.

429
00:38:05,194 --> 00:38:06,064
Him?

430
00:38:07,155 --> 00:38:08,716
Businessman from England.

431
00:38:09,113 --> 00:38:11,402
High influence, up there with the English government.

432
00:38:12,573 --> 00:38:13,816
Quick with info too.

433
00:38:13,913 --> 00:38:14,826
Faster than you?

434
00:38:15,414 --> 00:38:17,516
If it's about France, yes

435
00:38:17,584 --> 00:38:18,959
I'm here.

436
00:38:21,254 --> 00:38:22,991
Don't go, come here.

437
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:24,414
Drink a little.

438
00:38:24,663 --> 00:38:27,105
Just got here, but stirring things up already...

439
00:38:27,504 --> 00:38:29,109
I want a half day off.

440
00:38:29,463 --> 00:38:30,751
Off for what?

441
00:38:31,254 --> 00:38:33,596
Me and him.

442
00:38:34,593 --> 00:38:35,462
Go out.

443
00:38:36,053 --> 00:38:37,384
You don't care right?

444
00:38:40,433 --> 00:38:41,302
I don't mind.

445
00:38:44,223 --> 00:38:45,102
Let's go!

446
00:38:46,143 --> 00:38:48,892
Kiki, where I want to go, you need not go.

447
00:38:49,442 --> 00:38:51,730
Cause you dare not take me?

448
00:39:10,082 --> 00:39:12,557
This is the General, let's fight.

449
00:39:12,792 --> 00:39:15,222
Let's watch.

450
00:39:16,922 --> 00:39:17,792
Come here.

451
00:39:20,761 --> 00:39:22,225
Any more seats? Who is that?

452
00:39:24,092 --> 00:39:25,741
Anybody else, no. For you, yes.

453
00:39:25,801 --> 00:39:27,726
Brothers, look who's here.

454
00:39:27,801 --> 00:39:29,408
Brother, come here.

455
00:39:31,062 --> 00:39:32,162
Everyone

456
00:39:32,522 --> 00:39:33,434
Kiki.

457
00:39:33,731 --> 00:39:34,788
Everyone introduce yourselves!

458
00:39:34,892 --> 00:39:35,815
I am Ta Chong

459
00:39:35,851 --> 00:39:36,907
Fu Hai

460
00:39:37,021 --> 00:39:37,890
I'm Chi Hie.

461
00:39:37,981 --> 00:39:38,850
DA Woh, Ting Hong.

462
00:39:40,481 --> 00:39:41,350
Ah Kian

463
00:39:41,481 --> 00:39:42,769
I'm Li Hsieh.

464
00:39:42,862 --> 00:39:45,149
Hello.

465
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,190
Big Brother, this beautiful lady.

466
00:39:48,111 --> 00:39:48,991
Your wife?

467
00:39:52,741 --> 00:39:55,085
Girlfriend!

468
00:39:55,122 --> 00:39:55,870
Lady Kiki, hotpot is okay?

469
00:39:55,871 --> 00:39:56,290
Of course!

470
00:39:56,291 --> 00:39:57,302
Let us...

471
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,004
Very good!

472
00:39:59,121 --> 00:40:01,056
Let me ask...

473
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:03,924
What powers have you got.. to control big brother!

474
00:40:10,471 --> 00:40:12,802
I dance at Casablanca night club ..

475
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:14,520
That's a hot job in Shanghai right now.

476
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,820
You're the best!

477
00:40:19,101 --> 00:40:20,113
Stop playing.

478
00:40:20,271 --> 00:40:22,238
Let's drink!

479
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:25,021
Big Brother, I wanna ask something.

480
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,696
We're happy that you're here today.

481
00:40:26,769 --> 00:40:28,419
Let me make the first toast.

482
00:40:28,439 --> 00:40:32,114
Let us remember our fallen brothers as well.

483
00:40:34,069 --> 00:40:37,868
Let's drink to our good brother...

484
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:38,738
Chen Zhen.

485
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,299
Alright, let's not talk about the past.

486
00:40:48,419 --> 00:40:49,248
Come on.

487
00:40:49,249 --> 00:40:50,118
Let's drink!

488
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:51,963
Zhi Shan?

489
00:40:53,759 --> 00:40:54,805
Thank you

490
00:40:56,969 --> 00:40:58,431
Kiki, hello.

491
00:40:58,678 --> 00:41:00,417
My sister.
Your sister?

492
00:41:01,509 --> 00:41:04,170
Why is it that you two don't look alike?

493
00:41:04,178 --> 00:41:05,235
Of course we don't!

494
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:07,242
Cause I'm better looking!

495
00:41:12,189 --> 00:41:14,300
Oh, you said Chen Zhen.

496
00:41:14,358 --> 00:41:17,384
The Chen Zhen that defeated Hong Khau?

497
00:41:17,399 --> 00:41:20,149
Yes.

498
00:41:20,609 --> 00:41:23,182
Wasn't he killed by the Japanese?

499
00:41:25,238 --> 00:41:26,250
He is still alive.

500
00:41:26,908 --> 00:41:28,696
There were a lot of rumors that year.

501
00:41:28,697 --> 00:41:30,492
But he definitely didn't get killed by the Japanese.

502
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:33,457
He went through life and death with us...

503
00:41:33,577 --> 00:41:35,183
...for 3 long years.

504
00:41:36,288 --> 00:41:37,806
Chen Zhen is my good brother.

505
00:41:37,918 --> 00:41:39,160
He is a good brother of ours, ain't that right?

506
00:41:39,297 --> 00:41:40,485
Yes.

507
00:41:40,587 --> 00:41:41,457
It's the truth!

508
00:41:41,628 --> 00:41:43,653
Though my eyes are small, I see very well.

509
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:45,778
Chen Zhen is a bad ass.

510
00:41:45,887 --> 00:41:46,756
Really?

511
00:41:46,887 --> 00:41:48,494
Yes, even Tu Dian is not as fast as him.

512
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:50,632
Bottoms up...

513
00:41:50,677 --> 00:41:52,195
Bottoms up!

514
00:41:52,217 --> 00:41:53,185
Let's drink!

515
00:42:42,807 --> 00:42:43,676
Lady Kiki.

516
00:42:44,347 --> 00:42:45,226
For you.

517
00:42:46,475 --> 00:42:47,344
Thank you!

518
00:42:47,475 --> 00:42:48,675
I won't bother you two.

519
00:42:51,025 --> 00:42:51,894
Look like me?

520
00:42:54,026 --> 00:42:55,490
It's good here...

521
00:42:55,607 --> 00:42:57,541
Everyone's kind-hearted.

522
00:42:57,735 --> 00:43:00,074
No one is trying to deceive you...

523
00:43:00,075 --> 00:43:01,725
Or put on a front.

524
00:43:02,905 --> 00:43:06,784
Living like this is nice.

525
00:43:06,785 --> 00:43:07,655
Yes.

526
00:43:26,885 --> 00:43:28,809
Stick, tiger, egg...

527
00:43:28,844 --> 00:43:29,768
Tiger!

528
00:43:30,645 --> 00:43:32,021
You lost

529
00:43:32,475 --> 00:43:33,662
I let you win!

530
00:43:36,104 --> 00:43:36,974
We've reached your home.

531
00:43:42,404 --> 00:43:43,274
Thank you.

532
00:44:04,583 --> 00:44:05,705
Thank you.

533
00:44:16,343 --> 00:44:17,212
Who are you?

534
00:44:21,513 --> 00:44:24,548
I count to 3, I'll shoot if you don't tell me.

535
00:44:36,492 --> 00:44:37,637
You drank a lot.

536
00:44:38,113 --> 00:44:39,256
Too much

537
00:44:41,112 --> 00:44:42,355
I'm going in.

538
00:44:46,122 --> 00:44:47,354
You carry a gun everyday?

539
00:44:48,832 --> 00:44:50,625
Shanghai is a complicated place.

540
00:44:51,332 --> 00:44:53,026
Mr. Lu let us have them for protection.

541
00:45:03,932 --> 00:45:06,318
Handsome, let me have your signature.

542
00:45:06,601 --> 00:45:08,803
Signing is not needed, but you can keep it.

543
00:45:09,812 --> 00:45:12,330
Then it's my reward for the day.

544
00:45:13,101 --> 00:45:13,971
Thank you!

545
00:45:16,691 --> 00:45:18,022
Who are you... really?

546
00:45:26,361 --> 00:45:27,285
Your real name...

547
00:45:28,161 --> 00:45:29,074
Feng Ching.

548
00:45:30,031 --> 00:45:31,086
Lady Feng Ching.

549
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:48,975
The Japanese map must be completed quickly.

550
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:50,789
Must deliver in 2 days.

551
00:45:50,971 --> 00:45:52,939
What's the situation regarding the artefacts?

552
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:55,599
Here is the map of China's artefacts.

553
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,139
Lots of valuable things.

554
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:59,614
Okay, take as much as you can.

555
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,946
Destroy anything you can't.

556
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,899
Valuable sources like this...

557
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,555
...in the hands of China, is such a waste!

558
00:46:08,691 --> 00:46:11,121
This country should be under Japan's control.

559
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:15,210
Colonel, classified news from Japan.

560
00:46:18,369 --> 00:46:19,238
Killed this many?

561
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:21,743
To kill this many in 1 month

562
00:46:22,499 --> 00:46:24,556
even using all of our manpower

563
00:46:24,789 --> 00:46:26,627
it is not possible.

564
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:31,691
To achieve Japan's dream, We must do justice.

565
00:46:31,919 --> 00:46:34,812
We just need extra effort.

566
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:39,126
This list...

567
00:46:39,299 --> 00:46:42,742
Contains those who publicly oppose Japan.

568
00:46:43,098 --> 00:46:44,607
Cannot let it leak out.

569
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:48,097
If not, Japan's killings would only increase.

570
00:46:48,348 --> 00:46:50,603
So England and U.S would do nothing?

571
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:53,228
When is Japan moving their troops here?

572
00:46:53,229 --> 00:46:55,065
Any word from England and U.S?

573
00:46:55,528 --> 00:46:56,398
No.

574
00:46:56,479 --> 00:46:57,722
When Japan set their troops here.

575
00:46:57,819 --> 00:46:59,699
They only want to benefit from it.

576
00:46:59,778 --> 00:47:02,572
Don't forget, this country is victorious in war.

577
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:04,359
But England, U.S, France.

578
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,787
Let Japan have Taiwan island.

579
00:47:06,948 --> 00:47:08,324
Without any talk or consideration.

580
00:47:08,499 --> 00:47:09,873
Only seeing to their own benefits.

581
00:47:15,328 --> 00:47:16,208
Headlines!

582
00:47:16,248 --> 00:47:18,173
Japan's assignations.

583
00:47:18,208 --> 00:47:19,956
Spark Radio reporting.

584
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,288
List of Japanese assassinations.

585
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:26,546
Killed for opposing...

586
00:47:26,547 --> 00:47:27,791
Jack Taylor...

587
00:47:28,258 --> 00:47:29,226
John Hanneke...

588
00:47:29,467 --> 00:47:31,260
Robert Wendon...

589
00:47:31,927 --> 00:47:36,668
Do Wen Chiu... He Chang... Ji Yong...

590
00:47:39,688 --> 00:47:41,205
This has already happened

591
00:47:41,437 --> 00:47:44,375
I want to know, what you guys are doing about it.

592
00:47:46,237 --> 00:47:47,238
Sit.

593
00:47:48,447 --> 00:47:52,076
We had a meeting this morning.

594
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:54,616
We were expecting something like this.

595
00:47:54,617 --> 00:47:56,729
Following it very closely.

596
00:47:56,787 --> 00:47:58,294
Not a big deal.

597
00:47:59,367 --> 00:48:01,115
Don't just say it

598
00:48:01,166 --> 00:48:03,223
I already know what you're gonna do.

599
00:48:03,287 --> 00:48:04,530
Talk to a superior?

600
00:48:04,627 --> 00:48:07,376
Talking to your superior is useless

601
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:19,000
I'm trying to run a business, then this happens.

602
00:48:19,016 --> 00:48:20,568
Do you know how much my business...

603
00:48:20,927 --> 00:48:22,169
would be harmed?

604
00:48:22,896 --> 00:48:24,315
Now everyone is worried?

605
00:48:24,476 --> 00:48:26,038
All customers are gone.

606
00:48:26,106 --> 00:48:27,161
What am I to do?

607
00:48:28,526 --> 00:48:31,550
I want to know what you are doing about it.

608
00:48:31,645 --> 00:48:34,583
Go protect people on this list

609
00:48:34,606 --> 00:48:37,586
...or find out who's behind this!

610
00:48:39,906 --> 00:48:43,524
You are the law, so you must do it yourself.

611
00:48:43,655 --> 00:48:47,285
Don't depend on that Tien Sun Hei guy.

612
00:48:51,876 --> 00:48:52,931
Alright, I'm done talking.

613
00:48:53,625 --> 00:48:56,375
This is my good brother, Qin Tiansheng.

614
00:48:56,585 --> 00:48:57,596
This is Mr Huang.

615
00:48:58,885 --> 00:49:00,304
Chief Investigator right? Hello

616
00:49:00,845 --> 00:49:02,351
I'm Huang Ciao Long.

617
00:49:05,345 --> 00:49:06,764
Boss, the Japanese are here.

618
00:49:06,845 --> 00:49:08,131
There seems to be a problem.

619
00:49:11,225 --> 00:49:12,830
Wait, wait pretty miss...

620
00:49:14,394 --> 00:49:15,725
Please take a seat.

621
00:49:16,845 --> 00:49:17,823
They are here.

622
00:49:18,024 --> 00:49:18,893
Mr. Owner.

623
00:49:19,524 --> 00:49:21,768
Sun Qi Chin, hello...

624
00:49:21,814 --> 00:49:23,057
Long-time no see.

625
00:49:23,114 --> 00:49:24,258
Have a smoke.

626
00:49:24,864 --> 00:49:25,733
Where are the girls?

627
00:49:25,984 --> 00:49:28,283
Why are there no girls sitting here?

628
00:49:28,284 --> 00:49:29,153
Sorry.

629
00:49:29,444 --> 00:49:30,368
Hurry.

630
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:32,871
Mr. Lu, I'll see to it for you.

631
00:49:32,914 --> 00:49:34,377
You can see, but what can you do?

632
00:49:34,744 --> 00:49:36,218
You dare kick him out?

633
00:49:36,494 --> 00:49:38,287
Where are the girls?

634
00:49:38,374 --> 00:49:39,242
Right away.

635
00:49:40,234 --> 00:49:40,806
Sorry.

636
00:49:41,964 --> 00:49:43,009
Get them here...what's with you?

637
00:49:43,164 --> 00:49:44,956
The beautiful lady is here.

638
00:49:45,004 --> 00:49:46,885
Come over here.

639
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:49,027
Please sit, sit.

640
00:49:49,673 --> 00:49:51,092
You help translate a bit...

641
00:49:51,173 --> 00:49:52,317
Okay, speak.

642
00:49:52,384 --> 00:49:54,932
Today, the ladies of Caca...

643
00:49:54,933 --> 00:49:57,453
...all don't want to sit with these Japanese folks.

644
00:49:57,643 --> 00:50:00,074
People will die, if you say that Lady Kiki.

645
00:50:00,103 --> 00:50:00,972
Say it...

646
00:50:01,683 --> 00:50:02,552
Say it!

647
00:50:03,853 --> 00:50:05,965
She says she won't sit with Japanese!

648
00:50:05,983 --> 00:50:07,809
- What?
- It's nothing!

649
00:50:07,853 --> 00:50:08,909
Wait a minute!

650
00:50:09,353 --> 00:50:10,551
Wait!

651
00:50:10,653 --> 00:50:12,490
Sorry...Hold it. ..

652
00:50:12,523 --> 00:50:14,085
How's it? I'm here.

653
00:50:14,193 --> 00:50:15,391
Let me!
Sit down!

654
00:50:17,113 --> 00:50:20,687
Sorry, I'm Qi Tiansheng.

655
00:50:20,862 --> 00:50:21,742
Nice to meet you!

656
00:50:23,993 --> 00:50:26,929
You're Qi Tiansheng, the business partner of Owner Lu right?

657
00:50:29,123 --> 00:50:30,640
Your info is good!

658
00:50:33,503 --> 00:50:34,371
Let me serve you!

659
00:50:36,132 --> 00:50:39,795
I'm not only good with info but also like to find things.

660
00:50:40,262 --> 00:50:43,012
This man in this picture is also Qin Tiansheng.

661
00:50:43,642 --> 00:50:45,381
I lost this picture a long time ago.

662
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:47,880
Thank you for finding it.

663
00:50:49,062 --> 00:50:52,218
No need to thank me. It wasn't hard to find.

664
00:50:52,731 --> 00:50:56,163
What's hard is telling who's real and who's not.

665
00:51:00,782 --> 00:51:03,157
Mr. Qin, do you know who the green hornet is?

666
00:51:04,531 --> 00:51:06,599
I've heard about this "green hornet" movie..

667
00:51:06,991 --> 00:51:08,597
Not a bad film really!

668
00:51:08,741 --> 00:51:11,722
After this movie came out, the box offices were packed.

669
00:51:11,831 --> 00:51:13,943
You've seen this movie?

670
00:51:15,331 --> 00:51:19,005
After the kill list comes out,
you think the Green Hornet would appear?

671
00:51:19,581 --> 00:51:20,912
You say the Green Hornet, huh...

672
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,112
Give me a sec, let me think...

673
00:51:26,171 --> 00:51:27,050
Yes!

674
00:51:31,301 --> 00:51:32,543
Then let us make a bet!

675
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:36,922
More people die, or more saved by the Green Hornet...

676
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:38,009
Okay?

677
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:39,060
What are we betting with?

678
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,349
A country!

679
00:52:16,339 --> 00:52:18,682
Colonel Chikaraishi, great to have you here.

680
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:20,281
What are we betting? A country?

681
00:52:20,469 --> 00:52:21,801
My business partner, you guys have met.

682
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:23,176
Interesting guy!

683
00:52:23,468 --> 00:52:27,018
Owner Lu, why accept Mr. Qin as new shareholder,

684
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:28,350
but deny us in joining you?

685
00:52:28,848 --> 00:52:31,236
This small business isn't fit for the Japanese.

686
00:52:31,269 --> 00:52:32,237
We want in!

687
00:52:33,109 --> 00:52:35,858
Then you can open another one.
Guaranteed that it'll be bigger than this place.

688
00:52:35,989 --> 00:52:37,309
You're not afraid of competition?

689
00:52:39,778 --> 00:52:43,354
If your place is a success, we'll close down right away!

690
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:46,360
The Japanese release of this kill list...

691
00:52:46,408 --> 00:52:49,115
Besides Chinese, there's British, U.S,
and French...What's your explanation?

692
00:52:50,158 --> 00:52:50,957
This list is fake!

693
00:52:50,958 --> 00:52:52,014
There's someone behind this trying to frame us!

694
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:55,037
Japanese troops are on the move. Are you guys invading China?

695
00:52:55,038 --> 00:52:57,381
Does Japan want to start WWII?

696
00:52:57,628 --> 00:52:59,695
My presence here at Casablanca is the best evidence!

697
00:53:00,087 --> 00:53:02,156
Japanese and Chinese are good friends.

698
00:53:02,178 --> 00:53:04,609
Me and Owner Lu are good friends.

699
00:53:05,047 --> 00:53:06,929
We will never become enemies

700
00:53:11,137 --> 00:53:13,294
I have to go. I'll come back when I have time.

701
00:53:15,097 --> 00:53:16,978
If you can, don't ever come back!

702
00:53:26,987 --> 00:53:29,187
Mr. Li Tze Men, wait a sec!

703
00:53:29,817 --> 00:53:31,698
I think you dropped this...

704
00:53:37,287 --> 00:53:38,475
It's mine. Thank you.

705
00:53:39,997 --> 00:53:41,745
Come to Japan sometime.

706
00:53:41,786 --> 00:53:43,261
Alright, next time.

707
00:53:48,967 --> 00:53:50,573
Boss, it's alright now.

708
00:53:51,546 --> 00:53:52,415
Alright?

709
00:53:54,006 --> 00:53:55,932
We just made enemies, and that's alright?

710
00:54:07,606 --> 00:54:08,475
Yên.

711
00:54:41,005 --> 00:54:42,336
Expert Lam, go to Hong Kong and hide!

712
00:54:42,465 --> 00:54:44,170
Okay, thank you ..

713
00:54:48,554 --> 00:54:50,205
Feng Ting, I'll take you home..

714
00:54:50,725 --> 00:54:51,594
Why is that?

715
00:54:52,395 --> 00:54:54,363
You forgot you upset the Japanese?

716
00:54:55,024 --> 00:54:57,951
There are lots of folks in Shanghai that upset the Japanese.

717
00:54:58,313 --> 00:54:59,557
How many can you protect?

718
00:55:00,524 --> 00:55:02,087
As many as I can.

719
00:55:02,615 --> 00:55:03,527
Careful!

720
00:55:53,573 --> 00:55:54,530
Headlines!

721
00:56:02,703 --> 00:56:05,134
Big Brother, tell the Hoa Chong brothers.

722
00:56:05,292 --> 00:56:06,524
Ready all our manpower! - Yes!

723
00:56:06,622 --> 00:56:07,590
Combine with the students.

724
00:56:08,583 --> 00:56:10,693
Fight back Japan!

725
00:56:10,791 --> 00:56:13,223
Save our China!

726
00:56:13,292 --> 00:56:15,954
Fight back Japan!

727
00:56:15,962 --> 00:56:18,437
Save our China!

728
00:56:21,932 --> 00:56:24,341
This is our China... How can I just leave?

729
00:56:24,342 --> 00:56:26,222
Just because you say that, we cannot lose you!

730
00:56:26,261 --> 00:56:27,142
It's only temporary leave.

731
00:56:27,262 --> 00:56:28,373
When it's safe, we'll bring you back.

732
00:56:29,682 --> 00:56:30,562
Who?
It's me, Hao.

733
00:56:30,602 --> 00:56:31,976
Attacking the old and young, even me.

734
00:56:32,231 --> 00:56:33,101
What did you do?

735
00:56:33,392 --> 00:56:34,403
I told you to protect everyone.

736
00:56:34,651 --> 00:56:36,708
Protect the scholars and educated minds

737
00:56:36,771 --> 00:56:38,333
I did follow your list of names.

738
00:56:38,401 --> 00:56:39,458
But those people...

739
00:56:39,572 --> 00:56:41,123
...don't wanna leave, what can I do?

740
00:56:41,192 --> 00:56:42,071
Threaten them!

741
00:56:42,741 --> 00:56:44,986
You good at that, right?

742
00:56:45,032 --> 00:56:48,331
What are you doing? Just go, go!

743
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:50,133
Don't push me! I won't push, just go!

744
00:56:51,292 --> 00:56:52,710
You people don't have the right to do this.

745
00:56:52,791 --> 00:56:54,672
There're worse things...you wanna try it?

746
00:56:55,211 --> 00:56:56,168
Get on, now!

747
00:56:58,630 --> 00:56:59,500
From the General!

748
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:03,047
After you release this list, a lot of people ran away!

749
00:57:03,251 --> 00:57:05,594
Then, doesn't that solve our problem?

750
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,905
Move aside..

751
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,281
Don't look!

752
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:14,299
Do not move!

753
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:24,650
3!

754
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:25,599
4!

755
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:26,773
5!

756
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:37,201
What are you guys doing? Why...

757
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:06,468
Listen!

758
00:58:06,769 --> 00:58:10,977
Us, the British, the Americans, Germans...
We need to get involved here..

759
00:58:10,978 --> 00:58:13,729
We must show the Japs who's in charge here!

760
00:58:17,699 --> 00:58:20,487
Fucking Japs! Do you hear me!

761
00:58:20,488 --> 00:58:21,357
Fuck all of you!

762
00:58:22,698 --> 00:58:23,887
Wow, how brave you are!

763
00:58:53,018 --> 00:58:54,668
Ever think about leaving Shanghai?

764
00:58:57,307 --> 00:58:58,968
It's not like I've never left Shanghai.

765
00:59:00,568 --> 00:59:03,361
This time's different, it's with me.

766
00:59:04,238 --> 00:59:05,107
Go where?

767
00:59:05,987 --> 00:59:07,131
Anywhere is fine.

768
00:59:09,827 --> 00:59:11,146
When Shanghai is less chaotic

769
00:59:13,497 --> 00:59:14,597
I'll take you with me.

770
00:59:16,247 --> 00:59:18,304
Right now, you have a lot of things to resolve.

771
00:59:22,206 --> 00:59:24,407
This world has lot of problems...

772
00:59:27,256 --> 00:59:28,125
How are you going to resolve them?

773
00:59:30,927 --> 00:59:32,576
If everyone leaves just like you...

774
00:59:35,426 --> 00:59:36,626
This place won't exist.

775
00:59:37,926 --> 00:59:40,225
With no country, there's still a home.

776
00:59:46,225 --> 00:59:47,281
You're not afraid of death?

777
00:59:49,856 --> 00:59:50,725
Everyone dies.

778
00:59:52,946 --> 00:59:54,783
It's important to die with meaning.

779
00:59:55,486 --> 00:59:56,355
Right?

780
01:00:13,835 --> 01:00:15,485
When the ships dock, work with each other.

781
01:00:16,585 --> 01:00:18,422
Watch the spacing between ships.

782
01:00:24,174 --> 01:00:25,880
Now is when we show our nation's force.

783
01:00:26,805 --> 01:00:29,423
Going against China's army...

784
01:00:30,305 --> 01:00:32,923
Number is not an issue..

785
01:00:32,935 --> 01:00:34,309
We are for sure stronger!

786
01:00:34,433 --> 01:00:35,303
Correct!

787
01:00:38,694 --> 01:00:40,025
Then let's join together.

788
01:00:58,623 --> 01:01:00,416
Don't you love to write? Keep writing!

789
01:01:00,463 --> 01:01:01,608
Let's see how you write next time?

790
01:02:56,931 --> 01:02:57,855
Chen Zhen..

791
01:02:59,059 --> 01:03:01,448
Don't give up!

792
01:03:51,269 --> 01:03:53,656
Boss, Chong from LuShan Times died!

793
01:04:00,657 --> 01:04:02,672
So did the deputy editor...

794
01:04:04,289 --> 01:04:05,289
Search again to be sure!

795
01:04:40,188 --> 01:04:41,331
Your little brother died!

796
01:05:11,676 --> 01:05:12,962
My good war brother taught me this piece.

797
01:05:14,597 --> 01:05:15,554
To save our country..

798
01:05:23,855 --> 01:05:25,043
He was sacrificed in a battle with foreigners.

799
01:05:36,945 --> 01:05:37,957
Till this day..

800
01:05:40,116 --> 01:05:41,579
The sacrifices continues...

801
01:05:47,705 --> 01:05:53,162
Long live! Long live! Long live!

802
01:05:56,126 --> 01:05:59,611
Japan's 80 planes bombarded the General's battlefield nonstop

803
01:06:00,424 --> 01:06:03,044
Japanese ground troops at Honglong Giang blocks his retreat.

804
01:06:03,216 --> 01:06:04,502
Munitions are also destroyed ..

805
01:06:04,925 --> 01:06:07,499
Let us unite, to defeat Japan.

806
01:06:07,515 --> 01:06:08,484
Fight Back against Japan!

807
01:06:08,845 --> 01:06:11,231
Save our China!

808
01:06:12,474 --> 01:06:13,969
These same old sayings, over and over!

809
01:06:14,274 --> 01:06:15,551
These sayings are useless!

810
01:06:15,685 --> 01:06:16,697
Just get the guns.

811
01:06:17,315 --> 01:06:18,184
Don't be rash!

812
01:06:18,695 --> 01:06:19,563
To get ammo..

813
01:06:19,694 --> 01:06:20,883
Right, that's it. Fight fast, win fast!

814
01:06:21,565 --> 01:06:22,808
Cannot do this idea!

815
01:06:28,575 --> 01:06:29,674
We can't just sit and wait.

816
01:06:30,824 --> 01:06:31,968
This time we must raise our flags!

817
01:07:36,961 --> 01:07:39,074
Lady, your wine!

818
01:07:39,223 --> 01:07:40,092
Thank you!

819
01:07:56,562 --> 01:07:57,442
Sorry!

820
01:08:09,702 --> 01:08:11,219
You got something to tell me?

821
01:08:21,752 --> 01:08:24,962
1 sugar, 2 sugar..

822
01:08:25,470 --> 01:08:26,427
No milk?

823
01:08:35,890 --> 01:08:39,751
Why are you here at Casablanca?

824
01:08:41,161 --> 01:08:43,328
I'm a dance girl..

825
01:08:44,230 --> 01:08:45,979
So now you won't accept me.

826
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:48,000
Wanna know this lowly girl origin?

827
01:08:56,990 --> 01:09:01,356
You do not smoke, why tell Hong Lian to buy them?

828
01:09:07,170 --> 01:09:08,820
I don't know what you're talking about

829
01:09:13,469 --> 01:09:18,464
I really hope you can tell me that
you don't work for the Japanese.

830
01:09:56,338 --> 01:09:58,494
Don't come back here again!

831
01:10:02,007 --> 01:10:07,508
If you come back, I will kill you.

832
01:11:09,236 --> 01:11:10,237
Let me go!

833
01:11:10,606 --> 01:11:12,586
No, don't hurt Kiki!

834
01:11:12,776 --> 01:11:14,062
I am the General's girlfriend!

835
01:11:14,315 --> 01:11:16,571
Anything you wanna say to him, he'll answer you guys.

836
01:11:16,866 --> 01:11:18,011
Don't throw Kiki into the water!

837
01:11:19,656 --> 01:11:20,943
Do you guys understand what I'm saying?

838
01:11:22,366 --> 01:11:24,070
Kiki, don't be scared!

839
01:11:24,285 --> 01:11:25,979
They only want the General to listen to them.

840
01:11:28,456 --> 01:11:29,599
You know her?

841
01:11:31,956 --> 01:11:32,836
You don't know her!

842
01:11:34,625 --> 01:11:36,781
She's not Kiki, she's Sunko Yomei.

843
01:11:37,175 --> 01:11:39,506
She is Japanese.

844
01:11:42,076 --> 01:11:43,231
What do you want?

845
01:11:53,315 --> 01:11:54,822
Thu Phe Yen has Yin Tze ..

846
01:11:55,855 --> 01:11:56,724
I have her..

847
01:11:57,895 --> 01:12:00,281
Both sides have the best spies.

848
01:12:01,404 --> 01:12:04,364
You cannot touch her, she's General Zeng's girl!

849
01:12:04,365 --> 01:12:05,926
We can still use her..

850
01:12:08,115 --> 01:12:08,896
She can be our hostage..

851
01:12:09,115 --> 01:12:10,720
This is a lowly method... using a woman for blackmail.

852
01:12:12,074 --> 01:12:15,879
Do you think I'll do it?

853
01:12:29,804 --> 01:12:32,279
This country needs an army to create confusion.

854
01:12:33,724 --> 01:12:36,561
General Zhuo is against the idea of General Zeng working with us.

855
01:12:37,723 --> 01:12:39,747
So he sent someone to kill his wife.

856
01:12:42,484 --> 01:12:47,521
Sunko Yomei, it is you who will make this happen.

857
01:13:02,372 --> 01:13:05,486
Lt. Sunko Yomei, congratulations for accomplishing this

858
01:13:06,293 --> 01:13:08,493
I will report to my chain of command in Tokyo!

859
01:13:39,231 --> 01:13:40,155
Sorry to bother you!

860
01:13:41,322 --> 01:13:45,172
I'm Huang Ciao Long from the police station.

861
01:13:45,982 --> 01:13:47,005
What do you want?

862
01:13:47,281 --> 01:13:50,592
I'm here to see Colonel Li Tze Men.

863
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:00,793
My wife.

864
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:16,934
Why so much?

865
01:14:17,231 --> 01:14:20,100
Great, Chen Zhen calls us here, but he doesn't show up!

866
01:14:20,101 --> 01:14:22,081
Alright, our plan depends on 3 main points.

867
01:14:22,151 --> 01:14:23,437
First, timing...

868
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,588
Since we are splitting up, we must arrive back at the same time!

869
01:14:25,690 --> 01:14:27,164
Second, it's timing!

870
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:28,979
One extra second is one more danger.

871
01:14:29,070 --> 01:14:30,676
Third, it's still timing!

872
01:14:30,780 --> 01:14:31,650
Here, hold it!

873
01:14:32,451 --> 01:14:33,364
Hurry and go! what you doing here?

874
01:14:33,451 --> 01:14:34,462
Come with us!

875
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:36,345
I've got it here, I'm the Chief Investigator.

876
01:14:36,409 --> 01:14:37,278
You're useless!

877
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:44,130
Continue!

878
01:14:44,131 --> 01:14:44,999
Hurry!

879
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:46,119
Go!

880
01:15:35,798 --> 01:15:36,941
Why is he here?

881
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:38,826
He is our country's enemy, that's why!

882
01:15:38,878 --> 01:15:40,627
Every Chinese is our enemy!

883
01:15:41,338 --> 01:15:43,175
How many can you imprison here?

884
01:15:45,889 --> 01:15:47,131
What are you questioning him about?

885
01:15:47,557 --> 01:15:48,426
Nothing.

886
01:15:53,438 --> 01:15:55,957
Chen Zhen, you're being sloppy.

887
01:15:56,689 --> 01:16:02,010
Last year, you killed a man named Li Tze Chong.

888
01:16:06,448 --> 01:16:08,053
That person is my father...

889
01:16:35,596 --> 01:16:37,433
We Chinese are not the Sick Men of Asia.

890
01:16:46,937 --> 01:16:48,541
Sir! Something happened at headquarters.

891
01:16:49,065 --> 01:16:50,759
We Chinese are not the Sick Men of Asia!

892
01:16:53,656 --> 01:16:54,569
Release him!

893
01:16:55,486 --> 01:16:57,324
I still want a battle of life or death with you...

894
01:16:59,535 --> 01:17:02,010
To revenge my father's death!

895
01:17:09,626 --> 01:17:10,539
Hurry!

896
01:17:17,545 --> 01:17:18,558
Japanese troops are here! Scram!

897
01:17:24,225 --> 01:17:25,687
Hurry! Get out!

898
01:17:26,134 --> 01:17:28,291
Over here, quickly!

899
01:17:28,645 --> 01:17:29,646
Run!

900
01:17:35,684 --> 01:17:37,070
Hurry, over here!

901
01:17:38,154 --> 01:17:39,298
Hide over here!

902
01:17:43,985 --> 01:17:45,084
Hurry! Get in!

903
01:17:45,655 --> 01:17:46,524
Hurry!

904
01:17:53,494 --> 01:17:55,332
Stop! Don't you run!

905
01:18:00,793 --> 01:18:03,455
Idiot! Where did you place the bombs?

906
01:18:16,763 --> 01:18:18,194
Fire! Put out the fire!

907
01:18:37,452 --> 01:18:39,652
Chen Zhen the game ends now!

908
01:18:56,213 --> 01:18:57,093
Mr. Qin!

909
01:18:57,262 --> 01:18:58,131
Come and help!

910
01:19:16,902 --> 01:19:17,815
Kill!

911
01:19:50,350 --> 01:19:53,376
Don't worry, you're Chen Zhen's sister.

912
01:19:53,601 --> 01:19:55,020
How can I kill you?

913
01:19:57,641 --> 01:19:58,521
Take her!

914
01:20:27,879 --> 01:20:28,748
Move. Make way!

915
01:20:30,469 --> 01:20:31,383
Move!

916
01:20:32,630 --> 01:20:34,192
You watch here! You come here!

917
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:36,835
Get back, step back. There's nothing to see.

918
01:20:52,858 --> 01:20:55,379
My people wake up, wake up!

919
01:20:55,570 --> 01:20:58,275
Fight back, save the homeland!

920
01:20:58,949 --> 01:21:01,467
Save our country!

921
01:21:01,618 --> 01:21:04,456
Disband Japan!

922
01:21:04,748 --> 01:21:07,631
Our people wake up!

923
01:21:07,749 --> 01:21:10,455
Our people wake up!

924
01:21:11,079 --> 01:21:13,839
Save our country!

925
01:21:19,629 --> 01:21:21,971
Special report, Shanghai Radio.

926
01:21:22,548 --> 01:21:26,497
The North Army attacked General Zhuo...
heavy losses

927
01:21:26,847 --> 01:21:28,541
30,000 casualties...

928
01:21:28,807 --> 01:21:31,922
The NE Army is losing hope...

929
01:21:34,058 --> 01:21:35,940
You're having a good sleep!

930
01:21:37,857 --> 01:21:38,726
You're good!

931
01:21:40,237 --> 01:21:42,569
With the situation like this out there,
you still can sleep.

932
01:21:46,118 --> 01:21:49,879
Now I think I'm the one running things.

933
01:21:50,157 --> 01:21:53,830
You're something else, just sleeping.

934
01:21:55,998 --> 01:21:57,736
But do you know what time it is now?

935
01:21:57,787 --> 01:22:00,405
It's to the brink of disaster out there, Wake up!

936
01:22:00,587 --> 01:22:03,045
I can't... I can't handle it all.

937
01:22:03,046 --> 01:22:05,433
Are you really Chen Zhen? You need to wake up!

938
01:22:13,466 --> 01:22:15,996
Fight Japan, Save country! Fight Japan, Save Country.

939
01:22:16,386 --> 01:22:19,324
Preserve our homeland! Preserve our homeland.

940
01:22:19,397 --> 01:22:21,454
Disband Japan! Disband Japan.

941
01:22:22,687 --> 01:22:25,525
My people wake up!

942
01:22:25,526 --> 01:22:28,364
Protect our country!

943
01:22:28,486 --> 01:22:30,223
Disband Japan!

944
01:22:30,276 --> 01:22:31,696
Okay, okay Stop yelling.

945
01:22:32,157 --> 01:22:33,433
You noisy kids, what good does that do?

946
01:22:33,946 --> 01:22:35,046
Go back, go back home!

947
01:22:35,945 --> 01:22:37,321
That is Japan's Territory ahead...

948
01:22:37,446 --> 01:22:38,777
I can't help you all if you cross that line.

949
01:22:38,906 --> 01:22:39,873
Who needs your help?

950
01:22:40,115 --> 01:22:41,704
We don't need you patrol dogs to help!

951
01:22:41,705 --> 01:22:43,169
Right! you all are Japan's lap dogs.

952
01:22:43,246 --> 01:22:44,764
You do not represent us Chinese!

953
01:22:45,336 --> 01:22:47,162
Besides taking bribes, what else do you do?

954
01:22:47,296 --> 01:22:48,296
Don't speak nonsense here!

955
01:22:48,666 --> 01:22:50,612
You all, don't come near!

956
01:22:51,625 --> 01:22:53,418
They fired!

957
01:22:55,005 --> 01:22:56,568
Stop your fire!

958
01:22:56,716 --> 01:22:57,585
Who fired?

959
01:22:59,056 --> 01:23:01,299
Stop, stop your fire!

960
01:23:09,975 --> 01:23:12,636
Stop, stop!

961
01:23:22,865 --> 01:23:24,833
You won't control these students who started firing...

962
01:23:24,905 --> 01:23:26,741
Now you tell me to let them go?

963
01:23:27,494 --> 01:23:30,101
No, think about it, where did they get guns?

964
01:23:30,124 --> 01:23:32,369
Must be someone else trying to start things.

965
01:23:32,415 --> 01:23:33,878
The students must be punished!

966
01:23:34,495 --> 01:23:36,924
If not, how can I socialize with the Japanese?

967
01:23:36,954 --> 01:23:38,560
You socialize with them?

968
01:23:38,664 --> 01:23:39,863
Is this not English territory?

969
01:23:42,213 --> 01:23:43,314
So useless!

970
01:23:45,305 --> 01:23:46,305
You don't want to work here anymore?

971
01:23:46,964 --> 01:23:48,668
Stay off!

972
01:23:53,343 --> 01:23:54,861
This is China!

973
01:23:56,015 --> 01:23:57,719
It's you that needs to get lost!

974
01:23:58,104 --> 01:24:00,482
Let me tell you something,
I can't stand you all pale skin pigs...

975
01:24:00,483 --> 01:24:02,089
Dancing around right in front of my face

976
01:24:02,483 --> 01:24:03,814
I really want to tell your superiors...

977
01:24:03,903 --> 01:24:05,729
how much money do you take from us monthly!

978
01:24:05,863 --> 01:24:07,414
Let's see who should get lost.

979
01:24:08,364 --> 01:24:10,201
Look at you! All day, you copy those dog foreigners.

980
01:24:10,654 --> 01:24:12,621
Without us, can you be so relaxed?

981
01:24:12,782 --> 01:24:14,939
Without us, you can do nothing here!

982
01:24:15,033 --> 01:24:16,958
You think you get to keep this job, for such a long time?

983
01:24:17,742 --> 01:24:19,668
You still want to socialize with the Japanese?

984
01:24:20,334 --> 01:24:21,522
Socialize my ass!

985
01:24:22,583 --> 01:24:24,969
What? Something is wrong?

986
01:24:26,373 --> 01:24:27,297
Can't understand me?

987
01:24:28,002 --> 01:24:29,696
Then let me use English.

988
01:24:30,502 --> 01:24:32,659
You are useless!

989
01:24:33,963 --> 01:24:35,899
Let me tell you, our country China
has been here for thousands of years.

990
01:24:35,923 --> 01:24:37,484
Countless times, foreigners try to invade us.

991
01:24:38,472 --> 01:24:40,804
We give them only 2 words in the end,
"get lost"!

992
01:24:41,142 --> 01:24:42,055
Yeah!

993
01:24:46,183 --> 01:24:47,151
Let me free the students...

994
01:24:49,021 --> 01:24:49,891
Whatever...

995
01:25:11,162 --> 01:25:12,042
Awake, he's awake.

996
01:25:12,121 --> 01:25:13,221
Thank the stars! He is up.

997
01:25:13,830 --> 01:25:14,700
Brother Chen!

998
01:25:16,211 --> 01:25:17,399
He's up, Doctor!

999
01:25:17,541 --> 01:25:18,421
Hurry, come here!

1000
01:25:23,052 --> 01:25:26,218
Ting Hong, Fu Hai, Thong Man, DA Woh!

1001
01:25:26,391 --> 01:25:28,217
One by one right in front of us..

1002
01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:31,040
That's what the Japanese want.

1003
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:32,517
They wanted to show the people of China...

1004
01:25:34,392 --> 01:25:35,260
What should we do now?

1005
01:25:36,730 --> 01:25:40,767
When I left, Zhi Shan, she...

1006
01:26:00,919 --> 01:26:04,539
I'm okay, brother Chen

1007
01:26:05,669 --> 01:26:07,044
I am really alright...

1008
01:26:15,929 --> 01:26:20,098
Headlines! Headlines! General Zhuo has lost!

1009
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:25,030
General Zhuo has lost completely...

1010
01:26:25,059 --> 01:26:27,402
Japan and General Zeng joined forces to defeat him.

1011
01:26:28,609 --> 01:26:29,885
Both husband and wife are dead!

1012
01:26:32,028 --> 01:26:33,405
And the list of names...

1013
01:26:33,610 --> 01:26:35,997
In there, some are dead, some escaped.

1014
01:26:37,198 --> 01:26:38,529
We've lost, let's surrender...

1015
01:26:40,829 --> 01:26:42,434
Just 2 of us cannot save the world.

1016
01:26:47,249 --> 01:26:48,118
My brother!

1017
01:27:07,927 --> 01:27:10,041
Is it Kiki ? Am I mistaken?

1018
01:27:19,897 --> 01:27:22,242
I'm worried. You haven't worked for some time.

1019
01:27:23,108 --> 01:27:24,713
You look very good in that!

1020
01:27:25,367 --> 01:27:28,348
I'm part of the Japan army secret force.

1021
01:27:31,247 --> 01:27:32,347
Lady General!

1022
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:36,308
Merry Christmas!

1023
01:27:40,917 --> 01:27:43,666
I represent the Japanese Army to meet you

1024
01:27:43,966 --> 01:27:46,399
I hope you can find one person.

1025
01:27:49,216 --> 01:27:50,866
This is one of my people?

1026
01:27:51,557 --> 01:27:52,470
I don't know.

1027
01:27:53,557 --> 01:27:54,656
His name is Chen Zhen.

1028
01:27:55,516 --> 01:27:58,158
Did Chen Zhen not die?

1029
01:28:01,726 --> 01:28:04,344
We're also holding his accomplice, named Ta Kang.

1030
01:28:05,356 --> 01:28:07,974
What if I don't give him up?

1031
01:28:08,566 --> 01:28:10,026
In the interest of Japan immigrants...

1032
01:28:10,027 --> 01:28:12,370
We expanded our patrol area of protection to them.

1033
01:28:12,566 --> 01:28:13,853
Colonel Li Tze Men, he...

1034
01:28:15,575 --> 01:28:17,358
Has prepared the troops...

1035
01:28:19,455 --> 01:28:21,612
Then you're saying, if I can't give you the person..

1036
01:28:21,746 --> 01:28:24,266
You'll find an excuse to fight, right?

1037
01:28:27,835 --> 01:28:33,060
These shameless animals. You need to do this?

1038
01:28:34,177 --> 01:28:35,364
You have no other option.

1039
01:28:44,015 --> 01:28:44,884
You!

1040
01:28:46,186 --> 01:28:47,242
We still have...

1041
01:28:47,356 --> 01:28:48,225
You!

1042
01:28:50,934 --> 01:28:51,703
What's happened?

1043
01:28:51,704 --> 01:28:52,915
Keep still!

1044
01:28:55,564 --> 01:28:57,259
Now... I have an option.

1045
01:29:00,904 --> 01:29:04,711
Master, why did you start Jing Wu School?

1046
01:29:05,405 --> 01:29:07,703
To protect China, Chen Zhen.

1047
01:30:24,932 --> 01:30:26,307
Chen Zhen will win!

1048
01:30:27,482 --> 01:30:28,944
Jing Wu will live forever!

1049
01:30:31,942 --> 01:30:32,954
Chen Zhen will win!

1050
01:30:34,322 --> 01:30:35,786
Jing Wu will live forever!

1051
01:31:02,511 --> 01:31:03,699
I've been waiting a long time...

1052
01:31:09,561 --> 01:31:10,793
10 years of no martial art training.

1053
01:31:10,931 --> 01:31:12,131
Everything is the same

1054
01:31:12,272 --> 01:31:15,251
Japan is mighty.

1055
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:17,944
There will only be one outcome.

1056
01:31:18,191 --> 01:31:19,060
We also have one outcome.

1057
01:31:20,610 --> 01:31:22,305
You must be crazy!

1058
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:29,579
You promised not to kill him.

1059
01:31:30,121 --> 01:31:33,321
You need to know one thing.

1060
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:35,768
Those who oppose Japan, I will not let them live.

1061
01:31:36,870 --> 01:31:37,739
Watch her!

1062
01:31:43,590 --> 01:31:44,921
And you...

1063
01:31:48,421 --> 01:31:50,301
If you don't want to end up like her...

1064
01:31:51,339 --> 01:31:53,814
Then you just do what we do.

1065
01:32:00,980 --> 01:32:01,848
Chen Zhen.

1066
01:32:02,769 --> 01:32:07,906
Women are just objects for men to use.

1067
01:32:08,569 --> 01:32:12,827
So our method is, your little sister is...

1068
01:35:01,544 --> 01:35:02,424
You all listen...

1069
01:35:02,754 --> 01:35:04,459
China is not the Sick Man of Asia.

1070
01:35:14,144 --> 01:35:17,443
Stop! Everyone get back!

1071
01:35:17,683 --> 01:35:19,157
I want to fight him.

1072
01:35:54,342 --> 01:35:56,862
Things between us shouldn't have started.

1073
01:35:57,093 --> 01:36:01,822
Chen Zhen, I hurt you...

1074
01:36:12,902 --> 01:36:13,771
Come here!

1075
01:36:53,271 --> 01:36:54,140
You...

1076
01:36:57,351 --> 01:36:59,100
What? I'm here!

1077
01:38:23,348 --> 01:38:24,449
We'll make it back to China.

1078
01:38:26,388 --> 01:38:27,532
We'll march forward together.

1079
01:38:29,018 --> 01:38:30,349
Our battlefield in China.

1080
01:38:30,728 --> 01:38:32,191
We only need to stick together.

1081
01:38:32,308 --> 01:38:35,201
No other country, no other man can defeat us

1082
01:38:35,608 --> 01:38:36,753
I told you to protect everyone!

1083
01:38:39,447 --> 01:38:40,911
We've lost, nothing else we can do...

1084
01:38:42,238 --> 01:38:43,525
Protect our homeland!

1085
01:38:43,817 --> 01:38:46,524
Are you not Chen Zhen? Wake up!

1086
01:42:07,292 --> 01:42:08,623
General, this way.

1087
01:42:08,702 --> 01:42:09,502
Salute!
