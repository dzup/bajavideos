1
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:12,753
Here, the earth rocks when you walk.
The water table's high here, you see.

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,396
When it rains,
the fields turn into a giant swamp.

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,549
That's when the cattle sink in
and have to be hauled out with chains.

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,878
Once a cow sank so deep
into the mud, it vanished.

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,039
Six months later it turned up again,
inflated like a balloon.

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:37,555
It gave birth to a two-headed calf
with a calf's head and a human head.

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,629
You've got to keep such a freak
out of sight. Everyone knows that.

8
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,630
Still, the farmer kept it. Soon after
the cattle got mad cows disease -

9
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,755
- and the women lost
their unborn children and their minds.

10
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,155
The men gathered at the bar, -

11
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,990
- and one early morning
they dumped the beast in the bog -

12
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,510
- where it sank with a wretched roar.

13
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,111
Since then, there hasn't been any fuss
with neither cattle nor women.

14
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,630
THIS STORY IS BASED
ON ACTUAL EVENTS

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,959
You just snapped? Or...

16
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,275
Hell, it can happen to the best of us.

17
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:46,077
You're getting a second chance.
That's the good thing about the police.

18
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:54,158
- I don't suppose much happens here.
- When it does, just report it to me.

19
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,673
- So I know you've got a handle on it.
- Of course.

20
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,159
We'll soon have you back
in Copenhagen. If you want to go back.

21
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,754
- You might like it out here.
- I doubt it.

22
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:16,715
What if you find yourself
a new little missus here, eh?

23
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,995
He's here.

24
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,556
- Alone?
- With the chief from Tønder.

25
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,513
Mojn. That's what we say here.
It means both hello and goodbye.

26
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:44,039
If the chumps give you any trouble,
just call Tønder.

27
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,509
Hi there.

28
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:35,678
Oh, hi.
Dr. Zerlang, the local quack.

29
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,639
- Robert.
- I live across the street.

30
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,675
- Welcome. How was your trip?
- Longer than I'd expected.

31
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,955
I'm from Copenhagen, too. Or Virum.
But that's the same thing over here.

32
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,199
I only meant to stay
for a couple of weeks.

33
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,678
We've got lots to talk about, you and I.
It's going to be great.

34
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,157
- Do you play cards?
- Sorry, I don't play.

35
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,388
Your predecessor did. And so
does the shopkeeper and the priest.

36
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,718
Well, I'm afraid I don't.

37
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,552
The locals had rather seen a marshal
with local blood in his veins.

38
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,432
- They like to handle things themselves.
- I see.

39
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:34,430
Good thing for everyone
I'm only here for a short while, then.

40
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,553
I actually came to give you this.

41
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:44,198
It belonged to the old marshal, and
I've been looking after it until you came.

42
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,995
Otherwise it's going into the bog.

43
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,235
You've reached Josefine,
Hanne and Squeaky.

44
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:30,879
We can't answer the phone right now.
Leave a message after the beep.

45
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,960
Mojn.

46
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,714
Hello.

47
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,759
You won't find anyone.
The new guy's gone.

48
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,271
- The new guy?
- He's newer than the old guy, anyway.

49
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,758
- From Tønder. But no one used him.
- Why not?

50
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:13,839
Ingelise Buhl from the machine pool.
You're new, too.

51
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:20,798
- For a brief spell.
- Good... that you're here, I mean.

52
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:27,478
- He just up and left his shop?
- No, he disappeared.

53
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,116
- Disappeared?
- The way people disappear here.

54
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:36,952
- I'd better not say any more.
- Mojn.

55
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,069
- Mojn.
- We have reserved seats here.

56
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:57,035
Funny, the old marshal always
came in for his beer around this time.

57
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,756
I'm the new marshal
so I just want a soda.

58
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:10,159
- Mineral water?
- Please.

59
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,391
- Where's the new bicycle dealer?
- Has he disappeared?

60
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:22,550
If you can't find him,
maybe you should see a cyclelogist.

61
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,189
Cyclelogist.

62
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,519
You've reached Josefine,
Hanne and Squeaky.

63
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,429
We can't answer the phone right...

64
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,835
Is this a bad time?
It's me with the bike.

65
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:49,876
Forget what I said about
the bicycle dealer. About the bog.

66
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:55,279
- You didn't mention the bog.
- Just forget it.

67
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,670
- Is anything wrong?
- Can I trust you?

68
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,316
I am the marshal.

69
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:14,268
- What if you want a divorce?
- Not really a police matter, huh.

70
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,314
- If your husband beats you?
- Does he?

71
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,516
Yesterday, he slapped me.

72
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,795
- Just like that?
- Just because I said you looked good.

73
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,552
- Your picture was in the weekly.
- Well, that's asking for it, isn't it?

74
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:46,191
- Do you want to report him?
- I talked to the old marshal about it.

75
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,233
He told Jørgen so I got another beating.

76
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,515
A month ago Dr. Zerlang had
to stitch me up. Look.

77
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:07,916
- You shouldn't put up with that.
- I have a daughter.

78
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,272
- She's nine.
- Does he beat her, too?

79
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:19,430
Not yet. She takes the baby carriage
out for a stroll when...

80
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,712
When what?

81
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:30,713
Jørgen is dangerous.
You can't imagine how dangerous.

82
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,437
Well, now you know.

83
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,874
Since it's the police asking, yes.

84
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:55,872
Jørgen has broken arms, legs
and noses all around town.

85
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:02,599
- Mostly when he's drunk.
- Hasn't anyone filed a report?

86
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,510
A report? No.
Who'd dare report Jørgen?

87
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,871
- The wife?
- Especially not her.

88
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,072
Does he beat her?

89
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:19,070
The old marshal thought she
beat herself in order to get attention.

90
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,993
By the way, I received your
medical record from Copenhagen.

91
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,830
I thought you might need
some more pills, just to settle down.

92
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,478
- After that business.
- I've got a handle on it.

93
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:23,391
- Robert speaking. Skarrild Police.
- Moos here. Where the hell are you?

94
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,277
- I'm on patrol. What's up?
- I caught a shoplifter red-handed.

95
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,631
- Yes?
- Are you coming or what?

96
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,752
Mojn.

97
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,869
In here.

98
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,955
Something's been stolen?

99
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,598
- He hid it under his coat.
- Where's the thief?

100
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,117
Get out here.

101
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,359
Here's the culprit. Knud is his name.

102
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,710
- Surname?
- We call him Klepto.

103
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:39,517
- Is this your first offense, Knud?
- Robert, come here.

104
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,596
That's not how we do things.

105
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,875
The old marshal just clipped them
on the ear and sent them on their way.

106
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,790
- I don't hit children.
- But you'll just get Tønder involved.

107
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,076
Then he'll get an even worse beating
at home, and they won't wear gloves.

108
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,149
Okay, Knud.

109
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:20,392
I'll let you off with a warning,
but next time you're in for it. Off you go.

110
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,670
- Hello, Marshall.
- Hello.

111
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,679
I hear you've talked to my wife.

112
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:54,312
I don't know who you are or what
you mean. Just get out of my car.

113
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,876
She showed you her scar.

114
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,791
She cut herself with a broken bottle.

115
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:11,551
It's your word against hers.
I want you to get out of my car.

116
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,550
Know what this is?

117
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:22,036
Ingelise with a bread knife.

118
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:28,315
She hasn't been right in the head
since she had Dorthe. Crazy.

119
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:34,789
- In that case she needs help.
- I love her. I love her, get it?

120
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,832
And I take care of her
but you're upsetting her.

121
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,192
I'm just doing my job.

122
00:18:53,720 --> 00:19:00,114
You don't understand our ways
even though Moos tried to teach you.

123
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,829
- Right, Knud?
- What the hell are you doing?

124
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,999
- Giving you a hand.
- Don't ever do that again.

125
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,990
You mind your business,
and I'll mind mine.

126
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,674
Hanne speaking... Don't call us.

127
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,113
I just wanted to let you know I'm in
South Jutland. "Mojn" and all that.

128
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,598
I want to talk to Josefine.

129
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,713
- Why?
- I just want to hear her voice.

130
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:03,710
Well, you can't.
You'll only make her cry. Bye.

131
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:31,515
It's clear you're not from around here,
the way you hang up your washing.

132
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:42,509
It's so disorganized.
Look at the neighbor's.

133
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:51,158
Here, we hang up towels next to towels,
and then trousers-

134
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,148
- and finally socks. In pairs.

135
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:03,469
- Is that how you do it?
- No, but then I'm from Aabenraa.

136
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:15,953
There. Now we're like them.
Mr. And Mrs. Normal.

137
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:25,037
- Why are you spying on me?
- It's purely routine.

138
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:31,793
- Bored already?
- Just trying to find out what's what.

139
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:38,236
What are you going to do?
About my life.

140
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,557
- What do you want me to do?
- I told you about my husband.

141
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:48,916
- You seem happy together.
- It's all an act.

142
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,558
Jørgen puts on an act for the town,
and I for Dorthe.

143
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,797
Let's bide our time.

144
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,755
- Until I get beat up again?
- Without a report, I'm helpless.

145
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:10,994
You need broken limbs or just a black
eye? Or does someone have to die?

146
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,790
No.
That's not by the book.

147
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,711
Fancy some of that, Marshal?
That's the hairdresser.

148
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:20,118
- Lone TD.
- T's for Thousand. Guess what D's for.

149
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,835
- Got your own hairdresser back home?
- No.

150
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:29,068
- More into young men, maybe?
- Leave the marshal be.

151
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,273
We've got married women here, too.

152
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,517
Yes, people talk.

153
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,077
How quiet the marshal went
all of a sudden.

154
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:46,752
- Well, remember who she's married to.
- What are you talking about?

155
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,110
What are you all talking about?

156
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,673
- They're talking about your wife.
- What about Ingelise?

157
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,078
You ought to take better care of her.

158
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,515
- Yes?
- It's Dr. Zerlang. We've got a problem.

159
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:32,031
Ingelise came in this morning,
very confused and with a bloody face.

160
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,234
- I've given her a sedative.
- I'll say!

161
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,353
- I just gave her the usual dose.
- It's not the first time?

162
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:55,556
No, but it's the first time she's refused
to go back to her husband.

163
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,630
What did she say?

164
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:04,595
People talked at the bar
and Jørgen got jealous.

165
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,155
- You said we had a problem.
- There. What are we going to do?

166
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,478
- Let her sleep it off.
- Not here. I have patients.

167
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:25,357
- You doped her. Put her on the couch.
- No! Jørgen'll tear the place apart.

168
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,394
- Then what do you suggest?
- You're the marshal.

169
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,673
Sort out your own mess.

170
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,438
- What happened?
- You know very well what happened.

171
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:37,036
People talked at the bar.

172
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:42,519
- Where are we running away to?
- I'm taking you to Tønder.

173
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:58,715
- I'm not going to Tønder.
- You won't go to Tønder or home.

174
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:05,712
- Then what?
- You don't get jack shit.

175
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:33,396
This is all there is.
There's nothing else.

176
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,718
It's all mud, cows...

177
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,996
...and rubber boots.

178
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:53,598
Take me away from here.
Away from Jørgen.

179
00:29:53,800 --> 00:30:00,478
You need to file a report first,
but I don't know if you're ready for that.

180
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,034
Okay.

181
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,477
I have to call my daughter.

182
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,236
- That was Jørgen.
- And?

183
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,509
What are you doing here anyway?

184
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:12,834
- Trying to move up the ladder.
- It's a career move then, huh?

185
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:18,478
- You could say that.
- That's not what I heard.

186
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:25,317
Some people say
there's something wrong with you.

187
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,830
You got posted here as a punishment.

188
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:35,673
- It's a punishment to live here?
- Others say you're divorced.

189
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,633
Don't go there.

190
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:43,595
- They say it's because you're gay.
- I'm not gay.

191
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,149
Can you prove it?

192
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:55,911
- I've got a daughter.
- What's her name?

193
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:00,716
- Josefine.
- How old is Josefine supposed to be?

194
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:06,313
- Almost eight.
- We haven't seen much of her.

195
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:12,629
No, neither have I.
I haven't seen her in months.

196
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,116
Why not?

197
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:23,757
- Funny. She thinks I'm in Australia.
- Is that funny?

198
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:32,230
- Why are you in Australia?
- It was the country furthest away.

199
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,434
Why are you here, Robert?

200
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,474
I did something terrible.

201
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,276
What did you do?

202
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:06,869
I pulled a gun on my wife.

203
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:15,069
Why?

204
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:20,559
Because she was going
to take everything away from me.

205
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,996
- I'd like to go home now.
- Are you leaving?

206
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,514
- What about the report?
- You can forget your fucking report!

207
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,757
What sick game are you playing?
Do you want to get beaten up again?

208
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,430
I want to go home to my daughter.
Let me go!

209
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,953
Skarrild Police.

210
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,908
- So, what got swiped this time?
- A ghetto-blaster from the street.

211
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,999
- Great place to put it.
- I put my goods where I like.

212
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,955
Kids need to learn to keep their hands
off. They only learn the hard way.

213
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:27,989
Come here. The officer wants to know
if you want to get beaten or busted.

214
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,232
- Sorry.
- Don't apologize.

215
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:42,718
They don't deserve any better.

216
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,480
That'll teach you!

217
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,159
In case you have visitors.

218
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,031
Mojn.

219
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,473
- What's your teddy called?
- Buller.

220
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,712
- What happened to his foot?
- He hurt it.

221
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,920
What's wrong?

222
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:38,391
Open the door!

223
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,308
It's Jørgen.

224
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,555
Open the door!

225
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:55,352
- Is my wife here? I want to talk to her.
- No.

226
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:02,473
- Don't let him in. Hit him!
- Let me in.

227
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,990
- Knock him out!
- God damn it!

228
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,431
How did he look?

229
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:22,033
I need to talk to her.
Just for a second.

230
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:27,075
- She doesn't want to talk to you.
- I just want to see if she's okay.

231
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:32,400
- She's fine.
- I want to hear it from her.

232
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,993
- How are you?
- Okay...

233
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,758
Mojn.

234
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:40,508
- Mojn.
- What did you say?

235
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,954
Mojn.

236
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:17,353
- Do you have any more of those pills?
- What pills?

237
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,909
- The ones we talked about.
- Oh...

238
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:34,311
Robert, forget Ingelise.
I've barked up that tree, too.

239
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,075
Is it true Jørgen isn't Dorthes father?

240
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,751
- Whoa, where did you hear that?
- I'm the police.

241
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,078
Well, he's fathered at least seven
of the other runts running around town.

242
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,113
Seven?

243
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,471
I'm the doctor.

244
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:11,232
We still need a fourth player
for our card game.

245
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,356
No, a beer please.

246
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:40,913
Well, young Dorthe is taking
the baby carriage for a stroll again.

247
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,639
What did you say?

248
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:51,153
I said, young Dorthe is taking
the baby carriage for a stroll again.

249
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,516
Ingelise.

250
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:22,039
- I'm sorry. I'm so dumb in the head.
- There now.

251
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,800
Calm down. It's okay.

252
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:31,916
You should've taken me
away from here.

253
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:36,238
I'll take you with me to Copenhagen.

254
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:41,468
- I want to go to Aabenraa.
- Okay, Aabenraa.

255
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:51,638
- Promise?
- I promise.

256
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,270
Lie down with me.

257
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:31,316
Come lie down with me.

258
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,758
I want to feel you.

259
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,549
I want to feel you.

260
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,275
Let me feel you.

261
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,309
Ingelise!

262
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,519
Ingelise!

263
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:02,079
- Tønder Police.
- I have a confession.

264
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,352
Your name, please?

265
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:18,275
- Hello?
- It was an accident.

266
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:23,873
Robert? It's Zerlang.
I'm calling from the machine pool.

267
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:28,039
Get over here. Ingelise is dead.

268
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:03,272
I'm warning you.
She's not a pretty sight.

269
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:08,429
- Cause of death?
- Cardiac arrest. And excessive blows.

270
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,200
- Jørgen?
- Who else?

271
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,754
Well, what have you got to say
for yourself, Jørgen?

272
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:30,637
The last time I saw her, she was alive.
I swear.

273
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:36,073
So she bumped into a door?
Is that why she's such a mess?

274
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:40,398
What kind of idiots do you take us for?

275
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:46,835
- Admit that you hit her.
- Yes, but that never killed her before.

276
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:51,318
The last time I saw her,
she was alive, God damn it.

277
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:58,913
- How did you find her?
- Dorthe found her.

278
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:03,279
I want to be with my daughter.

279
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:19,709
Well, I guess you're going to call
Tønder Police for assistance.

280
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,799
I suppose I'd better.

281
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:31,031
But it's an open and shut case.
Jørgen more or less confessed.

282
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:40,312
It's not like you think.
I killed Ingelise.

283
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:46,117
Nonsense. You may feel guilty,
but that's not the same thing.

284
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:53,351
You may have caused their argument
but that doesn't make you a murderer.

285
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:57,109
You never should've invited her home.
That'll come out.

286
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:03,316
And the fact that you fooled around
and kissed in your garden.

287
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,798
Robert.

288
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:22,589
It's not in my best interest to have
Tønder Police snooping around.

289
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:28,716
I prescribed Ingelise
quite a lot of medicine.

290
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:32,879
I found this on the floor.

291
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:37,437
Maybe she overdid it.

292
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:41,633
She's been in Tønder Hospital before,
with an overdose.

293
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:45,719
I was reprimanded.

294
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:55,471
- What are you trying to say?
- Let's keep a cool head.

295
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:59,878
Hold our horses, as they say here.

296
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:05,074
I'll write a death certificate
that won't cause a stir.

297
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:10,308
I'll just write "cardiac arrest".
That'll do.

298
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:18,191
- That's not quite by the book, is it?
- No, but it's not a lie, either.

299
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:24,953
If Jørgen is charged,
we'll both be dragged into it.

300
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:29,790
There's no need for that,
is there, Robert?

301
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,993
And what about young Dorthe?

302
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:42,911
Want her to lose both her parents
at the same time?

303
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,313
There's been a...
a tragic accident.

304
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,231
Ingelise Buhl is dead.

305
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:36,514
Dr. Zerlang has examined her
and concluded -

306
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:42,989
- that Ingelise Buhl died
from cardiac arrest.

307
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:15,511
Love brought Ingelise Buhl
to this town years ago.

308
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:21,359
From the very beginning
she was a strange bird -

309
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:25,599
- and never quite settled in here with us.

310
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:33,195
Some of you may say we should
have made her feel more at home.

311
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,909
That we should have helped her.

312
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:44,956
But it's no secret that
Ingelise had a difficult disposition.

313
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:49,551
It's hard to help someone
who doesn't want to be helped.

314
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:54,072
Let's not in our grief
reproach ourselves -

315
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:58,239
- but take joy in the fact
that Ingelise finally found peace.

316
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:02,797
The family invites you all
for coffee at the bar.

317
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:14,070
Let me through.

318
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:33,672
I propose one minute of silence
in honor of the deceased.

319
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,639
- You'd better keep an eye on Jørgen.
- Why?

320
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:37,278
People put up with a lot here.
But not a wife-killer.

321
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,948
She died from cardiac arrest.

322
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:45,678
Take my advice...
If you want Dorthe to keep her father.

323
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:17,158
Dorthe!

324
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:20,716
Dorthe!

325
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:38,196
Dorthe!

326
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,434
Jørgen!

327
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,031
Jørgen.

328
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:58,309
Go get him.

329
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:08,034
I said, go get him.

330
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:16,558
You're meddling in matters
you don't understand.

331
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:26,389
You'll pay for this.

332
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:34,556
Jørgen, get in here.

333
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,239
You shouldn't have done that.

334
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,593
Find Dorthe.

335
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:56,914
Your boots, Jørgen.

336
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:23,909
Have any of you seen young Dorthe
since the funeral?

337
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:29,035
Or do you know where she is?

338
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:38,111
- I'm sick of being made a fool of.
- Then go back home to Copenhagen.

339
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:43,872
It won't be long. I'm turning this case
over to Tønder Police.

340
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:51,714
- Why drag Tønder into it?
- I will, unless you tell me where she is.

341
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:55,708
We don't want anyone from Tønder
snooping around.

342
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:00,869
- Dorthe can't be alone with Jørgen.
- Jørgen is her father.

343
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:06,313
Dorthe is afraid of Jørgen.
After all, he did kill her mother.

344
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:09,159
Says who?

345
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:13,797
Who says Jørgen killed Ingelise?

346
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:20,829
And at the end of the day,
who really killed Ingelise?

347
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:26,797
When Dorthe took the baby carriage
for a stroll, her mother was beaten.

348
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:31,709
You all knew that.

349
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:36,232
What did you do? Eco-Tage?

350
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:45,678
What did you do, Hansi?
What did you do, Helmuth?

351
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:51,398
You swilled your beer
and let them carry on.

352
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:56,037
That's the way it works around here.
Everyone knows everything, -

353
01:04:56,240 --> 01:05:01,758
- but no one does anything, and now
that little girl's mother is dead.

354
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:09,349
Well, if that's how you feel about it...

355
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:16,030
We'll tell you where she is, then.

356
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:34,832
Open it.

357
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:44,110
It's the police, Dorthe. Open up.
She asked to stay in there.

358
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:49,714
Dorthe, it's Robert.

359
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,994
Hi, Dorthe.
What a nice place you've got here.

360
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:12,439
Dorthe, no matter what people say,
your dad didn't kill your mum.

361
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:18,112
It was an accident.
Her heart stopped beating.

362
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:22,677
The doctor says so
and he knows what he's talking about.

363
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:29,393
I saw you.

364
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:34,958
You left our house
with blood all over your face.

365
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:43,836
- You saw me?
- Don't you remember?

366
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:48,192
- No.
- You were bleeding from your face.

367
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:54,554
You passed by me.

368
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:59,515
You tried to stop him. Didn't you?

369
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:05,953
- Have you told this to anyone?
- No.

370
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:09,038
Good.

371
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:18,188
No matter what your dad's done,
he didn't do it on purpose.

372
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:22,598
He misses your mom
just as much as you do.

373
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:28,193
Right now he misses you terribly.

374
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:36,876
I haven't seen my daughter in ages
and I'd be so happy to see her again.

375
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:51,955
- Where's your teddy? Buller?
- At home.

376
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,959
You've reached Josefine,
Hanne and Squeaky.

377
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:23,995
We can't answer the phone right now.
Leave a message after the beep.

378
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:30,753
Hey Josefine. It's Dad.
I just called to say happy birthday.

379
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,679
I hope you have a wonderful day.

380
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:39,796
I'm coming back from Australia soon,
so I hope to see you.

381
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,639
I'm really looking forward to it.

382
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:14,756
You sure have settled in lately.

383
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:18,077
Mojn.

384
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:25,553
That's right, I took your boots
with me from the bog.

385
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:29,548
- Keep them.
- Thanks.

386
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:40,789
How are you?
Is there anything I can do for you?

387
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:48,436
I want my name cleared.
I want a fair trial.

388
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:53,394
- What for?
- For what happened.

389
01:10:53,600 --> 01:11:00,756
Nothing happened. You haven't
been charged with anything.

390
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:05,795
- Okay, then I want to turn myself in.
- What for?

391
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:12,394
- That business with Ingelise.
- She died from cardiac arrest.

392
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:22,359
I'll call Tønder Police myself. Maybe
they can get to the bottom of this.

393
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:29,671
Stop thinking about yourself. Dorthe
doesn't need a father who's in prison.

394
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:35,512
- I didn't do it.
- No.

395
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:39,599
But tell that to Tønder Police.

396
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:43,829
We handle things ourselves here.

397
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:49,910
The quack's got some pills
that'll see you through this.

398
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:57,350
Talk to Dr. Zerlang.
He'll help you.

399
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:13,676
It's just like the old marshal.
He could put 'em away, too.

400
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:18,237
We thought you were a fag.
But fags don't drink like that.

401
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:23,150
- You thought he was.
- You thought so too.

402
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:35,238
- We've got new seats.
- I told you you weren't welcome here.

403
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:41,595
- Why? I pay cash.
- You know very well why.

404
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:45,554
No.

405
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:50,117
Go home, Jørgen.

406
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:57,635
If you throw me out, I demand
that you say out loud what I've done.

407
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:06,668
What about you, Marshall?
Can you tell me what I've done?

408
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:19,438
If no one can, I have a right to order just
like the rest of these apes. Two beers.

409
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:25,589
One for me and one for the marshal.

410
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:39,878
Don't you want it?
Or are you still popping pills?

411
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:47,318
Dr. Zerlang sure has got
his records straight.

412
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:04,638
Here's to the marshall
and his good ideas.

413
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:24,837
Two more.

414
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:42,318
Here's to Dr. Zerlang.

415
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,389
Two shots.

416
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:09,628
Two more, please.

417
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:17,838
Two more.

418
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:23,914
And another two.

419
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:43,595
Two more beers.

420
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:16,240
Dr. Zerlang sure knows where it's at.

421
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:21,276
Want to talk about Copenhagen?

422
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:27,555
About the time you came home and
found your wife on top of a colleague?

423
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:40,437
Were you really going to shoot them?
The both of them?

424
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:45,430
- None of your business.
- Christ!

425
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:50,115
Were you going to do it? Huh?

426
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:54,711
What happened?
Come on.

427
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:59,118
I don't remember!

428
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:05,156
You were sent to the nuthouse.
Three months with unsteady nerves.

429
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:09,272
I've got something for you.

430
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:16,833
You were there, Robert.

431
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:24,594
Dorthe cleaned house today and found
this under my and Ingelise's bed.

432
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:27,473
Know what she told me?

433
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:31,036
That she saw you outside our door
with blood all over your face.

434
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:35,756
Because you'd beaten Ingelise
half to death.

435
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:39,669
Were you going to fuck her?

436
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:47,237
Were you going to fuck her?
You've got two options.

437
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:53,629
Either you call Tønder Police
or you and I take a trip to the bog.

438
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:57,037
And get it over with.

439
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:08,675
- You forgot one.
- Right. But you haven't got the guts.

440
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:14,512
- I don't have much of a choice, do I?
- No, you don't.

441
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:20,431
But Dorthe will be left without a father.
Can you live with that?

442
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:25,668
I'm sorry, Jørgen, but some say
you aren't her real father.

443
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:34,588
Know what's good about that?

444
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,876
Hello? It's Dorthe.

445
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:10,276
My dad hasn't come home
and he's not at the bar.

446
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:14,268
I don't like it here.

447
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:16,670
One of Eco-Tage's cows sank
into the mud.

448
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:23,432
We hauled it out
but it was a filthy mess.

449
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:26,029
We need to talk.

450
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:33,112
- Yes?
- We'd better go inside.

451
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:35,390
Can't we talk here?

452
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:42,999
- We'd better go inside.
- I've got a confession to make.

453
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:45,794
Inside.

454
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:02,991
What a downpour last night.

455
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:11,750
The fields will be flooded for weeks.

456
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:16,670
- Yes, what a downpour.
- You can say that again.

457
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,876
You had a confession to make?

458
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:50,633
Yes, I... never got around
to writing the reports you asked for.

459
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:56,949
Never mind. Not much happens
around here, I suppose.

460
01:26:57,160 --> 01:27:00,277
Not more than I can handle.

461
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:10,796
- You wanted to talk to me?
- You've got a girl who misses her dad.

462
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:15,548
- Josefine?
- Dorthe.

463
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:20,709
Her dad's name is Jørgen.
She called us this morning.

464
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:33,316
- When was the last time you saw him?
- At the bar.

465
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:36,557
Yesterday at around six or seven.

466
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:41,469
We had a couple of beers
and I went home.

467
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:45,468
That corroborates my information.

468
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:53,598
- Did he seem depressed?
- His wife just died. Cardiac arrest.

469
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:56,917
So I understand.

470
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:08,316
Chief.

471
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:18,670
They've found a rubber boot
in the bog.

472
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:43,435
They're already at it.

473
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:57,199
I've found something.

474
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:16,276
This is a goddamned mess.

475
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:27,428
I've got this sister in Tønder.
She's got a boy. Grown up.

476
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:32,270
A good kid
but he got himself in a jam.

477
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:38,157
Drugs and what have you.
That's who we just hauled up.

478
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:48,517
He was looking at three years,
but I pulled some strings -

479
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:53,032
- and set him up
with a bicycle shop in this town.

480
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:59,475
I never should have done that.
Damn!

481
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:11,077
But if we say
Jørgen Buhl killed himself, -

482
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:16,035
- and call it suicide,
we'll close the case here.

483
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:31,751
- What about your men?
- I don't see any men. Do you?

484
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:38,990
That's another good thing
about the police.

485
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:45,675
And you'll be wanting to get
back home to Copenhagen, right?

486
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:32,991
Hello... Zerlang?

487
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:43,989
I just stopped by with this guy.

488
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:54,880
You can dump him in the bog
next to everyone else.

489
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:59,392
- Mojn, then.
- Fed up with the town already?

490
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:03,275
I'm back on duty in Copenhagen.

491
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:08,076
- I thought you'd settled in here.
- Yes, but I've got my daughter there.

492
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:13,593
- Well, that's nice.
- Certainly. If you are going home.

493
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:17,636
If?

494
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:21,992
Come on, Robert.
We know everything.

495
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:28,674
- What do you know?
- We know you killed Ingelise.

496
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:35,638
- You didn't mean to, but you did.
- She died from cardiac arrest.

497
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:44,711
- And you put a bullet in Jørgen's chest.
- Or two, to be precise.

498
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:52,758
- We don't blame you.
- We don't miss any of them.

499
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:57,954
They caused so much tension,
but that tension's gone now.

500
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:02,599
You're our man now, Robert.

501
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:08,639
What if I leave anyway?

502
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:20,399
Certain things about you will get out.
Things that will harm you.

503
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:27,631
- Especially in Copenhagen.
- So as I said, you're our man now.

504
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:08,270
Seven.

505
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:21,476
Solo.

506
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:42,349
- Mojn.
- Mojn.

507
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:10,235
THE END
