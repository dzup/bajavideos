1
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,276
THE WHORE AND THE WHALE

2
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,148
<i>Dear Lola...</i>

3
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,359
<i>I'm in Poblenou,
at a barricade.</i>

4
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,229
<i>After the battle of the Ebro the
Nationalists drove us into the sea.</i>

5
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,314
<i>They are crossing
the Llobregat</i>

6
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,750
<i>as I write to you,
quite pointlessly.</i>

7
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,910
<i>I could keep on running...</i>

8
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,550
<i>but the war has brought me
to your birthplace,</i>

9
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,670
<i>like returning home,</i>

10
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,316
<i>as if you were waiting for me.</i>

11
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,670
I liked your letter.

12
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,075
It's been a long time since
I got a love letter.

13
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,079
I didn't write it.

14
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,919
He did.

15
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,873
It's the same. You sent it to me.

16
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,154
How did you know
I was in Barcelona?

17
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,910
Everybody told me,
except you.

18
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,037
That you were staying
at your father's place...

19
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,231
with a son, and without a husband.

20
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,316
Don't look at him that way,
I'm starting to hate him.

21
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,635
Who was he?

22
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,316
An Argentine guy who died in Barcelona
when the nationalists arrived.

23
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,711
His pictures of the war
aren't bad, but...

24
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,996
these ones are a complete mystery.

25
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,999
Look.

26
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,229
We got them from a collector.

27
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,677
The letter came as part of the lot,
in his notebook.

28
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,036
And the pages of the letter,
did you tear them out?

29
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,152
No, they were loose, like this.
But he didn't mail it.

30
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,195
Look.

31
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,990
- Have a good look.
- What?

32
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,919
She's exactly like you
were at her age.

33
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,389
<i>You escaped from me
until the very last night,</i>

34
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,712
<i>when the tour was over
and you were going back to Spain.</i>

35
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,791
<i>All of Buenos Aires
was at the farewell party.</i>

36
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,314
<i>I couldn't cope with it all,
handing over chorus girls,</i>

37
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,830
<i>but you... I saved for myself.</i>

38
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,869
<i>No one else in the company
undressed like you did.</i>

39
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,073
<i>As if it were a relief.
As if no one could hurt you.</i>

40
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,759
Lola!

41
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,833
<i>Nothing in this life
could scare you.</i>

42
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,077
<i>Not in this one,
nor in the other one either.</i>

43
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,429
I almost fell!

44
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,156
- You scared the life out of me!
- What were you going to do?

45
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,319
Kill myself...

46
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,708
- So they would all see.
- See you naked?

47
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,797
<i>If a photo can steal your soul,
I took yours that night.</i>

48
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,074
<i>Your memory is still intact,
motionless,</i>

49
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,751
<i>caught in that photo
like a fallen angel.</i>

50
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,913
Is that the woman in the letter?

51
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,793
I don't know,
she looks like a chorus girl.

52
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,356
There is a Dolores
in the program.

53
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,956
But the letter
could be for anyone.

54
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,116
Anyway. She's a character.

55
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,029
Go to Argentina, investigate
that period and write about it.

56
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,835
Once...

57
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,112
at my convent, I took all my clothes
off in the confessional booth.

58
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,955
That day I finished
my primary education.

59
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,797
- How old were you?
- Fourteen.

60
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,518
I took my clothes off
and sang "Els Segadors".

61
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,708
<i>Bon colp de falc!</i>

62
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,709
Did you hear
the general's speech?

63
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,517
He toasted "the return of
the company to our Spain...

64
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,118
traditional Spain which has begun
to free itself from the reds".

65
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,038
I was taking photos of him.

66
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,317
You went upstairs as
if he'd insulted your mother.

67
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,953
My father.

68
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,829
Do you know why
the nuns threw me out?

69
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,878
Because my father burned
a church and they killed him.

70
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,710
They are my family.

71
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,190
Nobody else cares
if I leave or stay.

72
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,469
Me. I do.

73
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,310
You're going to Patagonia.

74
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,635
<i>You were the only one
who hadn't packed up.</i>

75
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,717
<i>You didn't want
to go back to Spain,</i>

76
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,195
<i>but didn't dare stay
on your own either.</i>

77
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,912
<i>You'd heard all the bullshit.</i>

78
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,271
Do you really care about me?

79
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,756
The truth is,
you saved my life.

80
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,756
You can do
what you like with me.

81
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,630
Don't sell your soul
to the devil.

82
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,915
Who said anything
about a soul?

83
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,873
<i>You did as you pleased,</i>

84
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,800
<i>without thinking of the price
you'd have to pay.</i>

85
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,752
<i>And whether you stay or go,
it's never for free.</i>

86
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,033
<i>And finding out what you want
doesn't come free either.</i>

87
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,071
- How long are you staying?
- Till Sunday.

88
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,918
On Monday I've got
to be back at work.

89
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,794
Writing silly articles
for a women's magazine.

90
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,149
I didn't send you this letter
just so I could see you, Vera.

91
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,112
I want you to publish.

92
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,155
By the age of 20 you had won
some award and published a novel.

93
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,515
That was then.

94
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,678
When you ran behind me picking up
the papers I'd thrown away.

95
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,831
The other day I mentioned
this book at dinner

96
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,554
and my father got up
from the table.

97
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,715
He's never read it,

98
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,798
but he couldn't stand
his patients praising it.

99
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,229
- It messed up my life, you know?
- Your father.

100
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,352
The book.

101
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,880
Are you sure you want me
to write another one?

102
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,353
That afternoon when you took this photo
of me fills an entire chapter.

103
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,194
And I didn't dare
write about all of it.

104
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,558
Many years have gone by.
Does it show?

105
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,912
What is it, Vera?

106
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,078
I have a lump here.
Feel it.

107
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,873
My sister is waiting to take me
to her gynecologist.

108
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,432
- Will you never ask me to stay?
- You have to go to the gynecologist.

109
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,030
Jordi!

110
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,155
The things you say, Vera.

111
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,914
When you left me for Antonio.

112
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,270
You see?
You don't understand anything.

113
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,232
That's why no woman will last
beyond the third fuck with you.

114
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,830
- I was with you for a year.
- Barely eleven months.

115
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,636
The happiest time of my life.

116
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,674
The only time when I didn't feel
alone in the whole world.

117
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,152
<i>- Digame'I en català.
- Et vaig estimar molt.</i>

118
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,759
Catalan...

119
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,879
That's the voice of my mother.
Her words.

120
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,878
I lie on my childhood bed and
her stories swirl round my head.

121
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,036
Do you lie on other beds?

122
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,679
Nobody's asked me to.

123
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,834
<i>Hello, Toni.</i>

124
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,792
<i>Sorry to interrupt
your meeting.</i>

125
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,995
<i>We're back in Madrid and I wanted
to make arrangements for Juanito.</i>

126
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,350
<i>- Where are you?
- In Avenida de America.</i>

127
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,957
There's loads of traffic...
Everybody's coming back to town.

128
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,828
The thing is... I won't be staying
at home, Antonio.

129
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,875
I also wanted to tell you that.

130
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,079
I don't know what my father said,
but I've made up my mind.

131
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,077
I've been thinking
about it all month.

132
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,999
It's better that I don't stay
at home, even for one night.

133
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,032
If Maribel's at home
I'll leave him with her.

134
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,073
I love you too.

135
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,678
Guess who's waiting
for you in the bathtub?

136
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,710
Pikachu.

137
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,309
Shall we give him a bath
while Maribel makes dinner?

138
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,274
And then later...

139
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,910
Remember we talked about mummy
not staying at home tonight?

140
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,712
Why?

141
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,272
I've already explained
it to you.

142
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,232
You know sometimes you do things
and you don't know why?

143
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,078
And then you tell me off.

144
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,476
I need to be alone, my love.
To find out what I want.

145
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,598
What do you want?

146
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,638
I don't know.

147
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,077
I don't want to get confused
by what my father wants for me.

148
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,556
Or grandpa, or whoever.

149
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,632
It's been the same all my life.

150
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,077
And now it's almost happening
again with your father.

151
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,113
<i>The train seemed to me
like a phantom ship,</i>

152
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,549
<i>adrift.</i>

153
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,195
<i>You would give in to whatever
happened without any impatience.</i>

154
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,672
<i>But I, who always want
what I haven't got,</i>

155
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,833
<i>counted out the minutes
like a prisoner.</i>

156
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,316
Don't you want
to make your wishes?

157
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,149
What wishes?

158
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,308
It's Cap d'an. New Year.

159
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,268
You eat a grape with each ring
of the bell and ask for what you want.

160
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,911
- Who are you missing tonight?
- Nobody.

161
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,989
Not even your family?

162
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,038
I really miss my uncle.

163
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,837
If my father met your uncle
he'd throw him in jail.

164
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,440
He hunts anarchists.

165
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,312
So you can really wish
for twelve things altogether?

166
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,995
I wish for everything I want.

167
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,716
It's twelve o'clock!

168
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,555
<i>I was afraid of you.</i>

169
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,791
<i>I can only admit</i>

170
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,393
<i>that now you're dead.</i>

171
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,429
<i>Your body scared me,
so full of life.</i>

172
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,835
Emilio, there are no grapes, but
there's wine, it's the same thing.

173
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,671
<i>And I find this hard
to admit but...</i>

174
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,833
<i>life separated us
more than death did.</i>

175
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,475
I want to always
fall in love like this.

176
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,839
With me.

177
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,593
With whoever!
With whom I choose.

178
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,231
With me.

179
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,439
I wish you would die for me.

180
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,754
May all my wishes come true.

181
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,790
It's no good saying "all".

182
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,911
You've got to say them
one by one.

183
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,231
If you don't cheat
the wish will come true.

184
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,318
Jordi!

185
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,517
I was dreaming.

186
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,952
You saved my life.

187
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,635
In a hotel.

188
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,150
Last night. I took Juanito home
and called you.

189
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,837
I haven't felt this lonely
since my mother died.

190
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,038
I started typing on
her typewriter. Listen.

191
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,559
A blank page.

192
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,514
You can't read anything,
the ribbon's completely dry.

193
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,751
About that woman.

194
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,398
The one in the photos.
The one in the letter.

195
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,349
The letter from the photographer,
the guy you hate.

196
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,628
I was dreaming about him.
He was photographing me stark naked.

197
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,595
Just like that.
We're going to meet.

198
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,839
Excuse me. Hang on.

199
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,991
This thing about Argentina
is still on?

200
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,916
I'm going to leave
the magazine.

201
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,234
I don't have to think it over.
I'm not going to stay here.

202
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,311
Because I can't stand feeling
like shit just 100 meters away

203
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,909
from where my son is feeling
like shit, as if I were dead!

204
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,671
Last night I cried
more than he did.

205
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,637
And if I think it over,
I'll end up agreeing with Antonio.

206
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,549
I'll be back home in three days.
It's better if I go.

207
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,118
As soon as possible.

208
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,190
Nothing.

209
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,394
Just see the gynecologist and have
a few tests. Three or four days.

210
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,431
The time it'll take you to send me
the ticket and the photos.

211
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,270
Thanks.

212
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,076
I'll do a good job,
you'll see.

213
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,556
<i>We wanted to get
to the end of the world.</i>

214
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,911
<i>There weren't even any roads.</i>

215
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,151
<i>When the gringo
landed at Bahía Blanca</i>

216
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,432
<i>we were already
about to board a ship.</i>

217
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,073
<i>He confirmed my first job.</i>

218
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,312
<i>It wasn't much money, but enough
for our trip to the south.</i>

219
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,994
<i>This Gringo Orestes was a peddler</i>

220
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,519
<i>who had a plane instead of a cart.</i>

221
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,912
<i>You got into that machine</i>

222
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,317
<i>as if you'd always been
delivering stuff in Patagonia.</i>

223
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,514
<i>The town popped up,
in the middle of nowhere.</i>

224
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,638
<i>That first stop
promised a pleasant stay.</i>

225
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,560
<i>Easy work, bed, and food.</i>

226
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,676
<i>I had to take photos
for a musician...</i>

227
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,794
<i>to illustrate
the covers of his scores.</i>

228
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,518
<i>Nobody knew his name.</i>

229
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,755
<i>Even his son called him
by his surname: "Suárez".</i>

230
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,239
Gringo!
Did you bring the records?

231
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,631
Here we are, Suárez.
I got everything.

232
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,956
I've brought the photographer
and everything we'll need

233
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,388
for the great Radio El Mundo
tango competition.

234
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,919
Santamarina. Suárez.

235
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,792
El Pibe Pedro,

236
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,550
Bandoneon player
and future composer.

237
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,711
Emilio, right?
The Gringo speaks highly of you.

238
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,509
Did you come alone?

239
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,553
Dolores Puig.
A friend of Emilio's.

240
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,678
Your hands are cold.

241
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,557
Welcome to Patagonia.

242
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,632
The ones I'll send to the contest
are like these...

243
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,195
only they'll have
your photographs.

244
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,391
- How much will you pay me?
- You tell me.

245
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,153
Who'll see the photos?

246
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,355
Tell me about them
and I'll imagine them.

247
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,754
How was the trip?

248
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,470
I wouldn't get in one of
those if they tied me up.

249
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,470
I loved it. I must have been
a bird in a previous life.

250
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,395
Yes, women are braver than men.

251
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,915
We're only good
for falling in love.

252
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,078
Doing artistic things:

253
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,919
Taking photographs,
composing a tango.

254
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,835
Or piloting a plane,
if you're brave enough.

255
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,713
But when you really need a man,

256
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,792
call a woman.

257
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,715
<i>Suárez reminded me of my father.</i>

258
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,671
<i>He liked lecturing.</i>

259
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,270
<i>He despised people from Buenos Aires
but wanted them to dance his tangos.</i>

260
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,551
<i>He'd decided to illustrate
his scores with women.</i>

261
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,070
<i>That's why I took
an interest in Matilde.</i>

262
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,350
<i>When you climbed
that ladder behind her,</i>

263
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,718
<i>I had a premonition.</i>

264
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,397
<i>I didn't tell you. I didn't want
to be a prophet of doom.</i>

265
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,556
<i>For you, that couple of weeks
in Suárez's hotel...</i>

266
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,751
<i>was part of the adventure.</i>

267
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,556
Aren't there any whales?

268
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,877
They come in winter,
in June or July.

269
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,316
Get out! Get out!

270
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,594
I told you I don't want you
sleeping here.

271
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,998
Everything's upside down here.

272
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,478
Even the moon's upside down.

273
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,359
This room is shameful.

274
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,235
Shameful, why?

275
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,514
My name is Dolores.

276
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,074
They call me Lola.

277
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,268
Matilde.

278
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,637
Emilio told me about this place.

279
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,759
Apart from being a hotel
it's also...

280
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,835
Nobody will bother you.
Don't be afraid.

281
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,512
I'm not afraid, just curious.

282
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,278
I was invited to one in Buenos Aires
but I didn't want to go.

283
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,232
So you let women in here?

284
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,358
Aren't I a woman?

285
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,558
<i>Every once in a while I fall asleep
with my pen in my hand.</i>

286
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,598
<i>And I can feel you behind my back,</i>

287
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,873
<i>peering from this letter
like in the darkroom.</i>

288
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,548
<i>These ghosts who appear
in the photos are all that remain.</i>

289
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,839
<i>Nameless faces...</i>

290
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,838
<i>that someone will find in some dead
photographer's bag under a bed.</i>

291
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,678
Don't touch, please.

292
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,075
It'll be sore for a few days.
Try to put up with it.

293
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,798
You've been dreaming a lot.

294
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,034
It's the anaesthesia.

295
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,912
You were talking
in your sleep all night.

296
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,839
- What was I saying?
- Something about photos.

297
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,549
I'm preparing a book
of photos from the '30s.

298
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,478
Sounds good. How lovely.

299
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,078
<i>You'll have to go to
a milonga, then.</i>

300
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,349
I've already been.

301
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,672
They asked me to dance,
but I didn't dare.

302
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,915
I'm hopeless.

303
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,989
Liar. You can't tell me
you don't dance tango.

304
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,353
Don't listen to her.

305
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:59,070
- What's wrong with her?
- I'm old, what do you think?

306
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,475
But I have a good memory.

307
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,954
You're Catalonian, aren't you?

308
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,037
Isn't everybody in town
"giving you the glad eye"?

309
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,470
Oh! Listen to that!
Something for your book.

310
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,557
That expression's antique,
grandma!

311
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,318
What does it mean?

312
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,556
That all the men
chase after you.

313
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,991
My God, yes.
Men certainly do stare at you here.

314
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,794
Like we were running
around naked.

315
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,076
One of these days you'll
we walking in the streets again,

316
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,272
and they'll be murmuring
their compliments as you pass.

317
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,356
As if I still had both breasts.

318
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,556
Did you know what you had
before coming in here?

319
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,751
I'd had a few tests.

320
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,120
But I didn't think
it would grow so fast.

321
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,676
- What was the doctor's name?
- Dr. Zimmerman.

322
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,671
He said I should go back to
Madrid for the operation.

323
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,153
But you didn't listen.

324
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,997
If I were you, I'd have listened.
You should go home.

325
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,112
What home?

326
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,557
You don't have
anyone back in Spain?

327
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,799
I have a son...

328
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,917
I have a husband...

329
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,278
and my father is a doctor,
he'd take care of everything.

330
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,279
But I'd be as lonely
as I am here.

331
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,195
Here I have no one to turn to.
It's clearer this way.

332
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,350
Last night, a friend from
Barcelona called you.

333
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,310
Jordi?

334
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,670
That's him.

335
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,754
He's going to call again.

336
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,951
He asked me not to say anything,
to keep it a surprise.

337
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,830
- He seemed sweet.
- Why did he call here?

338
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,359
Didn't you give his name
when you checked in here?

339
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,232
Just in case something happened.

340
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,759
Did you think
I'd leave without paying?

341
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,394
And why do you think you ended up
in the cardio unit?

342
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,592
You're OK now, but in the operating
theatre you had an arrhythmia.

343
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,878
If Zimmerman has something to say,
he should say it to me.

344
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,308
Not to anybody else.

345
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,714
You've got to leave this place.

346
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,309
Alright, grandma,
now Vera needs some rest, OK?

347
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,069
Her name is not Vera.
She's called Dolores.

348
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,432
<i>Straight away, you arranged things
so as not to be alone.</i>

349
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,595
<i>There you were,</i>

350
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,675
<i>learning the ways
of your new family.</i>

351
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,356
<i>Matilde danced, unaware
that you were spying on her.</i>

352
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,029
<i>But I knew from that
very first night</i>

353
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,390
<i>that there,
far away from everything...</i>

354
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,160
<i>you were beginning to find out
who you were.</i>

355
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,078
How's our Gallega doing?

356
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,273
I'm "La Catalana".

357
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,914
In Argentina all Spaniards
are called "Gallegos".

358
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,438
Come in, don't be afraid.

359
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,231
How did you know it was me?

360
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,629
I heard you.

361
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,631
Your heartbeat is accelerating.

362
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,190
No to mention what I can smell.

363
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,958
You're just a girl.

364
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,392
How old are you?

365
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,471
Don't you want to tell me
about yourself?

366
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,116
I don't feel like it right now.

367
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,039
Did we bring that?

368
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,672
I ask the questions here.

369
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,518
- Do you want to try?
- No. Sorry.

370
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,592
I can't stand mysteries.

371
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,314
If you play with fire...

372
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,638
You're not blind.

373
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,799
I can see something.

374
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,875
Lights...

375
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,439
and shadows.

376
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,237
Lights and shadows.

377
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,510
Have you been like that
all your life?

378
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,834
I've managed to see
what I needed to see.

379
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,434
You haven't seen me.

380
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,790
Come.

381
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,433
Here.

382
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,071
Gringo told me about you.

383
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,757
But he undersold you.

384
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,238
They tell me you're a dancer.

385
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,953
A chorus girl.
Instead of dancing I flash my ass.

386
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,549
I can dance "sardana",
thanks to my mother.

387
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,115
Do you want to try
dancing tango?

388
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,434
Just walk, that's all.
Smooth, like a queen.

389
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,073
Squeezing your pussy.

390
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,672
Look who's here, grandma!

391
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,393
Hello.

392
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,997
It's forbidden, but thanks.

393
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,269
How's it going?

394
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:17,234
Here I am. They're keeping me alive
to get money out of me.

395
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,193
Is that so? Let's ask
the girls to unplug you then.

396
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,472
Do it, I can die for free
anywhere else.

397
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,194
Nurse, unplug the old lady for me!

398
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,276
Stop that,
you'll get us all fired.

399
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,675
I went down to the nursing home
and picked up the scores.

400
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,838
- What did you want them for?
- They won't believe I was young once.

401
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,996
Don't tell me this is you, grandma!

402
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,072
Didn't you have any shame?

403
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,352
Shame of what?
Not here...

404
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,992
but here, we women
are virgins al our lives.

405
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,029
Even Lola.

406
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,993
Though she liked playing the whore.

407
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,518
Don't touch that!

408
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,077
- What are those?
- Money.

409
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,994
Two bits for a fuck,
four for the whole night.

410
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,918
<i>Not two weeks had gone by</i>

411
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,429
<i>and you already
seemed one of them.</i>

412
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,477
<i>You went from table to table,
so as not to get bored,</i>

413
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,591
<i>confusing the clients.</i>

414
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,959
You take photos of her?

415
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,195
Naked?

416
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,277
Dressed as a chorus girl.

417
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,472
Like I did in the train?

418
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,114
I'll show you later.

419
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,432
But like this...

420
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,636
No.

421
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,630
No?

422
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,150
No!

423
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,837
- It would cost you a lot.
- How much?

424
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,589
All those tokens.

425
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,438
<i>The bandoneon was sacred.</i>

426
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,074
<i>But you never asked permission.</i>

427
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,840
<i>You couldn't go through life
without playing it.</i>

428
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,395
If you drop it,
I'll beat the shit out of you.

429
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,877
Is it very difficult?

430
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,396
Your whole life
wouldn't be long enough.

431
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,477
Does it bother you
that Emilio sleeps with us?

432
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,113
Why should it bother her?

433
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,475
Sometimes I eat at home

434
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,477
and sometimes I eat
at a restaurant.

435
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,908
Like your clients do.

436
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,349
Get out!

437
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,352
You're like flies.

438
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,996
I stole this from a theatre.
If you like it, it's yours.

439
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,030
Stay still.

440
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,075
That's it.

441
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,433
Both of you.

442
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,159
<i>The only thing you never
touched was the books.</i>

443
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:21,155
<i>But you knew by heart all
the stuff you'd learned in bed.</i>

444
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,355
<i>You wanted to teach Matilde,
who was a professional.</i>

445
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,834
It's funny, isn't it?

446
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,149
A whore who doesn't believe
in sharing her body.

447
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,115
Want to see how Emilio
doesn't believe in it either?

448
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,515
That you're the one
who'll screw other people?

449
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,599
We do as we please.

450
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,108
You know what?

451
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,833
This breaks only once.

452
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,796
And then you're a virgin for life.

453
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,192
<i>The only one you could fool
was the kid...</i>

454
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,475
<i>He couldn't stop
staring at you.</i>

455
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,358
<i>And at me too.</i>

456
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,950
<i>But he looked at me like it'd been
all my fault from the start.</i>

457
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,071
Did you get laid yet, big boy?

458
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,029
Which one do you prefer?

459
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,276
<i>Sometimes I remember that kid.</i>

460
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:21,188
<i>I guess he's still pawing
your photos and your memories.</i>

461
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,592
<i>The few we left behind.</i>

462
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,679
What are you doing up?

463
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,633
If you need anything,
just ask. Go back to bed.

464
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,233
Want to see them? Alright.

465
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,510
You go back to bed
and I'll bring them to you.

466
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,915
- I must call Jordi.
- No, you can't.

467
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,792
Isn't that your friend
who called from Spain?

468
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,752
You can't call overseas from here.

469
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,474
You can call tomorrow,
when we transfer you.

470
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,238
There's a payphone in the hall.

471
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,159
Come on.

472
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,070
- Vera!
- Give me some change.

473
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,316
You can't call Spain with coins.
You need a card.

474
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,909
- Give me a card then.
- Where would I get one?

475
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,269
Have you got a card?

476
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,276
Me? No.

477
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:11,475
Please, Vera, you'll get me
into trouble. Don't you realize?

478
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,671
What don't I realize?
That I've got cancer?

479
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,757
That I'll be excavated
like my mother?

480
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,030
Of course I do!
Better than anyone else!

481
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,878
- Vera, listen...
- No, you listen!

482
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,629
I'll do with my life, and I've no
idea how much there is left of it

483
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,274
as I fucking please! OK?

484
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,352
If you want to help me,
get me a card.

485
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,194
I have one.

486
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,912
- Thanks. Matilde's related to you?
- She's like a grandmother.

487
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,669
She thinks I'm somebody else.
A Catalonian, like myself.

488
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,876
Jordi? It's Vera.

489
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,191
I'm fine, I swear.

490
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,836
No, that's not why I'm calling.

491
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,593
It's about the book.

492
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,958
I think I've found something.

493
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,670
I'm not crazy!

494
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,269
I've had a breast removed,
not my brain!

495
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,277
Don't tell my sister...

496
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,675
It's as bad as telling my father.

497
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,317
Let Antonio think what he likes,
that I'm here to dance, fuck...

498
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,795
whatever, but I don't want him
to know about the operation.

499
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,595
Good.

500
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,589
Listen.

501
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,592
Try and remember

502
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,110
if you've ever seen a photo
of that woman with a "bandoneón".

503
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:33,669
The one who looks just like me.
Naked, with a "bandoneón".

504
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,516
A "bandoneón"!
A musical instrument, Jordi, Jesus!

505
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,951
The "bandoneón", Suárez.

506
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,508
Sit down.

507
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,039
Listen.

508
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,514
If you play it like this...

509
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,432
It'll just moan.

510
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,879
But if you spread your legs...

511
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,869
wide apart...

512
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,993
it sighs...

513
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,312
for you.

514
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,596
And if you do this
and touch here...

515
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,038
it just gives in.

516
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,519
Suárez.

517
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,630
You're in the picture.
Move.

518
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,239
Listen.

519
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,193
G.

520
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,199
A, G, F, G...

521
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,230
Move it, Suárez, please...

522
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,193
It's like a woman.

523
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,512
You have to know where
to press the right buttons.

524
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,668
Look at me.

525
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,230
Don't you like it
when I look at Suárez?

526
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,758
And Matilde?

527
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,318
Look at me.

528
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,592
I can't see you.

529
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,950
It's as if you were spying on me.

530
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,039
Look at me.

531
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:17,989
I can't see you.

532
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,872
<i>That wasn't you anymore.</i>

533
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,952
<i>You were my invention.
Or an invention of Suárez,</i>

534
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,796
<i>who said that picture was the best,</i>

535
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,116
<i>even though he'd never seen
any of them.</i>

536
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,076
She's about to be christened.

537
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,194
I've been looking for this
for so long now, girl.

538
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,554
Your smell is a B...

539
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,234
..a B flat.

540
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,471
E, F, G, A.

541
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:03,032
G, F, E, D, C, F.

542
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,356
D, E, F, G, E, D, C...

543
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,438
B, C, D...

544
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:25,149
I'm going to dedicate
this tango to you.

545
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,628
It's yours.

546
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,231
Yours forever.

547
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:57,919
When are you leaving?

548
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,553
Early tomorrow.

549
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,629
I'll pay the Gringo for the photos
once you leave them at the printers.

550
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,708
I shouldn't really
have to pay for them

551
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,230
since you ended up
with such a good deal.

552
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,793
Are you sure about this?

553
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,751
You haven't fallen in love?

554
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,029
Me?

555
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,793
With this woman?

556
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,355
She's not the kind of woman
you fall in love with.

557
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,118
I couldn't take it that
she's fucking other guys.

558
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,630
What do you think being
in love is, you fool?

559
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:46,914
I don't know...

560
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,237
It didn't happen to me, but...

561
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,318
I think she is.

562
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,718
She's a girl to fall for, this one.

563
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,911
It wouldn't even occur to Emilio,
even if he was drunk.

564
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:02,759
What do you think
being in love is?

565
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,155
A mistake.

566
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,078
Bullshit.

567
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,871
It's healing well.

568
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,354
On Monday I'll take
the stitches out.

569
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,119
Enough.

570
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:34,956
I'm going to put
a waterproof dressing on it.

571
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,953
If you're careful,
you can take a shower.

572
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,839
First, can I see if for myself?

573
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,758
Go ahead.

574
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,753
You can come and see me
on Monday at 4 PM, alright?

575
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,950
You can fly to Madrid
that same night.

576
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,309
You can even book it.

577
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,438
Alright.

578
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:16,550
Once I'm back in Madrid
I'll start chemotherapy.

579
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,990
For now, just take the antibiotics
for another week...

580
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,033
the painkillers every six hours...

581
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,392
and if the pain is too much,

582
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,830
go to the drugstore and get this.

583
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,237
This will make you feel dizzy.

584
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,118
You're still on your own?

585
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,478
Absolutely.

586
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,431
What are you going to do
this weekend?

587
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,911
I guess I'll stay at my hotel.

588
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,913
Why?

589
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,833
Have you got other plans for me?

590
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,960
You haven't told me if I'll need
chemotherapy yet or not.

591
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,156
I get the biopsy results tomorrow.
But it's probable, yes.

592
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,553
You're very young, Vera.
At your age...

593
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,399
I'm the same age
my mother was.

594
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:29,277
My father made her have chemotherapy,
but she died anyway.

595
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,560
You start low and move
up as high as you can.

596
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:38,195
As high as the spider will take you.
Every day, a little bit higher.

597
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:42,988
You'll be okay.

598
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,590
I can tell when they bring them back
from the operating theatre.

599
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,791
You look at them in
the eye and you just know.

600
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,840
When they wake up
you wonder what they saw,

601
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,712
where they were.

602
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:58,276
I'm not a believer, but to me,
they look like astronauts.

603
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,313
I don't know, I've never looked
an astronaut in the eye, but...

604
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:06,116
but I know there are things
that belong to another order.

605
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,151
Don't let Dr. Zimmerman
hear this...

606
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:12,079
but there are things
doctors don't know,

607
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,159
and they can't explain.

608
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,471
They wheel in some
really desperate cases,

609
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,671
not a hope in hell,
but they seem to survive.

610
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,474
If we forget ourselves and start
talking as if you weren't there,

611
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,193
you're the one
who's got to tell us:

612
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,073
Hey, hang on, wait a minute,
I haven't left yet.

613
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,710
It's up to you.

614
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:33,591
Either you sink or swim,
no one can do it for you.

615
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:42,430
- Have the whales come yet?
- They've been here a while now.

616
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,195
Did you dive with them?

617
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,039
Tell me!

618
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:53,549
A boy wanted to know where
the whales go when they leave.

619
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,428
In winter he'd look at them
from the shore...

620
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,629
and in summer
he'd keep on asking.

621
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:02,590
Wait for me!

622
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,677
<i>But when people
talked about the sea,</i>

623
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,755
<i>they'd talk about the surface.</i>

624
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:13,195
They'd tell him to be careful,
not to swim too deep.

625
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:19,035
<i>Not a word about the whales.</i>

626
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,155
<i>One day he stopped asking,</i>

627
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:25,159
<i>and went to swim with the whales.</i>

628
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,633
Go on.

629
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,799
Down there you see everything
upside down.

630
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:42,439
The surface is a shiny crystal...

631
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,913
and whales fly.

632
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,788
The boy realized from shore you see
the wrong side of the sea.

633
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:58,357
From the bottom
you can see the real sea.

634
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,797
He was a bit scared.

635
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,319
Why? What happened?

636
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:11,238
Nothing, they just got too close.

637
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,637
Whales are shy,
but they're also curious.

638
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,676
They stared at him
with their great big eyes...

639
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,916
to have a good look at him.

640
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,672
I'm the one who's the mystery,
thought the boy.

641
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,556
And at that moment, he realized
that everything is relative.

642
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,272
That there's really very little
that we can understand.

643
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:43,796
So he stopped wondering
where the whales go...

644
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,234
and was happy to just sit
and wait for them.

645
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,872
Where do they go?

646
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,912
I don't know.

647
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,830
Something tells them
they have to leave.

648
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,197
And they trust that.

649
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,873
A call...

650
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,431
the command of the species.

651
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,996
The migration of the souls.

652
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,833
Something takes them
to their destiny.

653
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,598
They come and they go,

654
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,715
even if we'll never know
where they've been.

655
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,069
It's not a fish!

656
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:45,113
It's got warm blood!
And it's got a harpoon stuck in it!

657
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,475
Pedro! Come here!

658
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,870
- What's it like?
- Huge.

659
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,350
And when they are about to die,

660
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,357
they come out onto the beach.

661
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,995
No, grandma, no.
They die in the deep sea.

662
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:05,634
Every now and then,
one gets stranded.

663
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:11,756
But we don't know why.

664
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,276
Because they're tired.

665
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,510
I'm tired too.

666
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,716
Will you take me there?

667
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,313
Throw me into the sea.

668
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:39,317
Your father
will tell you where.

669
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:44,078
And don't forget
to get the money.

670
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,035
The painting
is hanging over the bed.

671
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,072
Give it to her...

672
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,996
tell her to come closer.

673
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,357
Come here, Catalonian.

674
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,235
Don't be afraid.

675
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:07,118
Take care of that
painting for me.

676
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,600
I took really good care of it.

677
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,516
I've been keeping it
safe for you...

678
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,678
my whole life.

679
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,910
Get out, please. Get out now.

680
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,269
Out of here! Both of you!

681
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,912
Cardiac arrest!

682
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:03,837
<i>I don't know why I went to
that beach, it was like a circus.</i>

683
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:07,228
<i>Watching an accident
of nature.</i>

684
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:21,352
<i>I called the photo
that I gave</i>

685
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,790
<i>"The Call of the Species".</i>

686
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:27,073
<i>Not just because of
the story she used to tell.</i>

687
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,477
<i>I gave it that title
for you too.</i>

688
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:40,869
Lola!

689
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,752
Come here, Emilio!

690
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,235
- Give me your hand.
- Get out!

691
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,271
Come on, come into the water!

692
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,078
Are you afraid of
getting the money

693
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,508
that you've hidden
in your pocket wet?

694
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:54,914
- What did they pay you for?
- The photos.

695
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:58,317
And what was Orestes paid for?

696
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:01,593
I don't know, Lola,
perhaps for having brought us.

697
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,314
And me?

698
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,470
How much do I get
for posing naked?

699
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:10,557
I don't know, Lola, you should
sort that out with Suarez.

700
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,678
I don't owe you anything.

701
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,837
Yes, you do owe me!

702
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,395
You owe me a trip
to the end of the world!

703
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,636
Remember, you bastard!

704
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:27,149
You are free to come and go
and fuck anyone you like.

705
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:30,518
I'm not even owner
of my own body!

706
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:35,395
<i>Hello, Vera, love.</i>

707
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,433
<i>We've had a lovely Sunday,
haven't we Juanito?</i>

708
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:41,311
<i>And Juanito has
learned something new.</i>

709
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,238
<i>Hang on... Juanito.
Do it for mummy.</i>

710
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,590
<i>He's learned how to whistle.
He's been practising for you.</i>

711
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,197
<i>When are you coming back?</i>

712
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:00,835
<i>It's me, Antonio. I've been
calling you every day this week.</i>

713
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:03,838
<i>They said at the hotel
that you'd gone. Where are you?</i>

714
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,350
<i>Hello, mum,
welcome to your computer.</i>

715
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,118
<i>Hello, Vera.
This is Jordi.</i>

716
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,913
<i>Antonio called me, freaked out
because he couldn't find you.</i>

717
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,036
<i>I had to tell him, Vera.</i>

718
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:20,957
<i>Hello, mum, welcome
to your comp...</i>

719
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:23,720
<i>Vera, I'm calling
about Matilde's photo.</i>

720
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,314
<i>I'm going to go
to her nursing home,</i>

721
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,839
<i>but I'm not sure
how to give you directions.</i>

722
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:29,554
<i>She's to be cremated tomorrow,
at 9AM at Chacarita cemetery.</i>

723
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:32,032
<i>If you like,
I'll meet you there.</i>

724
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,079
Hello.

725
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,836
In Spain we give two kisses.

726
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,960
I spent all night
doing paperwork.

727
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:00,111
Not even dying is easy
in this country.

728
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:01,714
Can I help you?

729
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,108
- Do you want them?
- Would you give them to me?

730
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,917
I can't fit anything else in here.

731
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,757
The Catalonian that
intrigued you so much.

732
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,112
Matilde loved her.

733
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,113
Even though my grandfather
dedicated his best tango to her.

734
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,390
He was a musician,
but lived off women.

735
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:37,114
And this one, the Catalonian woman,
was called Dolores?

736
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,198
Why can't I go by plane?

737
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,791
I weigh nothing,
less than a letter.

738
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:20,235
I want to go alone.

739
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:30,510
How many days
will you spend in Trelew?

740
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,591
I don't know, Lola.

741
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:35,994
I have to find a laboratory,

742
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:37,872
make the copies,
talk to the printers...

743
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:39,149
What if you never come back?

744
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:41,678
How do I get back
to Buenos Aires?

745
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:50,272
You're not free...
You're a coward.

746
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:51,595
Gentlemen!

747
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,957
I want to make a toast!

748
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:00,434
To our friend,
the photographer.

749
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:04,235
May he follow his destiny!
Cheers!

750
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:09,637
Who knows what
marvels he will he find?

751
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:12,638
But there's none better than
the one he's leaving behind.

752
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:15,070
<i>I've always been intrigued
by her legend.</i>

753
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:17,279
<i>What legend?</i>

754
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:18,470
<i>Something they say</i>

755
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,875
she did, which gave
the name to the tango.

756
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,278
The light bulb.

757
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:31,600
- That's it.
- What do you mean?

758
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:36,272
Now it's nice and warm.

759
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:40,079
Now I want you to play for me.

760
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:41,474
<i>Apparently the first time</i>

761
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,352
my grandfather played
this tango in public

762
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:44,629
<i>she danced to it.</i>

763
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:49,759
With a light bulb
stuck between her legs.

764
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:08,112
Here's 500,
I'll send the rest as usual.

765
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:09,196
Alright.

766
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:22,677
When I came to study here
I lived at Matilde's place.

767
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:29,550
I slept on the couch,
looking at that photo.

768
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,118
A couple of times
I asked her about it,

769
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:33,992
but she would get lost
in thought.

770
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:37,030
She would just start
talking to herself.

771
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:38,993
Poor old thing.

772
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:48,110
- Where is this place?
- In Patagonia.

773
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,916
What did you come
to Buenos Aires to study?

774
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:54,313
Biology. Three years.

775
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:58,112
Then I had to leave
and dropped out.

776
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:01,229
In Mexico I used to take
tourists on scuba diving trips.

777
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:06,155
Is it true you swim
with whales?

778
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,078
I'm supposed
to only observe them.

779
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:12,430
- I wouldn't like that...
- What?

780
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,398
You just observing me.

781
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:17,957
If I were a whale, I mean.

782
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:22,232
What are you going
to do with all this?

783
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,868
The lady asked me
to clear her room out.

784
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:31,676
I have to go.
I'm going to miss my plane.

785
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,112
Besides, if there's
something I can't stand,

786
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:38,512
it's collecting memories.

787
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:41,159
Is that so?

788
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:50,477
And I don't like
farewells either.

789
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:53,239
Be careful.

790
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,436
Aren't you going to ask me
what they did to me?

791
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:04,750
No.

792
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:09,551
They removed a tumour
the size of a walnut...

793
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:13,548
the left breast
and I don't know what else.

794
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:18,191
The stitches
are still there...

795
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:21,756
like barbed wire.

796
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:27,274
- I wanted you to know.
- I knew.

797
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:31,910
I could show you my heart.
Really...

798
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,150
You can see it
between my ribs.

799
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:38,233
The heartbeats.

800
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:31,273
Here, a memento. Take anything
you like, but let's go.

801
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:34,634
Anything?

802
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:47,948
Go, then. Don't miss your flight.
I'll take care of everything.

803
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:52,993
- I've already missed it.
- You can still make it.

804
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,155
This is the peak season.

805
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:56,669
They'll be starting
on the waiting list by now.

806
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,073
Do you really mean it?

807
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:03,040
I'd like to stay here
for a while, on my own.

808
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:07,874
Really?

809
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,110
I'll like to give you
something of mine.

810
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:19,355
I wrote this.

811
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:22,393
Seriously?

812
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:26,678
This can't be you? Yes, it is,
when you were a girl!

813
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:30,836
Look at this, you posed for
photos naked, just like...

814
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,270
You really do look alike.
She wasn't far wrong, the old lady.

815
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:35,674
Stop it!

816
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,799
- So you were a writer.
- You said it: I was.

817
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,036
- When I did what I wanted.
- Like what?

818
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:43,196
I don't know, what I wanted.

819
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:46,388
Like what?

820
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:49,156
Like fucking a stranger.

821
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:11,431
- Who is it?
- It's me, Suarez.

822
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:22,953
Here. Take this.
Urondo's token.

823
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:25,155
Take it!

824
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:59,431
<i>The plane went out over the sea
and we flew over the beacon.</i>

825
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:03,193
<i>The tide was high
and the whale had gone.</i>

826
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:07,115
<i>I had a weird feeling,
one of relief,</i>

827
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,716
<i>that stayed with me
for the rest of the journey.</i>

828
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:13,638
<i>As if everything
had fallen into place.</i>

829
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:24,438
<i>This morning a whale was stranded
on the shores of Patagonia.</i>

830
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:27,757
<i>- Here's the story.
- For reasons we are not aware</i>

831
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:31,873
<i>this 15 metre-long adult
whale was stranded.</i>

832
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,672
<i>Apparently it's a female.</i>

833
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:37,668
<i>We are working with volunteers
and staff from the institute</i>

834
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:39,791
<i>in an effort to keep it alive.</i>

835
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:43,989
<i>And we're hoping that at high tide
it might free itself naturally.</i>

836
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,918
<i>Thanks to our colleagues
at Puerto Madryn TV</i>

837
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:49,439
<i>for this coverage...</i>

838
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:22,952
- What are you doing here?
- I called the Institute.

839
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,233
They told me you were
with the whale.

840
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,476
That you'd be back here
when it got dark.

841
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:29,758
When I saw that
it was stranded again...

842
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:31,792
It was stranded again?

843
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,231
That a whale was stranded
again on the same spot.

844
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:39,554
- What was that?
- Whales.

845
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:43,150
Mating. This place
is perfect for mating.

846
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:45,759
The Seal. This is Vera.

847
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:48,155
- Hello, Seal.
- Hello, Vera.

848
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:52,672
I guess I also came
to see you again.

849
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:56,671
I'm sorry, it's not my fault.
Somebody called me.

850
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:58,918
Well... me.

851
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:01,750
It seems to make
no sense to you?

852
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:04,716
But it's like the boy
in your story,

853
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:06,831
we can't really
understand much.

854
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:10,910
The same happened
to me with Matilde.

855
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:17,113
I felt I was being called
and went up to say goodbye.

856
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,830
I thought it was me
who was leaving.

857
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:28,112
Do you have any rooms free?

858
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:32,274
- How's the whale?
- Still alive.

859
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:34,434
It's under the beacon
on the cliff.

860
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,949
Wasn't the one with
the harpoon over there?

861
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:40,391
- Somewhere around there.
- Where did it have the harpoon?

862
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:43,194
Stuck right here.
Behind the eye.

863
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:45,755
I'm sorry, madam,
we have no rooms left.

864
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:47,916
She can have mine.
I'll sleep on the boat.

865
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:51,192
- You're crazy. You can't.
- It's yours.

866
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,829
The whale you mentioned,
the one with the harpoon,

867
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:04,040
- was that many years ago?
- It was 1934.

868
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:06,998
A long time ago...

869
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:12,637
Could it be the same whale?

870
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:15,315
She'd have to be very old.

871
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:25,598
What do I do with this?

872
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:28,077
I don't know.
He sent it to you.

873
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:31,640
Didn't he give you anything else?
No letter?

874
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:34,432
He sent the scores for Suarez.

875
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:36,915
And he asked me to give you one
as a souvenir, that's all.

876
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:45,149
You can't work like this.
Aren't you taking anything?

877
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:49,750
When I get back
I'll bring you some medicine.

878
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:52,230
Where was Emilio going?

879
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:55,079
He was on his way south,
to Puerto Deseado.

880
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:57,917
He was going to take a ship
for Tierra del Fuego.

881
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,753
Suarez owes me money. It's yours
if you can get me out of here.

882
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:07,518
I could hide in the plane.
Nobody will know.

883
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:10,516
And afterwards?
How could I come back?

884
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,833
I have to work here.

885
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:21,952
Take care of that cold of yours.

886
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:26,040
<i>The Gringo Orestes had the habit
of talking to himself.</i>

887
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:29,837
<i>Once he told me
that forgotten words</i>

888
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:31,758
<i>could still be heard
in the air.</i>

889
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:36,149
<i>That if you repeated them,
the same things would happen again.</i>

890
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:38,753
<i>I'm writing this,</i>

891
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:42,919
<i>the things I never told you,
in case that's true.</i>

892
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:50,557
When these photos were taken

893
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:52,637
they didn't think
about identifying them.

894
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,639
Look...

895
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,671
..the calluses are the same.

896
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:01,631
Your hunch is not so absurd.

897
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:04,308
Scientists don't believe
in these things?

898
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:05,509
On the contrary.

899
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,798
That's what we do.

900
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:12,314
Last night I dropped by
but I couldn't find you.

901
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:15,231
Do you always write at night?

902
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:19,998
- It's been ages since I wrote.
- You got inspired.

903
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,828
This place is ideal for that too.

904
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:26,151
They say you just
have to get started.

905
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:31,349
The problem is, if it doesn't
come out, it rots inside.

906
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:40,476
Each of these represented
a pile of money.

907
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:42,750
They made combs,
nitro glycerine,

908
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,757
oils, all sorts of stuff.

909
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:48,357
- How long can it hold out?
- Probably, until another tide.

910
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:51,510
There isn't much we can do.

911
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:55,515
Keep her wet, and scare the fucking
seagulls hurting her.

912
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:59,957
It's sink or swim. If she doesn't
free herself nobody else can.

913
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:09,997
And what if it
was the same one?

914
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:13,476
I don't know, perhaps
it would be of scientific interest.

915
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:17,150
You win, Gallega.
It has a scar behind the eye.

916
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:19,351
Did you hear?

917
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:22,555
How did you get
in this mess, old lady?

918
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:25,071
What did you come back for?

919
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,952
I started reading your book
on the plane.

920
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:28,559
- Did you?
- I liked it.

921
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:32,034
- I like the girl's freedom.
- Really?

922
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:35,916
Would you have liked to meet her?

923
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:40,952
You left a letter inside.

924
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:47,553
- Did you read it?
- Of course not.

925
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:50,557
I've read it a thousand times.

926
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:53,957
And instead of text for a book of
photos, I wrote something else.

927
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:57,438
I put myself in Lola's place.
She wasn't afraid of anything.

928
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:58,868
But how do you know?

929
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:02,318
I know. I can imagine her.

930
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:05,320
I write about her as
if I was writing about myself.

931
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:08,956
And you haven't written
anything else until now?

932
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:10,116
No.

933
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:12,716
After publishing the novel
I got married...

934
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:15,314
and had a son.

935
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:19,230
- Do you have children?
- Yes.

936
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:23,955
A nine year old girl who lives
with her mother in Mexico.

937
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:28,398
And can you bear
being away from her?

938
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:30,715
No.

939
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:33,196
Then you know how much it hurts.

940
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:41,593
You didn't really come to write
a book on whales, did you?

941
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,630
Didn't Matilde ever mention
a photographer?

942
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:46,876
Yes, the one who did
the photos for the scores.

943
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:49,548
I've got his photos,
and the letter.

944
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:53,548
He wrote it to Lola the day
before he died, in January '39.

945
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:59,668
- He never sent it?
- He was killed in the war.

946
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:04,628
But Lola was dead already.
I came here to investigate that.

947
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:12,349
- What do you know about Lola?
- Nothing.

948
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,153
Just what my grandfather told me.

949
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:16,396
That she went back to Spain
and became a star.

950
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:17,316
That's not true.

951
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,990
If Lola worked for him,
there's no way he wouldn't see.

952
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:22,749
My grandfather was blind, Vera.

953
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:27,996
What you wrote
is related to these photos?

954
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,594
Did you already have them
when Matilde left you the photo?

955
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:35,199
They belong to
a publishing house.

956
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,755
It's publishing a book of photos.
They want me to write the text.

957
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:39,313
Why didn't you tell me?

958
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:43,359
I don't know.
I'm sorry.

959
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:47,555
I was about to return to Madrid,
empty handed, as I'd found nothing,

960
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:50,479
I was operated on in Buenos Aires
and I met Matilde.

961
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:52,593
Chance, destiny,
call it what you like.

962
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,711
I took you to her nursing home.
It wasn't destiny.

963
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:57,396
You screwed me and you kept
Matilde's stuff.

964
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:58,794
That's not chance.

965
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,230
Anyway, you were going
to throw everything out.

966
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:07,389
Hello!

967
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:10,399
What are you doing here?

968
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:12,717
Nothing, just passing by.

969
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:16,029
If you still have any complaints,
this is the editor of the book.

970
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:18,708
Jordi Ferré.
He'll take care of everything.

971
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:20,832
I forgot your name.

972
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:22,115
Ernesto Suárez.

973
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,231
The grandson of the guy
who exploited Lola.

974
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:26,476
- Who?
- Lola, Jordi.

975
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:28,318
The one in the letter.

976
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:30,914
Hello, Ernesto.

977
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,833
- How did you find me?
- Where do you want me to start?

978
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,678
From where you betrayed me
to Antonio.

979
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:39,075
After that I called Dr. Zimmerman,
I flew to Madrid,

980
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:41,271
from there to Buenos Aires,
went to the hospital to see him,

981
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:43,994
then to your hotel and you'd left.
A two hour flight to Puerto Madryn...

982
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:46,316
I searched for you
at every hotel in town...

983
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:48,590
I booked a room
and took a taxi to come here.

984
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,552
- What's the name of this place?
- Puerto Pirámide.

985
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:52,034
That's it, and here I am.

986
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:55,835
100 kms in a taxi. I should be
in the Guinness Book of Records.

987
01:19:56,840 --> 01:20:00,310
You saw my doctor, Jordi.
I can't believe it.

988
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,634
You're not even capable
of watering a plant.

989
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:07,037
It wasn't hard. I just thought:
What would Antonio do?

990
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:10,312
What would he ask?
What would Antonio do in my place?

991
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:15,631
Let them look after you, Vera.

992
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:18,596
You can't work this out
on your own.

993
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,150
I got cancer on my own.

994
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:24,951
Antonio went to get the tests
you had in Madrid...

995
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:27,833
and your father
contacted Dr. Zimmerman.

996
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:31,879
Anyway. I have the results
of the biopsy.

997
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:34,238
Give me that.

998
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:17,751
Shall we go out for a drink?

999
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:25,834
Shit. All I can think of
is getting drunk with you.

1000
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:41,709
Give me one.

1001
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:43,117
No, Vera.

1002
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:48,474
Being healthy goes against my
principles, but don't ask me that.

1003
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:54,754
It's not the only thing
I'll ask of you.

1004
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:14,072
Do you know
when I last smoked?

1005
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:19,549
The last time
I had sex with you.

1006
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:23,119
How long ago was that?

1007
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:26,188
Years.

1008
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:28,389
How many?

1009
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:30,276
I don't know.

1010
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:36,792
What are you doing?

1011
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,960
Vera, I have presbyopia.

1012
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:58,236
Did the doctor
say you could do it?

1013
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:00,113
I've done it already.

1014
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,150
Shit, I'm never the first.

1015
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:45,990
There's nothing like
having sex when you're tired.

1016
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:00,278
- I haven't forgotten you.
- Shut up.

1017
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,356
And this place suits you.

1018
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:14,356
You look like a professional
fucking with your clothes on.

1019
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:16,391
Will you shut up?

1020
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:24,195
We've certainly done it
in strange places...

1021
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:29,433
but I don't recall having
done it in a whorehouse.

1022
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:35,037
- What are you saying?
- The cab driver told me.

1023
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:39,791
There were whores here.

1024
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:44,389
Maybe in this very bed.

1025
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,159
What did I say?

1026
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:25,516
What's wrong?

1027
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:28,669
Nothing.

1028
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:42,513
PIBE PEDRO AND HIS TANGO QUARTET

1029
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:24,828
I've heard about that harpoon
since I was a kid.

1030
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:34,157
What did you hear?

1031
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:38,237
It was pulled out of the whale
and given to my grandfather.

1032
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:40,632
That's how it survived.

1033
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:47,350
Sheer luck, wouldn't you say?

1034
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:54,998
Do you know what, Gallega?

1035
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:57,958
I don't believe in anything.

1036
01:26:58,720 --> 01:26:59,994
I'd like to.

1037
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:04,834
To believe in God, be a football fan,
to have fought in the revolution...

1038
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:08,590
But no, the few things
I believed in collapsed.

1039
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:16,470
Now you tell me it's the same whale,
and so it is.

1040
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:25,272
You have no idea how scared
I was of that harpoon.

1041
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:30,235
What will you have?

1042
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:33,075
A whisky.

1043
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,073
No ice.

1044
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:40,435
What did you go to pick up
at the nursing home?

1045
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:44,317
Money. It has no value.

1046
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:47,474
Just some old bills
Matilde kept as a souvenir.

1047
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:50,358
Is this what you're talking about?

1048
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:52,797
Where did you get those?

1049
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:56,153
Matilde asked me to scatter them
with her ashes when she died,

1050
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:57,588
I don't know why.

1051
01:27:57,800 --> 01:27:58,915
Do you know what I think?

1052
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:01,628
This was Lola's price.

1053
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:03,478
What do you know about that?

1054
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:09,195
<i>Emilio mentions
this money in a letter.</i>

1055
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:14,716
<i>He said he gave it to Matilde.</i>

1056
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:18,229
<i>And apparently it's true.</i>

1057
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:22,039
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

1058
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:27,270
<i>I was a kid,
I barely remember.</i>

1059
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:29,959
Do you remember the money?

1060
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:39,476
Lola!

1061
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:42,753
I want to thank you...

1062
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:45,315
for being with Matilde
until the end.

1063
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:48,394
My son told me
she was fond of you.

1064
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:51,389
Yes, it's true.

1065
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:54,910
Let me introduce myself.
I am Pibe Pedro.

1066
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:57,873
"Bandoneón" player.
Future composer.

1067
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:00,911
Lola!

1068
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:05,792
- Suárez!
- Emilio?

1069
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:10,668
It's been a long time.
You remembered your friends.

1070
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:14,272
- I've got to talk to you.
- Coming.

1071
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:19,350
What is it?

1072
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:23,194
I've come to take Lola away.

1073
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:28,869
How do you plan to do that?
I won't just give her away.

1074
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:32,790
And if this rat ever touches
her again, I'll kill her.

1075
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,638
Who are you going to kill,
you bastard!

1076
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:37,639
You shut up, woman!

1077
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:41,676
You're not taking her away
just like that.

1078
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:44,310
If you want her...

1079
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,958
Then don't come shouting
and bullying around here.

1080
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:50,513
Lola's not leaving here!

1081
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:54,508
If you don't shut the fuck up
I'll sell you instead.

1082
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:57,516
- Have you got the dough on you?
- Yes...

1083
01:29:57,880 --> 01:29:59,552
The 1,500 you gave me.

1084
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:08,716
Tell me something.
What do you want her for?

1085
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:12,633
I just want her.
I don't know why.

1086
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:14,751
What's it to you?

1087
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:18,400
I just don't like
cheating on anybody.

1088
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:22,475
We have others
in much better shape.

1089
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:24,115
But whatever,

1090
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:27,117
if you've set
your heart on Lola,

1091
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:30,431
and if Matilde agrees...

1092
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:31,990
Hey, girl?

1093
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,319
You decide.

1094
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:41,192
If you want her, she stays.

1095
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:45,996
If you let her go,
the money is yours.

1096
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:48,716
Come on...

1097
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:51,276
take it.

1098
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:02,032
Hey, kid, kid...

1099
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:05,390
Lola's no longer
what she used to be.

1100
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:09,514
She's really gone downhill
since you sold her.

1101
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:12,838
- You didn't tell her, right?
- No, I didn't tell her a thing.

1102
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:15,670
- I'm telling you so that you know.
- I know.

1103
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:17,870
I know what I've done.

1104
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:21,755
No, I'm telling you so you know
what you're getting.

1105
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:25,594
The other stuff
is your business, asshole.

1106
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:37,678
This place is charming, isn't it?

1107
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,673
With a touch of nostalgia...

1108
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:43,592
Admit you're smoking again.

1109
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:46,598
Just buy your own
and kill yourself slowly.

1110
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:56,870
You've known each other
for a long time.

1111
01:31:59,240 --> 01:32:01,037
Vera was nineteen.

1112
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,515
I was teaching on a summer course
and we got involved.

1113
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:09,274
Then she started showing
me what she wrote.

1114
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:14,751
And since I make a living out
of other people's talent...

1115
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:17,030
And you'll publish
what she's writing.

1116
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:21,438
Well, I asked her to write
a text for a book of photos...

1117
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:23,790
but now it seems she's writing
a novel, right?

1118
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:28,518
What will be the title?

1119
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:32,074
I've no idea. "Lola's Price"

1120
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:35,272
or "The Whore and the Whale",
something like that.

1121
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:37,594
To the new novel.

1122
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:40,517
It'll sell much better
than the other one.

1123
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:47,078
To Lola and Emilio.

1124
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:49,791
I'd give my soul
to dance like her.

1125
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:52,197
Because my body is already...

1126
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:01,670
They want me to do
some more tests.

1127
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:04,150
Do you know what
the sentry ganglion is?

1128
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:05,952
The warning.

1129
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:17,830
Those tests are to make sure
other parts of the body are fine.

1130
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:21,716
I'm not a doctor, but I think
you should do as they say.

1131
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:34,230
I think the old man wants to
dedicate the next one to you.

1132
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:20,198
<i>Two pesos for going to bed,
four for the night.</i>

1133
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:22,518
<i>You don't get in here
without paying.</i>

1134
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:25,033
Where's your token?

1135
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:27,798
You don't get in here
without paying.

1136
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:31,197
<i>You pretended you knew nothing,
as you didn't work here any more.</i>

1137
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:34,234
<i>I said nothing,
went and paid my token.</i>

1138
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:36,552
<i>So you'd let me in.</i>

1139
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:41,395
<i>At least... that night.
Even though it was the last.</i>

1140
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:45,550
<i>The whales could be heard
really close,</i>

1141
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:48,072
<i>as if they were calling.</i>

1142
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:51,955
Sorry.

1143
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:57,675
I just wanted to tell you
that the bar is closed

1144
01:36:58,760 --> 01:37:01,194
and I've found someone
to take me to Puerto Madryn.

1145
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:03,118
Aren't you staying the night?

1146
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:07,953
There's always a
second chance, right?

1147
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:11,838
Sometimes it helps
to say goodbye.

1148
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:16,552
But I'm too drunk.
I'd rather go to my hotel.

1149
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:19,513
You won't even do me a favour?

1150
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:21,718
You won't even try?

1151
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:30,317
Let's pretend you're
a travelling salesman.

1152
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:33,918
You come to my door...

1153
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:38,874
and tell me you need
to take a leak.

1154
01:37:40,240 --> 01:37:43,277
But you're not you.
He's a dirty old man, right?

1155
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:45,232
- Even if he has your face.
- Vera, stop it.

1156
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:47,795
If you want to fuck,
then fuck somebody else.

1157
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:53,435
My flight leaves at nine.

1158
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:55,712
If you want,
you can still make it

1159
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:58,036
to the appointment
with Dr. Zimmerman.

1160
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,797
I'll be at the airport.

1161
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:07,274
Leave some money. I'm as broke
as a whore during Lent.

1162
01:38:16,040 --> 01:38:18,679
Yet again, you're giving up
without a fight, Jordi.

1163
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:22,033
- You're still the same...
- The same what?

1164
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:26,838
Do you know what's happened
to me all these years?

1165
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:29,319
Nothing at all.

1166
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:32,799
Sometimes I just want
to talk, shout out...

1167
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,992
because you can't hear
a thing in those filthy bars.

1168
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:40,038
And I hear myself saying
the same old things.

1169
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:44,149
Only I'm older.

1170
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,036
But you're lucky.

1171
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,877
I hope I'd get to say
the same one day.

1172
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:57,396
You're going to bury us all.

1173
01:38:59,320 --> 01:39:01,595
You're no longer
the girl I seduced.

1174
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:05,874
You've turned
into quite a woman.

1175
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:15,073
Alright. Let me go.

1176
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:16,829
Let me go.

1177
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:20,112
I'm the same old guy
I always was.

1178
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:39,118
Take your clothes off.
We don't have all night.

1179
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:42,152
We have a lifetime.

1180
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:45,954
We'll leave tomorrow.

1181
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:48,675
I just wanted to be with you.

1182
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:53,671
Aren't you going to ask me
what I want?

1183
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:55,229
You want to leave, don't you?

1184
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:59,391
Yes, but you haven't asked me.

1185
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:04,120
Please, forgive me.
I'll never forgive myself.

1186
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:08,793
I've missed you.
I've had a terrible time here.

1187
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:13,319
I, on the other hand,
had a wonderful time here.

1188
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:17,272
<i>- I needed to be alone.
- I needed to be alone.</i>

1189
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:23,036
But being alone in
Tierra del Fuego is frightening.

1190
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:25,272
You come to realize
what you really want.

1191
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:30,031
You realize what you want.

1192
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:34,276
And I want you,
I want to be with you.

1193
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:37,119
<i>What do I care what happens to you
when you're far away from here?</i>

1194
01:40:37,320 --> 01:40:39,038
What the hell do I care
what happens to you

1195
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:40,389
when you're far away
from here?

1196
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:41,999
You just want
what you don't have.

1197
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:43,599
And you don't have the balls
to look after what you have.

1198
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:45,392
<i>And you don't have the balls
to look after what you have.</i>

1199
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:47,879
Look at yourself.

1200
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:50,152
Now you're here and you don't
even want to do it.

1201
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:52,590
What do you expect, when you
treat me the way a whore would.

1202
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:53,789
That's what I am!

1203
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,228
Thanks to you!

1204
01:40:58,520 --> 01:40:59,794
<i>- I want to see them.
- What?</i>

1205
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,992
The 1,500 pesos I cost you.
I want to see them!

1206
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:07,632
Matilde's got them.

1207
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:11,310
<i>I don't know what's worse,
buying me or selling me.</i>

1208
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:15,550
I don't know what's worse,
buying me or selling me.

1209
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:17,719
You're still the same.

1210
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:20,154
The same, what?

1211
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:21,719
You're not a man...

1212
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:26,639
You're not a man...

1213
01:41:28,240 --> 01:41:30,629
You don't know what you want.
At least I do as I please.

1214
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:33,038
Sure, you do as you please.

1215
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:37,673
Are we talking about my pleasure
or Suarez' pleasure?

1216
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:41,070
You don't know who you are
unless someone is stroking you.

1217
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:41,837
Shut up.

1218
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:44,869
And with just a bit of stroking,
you spread your legs.

1219
01:41:45,080 --> 01:41:46,513
You think you do
as you please

1220
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:48,358
but you're just here
for other people's pleasure.

1221
01:41:57,160 --> 01:41:59,230
<i>And that's being
a whore, right?</i>

1222
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:04,149
And that's being
a whore, right?

1223
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,309
I'm not a whore
because you sold me.

1224
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:11,758
You sold me as a whore.

1225
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:14,670
- I didn't say that.
- Don't you touch me!

1226
01:42:30,760 --> 01:42:32,830
Do you know what I wondered
when I was far away?

1227
01:42:37,320 --> 01:42:38,594
Who are you

1228
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:44,077
when nobody's looking at you?

1229
01:43:05,480 --> 01:43:08,199
We're going to take
Matilde out to sea.

1230
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:11,432
Ernesto's asking
if you want to come with us.

1231
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:16,079
- I got you out of bed.
- No way.

1232
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,753
I was writing.
I think I found it.

1233
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:22,516
- Your novel?
- Yes.

1234
01:43:23,240 --> 01:43:25,231
And when your father
called at my door...

1235
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:28,034
I thought he was going to tell me
the whale had gone.

1236
01:43:28,240 --> 01:43:29,036
Another hunch?

1237
01:43:29,240 --> 01:43:31,834
Or better still,
that she'd gone again.

1238
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:37,398
- Shall we go and see?
- Why not? We're going that way.

1239
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,399
<i>You slept a while,</i>

1240
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:48,475
<i>and I stayed looking at you
for the rest of the night.</i>

1241
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:58,156
<i>When Pibe Pedro knocked on
he door to take us to the plane,</i>

1242
01:44:00,240 --> 01:44:02,913
<i>you opened your eyes and looked
at me as if I were a stranger.</i>

1243
01:44:33,640 --> 01:44:35,835
<i>As dawn was breaking
and we took off,</i>

1244
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:39,159
<i>I could see the whale
near the sandbar.</i>

1245
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:43,236
<i>With the sure instinct of animals,
as if time didn't exist,</i>

1246
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:47,228
<i>it headed for a specific spot
in the middle of the sea.</i>

1247
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:27,189
I'm worth more
than 1,500 pesos.

1248
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:29,837
Listen, you. Don't be stupid!

1249
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:34,430
Don't mistake value for price.

1250
01:45:40,520 --> 01:45:42,670
I'm not free because
they let me go.

1251
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:45,997
I'm free because
I was born that way.

1252
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:47,838
Even though
I've only been here

1253
01:45:48,040 --> 01:45:50,554
for other people's pleasure.
Isn't that right Suarez?

1254
01:45:57,560 --> 01:45:59,471
You really saw through me...

1255
01:46:04,280 --> 01:46:06,635
even if you're a blind bastard.

1256
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:10,438
Beat it, girl.

1257
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:25,196
- And now what?
- I told Seal to follow the whale.

1258
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:26,635
You tell me where to stop...

1259
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:28,751
And we'll throw the ashes
into the water,

1260
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:30,749
alright?

1261
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:35,517
I'll throw you in,
if you don't tell me the story.

1262
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:51,272
I didn't even tell Suarez.

1263
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:53,797
You're Suarez now.

1264
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,912
You're no longer a boy, pops.
And me neither.

1265
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:14,035
My old man never tells.

1266
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:16,751
He's been like that all his life.

1267
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:24,228
When my grandfather
told his stories...

1268
01:48:24,440 --> 01:48:26,237
my dad would leave so
as not to have listen to them.

1269
01:48:31,240 --> 01:48:32,798
Do you feel okay, Gallega?

1270
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:36,557
You shouldn't be doing this.

1271
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:39,029
Take your clothes off,
so you don't get...

1272
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:41,310
I can do as I please!
Don't treat me like I was ill.

1273
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:45,195
But you are ill. I forget too
at times, but you're ill.

1274
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:47,834
I'm okay.

1275
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:49,715
I'm just a little dizzy.

1276
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:55,790
It's not my fault.
Some things just happen.

1277
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,116
Forgive me.
I don't know what I'm saying.

1278
01:49:23,320 --> 01:49:25,914
Say whatever you like...

1279
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:29,472
but don't say you're sorry.

1280
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:50,590
Today your father
reminded me of mine.

1281
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:56,516
All the things
we never said to each other.

1282
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:02,633
All my life I've blamed him
for everything.

1283
01:50:11,960 --> 01:50:14,110
What you say is true.

1284
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:17,592
Of course I'm ill.

1285
01:50:19,240 --> 01:50:21,470
It's a relief
to hear you say it.

1286
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:05,069
I don't know what you were
like before. But you're beautiful.

1287
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:34,233
So you're leaving
tomorrow morning.

1288
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:36,317
I do as I please.

1289
01:51:39,320 --> 01:51:42,118
Like Lola, she finally
finds out what she wants.

1290
01:51:44,240 --> 01:51:47,516
One day I'll find
your novel in a bookstore,

1291
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:50,232
and I'll know you're okay.

1292
01:51:50,680 --> 01:51:53,240
- Will you buy it?
- Yes.

1293
01:51:54,560 --> 01:51:57,313
- And will you read it?
- Yes.

1294
01:51:59,720 --> 01:52:01,756
Then I'll write it.

1295
01:52:27,200 --> 01:52:28,519
Is it here?

1296
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:32,317
The airstrip was over there.

1297
01:52:35,280 --> 01:52:37,669
They came this way...

1298
01:52:38,120 --> 01:52:40,714
and circled over the whales.

1299
01:52:44,240 --> 01:52:46,037
<i>We stayed over there.</i>

1300
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:24,839
Whales!

1301
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:25,629
Lola!

1302
01:54:29,560 --> 01:54:31,118
Give me your hand.

1303
01:54:31,320 --> 01:54:33,038
Give me your hand!

1304
01:54:36,640 --> 01:54:38,312
Gringo! Level the plane!

1305
01:54:41,080 --> 01:54:42,672
Gringo!

1306
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:45,189
Level it, God damn it!
Lola!

1307
01:54:45,680 --> 01:54:49,434
Take a photo of me!
Take a photo of me!

1308
01:55:33,880 --> 01:55:36,269
<i>And then the plane
went on with its journey.</i>

1309
01:55:37,640 --> 01:55:38,834
<i>And the Gringo...</i>

1310
01:55:40,720 --> 01:55:42,119
never came back.

1311
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:48,273
- Can you still see them?
- Yes...

1312
01:55:52,760 --> 01:55:55,513
They're making circles
above the whales.

1313
01:56:02,160 --> 01:56:04,720
After some time Matilde
started telling me...

1314
01:56:06,120 --> 01:56:08,270
that I'd made all this up.

1315
01:56:12,040 --> 01:56:14,793
And that if I ever told Suarez...

1316
01:56:17,160 --> 01:56:19,913
She'd say I'm a liar.

1317
01:56:29,800 --> 01:56:30,994
And Suarez...

1318
01:56:33,320 --> 01:56:34,878
never found out.

1319
01:58:03,040 --> 01:58:04,678
<i>I can hardly see
what I'm writing.</i>

1320
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:07,911
<i>Bullets are falling
like shooting stars.</i>

1321
01:58:08,120 --> 01:58:10,315
<i>And I make the same wishes
as I always did.</i>

1322
01:58:14,680 --> 01:58:17,513
<i>Here, at war, while I wait
for my turn to come</i>

1323
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:20,551
<i>I take pictures of death
every day.</i>

1324
01:58:21,320 --> 01:58:25,359
<i>She's playing hard to get because
she knows I'm waiting for her.</i>

1325
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:28,231
<i>Be patient.</i>

1326
01:58:29,800 --> 01:58:31,392
<i>I won't be long.</i>

1327
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:51,392
