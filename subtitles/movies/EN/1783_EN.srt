1
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:35,901
<i>It's a question I ask myself
all the time.</i>

2
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:40,895
<i>It's not easy for me
to find an answer.</i>

3
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:43,909
<i>Can destiny be changed?</i>

4
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:49,915
<i>How much can we change
things?</i>

5
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:21,947
<i>My father asked himself the
same thing.</i>

6
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:24,950
<i>But he believed
it was impossible.</i>

7
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:31,855
<i>That each one, each person...</i>

8
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:36,951
<i>...was destined to an irreversible
story and we are prisoners of it.</i>

9
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:41,956
<i>And even though you struggle,
everything stays the same.</i>

10
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,999
<i>One day he thought
he had the answer.</i>

11
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:32,017
IS THERE A WAY OUT?

12
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:39,923
Beloved ones, we are gathered
here today to pay farewell to...

13
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:50,025
Angel. Our beloved husband,
father, brother, and friend.

14
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:55,939
For whom we are going to pray
that his soul finds the path...

15
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:59,044
...to peace and divine salvation.

16
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,047
Our father who art in heaven...

17
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:08,952
...hallowed be thy name. Thy
kingdom come, thy will be done...

18
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:12,057
...on earth as it is in heaven.

19
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:16,960
Give us today our
daily bread...

20
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:22,056
...forgive our trespasses as we forgive
those who trespass against us.

21
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:29,063
Lead us not into temptation and
deliver us from evil. Amen.

22
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,820
How can it come to this?

23
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:50,987
Can you tell me how this situation
can can come about?

24
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,099
How a railroad
worker comes to this?

25
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:58,103
It was a long time.

26
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:05,099
It was 35 years. Do you
understand what I say?

27
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:11,014
Lmagine it. My father
was a railroad worker.

28
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,119
My brother was a
a railroad worker.

29
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:24,129
I was 15 when I began.

30
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:27,132
It was my only job.

31
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:41,146
<i>We are railroad workers.</i>

32
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:46,151
<i>Maybe that's not
worth anything now.</i>

33
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:51,156
<i>For us it was very important.</i>

34
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:57,151
<i>It was our source of work, but...</i>

35
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:05,159
<i>...it was also... our second home.</i>

36
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:23,177
<i>Everything was shared. Even
more so when far from home.</i>

37
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:39,193
<i>For us it was very important.
We took it very seriously.</i>

38
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:43,208
<i>That's why we often worked
under hard conditions.</i>

39
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:47,212
- It's nothing.
- Hurry!

40
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:50,112
- Come on!
- An ambulance!

41
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:51,113
Shit!

42
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,117
<i>But the rules of the game
changed now?</i>

43
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:56,221
<i>- No.
- What happened?</i>

44
00:05:57,256 --> 00:06:02,216
No, the rules of the game didn't
change. There is no more game.

45
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:08,131
It doesn't matter how we look at
it. This is clear. After a full...

46
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:12,135
study and investigative work,
where it was proved that parts...

47
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:16,139
of the northern route are
greatly deteriorated and the cost...

48
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:20,143
of repairs is greater than
the profits, the representative...

49
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:24,147
commission of the rights of the
South Railroad Company has...

50
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,148
decided the closure
of the route.

51
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:30,949
Stop it. You've already read it 7
times. We won't learn it by heart.

52
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:34,151
It's all lies. And you know that.
The route's perfect.

53
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:39,253
The train can run. It's just they are
not interested because of business.

54
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:44,167
They don't give a shit about
anything. About the towns that...

55
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,999
lose the train. They don't
give a shit about us.

56
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:50,974
Let's see. If we retire voluntarily
and accept the money they're...

57
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:54,171
offering, we have to forget
about everything. Isn't there...

58
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:57,180
...anything in between that we
can negotiate? - We have to...

59
00:06:57,316 --> 00:07:00,183
to negotiate keeping our jobs.
That's essential.

60
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,481
We must keep working.
At the same time we...

61
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:06,183
have to call the press and draw
attention. Television. Everyone.

62
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:10,193
- They have to know what's
happening here. - No, Paquito.

63
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:14,197
There's no keeping our jobs. They've
already told you they don't need you

64
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,200
They don't care about
ending up without trains.

65
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:19,201
And the chance for a
transfer?

66
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:21,203
No, that's impossible.

67
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,207
We aren't the only route
that closed. And it...

68
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:27,210
seems to me they're going
to close quite a few more.

69
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:30,213
What we have to do is
the same as they did at...

70
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:34,217
La Estrella meat packers.
They won't like that.

71
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:36,321
That way
they would understand.

72
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:41,223
What did they do
at La Estrella?

73
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,227
They threw the manager into the
meat grinder.

74
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:49,232
- They ground him up?
- No, just an arm.

75
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:53,236
Why don't we take the station?
That's what we should do.

76
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:58,241
The situation is complicated. I
honestly don't think any forceful...

77
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,242
...measure would get results.

78
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:03,246
What we have to do
is negotiate...

79
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:06,249
the best possible severance pay.
Why are we...

80
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:09,252
we going to take a station
where no trains go by?

81
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:13,256
This was decided some time ago. We
can't think it's going to get fixed.

82
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:17,260
It's like Raul says, this was
something they had pending.

83
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:22,265
Boys, let's see if we understand. We
don't work for that State anymore.

84
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,926
These guys are different.

85
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:28,268
What's wrong with you, Antonio?
Are you in favour of them?

86
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:30,272
You keep saying
that we settle.

87
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:32,274
Don't fuck with me, Gomez.

88
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:36,279
You know the Union always tries
to get the best for the workers.

89
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,280
The money is there now.

90
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:41,284
After a while, these guys
will get up and leave...

91
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,287
this goes over to the Work
Ministry, to the lawyers.

92
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,391
And who knows
when we'll get paid.

93
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,389
No, I say there is nothing to
negotiate. Nothing.

94
00:08:56,435 --> 00:09:00,394
No severance pay, transfer
or television. Nothing.

95
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:05,410
Because if there were something
to negotiate...

96
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,908
poor Angelito wouldn't have
killed himself.

97
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:13,315
- Come on, Braulio, don't talk
bullshit. - Am I? And what...

98
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:16,319
...the hell are you saying?
I'm not talking bullshit.

99
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:19,322
So I am the only one talking
nonsense? If you like them...

100
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,325
sticking a finger up your ass,
it's your thing.

101
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:25,328
As for me,
nobody touches my ass.

102
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:28,331
- Why don't you go to hell?
- Don't disrespect me.

103
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:32,335
Don't disrespect me.
Look at yourself, deadbeat.

104
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,336
- Suck mine!
- Calm down.

105
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:36,338
Stay out of this,
you fucking brat!

106
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:39,342
- Don't yell at me!
- Who's yelling at you?

107
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:40,445
Stay out!

108
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:44,449
You prick!

109
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:09,372
No, Carlitos. They are a bunch
of sons of bitches.

110
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:12,375
How long is it until my
retirement? ¿2 years? And...

111
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,479
they want me to retire now.

112
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:19,382
Don't they want me to hand them my
ass too? Besides, did you read this?

113
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:20,382
Yes, I did.

114
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,384
- Did you read it well?
- Yes.

115
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:27,390
This was written by a terrible
son of a bitch. No, this is a crime.

116
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:30,393
Signing this is signing
a deal with the devil.

117
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:34,397
At least the devil throws in
a couple of naked women.

118
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,400
It's a bunch of shit,
but there's no other way.

119
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:40,403
There aren't any balls left,
that's what happens!

120
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:44,407
Everyone protests and complains
but nobody does anything.

121
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:47,410
- Are you using this cloth?
- What cloth? - This one.

122
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:51,414
- The covers? - Yes.
- No, I left them there just in case.

123
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,417
- I'm going to take a few.
- Take the ones you want.

124
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:58,421
I don't think they will ever be
used again. We can't sign!

125
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:00,422
That's the thing!

126
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,427
If they sign, within two years
you will be able to tell me...

127
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:06,428
what happened.
I'm not signing.

128
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:11,525
I know it's hard. But at some
fucking time we have to say no!

129
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:19,544
Shit!

130
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:26,449
Tute, listen to me. That friend
of yours from Constitución.

131
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:28,450
- Who?
- The one...

132
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:32,455
Careful, leave it. That's fine.
The one beaten by his wife.

133
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:34,456
- That's fine.
- Vargas.

134
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:38,461
- That one. Ask him to get you
into Vias del Sur. - No.

135
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:42,465
Antonio said that with the closure
of the route, there are no transfers.

136
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:45,570
Well, Antonio says a lot of
stupid things.

137
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:49,472
You have to move on your own.
You know that, uh?

138
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:53,476
It's more expensive. But
it's worth it because it's fresh.

139
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,580
The meat doesn't darken.

140
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:59,584
That guy is a lier.

141
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:06,489
There's no wine.
Can we use one of these bottles?

142
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,594
- No, there aren't any more.
- Are you sure?

143
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:14,497
I'm moving. I went with Carlos
to see a guy from Vias del Sur...

144
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:16,498
he said there are no
transfers.

145
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:20,503
Don't go with him. It'd be easier
to get a job for just one person.

146
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,607
Carlos knew the guy.

147
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:34,608
Tell me,
how long have I known you?

148
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:40,625
I don't know.

149
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,628
Almost 30 years.

150
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:48,633
You were a pretty guy.

151
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:59,644
Do you remember what I always
told you?

152
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,639
What? You told me
so many things.

153
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,659
What I always told you.

154
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:19,653
Yes, that you were going
to be rich.

155
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,675
It's not going to happen.

156
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,689
Is something wrong, dad?

157
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:46,691
No, nothing.

158
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:52,697
Representative of the rights of
the company.

159
00:13:55,734 --> 00:14:00,603
The closure of the route because
the workers signed a voluntary...

160
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:03,708
retirement agreement.
Bunch of sons of bitches!

161
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:07,712
Who the hell
do they think they are?

162
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:13,718
Do they think I am an idiot?

163
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:22,625
You know what I'm gonna
do with this? You don't know?

164
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:26,629
No, it's not
even good for that.

165
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:29,734
It's too rough.

166
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:37,742
Hey, you.

167
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:48,651
Sign and that's it. With that
money we can pay back my brother.

168
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:51,654
I know you'll find something.
You're very handy.

169
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,657
If we give him the money,
we'll be broke.

170
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:56,658
We have to pay it back.

171
00:14:56,795 --> 00:15:01,664
Did I say we weren't? We'll give
him part now and the other part...

172
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,769
When? If you
don't find anything?

173
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:09,774
New TV.

174
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,780
Does your head still ache?

175
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:17,782
Yes, a little.

176
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,792
When can I see you?

177
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:34,799
I will call you.

178
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,827
Don't take too long.

179
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,850
What did you do then?

180
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:29,854
We signed.
There was no choice.

181
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,754
Only the old guy
didn't sign.

182
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:37,760
They owed us two months salary. They
included that in the severance pay.

183
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:39,864
It wasn't much money.

184
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,767
Some debts were paid.
It didn't last long.

185
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:47,872
We had to start over again.

186
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:52,866
So... each of us did what he could.

187
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:03,786
- What do you know about guns?
- What I learned as a soldier.

188
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:07,790
What you learned as a soldier?
That's bullshit.

189
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:11,794
I am going to show you real
guns. This is a nice piece.

190
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:17,891
It's a. 45 colt. 11.25 calliber.
We'll talk about it later.

191
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:24,807
This is Israeli. Jerico. It carries
16 bullets. It's like having...

192
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:26,911
16 friends on your belt.

193
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:33,816
This is a Colt 38 special
revolver. 6 shots. This is a gem.

194
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:38,912
It's light, doesn't weigh a thing.
Take a look. Take it.

195
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,828
- Seems like a toy.
- Yes, but it's not a toy.

196
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:49,832
Guns are loaded by the devil
and emptied by idiots.

197
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:52,937
- Who are the idiots?
- We are.

198
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:58,932
No, not us. The idiots who stand
in front of this.

199
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:07,850
- Do you think this will work?
- How can't it work?

200
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:11,945
See Lujan tomorrow. In a few
days you'll be an expert.

201
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:15,960
The rest is easy. What?

202
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:19,964
You aren't afraid, are you?

203
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,000
Laura. Come on, it's late.

204
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:59,902
You could've woken me up.
The alarm didn't go off.

205
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,903
Didn't you heat the water?

206
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,907
There's water in the thermos.
The alarm did go off.

207
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:07,910
I overslept.
You could've woken me the same.

208
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:10,913
You got mad yesterday.
I brought you coffee in bed.

209
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:13,916
- Because it was 5 am.
- It was 5:30. When I get a job...

210
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:17,920
- I won't be here to wake you.
- We won't have to stay up until...

211
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:20,923
2 am figuring out what to do
about house, the mortgage.

212
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:24,927
Stop arguing. Dad, will you
turn on the water heater?

213
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:27,930
You can't take a bath now.
There's no time.

214
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:30,933
- I'll finish quickly, I swear.
- Hurry up. It's late.

215
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:32,036
OK.

216
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:34,936
- Can I have one?
- No.

217
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:37,940
Take your bath. We
won't get going if not.

218
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:40,044
Get going. Hurry up.

219
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:00,963
What job does Osvaldo have now?

220
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:02,066
<i>What?</i>

221
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:06,070
Osvaldo, where is he working now?

222
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:09,073
<i>In a company. In a laboratory.</i>

223
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:13,077
What is this idiot doing in a
laboratory?

224
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:19,083
<i>Dad, could you open the door?
It's Juan.</i>

225
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:27,990
Hello. How are you?
I've come to get Laura.

226
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:32,085
She's taking a bath, she overslept.
So I'd be leaving.

227
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:35,099
There's no problem. I'll wait.

228
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:46,008
Laura, this boy
is waiting for you.

229
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:50,103
<i>Juanchi, wait for me.
I'm washing my private parts.</i>

230
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:52,116
Don't worry.

231
00:20:56,154 --> 00:21:00,022
- What job does Osvaldo have at
the laboratory? - I don't know.

232
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:03,025
- Hello. - Hi.
- It must be on the card I gave you.

233
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:05,026
- Where is it?
- Which...? - Here.

234
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:09,031
It's those products that are sold
everywhere. What's their name?

235
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:12,034
- I don't know, Susan.
- Body Herbal, here it is.

236
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:15,037
I told him you'd be
there at 3:30.

237
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:18,040
- Laura, let me in the bathroom.
- Come in, mom.

238
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:21,145
- Hi, Juan. How are you?
- Hurry. - It's late. Let's go.

239
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,045
- Bye, mom.
- Wait for me.

240
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:27,151
I'll be right there.
I'll take you.

241
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:31,053
Yes?
Mom, did you ring for a car?

242
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:34,056
Yes, go on and get in.
I'll take you to school.

243
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:35,159
Okay.

244
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:43,065
- A car? Look at that.
- It's late. It only costs $3.

245
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:45,066
I'm leaving. Bye.

246
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:49,162
Dress up. I ironed the shirt
your mother gave you. Bye.

247
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,237
Yes, Poggi?

248
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:58,140
He's outside.
The one with the flowered shirt.

249
00:22:58,276 --> 00:22:59,243
Thank you.

250
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:09,151
Hello. I came recommended by
Marciani. Mingo Marciani.

251
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:11,255
Are you Poggi?

252
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,154
No.

253
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:16,158
Do you know where
I can find him?

254
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:19,161
He's outside talking
with a new guy I don't know.

255
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:23,165
Don't you know where he is or
how long he will be?

256
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:25,269
- Who?
- Poggi.

257
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:30,172
If you are looking for Poggi,
Poggi isn't in or out.

258
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:34,176
So he's not coming. Now, if you
are looking for Mr. Poggi, it's me.

259
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:37,179
I'm not inside because
I told you I was outside...

260
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:39,283
talking to a stranger,
who is you.

261
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:48,190
- Atilio. I was recommended by
Marciani. - Mingo. That's good.

262
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:51,295
I was looking for drivers
with their own car...

263
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,195
because the first
2 weeks we...

264
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:57,199
have to see how you move.
We can't give you one of ours.

265
00:23:57,335 --> 00:24:00,202
- No.
- So it's better that you have one.

266
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:04,206
After that, it's 50 %.
Half and half. Partners.

267
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:06,207
- I have a car.
- A car?

268
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:09,211
Let's see it.
If you have one to start...

269
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:13,215
you give us 20 % plus a
percentage of the expenses.

270
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:16,218
- Yes. - You keep the rest
after deducting the...

271
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:18,219
gas and the flat tires.

272
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:22,315
- And, of course, you have to be
very neat. Is that clear? - Yes.

273
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:29,230
You want to work with this?

274
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:30,334
Why?

275
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:35,339
Putty.

276
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,343
Tires.
Give me the keys.

277
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:45,247
The way it is, the commission is 25 %
To buy flowers for your funeral.

278
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:48,352
Check it out.
Bring the papers and follow me.

279
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:08,372
Hello.

280
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:12,376
Come this way, please.

281
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:16,380
- Come in.
- Thank you.

282
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:28,392
I was telling you I was
recommended by Marciani.

283
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:32,294
- Mr. Marciani.
- Yes, of course.

284
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:35,297
So, not another word.
Let me see.

285
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:38,300
- Give me that. Do you want a mint?
- No, thanks.

286
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:42,395
I eat them because I quit smoking.
Here, babe. Look this over.

287
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:47,400
- The permit.
- No, I don't have a permit.

288
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:53,315
Marciani, Marciani. Leave it. I'll
fix that for you. Take it down, babe.

289
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:54,418
License?

290
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:59,412
- Debt-free form? - No...
- Professional driver's license.

291
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:03,325
No, Marciani knows me well.
He knows how I can drive.

292
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:07,329
That's why he sent me here. If
not I wouldn't even think of it.

293
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:10,332
Relax. He knows me, too.
That's why you are here.

294
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:14,336
I'm going to help you out.
But like this it's impossible.

295
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:18,340
I'm an orderly guy.
I don't like having to hide.

296
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:20,341
Of course not. So then?

297
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:23,345
You are a working man.
You pay me with work.

298
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:28,350
Then we photocopy everything
and in 3 days I'll get it fixed.

299
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:30,351
- How much?
- How much?

300
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:34,356
If it wasn't for him,
I wouldn't take a car like that.

301
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:37,359
You take care of the mechanics
and I'll legalize...

302
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:39,463
everything.
That's 400 pesos.

303
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:41,362
400?

304
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:44,366
You pay me with a percentage.
50 and 50 until you pay back.

305
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:47,369
If you like to
work, 400 pesos...

306
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:52,465
The guys have the list of the
things you have to do to the car.

307
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:58,471
You fix it and begin.
Atilio...

308
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:02,486
- say hello to Marciani for me.
- Thank you.

309
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:07,491
- Here you have the list.
- Thank you.

310
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:14,396
- Who's Marciani? Do I know him?
- I don't know if you know him.

311
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:18,491
But I don't have the slightest
idea who Marciani is.

312
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:27,511
- Hello, my love.
- Hello, ma.

313
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:32,414
They came from the railroad to
bring some of dad's things.

314
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,518
That was there for you.

315
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:40,524
- Aren't you going to read it?
- Later.

316
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,425
<i>What else can I say...</i>

317
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:47,429
<i>except as for your
forgiveness. Forgive me, son.</i>

318
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:51,433
<i>How can I explain that I love
you infinitely if I am...</i>

319
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:55,437
<i>going to abandon you? How can I
tell you without asking for...</i>

320
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:58,440
<i>forgiveness that you are
my light, if I am blind.</i>

321
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:01,443
<i>All that I see ahead
is dark and terrible.</i>

322
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:06,448
<i>Why go on? Everyday becomes
longer and more difficult.</i>

323
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:11,453
<i>Not you or your mother deserve the
torture of having me next to you...</i>

324
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:16,458
<i>with this endless anguish and
everyday has more reasons to grow</i>

325
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:20,462
<i>and grow and turn
into such a big wall.</i>

326
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:24,466
<i>But it's OK. I won't give them
the pleasure of changing my mind.</i>

327
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:29,471
<i>Even though I have to go far from
you. I take your look with me.</i>

328
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:31,472
What is this? A love letter?

329
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:34,476
- Juan, give it to me.
- Who's the letter from?

330
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:37,479
- Tell him to give it back.
- Take it here.

331
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:39,583
- Let's see.
- Who wrote it?

332
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:44,588
- Tell him to give it back.
- He will give it to you.

333
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:51,584
- Forgive me. I didn't know.
- It's OK, he' already dead.

334
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:58,500
- Do you miss him a lot?
- Yes.

335
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:02,504
When Marcelo showed me the train
it reminded of my old man.

336
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,507
I thought he
was gonna get mad.

337
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:09,602
What an ass. I had forgotten
that he wasn't here anymore.

338
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:15,517
I remember when he used to
take us for a ride on the engine.

339
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:18,520
- Do you remember when you
drove it once? - Yes.

340
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:21,523
What a shame that the engine
isn't here anymore.

341
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:26,528
- There's nothing left. They took
everything. -No, the engine is there.

342
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:29,633
- No, it's not. - The engine
is there in the workshop.

343
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:32,636
Yes.

344
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:49,642
Hello? No, he's not here now.
Who's calling? Which Karina?

345
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:54,658
Wait. He just got here.
Wait a second, please.

346
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:58,662
- Who is it?
- Karina. I don't know.

347
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:05,658
Hello? Yes, how are you?
No, there's no problem. Tell me.

348
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:10,674
Yes, I'll be there at that hour.
Good bye.

349
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,678
- The baby?
- He's sleeping.

350
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:17,681
He had a fever the whole day.

351
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:20,581
Did you buy the medicine?

352
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:23,687
No, I was waiting for you to
bring the money.

353
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:27,589
Wasn't your father going to lend
us the money?

354
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:31,593
We can't depend on him all the
time. He's not a bank.

355
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:34,698
- What's wrong with you?
- Who is Karina?

356
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:39,703
- Caloviero's secretary.
- He has a secretary now?

357
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:43,604
- What did she want?
- Nothing.

358
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:45,709
Why did she call then?

359
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:48,609
- For a job.
- A job?

360
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:52,614
Yes, a job. I got an interview
tomorrow in a supermarket.

361
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:56,618
- Something to do with maintenance.
- Why didn't you tell me?

362
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:58,619
I just found out.
Tomorrow...

363
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:02,715
What does Caloviero have
to do with supermarkets?

364
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:10,734
Do you have 30 cents?

365
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:13,737
Where are you going?

366
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:19,641
To my dad's house to ask for
money. Then to the drugstore to

367
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:23,645
buy the medicine. At 4 o'clock
he has to have the antibiotic.

368
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:27,740
If he wakes up give him milk.
He didn't eat much today.

369
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:34,758
Bye.

370
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:05,687
You know we aren't just talking
about a product to lose weight...

371
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:09,782
but about a revolution in the
Argentine feeding system.

372
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:14,696
That's to say, the whole world.
A feeding system proposal to...

373
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:19,701
which 15 million North
Americans have said yes to.

374
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:23,705
You are saying it. You are
witnesses. The day will come...

375
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:28,801
when you give thanks to Body
Herbal for this opportunity.

376
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:37,719
Team. Family. Before you leave
I would like to share something

377
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:42,724
deeply emotional for me. This is
something very personal.

378
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:47,729
A man, a friend, a great worker
has come into the room.

379
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:52,734
He has come to us and will
surely become another...

380
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,735
member of Body Herbal.

381
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:58,831
I want to introduce Carlos
Delmar. An applause, please.

382
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:08,750
Look, we've known
each other for a long time.

383
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:11,753
Believe me,
this is a unique opportunity.

384
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:16,758
You can grow with this. The
company offers 47 products.

385
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:19,761
- How about the investment?
- They give you a name.

386
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:22,764
The best is they don't ask you
to work for them...

387
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,869
but to work for yourself.
Do you understand?

388
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:30,874
- Sincerely, I don't...
- What do you mean you don't?

389
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:34,776
To be able to work, I have to
pay $1,200?

390
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:38,780
What do you think globalization is,
Carlos? Freedom.

391
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:41,783
It's the chance for people
like us to get into the world.

392
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,878
Don't get left out.
Don't get left out.

393
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:54,887
How much is it? $1,200? You'd
have your first lot of products.

394
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,902
How long would you
take to sell it?

395
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:02,906
Do know how many
people want to lose weight?

396
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:05,909
No.

397
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:57,858
What are you doing, Gomez?

398
00:34:57,995 --> 00:34:59,860
I'm doing this.

399
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:03,865
It's the only thing I could find.
The owner is someone I know.

400
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:06,970
It's just a job
on the side for a few days.

401
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:13,966
I have to find something.
If not, I don't know what to do.

402
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:19,983
- You have a cell phone?
- No. Well, yes.

403
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:24,977
I did a paint job and they paid
me with this. 200 minutes.

404
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:27,991
It's Carmen.

405
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:34,987
The number appears here. The
only one who calls me is Carmen.

406
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:39,992
She wants me to keep coming.
Without paying her.

407
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:45,008
I can't do that.
I always paid her.

408
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:50,002
Now that I don't have
money, I can't. It's her job.

409
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:55,917
I don't have a job.
She doesn't have to lose hers.

410
00:35:56,053 --> 00:36:00,012
That's why I'm telling you,
Carlitos. I have to get one.

411
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:06,018
Do you want me to help? Is
there anything you need?

412
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:09,930
A train that works.

413
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:12,934
I'm so nervous.
I hope the dog comes.

414
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:16,938
I hope he says
he wants talk with me.

415
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:20,942
I want we go for a walk down
the avenue. Have an icecream.

416
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:22,045
Hello.

417
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:27,039
- Hello, dog, how are you?
- Fine. I was looking for you.

418
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:31,953
. I'm listening. I'm listening.
- I wanted to tell you that...

419
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:34,057
- That what?
- That I...

420
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:36,957
Say it once and for all!

421
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:38,959
I played ball with the kids.

422
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:42,065
What? Do you want me to tell
you what you are?

423
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,968
I'll tell you later. Mom just
got here and she's sure to have...

424
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:49,072
an excuse
for scolding us.

425
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:51,972
Will you give me a kiss?

426
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:54,077
He's asleep.

427
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:06,987
Did his fever go down?

428
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:09,092
I don't know.
I didn't take it.

429
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:12,994
You gave him his medicine
at 4, didn't you?

430
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:18,090
No, I forgot. What time is it?
We have to give it to him, right?

431
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:25,108
- I gave him a vapour bath.
- Let's see.

432
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:41,113
- Don't smoke here.
- I didn't think about it.

433
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:52,033
Will you stay still?
You make me nervous.

434
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:56,037
Are you sure they said to do
this? It seems stupid to me.

435
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:59,040
Yes, they said I it has to be
in perfect shape.

436
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:03,044
This seems so strange to me.
The whole hired car thing...

437
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,047
...doesn't go down well with me.

438
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:10,051
Why? I don't have to spend any
money. I can capitalize.

439
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:14,055
When I finish paying for the
license and paperwork...

440
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:16,159
I'll renew the unit.

441
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:21,153
Renew the unit. Look at that.

442
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:24,064
A wallet, "renew the unit".

443
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:27,170
Your occupation is noticeable.

444
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:35,076
- Did you talk with the doctor?
- Yes. - What did he say?

445
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:39,080
- Bathe him in cold water until his
fever goes down. - He coming?

446
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:42,083
No, I'll call him in 10 minutes.
Hand me the ice tray.

447
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:44,084
Why doesn't he come here?

448
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:48,089
He's not coming because we
don't have health coverage.

449
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:51,194
It's enough that he
attends us by phone.

450
00:38:58,235 --> 00:39:01,102
- Into the water.
- I don't want to.

451
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:03,103
Come on, you have to.

452
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,105
- No.
- Don't splash me!

453
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:08,109
- Will you give him to me?
- No, let go!

454
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:12,113
Will you give him to me?
Come with dad. He's cold.

455
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:16,117
- Slowly. Let's get into the water.
- It's cold.

456
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:21,122
Let's get in slowly.
I know it's cold.

457
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:24,125
It'll be over soon.
It's OK.

458
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:28,220
This will be good for you.
Right, my love?

459
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:35,227
It will go down. It will go down.
You'll be better soon.

460
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:41,244
It's Ok.

461
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,184
- Are you his mother?
- Yes.

462
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:27,188
- What is he taking?
- Ventoline, Teosona, and vapour.

463
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:30,191
We are going to listen
to your breathing.

464
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:32,295
Breath with your mouth open.

465
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:36,299
That's fine.
And again.

466
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:51,314
Very good.

467
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:54,317
Very good.

468
00:41:05,362 --> 00:41:08,229
- Excuse us, please.
- Doctor, please.

469
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:10,230
Wait for me.
I'll be right away.

470
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:13,234
- Can you wait outside.
- She told us to wait here.

471
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:16,237
- She'll be right out. Wait outside.
- She just told me...

472
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:19,342
Se'll be right out and will
inform you, please.

473
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:51,272
Take the temporary permit and
free-debt certificate.

474
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:53,273
- Everything fine?
- Everything.

475
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:58,279
That's better. I wanted to know
if I could talk with Poggi?

476
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:01,384
Not now. It would better at
another time.

477
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:04,284
Fine. There will be time.

478
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:07,390
Here, Laucha. On the
corner of the bar.

479
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:12,384
Here. You do this one.
That way you start right away.

480
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:14,397
Me?

481
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:16,399
Thank you.

482
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:35,316
You haven't been in this
occupation very long, right?

483
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:39,320
No, it's my first day.
How did you know?

484
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:47,329
- Do you believe in destiny?
- Yes. Not completely, but yes.

485
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:50,331
Don't you think our
destiny is predetermined...

486
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:53,334
like a road that goes around
and finally gets to where...

487
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:56,439
it has to and what has to
happen occurs?

488
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:00,340
Yes, that's true.

489
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:03,344
- And more and more.
- I don't.

490
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,447
You don't?

491
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:08,451
- I believe in free will.
- I do too.

492
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:14,355
Without will, 24 years
working on the railroad.

493
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:16,356
No, that's consistency.

494
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:20,361
Willpower and desire can do
much more than we believe.

495
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:24,365
I don't know you. If I look at
you with consistency just to...

496
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:27,368
know you, I will only see what
you want to show me.

497
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:33,374
Now, I want to know you well.
So I apply willpower. A lot.

498
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:37,378
And I see. With this energy I
throw light onto things.

499
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:41,382
It seems like a discovery,
but it isn't.

500
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:47,479
That way for me things are
clear and everything is easier.

501
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:53,394
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yes, ask away.

502
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:57,398
Besides, this is like a
confessionary.

503
00:43:57,534 --> 00:44:00,401
Do you know the way? Please
don't be offended.

504
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:04,405
Well, more or less.
If you want to show me the way.

505
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:09,501
Of course. What point would it
be for us to get lost together?

506
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:12,412
Yes.

507
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:16,417
You see? Your willpower failed
there. Willpower is useless...

508
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:20,512
if you don't know where you are
going or where you want to go.

509
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:27,428
Go ahead.
Take that little dirt road.

510
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:29,429
This way, ma'am?
You sure?

511
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:32,535
Yes,
I get out at that crossroad.

512
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:36,539
- Are you sure?
- Stop. It's here.

513
00:44:37,574 --> 00:44:38,541
How much?

514
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:44,547
- That's 11.50, ma'am.
- How much?

515
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:49,552
- Well, 11.
- It can't be. First you said 11.50.

516
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:52,452
The same, it's impossible.

517
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:56,548
But Ma'am, the kilometres
are shown here.

518
00:44:57,594 --> 00:44:59,459
Why do they
always charge $16?

519
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:01,461
I don't know, ma'am.

520
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:03,566
Here. 10...

521
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:07,468
11. I don't have 50 cents.

522
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:11,472
- I never pay with coins.
- Leave it. It's not necessary.

523
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:13,576
No, give it to me.

524
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:16,476
Give me.

525
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:18,581
Take this.
Charge me 15.

526
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:21,584
Don't worry about it, ma'am.

527
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:28,489
You are honest. Give me the
chance to return good for evil.

528
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:31,492
I don't think I have change.

529
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:34,597
Yes, I do. No.

530
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:38,601
- I'm short by 3.
- That's fine.

531
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:42,605
I told you I believe in free will.

532
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:55,607
- Yes? - I know you want to. When
you can you will give them to me.

533
00:45:56,653 --> 00:45:58,621
Can you show me the way out?

534
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:00,623
Ma'am?

535
00:46:07,664 --> 00:46:10,531
- Hands on the wheel!
- Shu up, asshole.

536
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:14,535
- Relax. - Keep still. Search
everything. Hands on the wheel.

537
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:16,536
What have you got there?

538
00:46:16,673 --> 00:46:18,538
Open your hand, asshole.

539
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:21,542
- Where do you have the money?
- Who gave you this?

540
00:46:21,678 --> 00:46:25,546
- Who gave this to you, idiot?
- The lady just paid me with that.

541
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:28,651
Damn it. That shitty old lady
screwed us again. Let's go.

542
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:43,563
We filled out all the papers.

543
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:47,659
It's an oxygen condenser for a
five year old boy.

544
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:51,572
But the cooperative can't
authorize this.

545
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:57,578
Why not? My wife lost
her job and I just lost my job.

546
00:46:57,714 --> 00:47:00,581
I don't have medical coverage.
I can't pay that.

547
00:47:00,717 --> 00:47:04,585
It says here that you weren't
fired. You renounced.

548
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:07,588
What do you mean?
They closed the route.

549
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:10,693
The train doesn't go by
anymore. I renouced?

550
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:16,597
You aren't the only person who
doesn't understand. 78 people...

551
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:19,600
were left without a job
and they don't understand.

552
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:22,603
They didn't decide to stop
working. I didn't either.

553
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:25,606
The company left us in the street.
Do you know why?

554
00:47:25,742 --> 00:47:27,710
Do you know why?
You don't?

555
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:33,614
We don't know either.
You are telling me I renounced?

556
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,719
But you signed for voluntary
retirement.

557
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:38,618
Shit!

558
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:40,723
I'll send it right away.

559
00:47:41,758 --> 00:47:43,623
- Hello.
- Hello. How did it go?

560
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,627
- More or less. I got a flat.
- You got a flat?

561
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:51,632
For a tire you are too slow. For a
passenger, too fast.

562
00:47:51,768 --> 00:47:54,635
Forget him. Quite a few
trips for the first day.

563
00:47:54,771 --> 00:47:57,638
Go render to Poggi.
He's about to leave.

564
00:47:57,774 --> 00:48:01,733
Come on, Paco. You have a trip.
367 Lavalle Street. Go on.

565
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:05,748
- So you had a flat?
- Yes. That's bad luck.

566
00:48:06,783 --> 00:48:07,750
Let me see.

567
00:48:08,785 --> 00:48:12,653
$62. What was our agreement?
Fifty-fifty, right?

568
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:14,654
- Yes.
- Keep this to fix...

569
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:16,759
...the flat
and have a spare tire.

570
00:48:17,794 --> 00:48:21,753
These $12 are mine. The small
change doesn't count.

571
00:48:29,806 --> 00:48:31,774
Juanito, how much is it?

572
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:35,778
$4, like always.
We haven't raised prices.

573
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:48,688
Do you have change for 50?

574
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:50,690
No, I don't.

575
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:55,787
Hang on, don't worry. I'll send
the girl. Sandra? Sandra?

576
00:48:56,833 --> 00:49:00,701
Alberto always has change.
He collects payments, people...

577
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:02,805
...pay him with change.
- Sure.

578
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,809
Go to Alberto's and get change.
Ask this man.

579
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:17,718
Now he has a machine to check
the bills and sounds an alarm...

580
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:19,719
if they are false.

581
00:49:19,856 --> 00:49:22,825
The other day they stuck him
with a fake bill of 100.

582
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:30,833
You OK?

583
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:34,837
Yes, it's nothing. I'm tired.

584
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:37,737
My stomack's a little upset.

585
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:41,833
- You need a toilette? The
girl's coming. - No, I'm fine.

586
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:01,864
Atilio, where are you going?

587
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:10,873
Hello?

588
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:17,778
Karina. How are you?
I know I had to go for the practice.

589
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:22,874
That's why I'm calling. Something
came up. I won't be able to go.

590
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,889
Oh, yes? I didn't know that.

591
00:50:27,924 --> 00:50:33,885
Karina, I'm out of credit and I
don't have any coins. Hello?

592
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:50,811
<i>Thank you for calling, Pitu.
And now the weather.</i>

593
00:50:50,947 --> 00:50:53,814
<i>We're going to have storms.
Get ready for the cold...</i>

594
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:58,910
<i>and rain and for staying at home.
And now, a musical...</i>

595
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:56,979
<i>I don't know why I found you. +</i>

596
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:38,919
<i>I suppose everything we do has
to cause movement elsewhere.</i>

597
00:52:39,055 --> 00:52:42,024
<i>Like a chain reaction.</i>

598
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:45,925
<i>May dad once told me if you
throw a stone into the water...</i>

599
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:48,929
<i>it's waves change the whole lake.</i>

600
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:52,933
<i>Sometimes I'd like to have
that stone's power and that my</i>

601
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:54,934
<i>acts change my surroundings.</i>

602
00:52:55,071 --> 00:53:00,031
<i>Maybe it can be.
Maybe you just have to try to.</i>

603
00:53:12,088 --> 00:53:14,955
<i>Didn't the train close down
because the tracks...</i>

604
00:53:15,091 --> 00:53:18,959
<i>weren't in good shape
and some parts were dangerous?</i>

605
00:53:19,095 --> 00:53:22,963
<i>No, it closed down because it
wasn't profitable. It's that simple.</i>

606
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:27,058
But they couldn't say it, so they
invented that about the tracks.

607
00:53:28,104 --> 00:53:31,073
The route is in perfect shape.

608
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:25,176
What a nice super locomotive
that Uncle fixed for you.

609
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:29,191
- Yes. - It's nice,
isn't it? I like it a lot

610
00:55:32,228 --> 00:55:35,095
- Do you feel better today?
- Yes.

611
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:36,198
Really?

612
00:55:39,235 --> 00:55:45,196
I'm going now but you stay with
your Mom. I'll come tomorrow.

613
00:55:46,242 --> 00:55:49,211
Give me a kiss.
Give me a kiss.

614
00:55:53,249 --> 00:55:55,217
Let's tuck you up.

615
00:55:56,252 --> 00:55:57,219
My baby.

616
00:55:58,254 --> 00:55:59,221
Bye, champ.

617
00:56:02,258 --> 00:56:05,227
I'll be right back.
I'll say bye to Dad.

618
00:56:19,275 --> 00:56:23,143
You know what I think?
Everything is our fault.

619
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:25,247
It's our fault?

620
00:56:26,282 --> 00:56:30,150
I broke my ass for 9 years in a
company so they could fire me...

621
00:56:30,286 --> 00:56:34,154
and it's my fault? I just missed
work one time in 9 years.

622
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:36,258
When Mati was born.
Once.

623
00:56:37,293 --> 00:56:41,161
They fired me anyway. Now it
turns out it wasn't them.

624
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:43,265
It's the same.

625
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:47,167
We saw this coming
and didn't do anything.

626
00:56:47,303 --> 00:56:51,262
- What the hell could we do?
- I don't know. Something.

627
00:56:52,308 --> 00:56:57,268
All the birds shit on on us.
We must be doing something wrong.

628
00:56:58,314 --> 00:57:03,274
What we did wrong was work.
Here the guy who works is a loser.

629
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:09,189
Everyone tells the same,
"it'll pas, it'll pass".

630
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:14,285
I don't know when
the hell it will. I don't know.

631
00:57:29,345 --> 00:57:30,312
Atilio?

632
00:57:32,348 --> 00:57:35,317
Atilio? Is that you?

633
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:39,321
What the hell
has he dropped?

634
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:44,326
Atilio?

635
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:48,330
Don't be an ass.

636
00:57:58,374 --> 00:58:05,246
Workshop. Babe! How are you?
How strange of you to call now.

637
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:09,340
Because there is no money.
It ran out.

638
00:58:10,386 --> 00:58:13,253
How are you?
Fine, I'm fine.

639
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:19,350
Yes, I went. Yes... No. I'm fine.
Yes, I take care of myself.

640
00:58:20,396 --> 00:58:23,263
The doctors don't know
anything, babe.

641
00:58:23,399 --> 00:58:28,359
Your boyfriend?
Did he get a job?

642
00:58:29,405 --> 00:58:30,372
No?

643
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:41,372
About time he started, isn't it?
He's going to be 32 years old.

644
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:46,286
I know things are screwed up,
babe. Listen to me.

645
00:58:46,422 --> 00:58:52,383
I am 68 and still working like a
dog every God given day.

646
00:58:57,433 --> 00:59:02,302
No, they didn't fire me. I didn't
sign shit. Do you understand?

647
00:59:02,438 --> 00:59:06,397
I'm here at the foot of the
cannon. Firm and solid.

648
00:59:07,443 --> 00:59:10,412
Bye. Kisses.
Hope all goes well.

649
00:59:11,447 --> 00:59:14,416
Hello? Take care of yourself.

650
00:59:19,455 --> 00:59:25,416
They want to convince me?
He should move his heavy ass.

651
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:33,424
He can't? I wonder if you
could say that before.

652
00:59:37,473 --> 00:59:38,440
Cheers.

653
00:59:41,477 --> 00:59:44,344
- What are you doing?
- How was it? I'm lost.

654
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,449
If you'd just concentrate
a little. Take a look.

655
00:59:48,484 --> 00:59:53,353
This in. Hammer in.
That will make it easier.

656
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:59,450
It only enters one way. There is
only one position. You see?

657
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:03,465
You slide it overt there.

658
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,367
You close it.
It returns to it's place.

659
01:00:07,503 --> 01:00:10,472
Ready. Bullet clip.

660
01:00:11,507 --> 01:00:14,476
- A piece of cake.
It's not to difficult.

661
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:18,378
Pay more attention
or we won't get anywhere.

662
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:22,473
- You're right. You're right.
- Leave your problems outside.

663
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:28,479
You say yes, but it's no. What's
wrong? What are you thinking?

664
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:33,393
- More of the same.
- What more of the same?

665
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:35,394
- Money.
- Yes.

666
01:00:35,531 --> 01:00:38,398
Matias needs an oxygen
condenser. A piece of...

667
01:00:38,534 --> 01:00:42,402
equipment that purifies the air.
Health care doesn't cover it.

668
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:44,506
This Matias turned out weak.

669
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:47,509
Take this.

670
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:50,409
200 bucks.
Let's see if we...

671
01:00:50,546 --> 01:00:53,413
...can let up a little.
You concentrate a little more.

672
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:55,517
This isn't a joke matter.

673
01:00:57,553 --> 01:00:58,520
Well...

674
01:00:59,555 --> 01:01:02,524
Load the 38 and come here.

675
01:01:29,585 --> 01:01:32,554
Why don't you try with your
eyes open?

676
01:01:38,594 --> 01:01:42,462
God, this cough. I'm going to
need that... What's it called?

677
01:01:42,598 --> 01:01:45,465
- Oxygen condenser.
- Oxygen condenser.

678
01:01:45,601 --> 01:01:47,466
If you keep smoking
like that.

679
01:01:47,603 --> 01:01:50,572
- Is it expensive?
- 1,200 pesos.

680
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:53,472
- 1,200 bucks?
Used.

681
01:01:53,609 --> 01:01:55,474
I better stop smoking.

682
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:59,570
Do you know how many bitches
I could pay with 1,200 bucks?

683
01:02:02,618 --> 01:02:07,578
Here. Take it. I'm giving it
to you. It's yours.

684
01:02:08,624 --> 01:02:12,583
It's for my personal use. I'll
bring you the papers tomorrow.

685
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:15,597
Take it.

686
01:02:16,632 --> 01:02:17,599
What for?

687
01:02:18,634 --> 01:02:20,602
It's good
to have a 2nd gun.

688
01:02:22,638 --> 01:02:25,607
What's wrong? Are you afraid?

689
01:02:26,642 --> 01:02:30,601
Fear has killed more people
than emphysema has.

690
01:03:12,688 --> 01:03:14,553
Come on, come here.

691
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:18,649
Where are you?
Atilio?

692
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:31,662
Where the hell did you go?
Atilio?

693
01:03:35,711 --> 01:03:37,679
You old asshole.

694
01:03:39,715 --> 01:03:40,682
Hey.

695
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:46,688
Atilio.

696
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:55,697
Ati.

697
01:04:01,737 --> 01:04:04,706
Atilio. Son of a bitch.

698
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:36,738
What are you doing there?

699
01:04:41,777 --> 01:04:46,737
<i>I know that my dream is possible.
I know I couldn't reach it.</i>

700
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:50,650
<i>I know you are clean
and strong. You have...</i>

701
01:04:50,786 --> 01:04:54,654
<i>inherited part of that dream
to adapt it to your story...</i>

702
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:58,658
<i>that will be different
from mine. I love you, son.</i>

703
01:04:58,794 --> 01:05:02,662
<i>But I can't go on anymore.
If I want a world without hate,</i>

704
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:08,668
<i>I am going to free it of the
hate I feel for it. Why go on?</i>

705
01:05:08,804 --> 01:05:12,763
<i>I only need you to understand
and forgive me.</i>

706
01:05:13,809 --> 01:05:19,770
<i>Until always. Your friend, Papa.</i>

707
01:05:21,817 --> 01:05:23,785
Why did I come here?

708
01:05:26,822 --> 01:05:29,791
Why did your
grandfather come here?

709
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:33,795
The train brought us.

710
01:05:36,832 --> 01:05:39,699
This whole
town was born with the train.

711
01:05:39,835 --> 01:05:44,704
Then the workshops. Do you
know how many worked here?

712
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:47,707
People who believed in what
they were doing.

713
01:05:47,843 --> 01:05:52,803
Who believed in working. They
believed in the country.

714
01:05:56,852 --> 01:05:58,820
Take a look now.

715
01:05:59,855 --> 01:06:01,823
The train is gone.

716
01:06:03,859 --> 01:06:07,727
The country, let's face it,
is gone too.

717
01:06:07,863 --> 01:06:12,732
Nobody cares about anything.
Nobody gives a damn.

718
01:06:12,868 --> 01:06:17,737
It's sad but that's the way it is.
What draws my attention is that...

719
01:06:17,873 --> 01:06:23,743
no one reacts. No one says stop.
Enough. It's over.

720
01:06:23,879 --> 01:06:27,838
Why the hell are we always the
ones who have to slacken?

721
01:06:30,886 --> 01:06:34,754
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- Yes, of course.

722
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:36,755
I also ask myself why...

723
01:06:36,892 --> 01:06:39,861
my old man gave up instead
of staying here to fight.

724
01:06:40,896 --> 01:06:42,864
Was he a coward?

725
01:06:59,915 --> 01:07:00,882
Hello.

726
01:07:25,941 --> 01:07:26,908
Hello.

727
01:07:29,945 --> 01:07:30,912
Laura?

728
01:07:38,954 --> 01:07:39,921
Carlos?

729
01:07:45,961 --> 01:07:47,929
What are you doing?

730
01:07:48,964 --> 01:07:50,829
What is this?

731
01:07:50,966 --> 01:07:53,935
- Did you put this on the door?
- Yes, it was me.

732
01:07:55,971 --> 01:07:58,838
How could you put something
like this on the door?

733
01:07:58,974 --> 01:08:00,942
With scotch tape.

734
01:08:02,978 --> 01:08:05,947
- I know.
- Lf you know, why do you ask?

735
01:08:08,984 --> 01:08:10,849
It's the foreclosure.

736
01:08:10,986 --> 01:08:14,945
Are you going to put this wig away
or should throw it away?

737
01:08:37,012 --> 01:08:40,971
Why are you cleaning?
Is there a rat?

738
01:08:42,017 --> 01:08:43,985
Yes,
there's a rat that cleans.

739
01:09:03,038 --> 01:09:07,998
There is a rat that hides things.
Wasn't it there wasn't anymore?

740
01:09:09,044 --> 01:09:11,911
- Did you want to drink it alone?
- Give it to me.

741
01:09:12,047 --> 01:09:15,016
- It's going to fall and break.
- No, it's not.

742
01:09:21,056 --> 01:09:23,024
What's wrong?

743
01:09:27,062 --> 01:09:29,030
Hug me.

744
01:09:32,067 --> 01:09:38,028
Let's stay together a little while
and not think of anything.

745
01:09:39,074 --> 01:09:41,042
Just for awhile.

746
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:45,046
Please.

747
01:10:50,145 --> 01:10:52,113
What's wrong?

748
01:10:53,148 --> 01:10:56,015
I can't. I can't.

749
01:10:56,151 --> 01:10:58,119
I'm sorry, I can't.

750
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:04,125
Be calm. Relax.

751
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:08,027
- It will go by.
- Forgive me Susana.

752
01:11:08,163 --> 01:11:12,031
It's OK, honey.
Everything's fine.

753
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:15,136
Hug me like this, tightly.

754
01:11:47,202 --> 01:11:49,170
What are you doing?

755
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:53,174
It's quarter to seven.

756
01:11:56,211 --> 01:11:59,180
How can you do this now?

757
01:12:21,236 --> 01:12:22,203
Lisa?

758
01:12:40,255 --> 01:12:43,816
Lisa. Lisa. Lisa. The boy?

759
01:12:43,926 --> 01:12:47,123
- Last night, what time did you...?
- Who stayed with him?

760
01:12:47,262 --> 01:12:50,231
He was with my mother.
What time did you come back?

761
01:12:57,272 --> 01:12:59,240
Are you going
to tell me?

762
01:13:00,275 --> 01:13:04,143
Caloviero invited me to dinner.
We were talking and...

763
01:13:04,279 --> 01:13:07,248
About what? What were you
talking with him about?

764
01:13:08,283 --> 01:13:10,251
He's going to get me a job.

765
01:13:16,291 --> 01:13:18,156
What are you into?

766
01:13:18,293 --> 01:13:20,261
Please, tell me.

767
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:02,201
- Good morning. Poggi?
- He's not here.

768
01:14:02,337 --> 01:14:05,204
- Where can I find Poggi?
- Who? - Poggi.

769
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:06,307
Mr. Poggi is...

770
01:14:07,342 --> 01:14:10,311
Check it out. Bring the
papers and follow me.

771
01:14:11,346 --> 01:14:14,315
Let's see if this one
passes the inspection. Open it.

772
01:14:16,351 --> 01:14:17,318
Atilio?

773
01:14:18,353 --> 01:14:20,218
- Are you deaf?
- What's up?

774
01:14:20,355 --> 01:14:25,224
You must go to Todo Home to pick up
a TV set and take it to this address

775
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:26,327
Shit.

776
01:14:27,362 --> 01:14:29,330
I'm the freight mover again?

777
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:41,342
Dad?

778
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:48,247
- What's with all this?
- What do you want?

779
01:14:48,383 --> 01:14:52,251
Where's the letter from the bank,
the one nailed to the door?

780
01:14:52,387 --> 01:14:55,356
- Your mother had it.
- She doesn't remember.

781
01:14:56,391 --> 01:14:58,359
Mama, he says you had it.

782
01:14:59,394 --> 01:15:02,261
Ask Mom to call the workshop and
ask Braulio if he

783
01:15:02,397 --> 01:15:05,366
...still has the solder machine?
- Yes.

784
01:15:06,401 --> 01:15:09,268
Mom, can you call the
workshop and ask Braulio.

785
01:15:09,404 --> 01:15:11,372
If he has the
solder machine?

786
01:15:51,446 --> 01:15:52,413
<i>Hello?</i>

787
01:15:53,448 --> 01:15:56,417
It's me. Hired car.
Freight mover. Todo Home.

788
01:15:58,453 --> 01:15:59,420
<i>Come in.</i>

789
01:16:12,467 --> 01:16:13,434
The TV set.

790
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:18,439
How are you? It
fell on you to bring it?

791
01:16:19,474 --> 01:16:20,441
Antonio!

792
01:16:22,477 --> 01:16:25,344
- This is where you live?
- What's up, Atilio?

793
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:31,350
- So, you are with Todo Home?
- Not Todo Home. I hire the car.

794
01:16:31,486 --> 01:16:34,455
Since I had a car, you see.
Besides, Todo Home...

795
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:39,358
Yes, they are more particular.
That's the way it is now.

796
01:16:39,494 --> 01:16:42,463
- It's not fair.
- No, they aren't particular.

797
01:16:43,498 --> 01:16:46,365
They are lucky you went in.
Nobody goes in there.

798
01:16:46,501 --> 01:16:48,469
That don't sell a thing to
anyone.

799
01:16:50,505 --> 01:16:54,464
- No even a... - It's a TV set.
- Yes, yes. Here?

800
01:16:56,511 --> 01:16:57,478
Here?

801
01:16:58,513 --> 01:17:01,482
- That's 20 inches.
- And this one?

802
01:17:02,517 --> 01:17:04,485
29 inches.

803
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,488
The inches are heavy,
right?

804
01:17:11,526 --> 01:17:13,494
Not bad, Antonio.

805
01:17:14,529 --> 01:17:18,397
The truth is if you didn't
imagine I'd come carrying...

806
01:17:18,533 --> 01:17:22,401
your TV set like a mule, much less
would I imagine this were your home.

807
01:17:22,537 --> 01:17:27,497
My what? No, Atilio. I'm a
slave. I never told you?

808
01:17:28,543 --> 01:17:31,410
- What?
- I never tell anyone out of shame.

809
01:17:31,546 --> 01:17:35,414
Everything you see here,
the house, the TV set...

810
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:38,519
...even this robe.
Everything is Zulma's.

811
01:17:39,554 --> 01:17:42,421
- Who's?
- My wife Zulma.

812
01:17:42,557 --> 01:17:45,526
She made all of this
with the hair shop.

813
01:17:48,563 --> 01:17:52,522
Highlighting came into fashion,
so we haven't died of hunger.

814
01:17:53,568 --> 01:17:56,435
Do me a favour, Atilio.
Bring it inside, will you?

815
01:17:56,571 --> 01:17:57,538
Yes.

816
01:17:58,573 --> 01:18:00,541
And take it.

817
01:18:01,576 --> 01:18:05,535
The small one. The TV set.
Take it. It's for you.

818
01:18:06,581 --> 01:18:09,448
- A gift for a friend.
- No.

819
01:18:09,584 --> 01:18:11,449
- Take it.
- I can't accept that.

820
01:18:11,586 --> 01:18:14,555
Come on. Take it.

821
01:18:18,593 --> 01:18:23,462
- Antonio, workmate.
- Go on. Take it with you.

822
01:18:23,598 --> 01:18:24,565
Thank you.

823
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,568
- Bye, Atilio.
- Bye.

824
01:18:56,631 --> 01:18:58,599
It's OK, I'll helpe you.

825
01:19:57,692 --> 01:19:59,557
- Hey, deaf guy. Hey.
- What?

826
01:19:59,694 --> 01:20:01,662
Can you turn the music down?

827
01:20:04,699 --> 01:20:07,668
Can you turn it down more?
More.

828
01:20:09,704 --> 01:20:10,671
Thank you.

829
01:20:11,706 --> 01:20:17,667
We're going a little out of the way.
We have to go get the doctor.

830
01:20:18,713 --> 01:20:21,682
- Turn here.
- Fine.

831
01:20:41,736 --> 01:20:45,604
We're going to go back down
the avenue in the same way.

832
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:49,699
- Stop just before the corner of
the supermarket. Got it? - Yes.

833
01:21:02,757 --> 01:21:05,726
Gomez,
what are you doing here?

834
01:21:06,761 --> 01:21:09,730
Hello, Atilio. How are you?

835
01:21:10,765 --> 01:21:12,733
So you're a doctor now?

836
01:21:13,768 --> 01:21:18,637
No, it's their joke.
You are a hired driver?

837
01:21:18,773 --> 01:21:21,742
- Yes.
- So you are broke?

838
01:21:24,779 --> 01:21:30,740
I told them. I told them.
Now it's not important.

839
01:21:31,786 --> 01:21:36,655
Atilio, do us a favour. Go a little
bit faster. We are in a hurry.

840
01:21:36,791 --> 01:21:39,760
- Fine. It was for the TV set.
- What TV set?

841
01:21:40,795 --> 01:21:42,763
I've got it in the trunk.

842
01:21:43,798 --> 01:21:47,666
You won't guess
who gave it to me.

843
01:21:47,802 --> 01:21:51,670
He bought a giant screen and
gave me the one he had.

844
01:21:51,806 --> 01:21:56,675
- Antonio. Antonio gave it to you.
- Yes.

845
01:21:56,811 --> 01:22:00,770
What other son of a bitch that
we knew could give it to you?

846
01:22:02,817 --> 01:22:05,684
- You found out about his wife?
- What wife?

847
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:07,685
The one with the hair shop.

848
01:22:07,822 --> 01:22:11,690
Don't tell me he made you
believe he got that fortune and...

849
01:22:11,826 --> 01:22:15,785
has that house with that slut
working as a hairdresser?

850
01:22:16,831 --> 01:22:21,325
- And manicure. - That bitch could've
made some money in her life...

851
01:22:21,436 --> 01:22:23,700
sleeping with
someone influential...

852
01:22:23,838 --> 01:22:28,707
with some politician, even with
some railroad boss. Understand?

853
01:22:28,843 --> 01:22:33,803
He screwed you, Atilio.
He screwed you, understand?

854
01:22:35,850 --> 01:22:42,722
I always said that worm was
going to betray us. Atilio.

855
01:22:42,857 --> 01:22:45,826
No. I can't believe you.

856
01:22:46,861 --> 01:22:48,829
You don't want to believe me.

857
01:22:49,864 --> 01:22:54,733
- Many of us didn't listen to you.
- To die alone o in a heap...

858
01:22:54,869 --> 01:22:56,734
what's the difference?

859
01:22:56,871 --> 01:23:00,830
I know you weren't only idiot
who didn't believe me.

860
01:23:01,876 --> 01:23:04,845
I said that worm was going to
betray us.

861
01:23:07,882 --> 01:23:12,842
That son of a bitch. He always
worked as an informer, a traitor,

862
01:23:13,888 --> 01:23:17,847
coward, inside man, miserable.

863
01:23:20,895 --> 01:23:23,864
That's it. No way to fix it.

864
01:23:24,899 --> 01:23:26,867
Do me a favour.
Over there...

865
01:23:27,902 --> 01:23:29,870
Cross the corner and stop.

866
01:23:40,915 --> 01:23:43,884
Susana, did you call the
workshop?

867
01:23:44,919 --> 01:23:45,783
Hey, Susana?

868
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:48,787
I'm looking for the paper
you lost. It must be at the...

869
01:23:48,923 --> 01:23:50,788
- bank tomorrow.
- I lost it?

870
01:23:50,925 --> 01:23:53,894
I left it stuck to the door.
Who took it off?

871
01:23:58,933 --> 01:24:00,798
How much is it?

872
01:24:00,935 --> 01:24:03,802
Don't worry about it.
It was worth it.

873
01:24:03,938 --> 01:24:05,803
Charge me, please.

874
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:07,908
The dead don't charge.

875
01:24:11,946 --> 01:24:13,914
Bye, Atilio.

876
01:24:24,959 --> 01:24:26,824
This is a robbery!
Get down!

877
01:24:26,961 --> 01:24:29,828
To the floor. Nothing's gonna
happen. You too, ma'am.

878
01:24:29,964 --> 01:24:30,931
Now!

879
01:24:37,972 --> 01:24:39,940
- Come on, hurry up!
- The money!

880
01:24:40,975 --> 01:24:42,943
You too! On the floor!

881
01:24:43,978 --> 01:24:45,946
What are you looking at?

882
01:24:47,982 --> 01:24:49,950
Hurry up! Hurry up!

883
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:59,858
Come out, Antonio you bastard!
I brought the TV back. I won't need

884
01:24:59,994 --> 01:25:03,862
need it because I don't have
enough to pay for electricity.

885
01:25:03,998 --> 01:25:06,967
It's your fault
you son of a bitch. Come out!

886
01:25:10,004 --> 01:25:13,872
- Stop it! What are you doing?
- Come out, coward!

887
01:25:14,008 --> 01:25:16,875
Stop it! What's wrong with you?
Are you crazy?

888
01:25:17,011 --> 01:25:19,878
What did you do? How can you
live with that? Traitor.

889
01:25:20,014 --> 01:25:22,881
Who where you talking with?
With Grimaldi, right?

890
01:25:23,017 --> 01:25:25,884
Do you believe that wretch?
He's envious.

891
01:25:26,020 --> 01:25:28,887
- It was him, uh?
- It was me when I opened my eyes.

892
01:25:29,023 --> 01:25:30,888
No, it was Grimaldi.

893
01:25:31,025 --> 01:25:32,890
Come on, you shit!
Open up!

894
01:25:33,027 --> 01:25:36,895
I won't open for an animal
like you who can't reason.

895
01:25:37,031 --> 01:25:40,592
I didn't do anything. All of this
would've happened the same.

896
01:25:40,702 --> 01:25:42,897
You and I are nothing.
What's to it...

897
01:25:43,037 --> 01:25:45,904
- if some bucks stuck to a few
of us? - Open up and I'll...

898
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:47,905
- explain it to you.
- No, I won't.

899
01:25:48,042 --> 01:25:51,011
- I'll throw you out like a dog.
- Yeah? Take this.

900
01:25:53,047 --> 01:25:55,015
Stop!
What are you doing?

901
01:25:58,052 --> 01:26:01,021
What am I doing? You'll see.

902
01:26:37,091 --> 01:26:41,050
Stop it! What're you doing?
Calm down. Stop it once and for all.

903
01:26:42,096 --> 01:26:44,064
Take it!
Stick it up your ass!

904
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:48,967
Son of a bitch.
We'll see each other again.

905
01:26:49,103 --> 01:26:50,968
You sold us out, rustler.

906
01:26:51,105 --> 01:26:54,973
You're a piece of shit. Bad
workmate. It's because of shit...

907
01:26:55,109 --> 01:26:59,068
like you we are like this.
You'll remember. We'll get you.

908
01:27:05,119 --> 01:27:07,986
Susana, I asked you 4 times
to call the workshop.

909
01:27:08,122 --> 01:27:11,091
If I don't have the soldering
machine I won't ever finish.

910
01:28:39,213 --> 01:28:40,180
Braulio?

911
01:28:45,219 --> 01:28:46,186
Braulio?

912
01:29:03,237 --> 01:29:06,206
Son of a bitch.
Braulio?

913
01:29:08,242 --> 01:29:09,209
Braulio?

914
01:29:12,246 --> 01:29:14,214
The phone, Braulio.

915
01:29:27,261 --> 01:29:29,229
Why doesn't
this idiot answer?

916
01:29:30,264 --> 01:29:32,232
Hello? Hello?

917
01:29:53,287 --> 01:29:54,254
Braulio!

918
01:30:04,298 --> 01:30:06,266
No, don't do this to me.

919
01:30:08,302 --> 01:30:10,270
Not you, my friend.

920
01:30:16,310 --> 01:30:19,279
Do you know you were right?

921
01:30:21,315 --> 01:30:23,283
We shouldn've signed.

922
01:30:25,319 --> 01:30:27,287
They screwed us, Braulio.

923
01:30:32,326 --> 01:30:34,294
They screwed us.

924
01:30:47,341 --> 01:30:49,309
I want to go to the bathroom.

925
01:30:52,346 --> 01:30:56,214
- How long until you finish?
- I asked you 5 times to call...

926
01:30:56,350 --> 01:31:00,218
the workshop. Did you do it?
You didn't. I don't have the tool.

927
01:31:00,354 --> 01:31:03,221
- It's not my fault.
- And I don't have my tool!

928
01:31:03,357 --> 01:31:06,224
- I need the bathroom.
- Use the neighbour's.

929
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:09,227
What neighbour? You've been
in here since 7 am...

930
01:31:09,363 --> 01:31:14,232
It's 8 pm. You pretend to be a
plumber without knowing about pipes!

931
01:31:14,368 --> 01:31:18,236
- Call a plumber and pay it yourself.
- With what money?

932
01:31:18,372 --> 01:31:21,239
If you had at least accepted
Osvaldo's offer?

933
01:31:21,375 --> 01:31:24,242
What do you want me to accept?
He's selling the car!

934
01:31:24,378 --> 01:31:28,246
He's selling the car because
he's buying a SUV!

935
01:31:28,382 --> 01:31:32,250
Why don't you and Osvaldo and
this shitty pipe go to hell!

936
01:31:32,386 --> 01:31:34,354
Damn son of a bitch!

937
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:37,254
Be careful!

938
01:31:37,391 --> 01:31:40,258
- Hurry up!
- Take this! Laura!

939
01:31:40,394 --> 01:31:42,259
- Give it to me.
- Hold this here.

940
01:31:42,396 --> 01:31:45,263
- I'll bring something.
- No, hold this here.

941
01:31:45,399 --> 01:31:47,264
Help your mother.

942
01:31:47,401 --> 01:31:49,266
Grab this.
Put a towel.

943
01:31:49,403 --> 01:31:52,270
Give me a towel.
Calm down.

944
01:31:52,406 --> 01:31:56,365
- What happened? - I don't know.
This shitty pipe broke. Come here!

945
01:32:00,414 --> 01:32:04,282
<i>- Carlos! - I'll be right there.
- Help me, I can't do it!</i>

946
01:32:04,418 --> 01:32:06,283
Look for a pail, Laura.

947
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:10,288
<i>The police have begun to
identify some of the assailants.</i>

948
01:32:10,424 --> 01:32:16,294
<i>One of them is Luis Gomez.
A 56 year old man.</i>

949
01:32:16,430 --> 01:32:22,300
<i>The second man is 43 year old
Mariano Andres Vitalli.</i>

950
01:32:22,436 --> 01:32:26,304
<i>Married and with two children.
We don't have too much...</i>

951
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:31,309
<i>information about the third
member of the gang.</i>

952
01:32:31,445 --> 01:32:36,314
<i>The only thing we know is he's
no more than 40 years old.</i>

953
01:32:36,450 --> 01:32:40,409
<i>Hello? Carlos, this is Atilio.</i>

954
01:32:41,455 --> 01:32:43,423
<i>I called to...</i>

955
01:32:45,459 --> 01:32:47,427
<i>Nothing
is turning out for me.</i>

956
01:32:48,462 --> 01:32:54,423
<i>I don't even know how to say it.
I'm here in the workshop...</i>

957
01:32:56,470 --> 01:33:02,431
<i>Braulio passed away. I don't know.
It seems to have been a heart attack</i>

958
01:33:03,477 --> 01:33:05,445
<i>Call me when you can.</i>

959
01:33:10,484 --> 01:33:12,349
<i>This is the situation.</i>

960
01:33:12,486 --> 01:33:17,446
<i>Trapped again by the terror
caused by delinquents.</i>

961
01:33:18,492 --> 01:33:24,362
<i>Violence is again the protagonist.
From railroad employee to criminal.</i>

962
01:33:24,498 --> 01:33:27,467
<i>Do you understand it?
I don't.</i>

963
01:33:28,502 --> 01:33:30,367
<i>Come here, dad!</i>

964
01:33:30,504 --> 01:33:33,371
<i>What are you doing?
Come here!</i>

965
01:33:33,507 --> 01:33:36,476
<i>Carlos! What's wrong?
Come here!</i>

966
01:33:43,517 --> 01:33:47,476
Will you shut up, ma'am?
Kid, see if you can calm her down.

967
01:34:50,584 --> 01:34:52,552
- I'll go.
- Fine.

968
01:34:58,592 --> 01:35:02,460
- Did you see the news? - Yes.
Gomez in a supermarket. I saw it.

969
01:35:02,596 --> 01:35:04,564
No, no.

970
01:35:07,601 --> 01:35:10,468
<i>How can a working man, a
worker transform?</i>

971
01:35:10,604 --> 01:35:14,472
<i>Transgress his history, his
culture, his education and...</i>

972
01:35:14,608 --> 01:35:18,476
<i>end up like this? With these
irrational criminal acts which</i>

973
01:35:18,612 --> 01:35:20,477
<i>were never part of his life?</i>

974
01:35:20,614 --> 01:35:24,482
<i>This is what happens when they
don't give you any way out.</i>

975
01:35:24,618 --> 01:35:27,485
You start looking for the
solution anywhere.

976
01:35:27,621 --> 01:35:29,589
People are desperate.

977
01:35:31,625 --> 01:35:33,593
When you are desperate...

978
01:35:35,629 --> 01:35:38,598
everything looks black.

979
01:35:39,633 --> 01:35:43,592
You don't see any light.
There is no light.

980
01:35:44,638 --> 01:35:47,607
That happened to us when they
closed the railroad.

981
01:35:49,643 --> 01:35:51,611
That's why it comes to this.

982
01:35:52,646 --> 01:35:55,513
That's fine. Let's agree
this is not the way.

983
01:35:55,649 --> 01:35:58,516
- There're innocent people there.
- Yes, you're right.

984
01:35:58,652 --> 01:36:00,620
What is the way?

985
01:36:01,655 --> 01:36:05,614
Tell me. What is the way?
Because I still haven't found it.

986
01:36:06,660 --> 01:36:10,528
My brother didn't find it.
Braulio didn't find it either.

987
01:36:10,664 --> 01:36:13,531
<i>Let's go to our mobile unit in
front of the supermarket.</i>

988
01:36:13,667 --> 01:36:15,532
<i>Monica,
is there anything new?</i>

989
01:36:15,669 --> 01:36:19,537
The activity here is intense and
we know the logistical work...

990
01:36:19,673 --> 01:36:23,541
is in an advanced stage.
The police have begun to...

991
01:36:23,677 --> 01:36:28,478
surround the place and we don't
know yet the course of action.

992
01:36:28,582 --> 01:36:32,018
If they'll try to enter the
supermarket by force or if they'll

993
01:36:32,119 --> 01:36:35,555
try to establish a dialogue
with the criminals to get the...

994
01:36:35,689 --> 01:36:37,657
release of the hostages.

995
01:36:55,709 --> 01:36:59,577
<i>I feel now is the time to do
something. Maybe we're capable...</i>

996
01:36:59,713 --> 01:37:02,682
<i>of changing the world
and we don't realize it.</i>

997
01:37:04,718 --> 01:37:07,687
<i>Now is the time to try it.</i>

998
01:37:27,741 --> 01:37:29,709
Guide me Braulio.

999
01:37:30,744 --> 01:37:32,712
First,
see if there's a spark.

1000
01:37:36,750 --> 01:37:39,719
Help me Braulio. I'm tired.

1001
01:37:43,757 --> 01:37:46,726
Then fuel must get in there.

1002
01:37:48,762 --> 01:37:52,630
Let's see, Braulio. If there is a
spark everything is all right.

1003
01:37:52,766 --> 01:37:55,735
A spark and fuel. It has to light.

1004
01:38:02,776 --> 01:38:06,735
Come on. We did everything
right.

1005
01:38:07,781 --> 01:38:08,748
Come on.

1006
01:38:10,784 --> 01:38:12,752
You see, Braulio? It worked.

1007
01:38:14,788 --> 01:38:18,656
Take this old wagon. You'll
enjoy it more than I.

1008
01:38:18,792 --> 01:38:20,760
I'm worthless.

1009
01:38:21,795 --> 01:38:24,764
I only screw up.
You're the mechanic.

1010
01:38:27,801 --> 01:38:29,769
I am nothing. A failure.

1011
01:38:45,819 --> 01:38:48,788
<i>- We should be...
- Excuse me.</i>

1012
01:38:49,823 --> 01:38:52,690
Relax, ma'am.
Everything will be all right.

1013
01:38:52,826 --> 01:38:56,694
<i>Let's go back to the supermarket.
Monica, any news?</i>

1014
01:38:56,830 --> 01:39:02,700
<i>According to the information we
have from neighbours, the...</i>

1015
01:39:02,836 --> 01:39:08,706
<i>delinquents entered the
supermarket on foot stemming...</i>

1016
01:39:08,842 --> 01:39:16,715
<i>from the hypothesis there were
no suspicious cars in the area.</i>

1017
01:39:16,850 --> 01:39:20,718
<i>The situation is very tense. The
police continue trying to...</i>

1018
01:39:20,854 --> 01:39:24,722
<i>negotiate with the delinquents.
Even so, direct communication...</i>

1019
01:39:24,858 --> 01:39:29,727
TO MY BELOVED GODSON, YOUR
GODFATHER WHO LOVES YOU. CALOIERO.

1020
01:39:29,863 --> 01:39:33,731
<i>We are able to confirm what
was just a...</i>

1021
01:39:33,867 --> 01:39:35,732
...a hypothesis until now.

1022
01:39:35,869 --> 01:39:40,738
The supermarket's security
guard is among the hostages.

1023
01:39:40,874 --> 01:39:42,842
His name is Daniel Sanabria.

1024
01:39:45,879 --> 01:39:49,747
<i>If they don't come up,
nobody's going out from here.</i>

1025
01:39:49,883 --> 01:39:54,843
<i>Clear the area and people
will come out in 15 minutes.</i>

1026
01:39:55,889 --> 01:39:56,856
Daniel!

1027
01:39:57,891 --> 01:39:58,858
Gomez.

1028
01:40:03,897 --> 01:40:05,865
What are you doing?

1029
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:08,868
- What're you doing?
- Put it down.

1030
01:40:09,903 --> 01:40:11,871
Everything all right, Gomez?

1031
01:40:16,910 --> 01:40:18,878
Yes, everything is all right!

1032
01:40:22,916 --> 01:40:26,784
<i>Carlos Delmar. Railroad worker.
Will you tell me how we...</i>

1033
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:28,785
<i>...got to this situation?</i>

1034
01:40:28,922 --> 01:40:31,891
<i>I don't know how we got
to this situation.</i>

1035
01:40:32,926 --> 01:40:36,885
<i>And I don't know how we are
going to get out, either.</i>

1036
01:40:38,932 --> 01:40:43,801
<i>Is that you, Gomez? What
happened? Answer me, please.</i>

1037
01:40:43,937 --> 01:40:48,897
<i>Gomez! Don't do anything stupid.</i>

1038
01:40:52,946 --> 01:40:53,913
<i>Please.</i>

1039
01:40:54,948 --> 01:40:57,917
<i>I want us to be together.</i>

1040
01:40:58,952 --> 01:41:00,817
Shit! It's not here!

1041
01:41:00,954 --> 01:41:01,921
It was here.

1042
01:41:02,956 --> 01:41:04,924
Come on, Juan, look for it.

1043
01:41:05,959 --> 01:41:07,927
Look for it, please.

1044
01:41:10,964 --> 01:41:11,931
Here it is.

1045
01:41:16,970 --> 01:41:17,937
Let's go.

1046
01:41:43,997 --> 01:41:46,864
<i>The special police squad
surrounds the place...</i>

1047
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:50,868
<i>without abandoning attempts to
negotiate with the individuals.</i>

1048
01:41:51,004 --> 01:41:53,871
<i>They are asking for the
road to be freed.</i>

1049
01:41:54,007 --> 01:41:57,875
<i>Two of them have been
identified. They are Mariano...</i>

1050
01:41:58,011 --> 01:42:00,878
<i>Vitalli and Luis Gomez.
Back to you, Monica.</i>

1051
01:42:01,014 --> 01:42:04,609
Fortunately, it has stopped
raining. Although here the...

1052
01:42:04,718 --> 01:42:07,881
...situation remains tense.
We're walking towards the...

1053
01:42:08,021 --> 01:42:11,889
<i>rails of discord. The train
stopped passing by here a long...</i>

1054
01:42:12,025 --> 01:42:14,892
<i>time ago with the resulting
loss of jobs for many men.</i>

1055
01:42:15,028 --> 01:42:17,895
<i>Some of whom are
inside the supermarket...</i>

1056
01:42:18,031 --> 01:42:21,990
in situation with
an unclear ending.

1057
01:43:29,102 --> 01:43:32,071
THE TRAIN IS OURS

1058
01:43:54,127 --> 01:43:57,096
<i>I'm not sure if we can change
destiny.</i>

1059
01:43:59,132 --> 01:44:00,997
<i>I believe we shoul do...</i>

1060
01:44:01,134 --> 01:44:05,093
<i>everything within reach to
change the things we don't like.</i>

1061
01:44:09,142 --> 01:44:14,102
<i>Something happened that night.
It would change us forever.</i>

1062
01:44:15,148 --> 01:44:18,117
<i>Something that had to do with
the anger...</i>

1063
01:44:19,152 --> 01:44:24,021
<i>the injustice,
with the laws, the rights...</i>

1064
01:44:24,157 --> 01:44:27,126
<i>and above all
with every one of us.</i>

1065
01:44:29,029 --> 01:44:32,521
<i>Something that had to do with
our identity. With being part of...</i>

1066
01:44:32,633 --> 01:44:36,034
<i>something that always belonged
to us. I don't know why we...</i>

1067
01:44:36,169 --> 01:44:39,138
<i>thought it was not ours and
unreachable.</i>

1068
01:44:42,175 --> 01:44:45,144
<i>I still ask myself why my old
man didn't see any way out.</i>

1069
01:44:48,181 --> 01:44:52,140
<i>I'm sure there has to be one.
And I won't stop until I find it.</i>

1070
01:45:17,210 --> 01:45:20,077
<i>That night we didn't watch as
the train passed by.</i>

1071
01:45:20,213 --> 01:45:22,181
<i>We started it up.</i>

1072
01:45:23,213 --> 01:49:22,181
