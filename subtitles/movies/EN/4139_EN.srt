1
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:38,964
In My Skin

2
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:21,280
At three words an hour
you'll never finish, Esther!

3
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:25,884
- Are you off?
- Yes. I'm going home to work.

4
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:29,488
I'm tired of this.
We should rent a place together.

5
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:32,624
With only one salary?
I want to Iive in luxury!

6
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:35,527
You had a steady salary before.

7
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:36,722
Yeah.

8
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,682
See the house?
Be great when it's finished.

9
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:08,287
He's a skirt-chaser. Go for it!
He's friends with the boss.

10
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:11,557
- Gee, thanks!
- I'm joking. That's him in the suit.

11
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:12,991
Good evening.

12
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:18,697
Is there any way
I can speed things up at the agency,

13
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,033
other than that,
to see what my chances are?

14
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:24,770
Not now, please!
I'll wish I hadn't got you in.

15
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:29,231
- Come on, there they are.
- I'll join you.

16
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,403
Shit!

17
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:12,978
Thanks.

18
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:16,848
I fell and tore my trousers.
My jacket's filthy, damn it!

19
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:18,984
I was out in the yard. Big place!

20
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,953
- He bought it for peanuts, apparently.
- Really?

21
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:23,774
You're ridiculous.

22
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:28,314
No, this is mine! Get your own.

23
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:29,871
Don't be mean!

24
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,590
Can I borrow her?

25
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:13,438
I've got to go.

26
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,973
- You're joking!
- Sorry.

27
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:19,044
I promised my friends.
I'll phone you for a lunch date.

28
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,580
I may ask your advice
about my work.

29
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:24,983
I don't do lunch dates.
I do dinner.

30
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:26,451
As you like.

31
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,247
Thanks. Bye.

32
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:32,711
Esther?

33
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,783
Esther!

34
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,727
Where have you been?

35
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:52,397
- Sorry, I'll explain. Let's go.
- Just a sec.

36
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:55,734
Henri and I looked everywhere for you.
It was weird!

37
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:59,271
There was blood on the bathroom floor
but nobody there.

38
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,339
We were scared we'd find a corpse!

39
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,568
Any luck?

40
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,544
I looked everywhere.

41
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:22,928
Forget about it.
I'm off home.

42
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:26,898
Henri should call the police.
No one reported an accident.

43
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:30,435
- So, where the hell were you?
- Walking in the yard.

44
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:33,138
I'm not tired.
How about a final drink?

45
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,959
- Okay.
- A quick one then.

46
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,123
Well, well!

47
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:59,804
The joint and Iigaments
escaped by an inch.

48
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:04,936
Had your tetanus shots?

49
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:09,007
- I think so.
- We'll give you a booster.

50
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,875
How did you do it?

51
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:15,614
I fell on some metal on a building site.
A tool, I think.

52
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,249
You and building sites don't mix!

53
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:24,070
This happened some hours ago.
Why didn't you come sooner?

54
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:27,717
I didn't know I was hurt.

55
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,894
I only noticed later.

56
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:31,363
Then I went to a bar.

57
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,531
I didn't think it was...

58
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:36,632
Didn't notice? Didn't it hurt?

59
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,636
No.

60
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,505
It does now, and in the bar,
but not then.

61
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:42,173
And it was too dark to see.

62
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:43,441
That's not normal.

63
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:46,811
Shock has strange effects, but still.

64
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,272
You should have felt it.

65
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:53,218
I feel my leg normally now.
I guess I wasn't thinking.

66
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:54,489
Scatterbrain!

67
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,322
Are you sure it's your leg?

68
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:01,259
Just a joke. I'm tired.
Can you feel my hand?

69
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,260
Yes.

70
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:03,862
I'll do a test.

71
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:06,297
Round or sharp? Don't look.

72
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:07,663
Don't look.

73
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,431
Round.

74
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,978
Sharp.

75
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:24,915
Sharp.

76
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,123
I didn't touch you.

77
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:33,124
Good.

78
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:39,035
I'll anesthetize it.
You'll feel a pinprick, then nothing.

79
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:45,537
You may need surgery
to replace the tissue.

80
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:49,074
- It won't all heal back.
- What do you mean?

81
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:53,478
Your skin will heal unevenly.
Like this.

82
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:58,349
A graft will fix it.
A few days in the hospital.

83
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,350
I'll consider it.

84
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:02,954
Medically, there's no need
but it won't look pretty.

85
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:06,157
If there's no need, I'd rather not.

86
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:07,258
Think about it.

87
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:11,629
The dressing will need changing.
We'll discuss it then.

88
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,000
There you go.

89
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,394
Hello.

90
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:11,299
Why didn't you go
straight to the hospital?

91
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,180
You gash yourself

92
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:20,326
and calmly go out for a Coke?

93
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,839
I guess I was in shock.

94
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:27,692
I want to go out. I did a hard
night's work. Let's eat out.

95
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,627
I don't fancy it.

96
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:31,928
Alright.

97
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:35,647
It's strange that you felt nothing.

98
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:39,737
The doctor said everything's normal.

99
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:42,073
How about a boat ride on the canal?

100
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:46,664
Don't fancy it either?
You suggest something.

101
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,621
- What was that?
- Nothing.

102
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,993
When you rip up your leg,
you don't feel it.

103
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:06,044
When I touch you,
you jump and scratch.

104
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:09,057
Admit it's weird.

105
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:15,767
Say something.

106
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:20,106
No answer?

107
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,850
If you don't want to go out,
just say so.

108
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:27,885
Don't endlessly change the subject!

109
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,787
I said I didn't want to.

110
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:34,025
And I don't want
to discuss the accident!

111
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,516
Esther.

112
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:50,628
Don't go to any more parties
without me.

113
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:58,904
You were on the make. Admit it.

114
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,612
Are you sure?

115
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:07,050
Walking in dark yards all alone
sounds fishy to me.

116
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:18,848
I've had a proposition too.

117
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:21,097
From a woman?

118
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,368
A job offer.

119
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:24,999
What job?

120
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:27,274
In a bank.

121
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:32,707
They head-hunted me.
They want a new image.

122
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:37,633
They need a business journalist.

123
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:42,166
I'd help to design
their new P.R. strategy.

124
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:46,925
- Excellent!
- I'm not so sure.

125
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:49,934
Exciting, yes.
Good money, new job,

126
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:55,805
but it feels like selling out.
I'll show you the dossier.

127
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,968
You'll wear a suit!

128
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:09,681
When I do this, can you feel it?

129
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,183
No.

130
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,590
No?

131
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,703
There you go.
Here, I've read it.

132
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:03,341
I added some notes
to clarify things for the client.

133
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,476
- Fine.
- For Wednesday, okay?

134
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:09,113
It's short, but I promised.
Wednesday morning if you can.

135
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:10,274
Sure.

136
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:11,749
The rest is fine.

137
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,317
It's a good analysis.

138
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,318
Merci.

139
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:39,274
My job stinks.

140
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:43,411
Nothing but bureaucratic bullshit.

141
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:45,322
Gives me a headache.

142
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:49,783
My job's okay
but the deadlines are tiring.

143
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:52,528
Pierre, can you come?

144
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:53,631
Damn!

145
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:57,993
We'll have that coffee later.

146
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:31,402
Coming for coffee?

147
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:32,403
Not now.

148
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:36,307
I'm up to my neck.
If I stop, I'm sunk.

149
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,088
Don't stop, then.

150
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:45,816
I'll never finish
with you hanging over me.

151
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,478
Take it easy.

152
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:52,990
I won't bother you. I just wanted
some coffee and fresh air.

153
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:58,141
Come on! I'll finish your work.
It can't be hard.

154
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:01,760
Joke!

155
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:08,906
I've been cooped up all day.
Not even a lunch break.

156
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:10,534
In my office.

157
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:15,279
Then I cut myself in the storeroom.

158
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:18,549
The storeroom, my office.

159
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:24,090
The air-conditioning,
no windows open, can't breathe...

160
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:29,313
I'll be okay.

161
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:35,107
If you're hurt, the first aid box
is by the photocopier.

162
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,270
Is it? I'll get it.

163
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:41,805
Wait. How did you cut yourself?

164
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:44,104
On a metal thing.

165
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:47,311
I guessed that.
What were you doing with it?

166
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:49,439
Cutting myself.

167
00:25:55,020 --> 00:26:00,920
Flesh wounds. Nothing serious.
I was already injured but...

168
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:04,626
Forget it. Some other time.

169
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:06,716
Why did you do it?

170
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:09,394
I don't know.

171
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:18,475
I think I may have misused
a word, ''alternatively,''

172
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:22,780
in the first part
of my report this morning.

173
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:25,182
What are you working on?

174
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:29,051
A presentation to the Ministry.

175
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:33,921
Neat! Takes a special kind of writing.

176
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:37,561
Daniel gave me back my report.

177
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:41,465
I have to rewrite some of it,
but not all.

178
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:44,264
On the whole, it was good.

179
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:46,704
I'll let you get on.

180
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:50,207
No, let's have coffee. It can wait.

181
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:52,176
No, I should...

182
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:58,449
I should check that mistake
or it'll bug me.

183
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,684
- Don't worry about it.
- Wait!

184
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:03,245
Is Vincent home tonight?

185
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,720
No. He's got to work.

186
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:10,327
- Stay at my place.
- Really?

187
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:15,198
Thomas is coming
but you can sleep on the sofa.

188
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:44,493
Esther!

189
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,288
Coming!

190
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:51,669
Esther, answer!
Why is the door locked? Open it!

191
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,864
Open!

192
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,942
Sorry. I locked it without thinking.

193
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:00,511
But I did answer you.

194
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,639
- Here.
- Thank you.

195
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,259
God! You didn't do that?

196
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,260
No.

197
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:20,464
It's mostly the accident
at the party.

198
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:23,975
Don't look. Go, I'll disinfect it.

199
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:36,639
Stop staring at me.

200
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:43,965
Can you leave me alone
for a minute?

201
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:52,991
I hope you didn't touch my pans!

202
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:55,187
I'm the chef tonight.

203
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,936
I've decided to treat you
to my cooking skills.

204
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:01,538
Not that they're any good, but still.

205
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:03,089
It smells good.

206
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:04,641
Here.

207
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,611
I had a twelve-pack sent up.

208
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:12,449
The grocery downstairs
takes orders by phone. It's handy.

209
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:16,353
I have to work tonight
to meet my Wednesday deadline.

210
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:18,015
Okay.

211
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:23,761
I don't know what to say
about your cuts.

212
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,229
Say nothing.

213
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:27,593
But I'm worried.

214
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:30,534
You won't do it again, will you?

215
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:32,936
No, I did it without thinking.

216
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:36,607
You could see a doctor.
Get some pills.

217
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,710
I do, if I'm depressed or anxious.

218
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:42,171
You could see my doctor.

219
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:48,045
But he'd probably have you certified!

220
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:53,910
I know you,
but it looks sick to an outsider.

221
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:58,562
Anyhow, there's no need.

222
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:00,531
- Isn't Thomas coming?
- No.

223
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:02,090
He canceled.

224
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:06,770
Not that I care,
so long as I have company.

225
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:09,771
How's your presentation going?

226
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,109
So-so.

227
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:14,411
I'm so fed up.

228
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:18,004
I deserve a more responsible job.

229
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:21,752
With my experience and clients,
I should be a project manager.

230
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:25,393
I'd like that. Especially the money!

231
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:30,828
You'll soon be a research analyst.
I feel like a stooge.

232
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:34,064
I'm not so sure I will.
Tomorrow, at the office party,

233
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:38,535
I'll ask Modier
if I get the job and when.

234
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:42,843
I wouldn't.
You could blow your chances.

235
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:25,511
- So?
- I got the job!

236
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:29,486
I start in ten days
with that jewelry firm.

237
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:31,284
Congratulations.

238
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,985
Who's in charge?

239
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:35,259
Me.

240
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,262
I'll be project manager,
not just an analyst.

241
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:40,788
Junior manager, that is.

242
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:44,935
My Middle East knowledge
clinched it.

243
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,270
Well!

244
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:49,667
Fantastic.

245
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:53,744
You're not very experienced, but...

246
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,646
Junior manager!

247
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,239
Good going.

248
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:01,749
Do you mind?

249
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:05,186
No. I got you in here.

250
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:09,393
It feels a bit weird.
I've been here five years,

251
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:13,096
but I'm happy for you,
if you think you're fit enough.

252
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,097
Yes.

253
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:17,567
It'll be hard work at first
but I'll cope.

254
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:20,059
I'm sure you will.

255
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:24,641
So maybe I'll work for you?

256
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:26,439
Maybe.

257
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,924
Sandrine, please don't think I-

258
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:43,134
In the water!
Like everyone else!

259
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,998
- I've got no swimsuit!
- Who cares?

260
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:49,869
Go in your undies!

261
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,936
Sandrine!
Sandrine!

262
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,777
- Off with her trousers!
- Sandrine!

263
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,910
Enough. Let her go.

264
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:05,582
It's your loss, girl.
The water's great!

265
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:08,711
I'm sorry. It was stupid.

266
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,949
Doesn't matter.

267
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:16,752
Sorry.

268
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,293
I panicked and froze.

269
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,556
She's jealous.

270
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:55,692
Like she was at college, only worse.

271
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:58,228
Her failures aren't my fault.

272
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:00,764
I don't want to see her again.

273
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,066
I was thinking this afternoon.

274
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:05,735
With my new salary
and yours at the bank,

275
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:07,971
why don't we buy, not rent?

276
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:11,141
We'll get a loan
and renovate a nice place.

277
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:13,410
How do I know
it won't happen again?

278
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:15,743
You can't explain it!

279
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,881
It was only once.
I don't intend...

280
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:20,650
Fuck your intentions!
Did you expect that?

281
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:23,153
Look at yourself! Show me again.

282
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:26,556
I didn't expect it
but it won't happen again.

283
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:30,026
What else can I say?
You ignore my new job-

284
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:32,028
I didn't ignore it!

285
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:34,464
I'm glad about it,
I'll inquire about loans.

286
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,385
But that! I can't handle it.

287
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:40,604
Talk about it! Why can't you?

288
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:43,106
I told you. It came over me,

289
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:45,909
a mindless urge.
I won't do it again.

290
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:48,280
What gave you the idea?

291
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:50,614
What did you want? That?

292
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:52,395
Do you like that?

293
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,417
Do you like it?

294
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:58,805
- Stop, you're scaring me!
- You scare me!

295
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,495
Is it my fault?

296
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:09,633
No.

297
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,436
Don't you like your body?

298
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:16,406
Yes, I do. But...

299
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:22,911
This all started with your accident
the other day, right?

300
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:27,444
Maybe. I don't know.
Stop questioning me.

301
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:31,482
Okay, I'll stop.

302
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:37,239
I know you. I'll take your word
it won't happen again.

303
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:41,197
Sorry I lost my temper.

304
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,736
Let's dress up
and celebrate your job.

305
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:51,341
I'll move in with you tonight,
since I don't work at home now.

306
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:55,244
I'll feel easier that way.
Okay?

307
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:56,365
Hello.

308
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:58,505
We need precise details
of Ivar's brand image abroad,

309
00:37:58,506 --> 00:38:00,410
We need precise details
of Ivar's brand image abroad,

310
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:03,046
in markets where luxury
has other referents.

311
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:06,750
Our main aim
is to send our local agents

312
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:10,887
the data on which to devise
their independent strategies.

313
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:14,457
We need data on the luxury market,
especially jewelry,

314
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,726
the market leaders, their images,

315
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:19,696
and naturally the image
of Ivar itself.

316
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:21,731
We'll want to access surveys

317
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:25,068
from North America, Brazil,
Asia and the mid-East.

318
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:27,037
We're ready to spend.

319
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:29,165
The stakes are high

320
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,308
but we can't study every country.

321
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:35,345
Two countries should yield
a fairly accurate picture,

322
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:38,782
provided the cultural zone
matches your target markets.

323
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:41,451
Daniel says you're an expert
on the Middle East.

324
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:46,290
Yes. I'm not a specialist but I've
studied the area, its economics,

325
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:48,058
and I've spent time there.

326
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:50,560
- You could orient us.
- I hope so.

327
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:55,131
We'll draw up a proposal.
Esther will handle that aspect.

328
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:58,068
An international project.
Just what you wanted!

329
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:01,371
You're lucky.
Better than packaging surveys!

330
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:02,372
You bet!

331
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:06,776
I'll leave you to plan it.
Schedule several phases.

332
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:09,379
They seem to have money.
Give it the works.

333
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,472
Okay.

334
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:13,083
This will be cleared.
Chair okay?

335
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:15,674
Thanks. Everything's fine.

336
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,864
How's it going?

337
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,230
Fine.

338
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:33,436
Still got my beige trousers?

339
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:36,039
The laundry couldn't
get the stains out.

340
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,942
I'll write you a check to replace them.

341
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:39,943
No...

342
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:45,081
Actually, yes.
They cost me 900 euros.

343
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,230
I'm kidding.

344
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:48,975
90.

345
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:55,878
I'm busy now.
I'll leave it with the receptionist.

346
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:03,533
Yes.

347
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:08,171
Yes.

348
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:12,184
The bedroom or verandah?

349
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:14,877
What did he say?

350
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,405
How many square meters?

351
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:21,451
Got to go. My dinner's here.

352
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:24,944
Around the clock! Bye.

353
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:29,020
- Thanks.
- No! Leave it to me.

354
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:32,498
Let me smell that.

355
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,619
Leave it to me, I said!

356
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:45,642
You should uncover it soon
to let it dry.

357
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:48,111
I'll see.

358
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:53,883
Sweetheart! Your cute Iittle face
on a magnetic card!

359
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:55,010
See?

360
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:58,451
Look in my bag.

361
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:01,858
I made appointments
to see three apartments.

362
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:03,193
The descriptions are in my bag.

363
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:05,161
- Whereabouts?
- You'll see.

364
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:07,122
In the blue folder.

365
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:12,588
I may be having dinner
with clients tomorrow.

366
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:16,339
What's that on your hand?

367
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,705
Let me see.

368
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,172
Hurry up!

369
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:29,076
Sorry.

370
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:33,058
I'm sorry, I thought...

371
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:48,838
I hope you'll agree it's delicious.

372
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,074
- It's a superb vintage.
- No, thank you.

373
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:54,777
- You don't like wine?
- No alcohol. Just water.

374
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:58,915
It's not alcohol,
it's a very good wine. Shame!

375
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:01,196
It's no everyday wine.

376
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,620
You've tempted me. I'll try it.

377
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:05,816
You'll see.

378
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:14,482
Excellent. Really excellent.

379
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,490
Well?

380
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:21,304
Delicious, I admit.
I'll do without water.

381
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:22,329
You see?

382
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:25,975
To return to business,
that was an interesting group.

383
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:29,279
Aside from the usual
generalities about luxury,

384
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,082
our image came out clearly.
A hard meeting to run too.

385
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:34,384
You coped well.

386
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,554
That woman on your left
kept contradicting the others!

387
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:38,605
Thank you.

388
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:52,363
Please.

389
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:55,204
A few years ago, we issued
a worldwide press package.

390
00:42:55,205 --> 00:43:01,077
We had to withdraw it from Japan
because one detail upset them.

391
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,358
What was it?

392
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:05,014
The postures of the people in the ad.

393
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:11,015
There was a hand gesture
which we saw as being very elegant.

394
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:13,690
It deeply shocked the Japanese.

395
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:16,593
It was like a gesture of disdain.

396
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:19,929
For the reader, it signified refusal.

397
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,840
Talk about details!

398
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:24,767
Crucial details!

399
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,971
Often, the whole thing
hangs on such subtleties

400
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:30,640
in the local culture.
We have to be careful

401
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:33,376
not to send negative signals.

402
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:39,377
They say a translation error
brought Japan into World War II!

403
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:42,585
Communications are
different in Japan.

404
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:46,189
We have a global strategy
but Japan is an exception.

405
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:47,590
We have a marketing team there.

406
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:51,151
It's so unlike Europe and the U.S.

407
00:43:56,667 --> 00:44:00,036
I didn't know Japan
was so unique in that way.

408
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:03,072
Some years ago,
we ran our global ads there.

409
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:04,941
The tests were catastrophic.

410
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:07,944
Two different cultures.
It did our image more harm than good.

411
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:12,015
Status symbols, especially,
are perceived very differently.

412
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:15,485
The Japanese marketing department
ignored guidelines from France.

413
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,688
They were almost completely useless!

414
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:22,229
We devised local strategies instead.

415
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:24,861
You worked in Japan?

416
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:26,229
For ten years.

417
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:28,698
I trained there and stayed on,

418
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:32,301
but Iiving so far away was hard.
I missed France.

419
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:35,071
I worked in Germany,
then back to Paris.

420
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:36,539
What drew you to Japan?

421
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:40,910
I studied Japanese history,
then got an M.B.A.

422
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:42,345
I knew the language and

423
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,247
the country fascinated me,

424
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:47,798
less for its present than its past.

425
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:50,185
It was like a dream.

426
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:53,589
Seeing for real
the things I had studied,

427
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:55,191
or what was left of them.

428
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,894
If you study a language,
you want to use it.

429
00:44:57,895 --> 00:45:00,305
That was another motive.

430
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:02,388
I'm sure.

431
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:05,535
I'd like to travel too,
in a few years.

432
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,704
We're part of a European group.

433
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:08,838
We can move around.

434
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:10,840
- Where would you go?
- Lisbon.

435
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:12,399
Oh? Why?

436
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:14,544
I go there on vacation.
I like the feel,

437
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,813
the superior quality of Iife,

438
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:19,715
the people, the mentality.

439
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:21,250
It's only a 3-hour flight.

440
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:23,453
- That's quick.
- A good compromise.

441
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:26,155
Foreign, but still European.

442
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:29,559
I doubt I could Iive
in a totally alien culture,

443
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,294
but I like Lisbon.

444
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:32,345
Excuse me.

445
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:40,337
- Sorry. Go ahead.
- No hurry, Madam.

446
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:47,076
I don't like the way
Lisbon has changed since the Expo.

447
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:52,315
I used to like the city's
timelessness and authenticity.

448
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:55,785
The Expo changed so much.
The Vasco da Gama bridge,

449
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:59,188
the Barrio Alto...
I found it lost its charm.

450
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:03,359
Not at all. The innovations
were very good for the city.

451
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,427
They made Iife easier.

452
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:06,796
Creativity has blossomed.

453
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:08,707
You see creativity?

454
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:12,068
Definitely. AlI those places, like...

455
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:15,204
There's an interesting split
between everyday Iife,

456
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:17,807
which is more provincial
than metropolitan,

457
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:21,544
and the style and ambiance
of dinner at the Alcantara

458
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:23,346
or a place like the Lux,

459
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:25,414
or the Kremlin. Fabulous!

460
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:28,050
Much more inventive
than most places in Paris.

461
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:31,420
I don't know Lisbon.
You'd advise me to go?

462
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:33,856
I think it's a marvelous place.

463
00:46:33,857 --> 00:46:36,092
Life there is stress-free
and pleasant,

464
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:39,362
but the entertainment
is first class.

465
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:41,503
Rather like Rome, no?

466
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:44,200
Rome is the exact reverse.

467
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:46,169
It has the cultural poverty
of a provincial town,

468
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:51,107
and all the aggravation of a big city.

469
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:54,076
- You're exaggerating.
- You don't like Rome?

470
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:55,444
Not much, no.

471
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:58,225
- Why not?
- I don't know.

472
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,716
My remark was offhand.

473
00:47:00,717 --> 00:47:03,352
But whenever I was there,
I felt uncomfortable.

474
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:06,189
- Perhaps it was you.
- No, not really.

475
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:08,020
It's like I said.

476
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:10,159
I found it very aggravating.

477
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:14,119
Cars, horns,
scooters, traffic jams...

478
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:18,334
The smallest practicalities
become exhausting.

479
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:21,170
- And that wind...
- The sirocco.

480
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:22,471
It's infuriating!

481
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:24,907
I didn't take to the people.

482
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:28,211
They're less friendly
than elsewhere in Italy.

483
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:31,814
The women about town are so vulgar.
The way they walk!

484
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:33,482
Even their manners are bad.

485
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:35,384
The city itself is superb.

486
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:39,388
Its monuments, yes. Its museums
always seem to be closed.

487
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:42,892
For entertainment and nightlife,
it's poor.

488
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:45,494
Few cinemas. Only one arthouse.

489
00:47:45,495 --> 00:47:48,664
Not many bars or clubs.
Not that they're my scene,

490
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:52,568
but my friends there
feel bored and cut off.

491
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:55,838
True, Paris has more entertainment
but it's improving.

492
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,339
More screens are opening.

493
00:47:58,408 --> 00:48:03,188
And it's so beautiful.
I'm happy just walking.

494
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:18,127
One of our project managers
works in Rome now.

495
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:21,931
- For your agency?
- No, he ''reoriented,'' as they say.

496
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:24,767
Besides, our agency is in Milan.

497
00:48:24,768 --> 00:48:27,837
He spent a few years in Milan,

498
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:30,706
but now he has another job in Rome.

499
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:34,710
He rents a place there
and keeps one in Milan.

500
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:36,779
Whatever he thinks of Rome,

501
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,247
he prefers Italy to France.

502
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:40,249
I don't think he plans to come back.

503
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:44,620
Would you like to move
to the Middle East?

504
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:52,328
So, in a nutshell,
Rome's awful, Lisbon's spoiled.

505
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:55,464
- What city do you like?
- Paris, of course.

506
00:48:55,465 --> 00:49:00,569
The world's most beautiful city.
Harmonious architecture,

507
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:05,141
unspoiled, outstanding surroundings,
pleasant Iifestyle.

508
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:07,743
Those trendy clubs of yours,

509
00:49:07,744 --> 00:49:12,581
they're not my criteria.
I have nothing against them,

510
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:16,585
but for me, that kind of place
can never replace

511
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:19,388
the daily pleasures
of our local bars and bistros.

512
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:22,458
Which always greet us so warmly!

513
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,961
Not always,
but don't let's generalize.

514
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:28,097
You must have missed
all that in Tokyo.

515
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:29,497
Definitely!

516
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,935
To return to what we were saying,

517
00:49:32,936 --> 00:49:38,007
how do you go about working with
market research agencies in Japan?

518
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:43,148
Their methods must be different.
It can't be easy.

519
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:49,273
The air-conditioning is strong.

520
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:53,139
Excuse me.

521
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,920
Coming! I'm getting wine.

522
00:51:13,937 --> 00:51:18,340
We researched
the whole concept of luxury,

523
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:22,878
how people feel about luxury goods,
be it perfumes or jewelry.

524
00:51:22,879 --> 00:51:26,115
Trifles, let's say,
but expensive ones.

525
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:29,616
We tried to gauge public attitudes.

526
00:51:37,227 --> 00:51:40,763
- Will you have a dessert?
- No thank you.

527
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,832
- Coffee?
- Not for me.

528
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:44,400
We could ask for the check.

529
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:47,165
Waiter! The check.

530
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:49,588
The survey

531
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:55,210
<i>was originally designed to confirm...</i>

532
00:59:32,035 --> 00:59:33,725
It's down there.

533
00:59:35,104 --> 00:59:38,924
Your friend's there, in the ambulance.

534
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:52,521
I was so scared.
Have you broken anything?

535
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:54,353
No, this is all.

536
00:59:54,457 --> 00:59:57,687
- You took quite a fall.
- Yes.

537
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:17,379
I drove a client home
to the suburbs, around 11 p.m.

538
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:22,374
I got completely lost
with those traffic things,

539
01:00:22,485 --> 01:00:25,113
sending you here, there,

540
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:27,121
making no sense...

541
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:32,160
So I got lost,
then I saw this road thing,

542
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:34,695
a kind of sign.

543
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:38,324
I completely lost...

544
01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:42,598
I lost control and went over.

545
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:45,007
See? I tore my trousers.

546
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:47,509
How's your head?
Will they X-ray it?

547
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:50,707
No, I told them I'm okay.

548
01:00:51,914 --> 01:00:56,752
The dinner yesterday went badly.
I want to get to work on time.

549
01:00:56,753 --> 01:01:01,263
I'll go to the hospital
if I feel anything.

550
01:01:06,729 --> 01:01:08,263
You look tired.

551
01:01:08,264 --> 01:01:11,044
It's almost the same place.

552
01:01:11,634 --> 01:01:15,470
Naturally, your knee took the weight...

553
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:17,871
but it's high.

554
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:24,312
You must have laid
on the ground a long time

555
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:27,476
to get those dents.

556
01:01:35,725 --> 01:01:37,249
I don't know.

557
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:39,447
I guess it's that.

558
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:01,450
Something wrong?

559
01:02:01,451 --> 01:02:03,783
I couldn't sleep.

560
01:02:10,693 --> 01:02:14,959
It's about time I got up as well.

561
01:02:18,668 --> 01:02:23,171
Bad luck, but it'll heal.
Don't think about it.

562
01:02:23,172 --> 01:02:26,508
It wasn't just bad luck.
I shouldn't have drunk.

563
01:02:26,509 --> 01:02:28,379
You couldn't know.

564
01:02:28,444 --> 01:02:33,048
Cut out the drinking,
cut out the problem. Make sense?

565
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:34,049
Yeah.

566
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:44,624
You're still shocked and tired.
Don't sweat it.

567
01:02:44,727 --> 01:02:47,529
You learned your lesson.
It won't happen again.

568
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:51,830
Think about something else.
Me, your job,

569
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:54,198
me again...

570
01:02:55,872 --> 01:02:59,775
We're seeing that place
again at 5, remember?

571
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,977
We could move on Saturday.

572
01:03:01,978 --> 01:03:03,578
I won't forget.

573
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:07,179
Your dinner problem will blow over.

574
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:08,880
Yes.

575
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:13,086
I'll pick you up tonight.

576
01:03:13,222 --> 01:03:16,591
The apartment,
then the travel agency.

577
01:03:16,592 --> 01:03:21,163
Eric and Justine prefer Italy.
Me too. Is that okay?

578
01:03:21,164 --> 01:03:22,825
Yes, me too.

579
01:03:27,904 --> 01:03:31,072
I wish they'd taken X-rays.
I hope you're okay.

580
01:03:31,073 --> 01:03:33,371
Don't worry.

581
01:03:33,943 --> 01:03:35,953
I'll take a shower.

582
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:44,452
We should bring a tape measure.
Their plans may be inaccurate.

583
01:03:44,453 --> 01:03:46,011
Right!

584
01:03:46,722 --> 01:03:48,087
Come in.

585
01:03:50,526 --> 01:03:51,693
Good morning.

586
01:03:51,694 --> 01:03:53,744
Sorry to bother you.

587
01:03:53,796 --> 01:03:57,666
- I'm sorry I wasn't good at dinner.
- No, you weren't.

588
01:03:57,667 --> 01:04:02,971
That kind of dinner is not for fun,
or to have a good meal. It's work.

589
01:04:02,972 --> 01:04:07,822
Your professional behavior
was seriously lacking!

590
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:11,413
I've known you two years.

591
01:04:11,414 --> 01:04:14,049
I won't judge you on one lapse.

592
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:18,019
I was very embarrassed,
both towards them

593
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:22,657
and to find you were less mature
than I thought.

594
01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:23,955
There.

595
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:26,194
I have nothing to add.

596
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:30,265
Your survey was well done,
so you're in credit overall.

597
01:04:30,266 --> 01:04:33,602
A second lapse
would jeopardize your place here,

598
01:04:33,603 --> 01:04:36,304
at least at your level
of responsibility.

599
01:04:36,305 --> 01:04:39,715
Understood. It won't happen again.

600
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:41,437
Thank you.

601
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:03,867
We have until Friday.
The vendor's giving us priority.

602
01:05:03,902 --> 01:05:05,200
Oh, cool.

603
01:05:05,201 --> 01:05:07,636
- We'll be set in no time
- Yes.

604
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:09,571
What did you want to
discuss with the builder?

605
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:13,208
The plumbing in the kitchen
and the bedroom windows.

606
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:16,211
Same as you.
And that load-bearing wall.

607
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:19,402
Yes. Hang on, I need some cash.

608
01:06:14,704 --> 01:06:17,372
If that wall has to stay, it's no deal.

609
01:06:17,373 --> 01:06:20,642
Pity, because I really like the place.

610
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:26,247
It's perfect on the whole,
but for that one potential problem.

611
01:06:26,248 --> 01:06:31,478
Even if it's load-bearing,
there must be solutions.

612
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:33,888
Are you Iistening? What's up?

613
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:35,323
Nothing. Just a sec.

614
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:40,028
The whole wall can't be load-bearing.
We could cut it in half

615
01:06:40,029 --> 01:06:45,269
to feel less boxed-in.
We can't knock it all down.

616
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:47,678
What are you up to?

617
01:06:48,037 --> 01:06:49,407
What's wrong?

618
01:06:49,605 --> 01:06:52,107
I've forgotten
my wretched PIN number!

619
01:06:52,108 --> 01:06:56,298
I know it.
There's nothing to cry about.

620
01:06:56,612 --> 01:06:58,546
How much? 200?

621
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:19,067
We must answer by Friday.

622
01:07:19,068 --> 01:07:21,434
It's only Wednesday.

623
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:25,407
I've been thinking about your job.

624
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:27,709
If they're training an in-house team

625
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,478
rather than outsource the work,

626
01:07:30,479 --> 01:07:34,839
maybe they intend
to create permanent jobs.

627
01:07:37,353 --> 01:07:39,721
Perhaps they're planning to expand.

628
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:44,692
It's strange, since they already have
P.R. and personnel departments.

629
01:07:44,693 --> 01:07:48,652
But there must be a reason for it.

630
01:07:49,432 --> 01:07:51,633
Does that sound stupid?

631
01:07:51,634 --> 01:07:55,424
I don't know. I've had a tiring day.

632
01:08:03,145 --> 01:08:04,946
What's the matter?

633
01:08:04,947 --> 01:08:06,710
Nothing.

634
01:08:07,216 --> 01:08:08,450
Something's wrong.

635
01:08:08,451 --> 01:08:09,731
Not with me.

636
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:14,452
I don't cry in the street.
I'm a normal guy.

637
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:22,063
You must be so happy with me
if you cry over a PIN number!

638
01:08:22,064 --> 01:08:26,568
I'm thinking, what can I do?
Probably nothing.

639
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:29,909
I'm not a drag or a pain, am I?

640
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:33,341
If I'm not the problem,

641
01:08:33,342 --> 01:08:38,213
it's something I don't know about,
so I don't know you.

642
01:08:38,214 --> 01:08:41,843
You do know me. You do.

643
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:47,063
You always look for meanings.

644
01:08:48,824 --> 01:08:52,560
Maybe I do.
People get tense, strung out.

645
01:08:52,561 --> 01:08:56,021
The car accident...
I don't know.

646
01:08:57,533 --> 01:09:03,438
I'm turning in. You should too.
We'll feel better tomorrow.

647
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,031
I'm coming.

648
01:18:40,348 --> 01:18:41,713
Good morning.

649
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:43,990
I need some formalin.

650
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:47,169
I don't sell it. It's illegal.

651
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:50,324
Try asking a lab,
but they won't give you any.

652
01:18:50,325 --> 01:18:53,360
A hospital, maybe.
What's it for?

653
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:59,281
I had a piece of bad skin removed.
I want to preserve it.

654
01:19:00,035 --> 01:19:01,945
You're sentimental!

655
01:19:04,005 --> 01:19:06,473
I never saw that before.

656
01:19:08,009 --> 01:19:11,345
What's it in, water?
Is that how they packed it?

657
01:19:11,346 --> 01:19:13,881
I broke the other flask.
It's water.

658
01:19:13,882 --> 01:19:15,349
They didn't strain themselves!

659
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:21,350
But things deteriorate,
even in formalin, over the years.

660
01:19:21,957 --> 01:19:24,619
I don't see what could...

661
01:19:24,726 --> 01:19:30,197
Skin is tanned, normally.
Human skin not often, thankfully!

662
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:33,033
But it's the same.
What did they suggest?

663
01:19:33,034 --> 01:19:36,270
I forgot to ask.
How do I tan it?

664
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:38,672
Will it stay smooth and soft?

665
01:19:38,673 --> 01:19:41,308
Yes, like anything made of leather.

666
01:19:41,309 --> 01:19:44,912
Wallets, clothes... They're tanned.
Tanned and treated.

667
01:19:44,913 --> 01:19:50,851
It's a whole technique.
To do it yourself, try potassium alum.

668
01:19:50,852 --> 01:19:54,288
Dilute it in water, smear it on,

669
01:19:54,389 --> 01:19:57,658
roll it out flat. That will tan it.

670
01:19:57,659 --> 01:20:01,195
It won't be treated or dyed,
but tanned. It won't budge.

671
01:20:01,196 --> 01:20:04,063
Press it hard.

672
01:20:04,166 --> 01:20:06,766
It shouldn't be too thin.

673
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:09,398
May I?

674
01:20:24,786 --> 01:20:26,413
No problem.

675
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:30,691
What's bad about it?
It looks fine.

676
01:20:30,692 --> 01:20:34,662
It wasn't.
That's all I have to do to tan it?

677
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:35,960
That's all.

678
01:20:36,464 --> 01:20:37,865
Anything else?

679
01:20:37,866 --> 01:20:42,766
Yes. Foundation cream
and aspirin or paracetamol.

680
01:20:58,153 --> 01:21:00,747
Yes, it's me.

681
01:21:02,724 --> 01:21:04,914
Can you call me back?

682
01:21:04,993 --> 01:21:07,723
I'm on my mobile.

683
01:21:07,829 --> 01:21:10,998
I'm afraid I won't be home tonight,

684
01:21:10,999 --> 01:21:13,297
but please call me.

685
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:19,868
Take care. Bye for now.

686
01:21:31,219 --> 01:21:33,847
Esther here.

687
01:21:35,357 --> 01:21:40,261
I'm sorry. A mass of things
has kept me from coming to work.

688
01:21:40,262 --> 01:21:46,033
Can you apologize to Daniel,
say I'll be in at 9 sharp tomorrow?

689
01:21:46,034 --> 01:21:48,298
No need.

690
01:21:51,473 --> 01:21:54,541
No, that was a friend.
He didn't know.

691
01:21:54,542 --> 01:21:56,912
Can you give me Elodie?

692
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:03,905
<i>Hello. This is your wake-up call.</i>
