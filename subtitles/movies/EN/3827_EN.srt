1
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,553
Based on actual events

2
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,553
Based on actual events

3
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,755
More than 500 war reporters
were killed in the last decade.

4
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,632
This film is dedicated
to their memory.

5
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,152
Iraq - 2007

6
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,635
(Woman) He can't talk,
so he just films things.

7
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,954
(Man) Yeah, basically.

8
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,913
He's even named his camera Dave,
which I find kind of sad.

9
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,031
(Man 2) And we're taping.

10
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,355
Anders. Miriam.

11
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,959
Say hello to the folks at home.

12
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,310
Say, "Greetings from hell."
Come on, guys.

13
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,829
What are you doing back there?
Planning a date?

14
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,999
We're speculating about al-Safi's
motives on giving us this interview.

15
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,671
Yeah. Let's talk about something
that really interests people.

16
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,028
Like sex.

17
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,754
(Sighs) Sebastian, you are
such a fucking pervert!

18
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,917
Why don't you turn that off, and
save the battery for the real stuff?

19
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,600
- Yeah, stop filming us!
- This is the real stuff.

20
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,756
People don't care
about boring old war.

21
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,634
They need something juicy
to break away from "American Idol".

22
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,478
Like emergency sex
among reporters.

23
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,512
Anders, would you care to explain
that concept to TV audiences?

24
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,915
(Laughs) Why don't you explain it?

25
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,349
You can explain the emergency
sex you have at night,

26
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,040
alone with the internet, you know.

27
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,118
Cos we don't want our sex lives
on your emergency sex show.

28
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,434
(Sebastian laughs)

29
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,472
Whoa there, missy!
Did you just say, "Our sex lives"?

30
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,034
Ah, does that mean you guys
are finally doing it?

31
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,832
When we get home
we're gonna have a talk

32
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,155
about your lack
of journalistic standards, OK?

33
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,679
You'll be severely disciplined.

34
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,836
(Driver) I see something.
(Sebastian) Where?

35
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,235
- I see someone on the road!
- I don't see anything!

36
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,351
(Gunshots and screaming)

37
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,630
(Sebastian) Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

38
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,194
Fuck! Jesus! Shut the door!

39
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,833
(Screams)

40
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,153
- (Sebastian) Is everyone all right?
- Yeah! Get down!

41
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,635
(Sebastian) Get this car in reverse!

42
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,354
Back off! Get us out of here! Press!

43
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,513
Press!

44
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,471
Put the car in reverse!

45
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,478
Move it, motherfucker,
or we're all dead!

46
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,352
Get us the fuck out of here!

47
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,799
(Screams)

48
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,354
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. I think the vest caught it.

49
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,879
(Gunshots)

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,479
(Screams)

51
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,160
(Sebastian) Is she OK? Is it bad?

52
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,158
She's been hit through the side!
She's bleeding pretty bad!

53
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,669
Stay with me! You stay with me!

54
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,190
You keep listening to me! You keep
listening to me! Say my name!

55
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,512
(Gunfire)

56
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,317
- Oh, shit!
- You're gonna be OK. I got you.

57
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,112
Get us the fuck out of here!

58
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,628
We're gonna get you out of here, OK?
Just stay with me!

59
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,917
- Fuck!
- Jesus!

60
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,555
(Anders) Don't you go...
Don't you go anywhere! Miriam!

61
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,398
(Speaking Arabic)

62
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,192
(Gunfire)

63
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,439
Fuck!

64
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,669
Miriam!

65
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,313
(Speaking Arabic)

66
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,431
(Gunfire)

67
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,473
(Gunfire continues)

68
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,439
Defensive positions!

69
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,953
Hey, you have to help her first, OK?

70
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,310
Call for medevac! Two urgent surgicals!

71
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,237
Let's go! Come on!

72
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,153
- Where are you guys from?
- Georgia! Coalition forces!

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,560
Look out! RPG at 12 o'clock!

74
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,118
This saved my life once.

75
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,192
Los Angeles - One year later

76
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,472
(On laptop) 'These days,

77
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,672
'violence in the conflict zone
has continued to escalate,

78
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,998
'and now represents a clear threat
to peace in our region.

79
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,318
'This is the Caucasus,
where violence harms everyone.

80
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,118
'I plead to the separatists,
the Russian Federation,

81
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,276
'and the people of Georgia,

82
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,755
'let's return
to the negotiating table.

83
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,314
(Reporter) 'That was Georgian
President, Mikheil Saakashvili,

84
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,908
'who is struggling to move
his country closer to the West.

85
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,474
'This former Soviet republic
has already sent troops

86
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,989
'to assist NATO's missions
in Iraq and Afghanistan,

87
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,556
'and would like full membership
in both NATO and the EU.

88
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,797
'Not surprisingly, Georgia's
aspiration to integrate with the West

89
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,117
'is in direct conflict with
Russia's desire to regain influence

90
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,232
'over territory lost in the break-up
of the Soviet Union,

91
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,351
'which according
to Russia's leader, Vladimir Putin,

92
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,552
'was the greatest geopolitical
catastrophe of the 20th century.'

93
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,198
(Anders) So, what's going on?

94
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,710
'This place is about to blow, man.
There's no one here.

95
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,877
'There's no one in Georgia,
but me Zoe and Stilton.

96
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,197
'Just today there was
a police truck, got lit up.

97
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,554
'The peacekeepers have come
under fire on the border.'

98
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,193
Whoa. That's the border...

99
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,550
'The administrative border
with South Ossetia.

100
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,319
'Lt's one of two breakaway provinces
backed by the Russians.

101
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,351
'Both sides have had
peacekeepers here

102
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,550
'since war broke out here
in the early 90s.'

103
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,432
No one'll fucking insure me.
I can't.

104
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,155
I got a special reputation
after Iraq and...

105
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,350
Apparently,
I was a loose cannon before.

106
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,789
- 'You are a loose cannon.'
- Thanks.

107
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,150
'Listen, I don't care what you do.

108
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,510
'Get onto a doc, get your papers
and get over here.'

109
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,074
I know Sebastian's ready
to rock and roll.

110
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,632
'I will dance for you! '

111
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,309
Tbilisi, Georgia - August 6, 2008

112
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,756
(Church bells peal)

113
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,632
(Laughter)

114
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,918
(Sebastian) It looks nice.

115
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,918
Then again most places do
before war tears 'em up.

116
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,272
In the end they all look the same.
And the world barely blinks.

117
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,709
There's that cheer I was missing(!)

118
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,239
I'm just laying out the facts.

119
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,875
There could be genocides
on five continents,

120
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,797
people don't give a fuck.

121
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,036
God forbid
their cable goes out, though.

122
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,196
So what's Russia's
big beef here, then?

123
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,436
They just don't want
to see this place go west?

124
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,313
It may have more to do
with the oil pipeline here.

125
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,194
It goes direct to Europe which makes
the Russian pipe irrelevant.

126
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,756
They're also playing tug-of-war
with a couple of Georgian provinces.

127
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,998
- Welcome to Cold War, the sequel.
- Exactly!

128
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,680
Wanna give Dutchman a call?
See where the others are at.

129
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,949
Yeah.

130
00:09:02,002 --> 00:09:03,321
And with Wolf Blitzer,

131
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:06,354
I think you should mention
the shelling of the villages...

132
00:09:06,482 --> 00:09:07,801
(Phone rings)

133
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,116
(Speaks Georgian)

134
00:09:09,242 --> 00:09:12,996
Mr President,
your cabinet members are here.

135
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:17,192
- Would you like me to go?
- No. Please stay.

136
00:09:17,322 --> 00:09:19,995
Gentlemen, you all know Chris,
my US press adviser.

137
00:09:20,122 --> 00:09:21,919
- Hello.
- Yes, please come in.

138
00:09:22,042 --> 00:09:24,761
- Good morning.
- Come in. Tell me news.

139
00:09:24,882 --> 00:09:27,077
Mr President, the latest intelligence

140
00:09:27,202 --> 00:09:30,399
indicates the separatists are firing
from the Russian positions,

141
00:09:30,522 --> 00:09:32,194
using their peacekeepers as shields.

142
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,517
That can only mean
willing cooperation.

143
00:09:34,642 --> 00:09:37,634
That could be another attempt
to draw us into wider hostilities.

144
00:09:37,762 --> 00:09:40,401
- Just like in '04.
- We believe this to be different.

145
00:09:40,522 --> 00:09:43,559
Russian fighter planes and tanks
are moving towards the conflict zone.

146
00:09:43,682 --> 00:09:46,116
A Russian fleet in the Black Sea
is also on the move.

147
00:09:46,242 --> 00:09:49,393
So you all believe war is certain?

148
00:09:50,522 --> 00:09:52,558
We... we pray not.

149
00:09:52,682 --> 00:09:56,197
But the Ossetians, they are refusing
all our efforts in diplomacy.

150
00:09:56,322 --> 00:09:58,836
Our troops are
at their lowest level of readiness.

151
00:09:58,962 --> 00:10:01,556
Several ministers
are also out of the country.

152
00:10:01,682 --> 00:10:03,161
We have no contingency plan...

153
00:10:03,282 --> 00:10:05,750
We'll call them back.
Yes, call them back. Everyone.

154
00:10:05,882 --> 00:10:10,194
And I want no response yet
to these provocations. Understood?

155
00:10:11,762 --> 00:10:15,471
The question is what do you wipe
your arse with in Tajikistan?

156
00:10:15,602 --> 00:10:18,639
There is no toilet paper anywhere.
Ever.

157
00:10:18,762 --> 00:10:22,072
There's no newspaper, no leaves
on the trees. I had the runs!

158
00:10:22,202 --> 00:10:25,433
I had to slide along the grass,
wipe my arse like a dog.

159
00:10:27,202 --> 00:10:29,352
That's a lovely visual, Stilton.

160
00:10:29,482 --> 00:10:31,438
That's why I drink whisky, my dear.

161
00:10:31,562 --> 00:10:35,714
Whatever it is, tummy bugs,
even memories, this kills it.

162
00:10:35,842 --> 00:10:37,514
- (Dutchman) Cheers.
- Cheers.

163
00:10:40,482 --> 00:10:41,881
Whoa!

164
00:10:42,002 --> 00:10:45,358
This stuff has put more experienced
drinkers than you in a coma.

165
00:10:45,482 --> 00:10:46,995
Don't worry about this man, Zoe.

166
00:10:47,122 --> 00:10:49,841
He can drink anyone under the table.
Yours truly excepted.

167
00:10:49,962 --> 00:10:51,953
You got pretty fucked up in Bosnia.

168
00:10:52,082 --> 00:10:53,834
- Me? Never!
- Most definitely.

169
00:10:53,962 --> 00:10:57,272
- Never! You were in Bosnia, too?
- See what I mean?

170
00:10:57,402 --> 00:10:59,472
- (Stilton) What were you? 12?
- 19.

171
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,073
Everything's easier in a miniskirt.

172
00:11:02,202 --> 00:11:04,796
Speaking from personal experience,
are you, Stilton?

173
00:11:04,922 --> 00:11:06,116
(Laughter)

174
00:11:06,922 --> 00:11:09,914
(Dutchman)
Hmm. Bosnia's pretty fucked up.

175
00:11:10,042 --> 00:11:12,272
Not as bad as Rwanda, though.

176
00:11:12,402 --> 00:11:15,394
Families hacked and stacked
in churches.

177
00:11:15,522 --> 00:11:19,276
Imagine the attention that would
have got if they'd had oil there.

178
00:11:19,402 --> 00:11:21,711
Yeah, war is like
an old toothless whore.

179
00:11:21,842 --> 00:11:23,241
(Laughter)

180
00:11:23,362 --> 00:11:26,274
- (Anders) Dutchman!
- Disgusting mainly. But then...

181
00:11:26,402 --> 00:11:28,836
Every now and again...

182
00:11:28,962 --> 00:11:30,520
(Growls quietly)

183
00:11:30,642 --> 00:11:33,315
...she gives it to you
like nobody's business.

184
00:11:35,082 --> 00:11:36,561
I mean, special.

185
00:11:36,682 --> 00:11:37,910
(Chuckles)

186
00:11:38,042 --> 00:11:39,714
The old whore!

187
00:11:42,842 --> 00:11:44,639
Oh, yes, Mommy!

188
00:11:44,762 --> 00:11:45,956
(Laughs)

189
00:11:46,082 --> 00:11:50,598
- So, you guys got a... a plan yet?
- We're trying to get hold of Rezo.

190
00:11:50,722 --> 00:11:53,316
Captain Avaliani.
You know, my guy from Iraq?

191
00:11:53,442 --> 00:11:55,433
Thought he might have some leads.

192
00:11:55,562 --> 00:11:57,792
But so far all we know
is his unit's back.

193
00:11:57,922 --> 00:12:00,072
Well, let me know.
I got a guy in Variani.

194
00:12:00,202 --> 00:12:02,591
He can hook you up with a guy
if you need it.

195
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,031
- Where you headed?
- Tskhinvali.

196
00:12:05,162 --> 00:12:08,279
- (Stilton) What?
- What?

197
00:12:08,402 --> 00:12:12,441
My dear chaps,
that's the separatists' capital.

198
00:12:12,562 --> 00:12:15,838
I just go where the man tells me,
and point the camera.

199
00:12:15,962 --> 00:12:20,797
' I have no fear of heights

200

(Sebastian) OK. All set.

207
00:12:51,402 --> 00:12:54,758
Dutchmars guy will meet us
near the village square at midnight.

208
00:12:54,882 --> 00:12:56,713
Oh, God!

209
00:12:57,682 --> 00:13:02,039
What do they put in this shit here?
Maybe I'm just getting old.

210
00:13:02,162 --> 00:13:04,232
Roll down your window, will you?

211
00:13:09,162 --> 00:13:11,471
It's no good, mate.
You're gonna have to pull over.

212
00:13:12,642 --> 00:13:14,280
Really?

213
00:13:17,482 --> 00:13:19,712
You all set? Lightweight.

214
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:22,072
(Groans) Yeah.

215
00:13:24,362 --> 00:13:26,512
Actually, I feel kind of hungry now.

216
00:13:27,562 --> 00:13:29,712
- Have we got any snacks?
- No!

217
00:13:30,882 --> 00:13:33,601
And if we have to stop
every five minutes for you to puke,

218
00:13:33,722 --> 00:13:36,031
we are never making it to the border.

219
00:13:38,242 --> 00:13:39,675
Fuck you!

220
00:13:39,802 --> 00:13:42,032
(Rumbling)

221
00:13:42,162 --> 00:13:46,599
(Anders) Sounds like shelling.
(Sebastian) Things are heating up.

222
00:14:10,042 --> 00:14:11,714
(Minister) Attacks are growing.

223
00:14:11,842 --> 00:14:15,039
Both villages and peacekeepers
are under fire now.

224
00:14:15,882 --> 00:14:20,353
We have casualties.
Dead and wounded.

225
00:14:22,122 --> 00:14:24,272
- We must respond.
- I agree.

226
00:14:24,402 --> 00:14:26,233
If we respond, we are at war.

227
00:14:26,962 --> 00:14:28,190
We cannot risk it.

228
00:14:28,322 --> 00:14:32,201
Mr President,
if our troops cannot return fire,

229
00:14:32,322 --> 00:14:34,233
they cannot evacuate the wounded.

230
00:14:34,362 --> 00:14:37,752
We will maintain ceasefire
as long as we can.

231
00:14:37,882 --> 00:14:40,555
(Chris) Mr President,
there is visual confirmation

232
00:14:40,682 --> 00:14:43,754
of Russian tanks
amassing for an invasion.

233
00:14:43,882 --> 00:14:46,077
I must address country
and world press tonight.

234
00:14:46,202 --> 00:14:48,762
I think that would be
a good idea, Mr President.

235
00:14:48,882 --> 00:14:50,440
- OK, let's do it.
- OK.

236
00:14:57,242 --> 00:15:00,154
(Door shuts)

237
00:15:01,362 --> 00:15:02,636
There's local colour.

238
00:15:02,762 --> 00:15:05,993
Besides, we've got time to kill
before Dutchman's guy shows up.

- Hello.

We have to hide the car

A lot of troops are on the move,

00:21:53,882 --> 00:21:57,921
'Whereas the government in Tbilisi
claims their troops... '

316
00:21:58,042 --> 00:22:02,797
...fired at Russian tanks entering
illegally into Georgian territory.

317
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:04,594
(Stilton) Sovereign Georgia.

318
00:22:04,722 --> 00:22:05,916
(Camera shutter clicks)

319
00:22:06,042 --> 00:22:07,600
Both sides have a dramatically...

320
00:22:07,722 --> 00:22:09,121
(Camera shutter clicks)

321
00:22:09,242 --> 00:22:13,360
...different account
of this escalation.

322

This is Thomas Anders,
reporting in Geor...

323
00:22:17,522 --> 00:22:20,832
This is Thomas Anders
reporting in Gori, Georgia.

324
00:22:21,482 --> 00:22:22,471
(Sebastian) OK.

325
00:22:22,602 --> 00:22:25,241
Well, that might get us on CNN.

326
00:22:25,362 --> 00:22:28,320
We can rock and roll that.
I'm gonna call our producer.

327
00:22:28,442 --> 00:22:31,957
'This is Michael Stilton
reporting from Gori, Georgia.'

328
00:22:33,282 --> 00:22:35,750
Very gory it is, too. I need a drink.

329
00:22:37,882 --> 00:22:40,157
Karin?

330
00:22:40,282 --> 00:22:42,273
Independent News Center New York
August 8, 2008

331
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,313
- 'I can't hear you.'
- No bites. I'm sorry.

332
00:22:44,442 --> 00:22:46,592
The networks are
all covering the Olympics.

333
00:22:46,722 --> 00:22:48,553
The opening ceremony started today.

334
00:22:48,682 --> 00:22:50,479
Did you mention a war started here?

335
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:53,241
'Of course. But everyone's
taking the Kremlin line.'

336
00:22:53,362 --> 00:22:55,557
Medvedev is saying
the Georgians fired first,

337
00:22:55,682 --> 00:22:58,116
and their troops
are just protecting their citizens.

338
00:22:58,242 --> 00:23:00,597
'Apparently, 98% of the people
in South Ossetia

339
00:23:00,722 --> 00:23:02,519
'suddenly have Russian passports.'

340
00:23:02,642 --> 00:23:05,236
Protecting them
by cluster-bombing villages

341
00:23:05,362 --> 00:23:07,159
miles outside the conflict zone!

342
00:23:07,282 --> 00:23:10,479
I know, Anders. I'm on your side.
You know what these people are like.

343
00:23:10,602 --> 00:23:13,674
They barely find the time
to cover the war we're in.

344
00:23:13,802 --> 00:23:16,441
You need to just... Hold on.

345
00:23:17,402 --> 00:23:19,120
Putin's on from Beijing.

346
00:23:19,242 --> 00:23:21,517
(Translator)
'There is no secret about it.

347
00:23:21,642 --> 00:23:23,394
'We had considered all scenarios,

348
00:23:23,522 --> 00:23:26,241
'including direct aggression
by the Georgian leadership.

349
00:23:26,362 --> 00:23:28,398
'We had to think beforehand
about how to provide

350

they can come and kill us,

such a policy will have for them.'

356
00:23:44,962 --> 00:23:47,078
- (Anders indistinct)
- What?

357
00:23:47,202 --> 00:23:50,080
I said I wonder
what that will look like!

358
00:23:50,202 --> 00:23:53,672
- Yeah.
- 'Wait. That's it? '

359
00:23:53,802 --> 00:23:56,760
Where's the Georgian side?
No questions even?

360
00:23:57,922 --> 00:24:00,436
Fucking unbelievable! Karin?

361
00:24:02,682 --> 00:24:04,673
(Shouting)

362
00:24:10,322 --> 00:24:12,995
(Sebastian) The networks
want something more personal?

363
00:24:27,642 --> 00:24:30,793
Hey, Tatia! Hey, hey!
Everyone make it out OK?

364
00:24:30,922 --> 00:24:32,958
I can't reach Sofi or my father.

365
00:24:33,082 --> 00:24:34,879
The phones
are not working in Variani.

366
00:24:35,002 --> 00:24:37,391
- Look, I mean...
- Hey.

367
00:24:40,002 --> 00:24:43,119
I think you need to take five.
Come on. Let's get some air.

368
00:25:07,282 --> 00:25:08,271
Thank you.

369
00:25:11,202 --> 00:25:14,160
- So, you studied in the States?
- Yeah.

370
00:25:15,762 --> 00:25:17,241
Where?

371
00:25:17,362 --> 00:25:19,922
New York. Political science.

372
00:25:20,042 --> 00:25:22,761
Thought about staying,
but came back here to teach.

373
00:25:26,322 --> 00:25:29,553
What is this? An interview now?

374
00:25:34,362 --> 00:25:35,590
OK.

375
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:39,038
Where's the US?

376
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:42,313
We were there for you with Iraq,
and you're nowhere to be seen.

377
00:25:42,442 --> 00:25:44,876
No. I... I agree with you.

378
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:46,401
(Mobile rings)

379
00:25:49,682 --> 00:25:51,673
(Speaks Georgian)

380
00:26:00,562 --> 00:26:03,952
My aunt and her husband got out OK
before the army closed the roads.

381
00:26:04,082 --> 00:26:07,995
She said everybody else had to go
to nearby villages for shelter, so...

382
00:26:08,122 --> 00:26:10,113
I gotta get back up there.

383
00:26:10,842 --> 00:26:13,800
- We're going back north.
- Really?

384
00:26:13,922 --> 00:26:16,595
Thanks for the offer.

385
00:26:17,682 --> 00:26:19,912
I'm gonna go to my cousirs
and see my aunt.

386
00:26:22,002 --> 00:26:23,435
Call us later.

387
00:26:30,962 --> 00:26:32,793
What the hell was that?

388
00:26:33,402 --> 00:26:36,121
Seriously, man, you mind
fucking consulting me next time?

389
00:26:36,242 --> 00:26:38,358
I don't want her coming north.
For her own good.

390
00:26:38,482 --> 00:26:40,950
We need her. She needs us.

391
00:26:41,082 --> 00:26:43,721
This is exactly the kind of story
the networks care about.

392
00:26:43,842 --> 00:26:46,640
Missing family, reunion.

393
00:26:46,762 --> 00:26:48,992
I don't want someone along
I gotta protect.

394
00:26:49,922 --> 00:26:52,390
What, you believe
in your own reputation now?

395
00:26:52,522 --> 00:26:55,400
Why? Because of Miriam? Giorgi?

396
00:26:55,522 --> 00:26:58,673
Hey, check out this living hotness.

397
00:26:58,802 --> 00:27:01,236
You've been the best
life insurance policy I ever got.

398
00:27:01,362 --> 00:27:04,672
You are also a crazy motherfucker,
but we always come out OK.

399
00:27:04,802 --> 00:27:06,554
And that's the way I like it.

400
00:27:06,682 --> 00:27:09,196
I don't want complications
and entanglements.

401
00:27:11,322 --> 00:27:13,358
Tatia is not Miriam.

402
00:27:14,402 --> 00:27:16,393
Anders, you've gotta let that go.

403
00:27:19,842 --> 00:27:22,276
We came here to cover a war.

404
00:27:22,402 --> 00:27:26,031
If we don't get a story,
this will all unfold unseen.

405
00:27:30,242 --> 00:27:32,472
Yeah? OK.

406
00:27:37,802 --> 00:27:40,111
You really think this is gonna work?

407
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:41,960
I've seen her work bigger miracles.

408
00:27:45,722 --> 00:27:48,077
Thank you. You know what?

409
00:27:48,202 --> 00:27:50,477
I'm going to write you down
my numbers, OK?

410
00:27:52,682 --> 00:27:55,480
(Wolf-whistling)

411
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,678
Thank you. See you guys.

412
00:28:04,802 --> 00:28:06,997
(Cheering)

413
00:28:13,562 --> 00:28:15,757
So, guys, mission accomplished.

414
00:28:15,882 --> 00:28:18,442
He's gonna get in touch
with Avaliani's unit.

415
00:28:18,562 --> 00:28:19,961
They're headed this way.

416
00:28:20,082 --> 00:28:22,721
You're gonna need to ride with them,
or you won't get far.

417
00:28:22,842 --> 00:28:26,073
The main roads are still shut down.
Checkpoints every single mile or so.

418
00:28:26,202 --> 00:28:27,999
You're amazing!

419
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:32,239
You know what they say.
Everything's easier in a miniskirt.

420
00:28:34,082 --> 00:28:37,472
Heard you guys had
a rough night last night. Sorry.

421
00:28:37,602 --> 00:28:39,240
Where did you end up?

422
00:28:39,362 --> 00:28:42,240
Stilton sent me to the capital
to get some... government shit.

423
00:28:43,762 --> 00:28:46,435
20 seconds away from the Russians

424
00:28:46,562 --> 00:28:48,473
bombing an airstrip
20 clicks from here.

425
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:52,277
Sometimes
that toothless whore is...

426
00:28:53,762 --> 00:28:55,081
...unkind.

427
00:28:55,202 --> 00:28:56,635
(Man) Give me the cash!

428
00:28:56,762 --> 00:28:59,117
My name's Sebastian Ganz.

429
00:28:59,242 --> 00:29:01,710
I'm trying to get a hold
of Captain Rezo Avaliani.

430
00:29:01,842 --> 00:29:03,833
Up in the mountains.
Entertain us all.

431
00:29:03,962 --> 00:29:05,953
Like a crazy sexy Santa Claus.

432
00:29:06,082 --> 00:29:07,595
(Chuckles)

433
00:29:07,722 --> 00:29:11,158
Listen, I just wanted to say
thank you for taking me up north.

434
00:29:12,202 --> 00:29:13,999
And I'm sorry
I snapped at you earlier.

435
00:29:14,122 --> 00:29:17,432
It's just this is all... really hard.

436
00:29:18,722 --> 00:29:21,714
Sofi's wedding was supposed
to be a new beginning for all of us.

437
00:29:21,842 --> 00:29:22,991
What do you mean?

438
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:26,278
My father and I
have never really gotten along,

439
00:29:26,402 --> 00:29:29,155
and my going to America
was just one of many things.

440
00:29:31,482 --> 00:29:33,359
His side of the family is Ossetian,

441
00:29:33,482 --> 00:29:37,395
and we've had...
more fights about politics

442
00:29:37,522 --> 00:29:39,001
than I care to remember.

443
00:29:39,122 --> 00:29:41,636
No, listen, we're trying
to get to Variani,

444
00:29:41,762 --> 00:29:45,038
and we wondered if we might be able
to hitch a ride along with you guys.

445
00:29:45,162 --> 00:29:47,278
We haven't spoken
to each other in years.

446
00:29:49,362 --> 00:29:52,513
How about your family?
They must be worried sick.

447
00:29:52,642 --> 00:29:54,951
No, no. I don't have one.

448
00:29:56,922 --> 00:29:58,037
Sorry.

449
00:29:58,162 --> 00:30:01,598
(Clears throat)
OK. Finally connected with Avaliani.

450
00:30:01,722 --> 00:30:04,680
His convoy will pass here
at first light,

451
00:30:04,802 --> 00:30:07,919
and we can ride with them
to about a mile from Variani.

452
00:30:08,042 --> 00:30:09,441
But then we're on our own.

453
00:30:09,562 --> 00:30:12,520
Great. Thank you. Both of you.

454
00:30:12,642 --> 00:30:14,837
Hey, guys! The president's back on!

455
00:30:17,522 --> 00:30:20,195
'My fellow citizens
and world leaders.

456
00:30:21,322 --> 00:30:23,882

'May God save Georgia and all of us.'

467
00:31:13,482 --> 00:31:14,756
Sit down.

468
00:31:15,802 --> 00:31:19,590
- Think the world heard me?
- I hope so.

469
00:31:20,442 --> 00:31:21,875
You hope so?

470
00:31:22,002 --> 00:31:24,436
The Americans?
Bryza at the State Department?

471
00:31:24,562 --> 00:31:29,511
Mr Bush has make it very clear
that they will not intervene. Can't.

472
00:31:29,642 --> 00:31:31,200
Not militarily, anyway.

473
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:33,711
That's just what the Russians want.

474
00:31:33,842 --> 00:31:36,037
The Americans must know
that I had no choice.

475
00:31:36,162 --> 00:31:38,881
If I'd stood by, the Russians
would be here by now,

476
00:31:39,002 --> 00:31:42,597
and my whole country would be lost!
Another Chechenya!

477
00:31:42,722 --> 00:31:45,873
If the Americans won't help,
then Europe must come to our aid!

478
00:31:46,002 --> 00:31:48,197
But someone. Someone has to come.

479
00:31:49,202 --> 00:31:51,318
That's gonna be tough, Mr President.

480
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:54,991
Medvedev is already playing this
as a Russian 9/11.

481
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:56,316
Oh, please! Oh!

482
00:31:56,442 --> 00:31:59,400
He's having press conferences
accusing your soldiers

483
00:31:59,522 --> 00:32:01,672
of killing innocent civilians
in Tskhinvali.

484
00:32:01,802 --> 00:32:04,396
- He's calling this Kosovo!
- But it's outrageous!

485
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:07,320
We did everything we could
to minimise civilian casualties

486
00:32:07,442 --> 00:32:08,716
while defending ourselves!

487
00:32:11,522 --> 00:32:14,639
(Sebastian) Let's try
and keep this car in one piece, eh?

488
00:32:14,762 --> 00:32:17,754
Otherwise Hertz will never
rent me anything ever again.

489
00:32:26,482 --> 00:32:28,438
It's good to see you, my friend.

490
00:32:28,562 --> 00:32:31,679
You, too, Rezo. I wish it were
under better circumstances.

491
00:32:31,802 --> 00:32:34,077
- Sebastian explained everything?
- Yes.

492
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,193
- Do you mind if we film?
- No.

493
00:32:37,682 --> 00:32:38,671
OK.

494
00:32:38,802 --> 00:32:41,191
Captain, this is Tatia,
whose family is missing.

495
00:32:41,322 --> 00:32:43,631
(Speaks Georgian)
Thanks for the escort.

496
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:45,480
Yeah, I hope they are safe.

497
00:32:46,962 --> 00:32:48,714
Anders, you ride with us.

498
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:51,515
Sebastian, you will follow.

499
00:32:51,642 --> 00:32:53,394
So, what's the situation
at the front?

500
00:32:57,522 --> 00:33:02,312
Our intelligence indicates that
not only the Russians are coming,

501
00:33:02,442 --> 00:33:04,910
but volunteer militia and mercenaries

502
00:33:05,042 --> 00:33:08,079
to help the Russians
cleanse the villages.

503
00:33:08,882 --> 00:33:13,433
You see men with white armbands
and black masks,

504
00:33:13,562 --> 00:33:15,678
you don't take pictures.

505
00:33:15,802 --> 00:33:19,033
You don't try to hide. You run.

506
00:33:19,162 --> 00:33:21,073
Understand?

507
00:33:28,162 --> 00:33:30,232
(Tatia) Your friend, Anders,
is pretty cold.

508
00:33:30,362 --> 00:33:33,274
Listen, he doesn't mean it.

509
00:33:33,402 --> 00:33:35,996
He just has a hard time
relating to people.

510
00:33:36,122 --> 00:33:39,319
You know, he's been through
some really bad shit.

511
00:33:39,442 --> 00:33:41,194
Iraq and before.

512
00:33:42,122 --> 00:33:43,999
But he's a good guy.

513
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:46,682
He cares about you and your family.

514
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:49,794
He just wants to keep you safe.

515
00:33:53,802 --> 00:33:56,521
(Speaks Georgian)

516
00:33:57,842 --> 00:34:00,879
- What's that?
- It means "God willing".

517
00:34:01,922 --> 00:34:03,913
(Speaks broken Georgian)

518
00:34:06,362 --> 00:34:08,592
Yes! That's good!

519
00:34:09,202 --> 00:34:10,521
That's nice.

520
00:34:12,722 --> 00:34:16,681
You know, Rezo, thank you
so much for this, but...

521
00:34:17,962 --> 00:34:19,680
...I think I should
give it back to you.

522
00:34:19,802 --> 00:34:23,397
No. I give to you for reason.

523
00:34:24,842 --> 00:34:28,232
Do you know the story of St George?

524
00:34:28,922 --> 00:34:30,958
Uh... the patron saint of soldiers.

525
00:34:31,082 --> 00:34:34,552
Yes. His image is in all churches.

526
00:34:34,682 --> 00:34:37,116
He was a Roman soldier

527
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:41,440
martyred for refusing
to abandon the truth.

528
00:34:41,562 --> 00:34:45,601
You were trying
to tell the truth in Iraq.

529
00:34:49,402 --> 00:34:50,437
(Speaks Georgian)

530
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:56,876
This is as far as we can take you.
God be with you, my friend.

531
00:35:00,722 --> 00:35:02,121
Thank you.

532
00:35:42,082 --> 00:35:44,073
(Speaks Georgian)

533
00:35:47,762 --> 00:35:48,956
No?

534
00:35:49,082 --> 00:35:50,151
(Sighs)

535
00:35:50,282 --> 00:35:53,115
This is the fifth village.
How are we supposed to find them?

536
00:35:53,242 --> 00:35:56,473
(Speaks Georgian)

537
00:35:56,602 --> 00:35:57,830
What's she saying?

538
00:35:57,962 --> 00:36:00,760
She thinks she can help us.
She wants to see the pictures.

539
00:36:00,882 --> 00:36:02,873
(Speaks Georgian)

540
00:36:06,362 --> 00:36:07,477
(Sighs)

541
00:36:07,602 --> 00:36:09,718
What are they saying?
What did they say?

542
00:36:09,842 --> 00:36:13,801
Her cousin owns an inn in Avnevi,
5km from here,

543
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:17,073
and he took in a bride
seeking shelter.

544
00:36:17,202 --> 00:36:19,033
A bride and her father.

545
00:36:35,962 --> 00:36:38,396
(Speaks Georgian)

546
00:36:42,162 --> 00:36:43,993
(Anders)
Let's check the registration.

547
00:36:50,362 --> 00:36:51,875
Sofi!

548
00:36:55,322 --> 00:36:57,552
(Sobbing)

549
00:37:00,042 --> 00:37:01,521
(Father speaks Georgian)

550
00:37:10,162 --> 00:37:11,390
Hey.

551
00:37:16,882 --> 00:37:18,395
(Grunts)

552
00:37:20,162 --> 00:37:21,914
Hey.

553
00:37:23,362 --> 00:37:25,159
(Sobs)

554
00:37:25,282 --> 00:37:27,238
(Whirring)

555
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,561
(Speaks Georgian)

556
00:37:29,682 --> 00:37:32,116
- What's he saying?
- Jets! Jets!

557
00:37:52,802 --> 00:37:54,793
(Baby cries)

558
00:38:04,442 --> 00:38:06,194
(Radar beeping)

559
00:38:10,002 --> 00:38:12,516
Guys, we need
to get to a shelter. Now!

560
00:38:22,522 --> 00:38:24,194
We do not have much down here,

561
00:38:24,322 --> 00:38:26,199
but you are welcome to have it.

562
00:38:26,682 --> 00:38:28,479
You must be hungry.

563
00:38:28,602 --> 00:38:29,796
(Rumbling)

564
00:38:40,562 --> 00:38:42,041
(Switches radio on)

565
00:38:44,562 --> 00:38:47,918
Russian tanks are crossing
into undisputed Georgian territory.

566
00:38:49,082 --> 00:38:51,835
The air force is bombing airfields
all across the country.

567
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:53,680
(Explosion)

568
00:38:53,802 --> 00:38:57,192
Battleships are moving in
to block our ports.

569
00:38:57,322 --> 00:38:59,916
- My God.
- (Anders) We leave at first light.

570
00:39:00,042 --> 00:39:03,352
Avaliani told me volunteer militia
are coming with the Russians.

571
00:39:04,242 --> 00:39:06,233
We should try to get some rest.

572
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,916

Sebastian? Sebastian, wake up!
Quickly! We've gotta go! Come on!

578
00:41:08,482 --> 00:41:11,713
We can't. There's choppers.
Tatia, hiding places!

(Screaming)

583
00:41:30,962 --> 00:41:33,601
- We have to go another way!
- We have to see this.

584
00:41:33,722 --> 00:41:36,111
Come on. This way.
The river. Come on.

What did he say?

591
00:42:15,482 --> 00:42:18,280
He said he wants
the chief of police and the mayor.

No! We have to do something!

597
00:42:41,162 --> 00:42:42,914
There's nothing we can do.

598
00:42:43,042 --> 00:42:45,158
They'll kill us all!

the fuck out of here, Sebastian.

604
00:43:50,122 --> 00:43:52,511
Just one sec.

605

Clear them out!

00:47:31,802 --> 00:47:33,599
(Baby cries)

637
00:47:38,362 --> 00:47:39,954
Please have pity.

638
00:47:42,042 --> 00:47:43,953
In the name of God.

639
00:47:45,802 --> 00:47:47,201
Shh.

640
00:48:04,962 --> 00:48:06,953
(Soldiers shouting)

641
00:48:14,362 --> 00:48:15,920
It's all clear.

642
00:48:18,042 --> 00:48:20,158
(Baby cries)

643
00:48:20,282 --> 00:48:21,761
You idiot!

644
00:48:22,762 --> 00:48:26,152
Come out or we'll kill you all!

645
00:48:28,482 --> 00:48:30,950
Stop, stop, stop! All right, stop!

646
00:48:31,082 --> 00:48:33,642
Press, press!

647
00:48:36,882 --> 00:48:39,191
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

648
00:48:39,322 --> 00:48:41,199
We're Ossetian!

649
00:48:41,322 --> 00:48:43,358
We are friends!

650
00:48:43,482 --> 00:48:45,359
- Don't!
- Don't touch her, you fuck!

651
00:48:45,482 --> 00:48:47,473
(Grunts)

652
00:48:47,602 --> 00:48:48,751
OK, OK!

653
00:48:48,882 --> 00:48:51,954
(Speaks Georgian)

654
00:49:14,962 --> 00:49:16,554
This is all they had on them.

655
00:49:16,682 --> 00:49:19,150
We found a second camera in the car.

656
00:49:23,882 --> 00:49:25,873
(Gunfire)

657
00:49:30,242 --> 00:49:33,200
What are you doing in Avnevi,
Mr Anders and Mr Ganz?

658
00:49:33,322 --> 00:49:37,315
We were filming
in a neighbouring village

659
00:49:37,442 --> 00:49:39,239
when the fighting broke out.

660
00:49:39,362 --> 00:49:42,001
Filming her wedding.

661
00:49:42,122 --> 00:49:45,353
And are Georgian weddings
a common passion for war reporters?

662
00:49:48,122 --> 00:49:50,158
(Snorts)

663
00:49:50,282 --> 00:49:53,911
This is amazing,
what a simple Google search can find.

664
00:49:54,042 --> 00:49:57,239
Look. You are Thomas Anders
and Sebastian Ganz.

665
00:49:57,362 --> 00:50:01,401
Ambushed by Shiite militants
on the road to Samarra.

666
00:50:03,362 --> 00:50:07,150
Miriam Eisner, American reporter,
was killed.

667
00:50:16,082 --> 00:50:19,711
The memory card is security coded.
Give me the code, please.

668
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:21,757
7676.

669
00:50:22,842 --> 00:50:26,312
7676.

670
00:50:29,802 --> 00:50:31,633
(Voices in Georgian)

671
00:50:37,322 --> 00:50:39,552
- Nice wedding.
- Mm-hm.

672
00:50:43,562 --> 00:50:45,951
I can make the women talk.

673
00:50:46,082 --> 00:50:48,232
You will not touch my daughters!

674
00:50:48,362 --> 00:50:51,957
They are Ossetians like me.

675
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:54,642
We are like you.

676
00:50:54,762 --> 00:50:56,673
I am a Cossack, old man.

677
00:50:57,362 --> 00:51:01,321
And the next time
you raise your voice at me,

678
00:51:01,442 --> 00:51:04,479
I will cut you open
while your daughters watch.

679
00:51:04,602 --> 00:51:07,321
Daniil. Daniil...

680
00:51:07,442 --> 00:51:09,000
Take the father first.

681
00:51:09,122 --> 00:51:10,714
No, you can't do this!

682
00:51:11,202 --> 00:51:12,430
(Speaks Georgian)

683
00:51:17,882 --> 00:51:19,873
If there is a video recording,
we have to find it.

684
00:51:20,002 --> 00:51:24,518
We don't need a PR nightmare
like the Americans in Iraq.

685
00:51:24,642 --> 00:51:26,633
Don't worry, we'll find it.

686
00:51:26,762 --> 00:51:30,437
Sir, we just received word that
the second invasion front has launched.

687
00:51:30,562 --> 00:51:31,836
Good.

688
00:51:31,962 --> 00:51:36,433
(Minister) Mr President, we now face
a massive assault on two fronts.

689
00:51:36,562 --> 00:51:39,793
We estimate the total size
of the Russian force at 40,000 men.

690
00:51:39,922 --> 00:51:41,719
More than three times
than our own army.

691
00:51:43,162 --> 00:51:46,472
- How long can they hold?
- We cannot fight a two-front war.

692
00:51:46,602 --> 00:51:51,232
Our troops in Abkhazia must retreat,
or they will be wiped out.

693
00:51:52,122 --> 00:51:54,590
(President) Pull them back.

694
00:51:55,602 --> 00:51:57,274
What's the news, Christopher?

695
00:51:57,402 --> 00:52:01,190
Any news from the Americans
on our ceasefire proposal?

696
00:52:02,642 --> 00:52:07,397
I was told that President Bush spoke
to Medvedev and Putin personally.

697
00:52:09,562 --> 00:52:11,598
They're not interested.

698
00:52:11,722 --> 00:52:15,874
Putin left Beijing yesterday and said
he would command this personally.

699
00:52:16,002 --> 00:52:19,677
He told Sarkozy he would not quit
until I am hanged by my balls!

700
00:52:21,882 --> 00:52:23,440
There is some good news.

701
00:52:23,562 --> 00:52:26,440
The EU ministers have agreed
to an emergency meeting.

702
00:52:26,562 --> 00:52:30,237
Oh, thank you, EU(!)
An emergency meeting! Oh!

703
00:52:30,362 --> 00:52:33,991
Oh, let's bring cocktails!
Champagne! Let's celebrate(!)

704
00:52:34,122 --> 00:52:37,831
Meetings. More meetings! And
more meetings. No more meetings!

705
00:52:37,962 --> 00:52:41,716
Every time some people sit
in meetings, more of our people die!

706
00:52:43,962 --> 00:52:45,873
The EU representatives
have to come here!

707
00:52:46,002 --> 00:52:47,560
They have to stand with us!

708
00:52:53,562 --> 00:52:55,518
What did you do with the real card?

709
00:52:55,642 --> 00:52:58,110
It's in the ground where you fell
after that guy hit you.

710
00:52:58,242 --> 00:53:00,597
I buried it
when I came over to help you.

711
00:53:03,384 --> 00:53:06,854
I swapped the cards in the orchard.
We have to get that footage out.

712
00:53:09,424 --> 00:53:12,018
Papa, are you alright?
Did they hurt you?

713
00:53:12,144 --> 00:53:14,135
I'm alright, I'm alright.

714
00:53:16,024 --> 00:53:17,980
(Daniil speaks Georgian)

715
00:53:33,504 --> 00:53:35,893
(Door slams and locks shut)

716
00:53:41,464 --> 00:53:42,817
Hey! Anders!

717
00:53:42,944 --> 00:53:45,219
Hey, where are you taking him?
Sebastian!

718
00:53:47,904 --> 00:53:50,782
Beautiful church.

719
00:53:52,424 --> 00:53:56,099
Do you know that Georgia has some
of the oldest churches in the world?

720
00:54:00,344 --> 00:54:03,734
At least they will be left
when this is over.

721
00:54:04,784 --> 00:54:08,902
My leaders in Moscow
have decided they don't want to risk

722
00:54:09,024 --> 00:54:11,857
the church's condemnation
of this project.

723
00:54:21,904 --> 00:54:23,303
Do you play?

724
00:54:39,504 --> 00:54:41,142
(Tatia) In English.

725
00:54:41,264 --> 00:54:43,095
Are you sure they didn't hurt you?

726
00:54:43,224 --> 00:54:45,454
Yes, yes.

727
00:54:45,584 --> 00:54:48,223
So, what did they do to you?
You were gone a long time.

728
00:54:51,624 --> 00:54:54,661
You didn't tell them anything,
did you?

729
00:54:54,784 --> 00:54:57,093
Oh, Christ!

730
00:54:58,624 --> 00:55:03,254
This board was a gift from my son,
Sasha. He died in Afghanistan.

731
00:55:26,864 --> 00:55:30,573
Not bad, Mr Anders. Not bad.

732
00:55:33,224 --> 00:55:36,375
My Sasha was only 21
when he was killed.

733
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:39,973
He was captured by enemy soldiers.

734
00:55:40,104 --> 00:55:43,096
You can imagine the things
they did to him.

735
00:55:43,224 --> 00:55:45,863
That doesn't excuse
what you did here.

736
00:55:46,864 --> 00:55:49,139
Of course it doesn't.

737
00:55:49,264 --> 00:55:53,257
I just say so...
you know I understand.

738
00:55:53,384 --> 00:55:55,739
Understand what?

739
00:55:55,864 --> 00:55:57,934
That look in your eyes.

740
00:55:58,064 --> 00:56:00,578
The emptiness that comes
from burying your family.

741
00:56:29,464 --> 00:56:32,661
You lost your parents.
Car accident, wasn't it?

742
00:56:32,784 --> 00:56:35,696
Drunk driver. Head-on collision.

743
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:40,503
You know what is interesting?

744
00:56:41,824 --> 00:56:47,057
That we both asked for combat
after family death.

745
00:56:49,504 --> 00:56:51,813
And if people asked us,

746
00:56:51,944 --> 00:56:56,495
I'm sure we'd give them many reasons
for why we did it.

747
00:56:58,344 --> 00:57:00,096
But if we are honest...

748
00:57:04,784 --> 00:57:10,814
...I think we just sought noise,

749
00:57:10,944 --> 00:57:13,981
to drown out all other thoughts.

750
00:57:15,344 --> 00:57:17,380
To forget.

751
00:57:17,504 --> 00:57:21,463
Then after a while, in that noise,

752
00:57:21,584 --> 00:57:24,940
you start to feel... immune.

753
00:57:26,504 --> 00:57:29,143
Am I right?

754
00:57:29,264 --> 00:57:35,703
Unfortunately, such an attitude
makes one prone to taking risks.

755
00:57:35,824 --> 00:57:37,974
Really careless sometimes.

756
00:57:39,224 --> 00:57:44,696
Like accepting
a Shiite cleric's invitation

757
00:57:44,824 --> 00:57:48,533
for an interview,
driving straight into a deadly trap.

758
00:57:48,664 --> 00:57:51,701
- You shut your mouth.
- What?

759
00:57:52,584 --> 00:57:55,656
You feel your privacy
has been invaded?

760
00:57:57,584 --> 00:57:59,814
But isn't that what you do?

761
00:57:59,944 --> 00:58:03,141
Capture people
at their most vulnerable?

762
00:58:04,984 --> 00:58:05,814
Enough!

763
00:58:05,944 --> 00:58:11,177
(Daniil) Russia hires us, because
their own army is not motivated.

764
00:58:12,904 --> 00:58:16,579
They pay us well for... special jobs.

765
00:58:24,344 --> 00:58:26,778
Like, we catch deserters sometimes.

766
00:58:28,024 --> 00:58:30,902
The lucky ones would get trial.

767
00:58:32,784 --> 00:58:34,661
But the worst men...

768
00:58:39,904 --> 00:58:41,303
...they give to me.

769
00:58:42,384 --> 00:58:44,261
How could you have told them?

770
00:58:44,384 --> 00:58:46,454
They will kill them now! All of us!

771
00:58:47,104 --> 00:58:50,141
They already know everything.

772
00:58:50,264 --> 00:58:52,141
Where is the recording? Tell me!

773
00:58:53,064 --> 00:58:55,817
I don't know!

774
00:58:55,944 --> 00:58:58,412
Tatia, do not play games with me!

775
00:58:58,544 --> 00:59:01,581
These men may be Ossetians,

776
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:04,138
but they will not wait forever.

777
00:59:04,784 --> 00:59:07,981
Tell me the location
of the memory card,

778
00:59:08,104 --> 00:59:10,060
and I will let you all go.

779
00:59:10,184 --> 00:59:11,742
You have my word.

780
00:59:11,864 --> 00:59:14,298
I don't know
what you're talking about.

781
00:59:14,424 --> 00:59:17,257
(Chuckles) Let's not do that.

782
00:59:17,384 --> 00:59:19,659
Your friend doesn't have
that kind of time.

783
00:59:19,784 --> 00:59:21,615
What are you doing to him?

784
00:59:27,344 --> 00:59:29,904
May I begin, Colonel?

785
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:31,616
Hold on.

786
00:59:35,744 --> 00:59:37,416
We must think of ourselves now.

787
00:59:37,544 --> 00:59:39,421
Not two strangers!

788
00:59:40,144 --> 00:59:44,057
You think they wouldn't leave us?
They will abandon us like the world has!

789
00:59:45,584 --> 00:59:48,496
Tatia, tell me where the recording is?

790
00:59:49,144 --> 00:59:51,533
You Americans!

791
00:59:51,664 --> 00:59:54,303
Saakashvili started this war!

792
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,699
You understand?

793
00:59:56,824 --> 01:00:00,419
We are here just to protect
our people in South Ossetia!

794
01:00:00,544 --> 01:00:03,661
I can't give a fuck who you think
you're trying to protect!

795
01:00:03,784 --> 01:00:08,699
But I would love to know how shooting
an old woman helps you to do it.

796
01:00:10,784 --> 01:00:14,572
I'm only a soldier.
I have my orders.

797
01:00:14,704 --> 01:00:17,662
Georgia already lost this war.

798
01:00:22,264 --> 01:00:24,573
(Gunshots)

799
01:00:30,224 --> 01:00:31,816
(Soldier speaking Georgian)

800
01:00:33,664 --> 01:00:35,495
(Speaks Georgian)

801
01:00:40,624 --> 01:00:42,137
(Shouting)

802
01:00:43,784 --> 01:00:46,344
- You didn't listen to me.
- How the hell did you...?

803
01:00:46,464 --> 01:00:49,501
We had to fall back.
Then we heard the attack here.

804
01:00:49,624 --> 01:00:51,933
- They got Sebastian.
- Yes. We are on it.

805
01:00:52,064 --> 01:00:54,737
And they got Tatia and her family.

806
01:00:54,864 --> 01:00:57,458
- Which way?
- The jail in the basement.

807
01:00:57,584 --> 01:01:00,303
(Soldiers shouting in Georgian)

808
01:01:02,064 --> 01:01:03,656
(Gunshots)

809
01:01:28,424 --> 01:01:29,937
(Speaks Georgian)

810
01:01:31,824 --> 01:01:33,576
(Speaks Georgian)

811
01:01:33,704 --> 01:01:36,059
- Are you all right, bucko?
- Yeah.

812
01:01:36,184 --> 01:01:37,173
Yeah?

813
01:01:39,584 --> 01:01:40,812
(Gunshots)

814
01:01:40,944 --> 01:01:42,935
We can use them as shields!

815
01:01:47,424 --> 01:01:48,937
Keys!

816
01:01:52,744 --> 01:01:53,733
You came back!

817
01:01:53,864 --> 01:01:55,183
- Yeah. You hurt?
- No.

818
01:01:55,304 --> 01:01:56,532
OK. Let's go.

819
01:01:56,664 --> 01:01:57,460
Tatia!

820
01:01:58,584 --> 01:02:00,973
No, I can't trust you.

821
01:02:01,104 --> 01:02:03,982
Tatia, I'm your father...

822
01:02:04,104 --> 01:02:06,572
They need my help.

823
01:02:09,344 --> 01:02:12,814
No. You'll be safer with your friends.

824
01:02:15,784 --> 01:02:16,978
(Groans)

825
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:19,383
Medic!

826
01:02:21,024 --> 01:02:24,460
- Are you okay?
- It's nothing... just my arm.

827
01:02:24,584 --> 01:02:26,222
Medic I said!

828
01:02:26,344 --> 01:02:29,177
Get them!

829
01:02:37,984 --> 01:02:39,417
You stay close to me.

830
01:02:58,504 --> 01:03:00,495
Get the vehicles started!

831
01:03:12,744 --> 01:03:13,859
(Grunts)

832
01:03:13,984 --> 01:03:15,975
(Gunshots)

833
01:03:16,104 --> 01:03:17,935
(Shouting in Georgian)

834
01:03:21,344 --> 01:03:22,663
(Speaks in Georgian)

835
01:03:25,024 --> 01:03:27,140
We need to get the memory card!

836
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:29,298
I know!

837
01:03:36,144 --> 01:03:37,338
Cover us!

838
01:03:38,344 --> 01:03:39,743
Come on! Get in!

839
01:03:39,864 --> 01:03:40,660
(Grunts)

840
01:03:40,784 --> 01:03:42,376
Get in! Quickly!

841
01:03:55,744 --> 01:03:57,416
Tank coming, Captain!

842
01:03:58,504 --> 01:04:00,142
- Captain!
- I know!

843
01:04:06,544 --> 01:04:09,012
(Engine revving)

844
01:04:52,064 --> 01:04:53,782
Stay down!

845
01:05:00,784 --> 01:05:03,901
I have to get out!
We have evidence of a war crime!

846
01:05:04,024 --> 01:05:06,299
Meet you where the road
comes around the orchard!

847
01:05:06,424 --> 01:05:08,176
(Avaliani mutters)

848
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:10,420
(Grunts)

849
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,382
That guy's crazy.

850
01:05:33,184 --> 01:05:34,697
(Shouting)

851
01:05:38,104 --> 01:05:39,378
(Grunts)

852
01:06:00,264 --> 01:06:01,538
(Tatia screams)

853
01:06:24,984 --> 01:06:26,383
Slow down! Slow down!

854
01:06:28,224 --> 01:06:29,213
Come on! Come on!

855
01:06:29,344 --> 01:06:31,016
- Did you get the memory card?
- Yeah.

856
01:06:33,144 --> 01:06:36,181
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

857
01:06:36,304 --> 01:06:37,976
We're almost out.

858
01:06:45,784 --> 01:06:47,183
Papa!

859
01:06:47,304 --> 01:06:48,419
Get down!

860
01:06:48,544 --> 01:06:49,454
(Grunts)

861
01:06:52,304 --> 01:06:53,976
(Gunshot)

862
01:07:30,824 --> 01:07:32,735
(Gunshots and cheering)

863
01:08:17,144 --> 01:08:22,537
Medvedev has refused
new peace proposals.

864
01:08:22,664 --> 01:08:24,461
Which parts?

865
01:08:24,584 --> 01:08:26,017
All of them.

866
01:08:26,144 --> 01:08:29,739
He told Sarkozy that
they have their own demands.

867
01:08:29,864 --> 01:08:33,823
- What possible demands?
- They're sending them over tomorrow.

868
01:08:33,944 --> 01:08:37,823
I am reinstating
unilateral ceasefire.

869
01:08:37,944 --> 01:08:40,936
- Mr President...
- All our troops, ceasefire.

870
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:45,015
Fall back to Tbilisi.
We must defend our capital.

871
01:08:45,144 --> 01:08:49,422
If the world does not respond
to this gesture, it is suicide!

872
01:08:49,544 --> 01:08:52,104
It is the only chance
we have for survival.

873
01:09:04,504 --> 01:09:07,098
(Avaliani)
We should reach Gori by noon.

874
01:09:07,224 --> 01:09:09,579
It is the nearest city
with broadcast centre.

875
01:09:10,624 --> 01:09:14,663
Isn't there a faster route?
We need to get this footage out now.

876
01:09:15,464 --> 01:09:17,978
No. We must stay off road.

877
01:10:13,024 --> 01:10:16,699
I'm... sorry for your loss.

878
01:10:19,664 --> 01:10:21,973
I don't mean to offend. It's...

879
01:10:23,224 --> 01:10:27,740
It's just I've lost
many people in my life.

880
01:10:30,064 --> 01:10:35,980
But I believe that
all the trials that we face...

881
01:10:37,184 --> 01:10:39,982
...lead us to our purpose.

882
01:10:43,464 --> 01:10:44,863
Thank you.

883
01:10:52,784 --> 01:10:54,740
What do you believe, Anders?

884
01:11:02,864 --> 01:11:04,343
I don't know.

885
01:12:02,464 --> 01:12:04,739
You're abandoning your post?

886
01:12:04,864 --> 01:12:06,775
By order of the President.

887
01:12:06,904 --> 01:12:08,815
All troops are to fall back

888
01:12:08,944 --> 01:12:12,141
and report to defend Tbilisi.

889
01:12:13,184 --> 01:12:14,776
Gori is going to fall.

890
01:12:14,904 --> 01:12:18,453
I'm sorry. I have my orders.

891
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:20,381
What did he say?

892
01:12:20,504 --> 01:12:24,099
- They're abandoning the city.
- We've got to get in there!

893
01:12:24,224 --> 01:12:26,692
- What do you wanna do?
- I will not run.

894
01:12:27,944 --> 01:12:29,582
I will not lose my country!

895
01:12:29,704 --> 01:12:32,582
I've fought in too many wars
to keep Georgia free.

896
01:12:37,144 --> 01:12:39,260
(Helicopter whirring drowns speech)

897
01:13:15,344 --> 01:13:16,618
(Speaks Georgian)

898
01:13:38,544 --> 01:13:42,059
- Which way to the broadcast centre?
- That way! East!

899
01:13:57,824 --> 01:14:00,338
I'm sorry. We must leave you here.

900
01:14:00,464 --> 01:14:04,059
I need to attempt a defence. As soon
as you can, you must leave the city.

901
01:14:04,184 --> 01:14:07,494
It will become very dangerous.

902
01:14:07,624 --> 01:14:10,502
- Take care, Rezo.
- God be with you.

903
01:14:16,464 --> 01:14:18,261
- (Anders) You got the card?
- Yeah.

904
01:14:18,384 --> 01:14:20,375
First, we need an upload code

905
01:14:20,504 --> 01:14:22,574
from a network willing
to accept the footage.

906
01:14:24,304 --> 01:14:26,977
Shit! They've gone!

907
01:14:30,224 --> 01:14:31,816
(Sighs)

908
01:14:33,184 --> 01:14:36,733
- What do we do now?
- We need a phone.

909
01:14:42,864 --> 01:14:45,822
- 'International operator.'
- A collect call to the USA.

910
01:14:45,944 --> 01:14:47,423
I need to eat something.

911
01:14:48,704 --> 01:14:51,423
Hey! I got water!

912
01:14:51,544 --> 01:14:53,057
- Hey, Karin.
- 'Thank God! '

913
01:14:53,184 --> 01:14:56,221
- You guys all right?
- 'Yeah. We're in Gori.'

914
01:14:56,984 --> 01:14:58,337
Gori? It's been bombed!

915
01:14:58,464 --> 01:15:00,534
- I know.
- 'You need to get out.'

916
01:15:00,664 --> 01:15:01,653
Got coins!

917
01:15:01,784 --> 01:15:04,856
No. We have something we need
to upload. I need a network!

918
01:15:04,984 --> 01:15:07,942
- The Russians are likely to take...
- 'Karin, I know! Listen to me! '

919
01:15:08,064 --> 01:15:10,737
We witnessed something.
Killings. Executions in a village.

920
01:15:10,864 --> 01:15:13,094
Sebastian got it all on tape.
We have to get it out.

921
01:15:13,224 --> 01:15:15,784
- 'Now.'
- Yeah, but how?

922
01:15:15,904 --> 01:15:20,341
There's a media centre building here
with a satellite upload capability.

923
01:15:20,464 --> 01:15:23,740
We can get in,
but we need for a network

924
01:15:23,864 --> 01:15:26,936
to accept the feed
and give us... an access code.

925
01:15:27,064 --> 01:15:29,862
She'd better hurry!
The bombing's winding down.

926
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:32,544
Which means the ground troops
are getting ready.

927
01:15:32,664 --> 01:15:34,382
- You hear that?
- 'Yeah, but Anders... '

928
01:15:34,504 --> 01:15:38,053
I have already tried everyone.
No one cares.

929
01:15:38,184 --> 01:15:42,541
'But I'll try Roger McTierney.
If anyone can get it on, it's him.'

930
01:15:42,664 --> 01:15:44,256
Yeah, yeah. OK.

931
01:15:46,944 --> 01:15:48,343
Here.

932
01:15:49,864 --> 01:15:52,059
Give me those coins.
Let's try the Dutchman.

933
01:15:52,184 --> 01:15:53,253
Yeah.

934
01:16:13,504 --> 01:16:14,698
Friendlies!

935
01:16:16,384 --> 01:16:17,863
Hold your fire!

936
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:27,575
Have you seen ground troops?

937
01:16:27,704 --> 01:16:29,615
Hear that?

938
01:16:33,224 --> 01:16:34,976
The bombing's stopped.

939
01:16:36,104 --> 01:16:37,981
Defensive positions!

940
01:16:38,104 --> 01:16:39,503
Move out!

941
01:16:40,504 --> 01:16:41,334
(Phone rings)

942
01:16:41,464 --> 01:16:43,819
- Karin?
- 'He won't do it.'

943
01:16:43,944 --> 01:16:44,933
Fuck!

944
01:16:46,184 --> 01:16:48,300
All right. Thanks for trying, anyway.

945
01:16:48,424 --> 01:16:52,133
- 'What are you gonna do now? '
- I don't know.

946
01:16:52,264 --> 01:16:54,175
(Explosion)

947
01:16:54,304 --> 01:16:55,737
Fuck!

948
01:16:55,864 --> 01:16:58,139
We're OK. I'll call you once... Karin?

949
01:16:58,264 --> 01:16:59,856
(Phone line buzzing)

950
01:17:02,544 --> 01:17:06,093
- (Sebastian) Now what?
- We've gotta leave town. Come on.

951
01:17:10,704 --> 01:17:12,695
(Explosions in the distance)

952
01:17:20,104 --> 01:17:21,423
Whoa!

953
01:17:22,864 --> 01:17:24,217
Jesus!

954
01:17:25,784 --> 01:17:27,376
Let's go! Come on!

955
01:17:34,384 --> 01:17:36,181
They're doing a final sweep.

956
01:17:37,624 --> 01:17:41,458
We've got to find shelter
before the ground troops get here!

957
01:17:48,464 --> 01:17:49,453
Fuck!

958
01:17:50,824 --> 01:17:53,816
(Laughs)
Hey! So glad you guys didn't die!

959
01:17:53,944 --> 01:17:55,377
How are you?

960
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:57,142
Hey! How did you find us?

961
01:17:57,264 --> 01:17:59,539
Your message.
I tried calling you back.

962
01:17:59,664 --> 01:18:01,495
- You still need a SAT upload?
- Yeah.

963
01:18:01,624 --> 01:18:04,092
I got one. Stilton and I have
an upload vehicle. Come on.

964
01:18:04,224 --> 01:18:06,943
I would've driven it here,
but I didn't feel like blowing up.

965
01:18:07,064 --> 01:18:10,739
Listen, I need you
to sit this one out, OK?

966
01:18:10,864 --> 01:18:14,413
- Anders, I can take care of myself.
- Well, we can't risk this. Please!

967
01:18:14,544 --> 01:18:16,296
Where am I gonna be safer?

968
01:18:16,424 --> 01:18:18,221
My station will take yours. Come on!

969
01:18:18,344 --> 01:18:20,062
Hold on. We've got to make a detour.

970
01:18:20,184 --> 01:18:22,379
Demidov told me
they spared the churches, so...

971
01:18:22,504 --> 01:18:24,540
Everybody, get close. Get close.

972
01:18:24,664 --> 01:18:26,495
- Now be happy.
- For fuck's sake!

973
01:18:26,624 --> 01:18:29,092
It's only a war.

974
01:18:38,304 --> 01:18:39,578
(Speaks Georgian)

975
01:18:55,304 --> 01:18:58,455
Anders... I don't like this at all.

976
01:19:01,544 --> 01:19:03,182
Would you do it for me?

977
01:19:03,304 --> 01:19:07,456
We'll come right back and then
we can all leave the city together.

978
01:19:07,584 --> 01:19:08,903
Fine.

979
01:19:09,024 --> 01:19:10,742
Thank you.

980
01:19:10,864 --> 01:19:13,503
How do I get in touch with you
if something happens?

981
01:19:24,464 --> 01:19:26,659
That's Dutchman's cell. Tell these...

982
01:19:27,864 --> 01:19:30,458
Ask these people
if anybody has a cell phone.

983
01:19:32,144 --> 01:19:34,294
(Speaks Georgian)

984
01:19:43,464 --> 01:19:45,261
OK. What's the number?

985
01:19:45,384 --> 01:19:47,454
There.

986
01:19:47,584 --> 01:19:50,735
I'll call you on this phone
as soon as the upload is done, OK?

987
01:19:50,864 --> 01:19:52,661
OK.

988
01:19:54,544 --> 01:19:56,102
You know, I hope...

989
01:19:56,944 --> 01:19:59,219
- Anders, come on! Let's go!
- Come on!

990
01:20:18,624 --> 01:20:20,216
(Camera shutter clicks)

991
01:20:24,344 --> 01:20:26,335
(Gunshots)

992
01:20:31,024 --> 01:20:34,096
I can't reach Stilton.
The signal keeps coming in and out.

993
01:20:41,664 --> 01:20:43,939
Stilton!

994
01:20:45,024 --> 01:20:47,060
- What's up?
- Zoe's with him.

995
01:20:48,584 --> 01:20:51,223
She knows what she's doing.

996
01:20:53,064 --> 01:20:54,895
(Dutchman) Align the dish!

997
01:20:55,024 --> 01:20:57,413
Link us back up! Hurry!

998
01:20:57,544 --> 01:20:59,262
(Anders) Wake up, Romeo!

999
01:20:59,384 --> 01:21:02,342
It's all we got. The people have got
to see this footage! Now!

1000
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:03,658
Here.

1001
01:21:05,224 --> 01:21:06,577
Hope it still works.

1002
01:21:06,704 --> 01:21:08,376
(Gunshots)

1003
01:21:08,504 --> 01:21:10,813
- Data's intact.
- Oh, yes!

1004
01:21:10,944 --> 01:21:13,378
How long for the uplink?

1005
01:21:13,504 --> 01:21:15,893
- Come on.
- About two minutes to transmit.

1006
01:21:16,024 --> 01:21:18,743
- Can I offer you a drink?
- I'll wait till the footage is out.

1007
01:21:18,864 --> 01:21:21,503
But I will take a cigarette.

1008
01:21:51,064 --> 01:21:53,100
(Beeping)

1009
01:21:57,544 --> 01:21:59,774
They've targeted us!
Get under cover! Go!

1010
01:21:59,904 --> 01:22:01,781
Go, go, go!

1011
01:22:01,904 --> 01:22:04,134
- What are you doing?
- Saving our footage. Go!

1012
01:22:09,064 --> 01:22:11,419
- (Sebastian) Almost there!
- Gotta go!

1013
01:22:11,544 --> 01:22:13,341
(Anders) Come on!

1014
01:22:14,304 --> 01:22:15,783
Come on!

1015
01:22:15,904 --> 01:22:18,543
- Get out!
- Come on! Come on!

1016
01:22:18,664 --> 01:22:20,416
- We're not gonna make it!
- Get out!

1017
01:22:30,824 --> 01:22:32,098
Get up now! Come on!

1018
01:22:45,464 --> 01:22:46,692
(Speaks Georgian)

1019
01:23:09,304 --> 01:23:11,340
(Cheering)

1020
01:23:22,744 --> 01:23:24,575
(Anders) Dutchman? Stilton?

1021
01:23:26,584 --> 01:23:28,142
Sebastian!

1022
01:23:32,504 --> 01:23:34,062
It's bad, isn't it?

1023
01:23:34,184 --> 01:23:35,902
I can't feel shit!

1024
01:23:36,024 --> 01:23:37,457
You're OK.

1025
01:23:37,584 --> 01:23:38,812
Hey.

1026
01:23:39,824 --> 01:23:41,052
(Chuckles)

1027
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:43,453
(Gunshots)

1028
01:23:43,584 --> 01:23:46,257
Oh, fuck. Shit.

1029
01:23:46,384 --> 01:23:49,421
- Go, go.
- I'm not leaving you.

1030
01:23:49,544 --> 01:23:51,136
- You have to go.
- I can help you.

1031
01:23:51,264 --> 01:23:54,893
No, no, no. Listen to me.
You need to go. Now.

1032
01:23:55,024 --> 01:23:58,937
- I'm not fucking leaving you!
- Shut the fuck up, OK?

1033
01:23:59,064 --> 01:24:00,975
I can't move.

1034
01:24:01,904 --> 01:24:03,860
You have to get our footage out.

1035
01:24:04,904 --> 01:24:08,499
Go back to that church.
Hide the card until it's safe.

1036
01:24:08,624 --> 01:24:10,501
I'll be fine.

1037
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:13,536
Life insurance policy. Remember?

1038
01:24:18,904 --> 01:24:20,735
Listen, you have to do this for me.

1039
01:24:21,704 --> 01:24:24,502
Promise me. Promise me
you'll get the footage out.

1040
01:24:24,624 --> 01:24:26,182
- Promise me!
- I promise!

1041
01:24:26,304 --> 01:24:28,181
(Gunshots)

1042
01:24:32,104 --> 01:24:33,696
Here. Take this.

1043
01:24:35,504 --> 01:24:36,903
I'm coming right back.

1044
01:24:37,024 --> 01:24:38,423
Go!

1045
01:24:50,384 --> 01:24:52,181
Tatia?

1046
01:24:53,144 --> 01:24:55,817
Tatia? Where is the girl I was with?

1047
01:24:56,424 --> 01:24:59,575
Come on, guys. Somebody must know.
Where is the girl I was with?

1048
01:25:00,504 --> 01:25:02,415
Where's the girl?
There was a girl with me.

1049
01:25:02,544 --> 01:25:05,661
I don't need a phone this time.
I need the girl I was with.

1050
01:25:05,784 --> 01:25:06,978
Remember the girl?

1051
01:25:09,664 --> 01:25:10,858
Oh, Jesus.

1052
01:25:13,664 --> 01:25:15,063
(Mobile rings)

1053
01:25:17,104 --> 01:25:20,016
- 'If you have hurt her... '
- Come to the Stalin Square.

1054
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:22,616
Bring the memory card.

1055
01:26:03,384 --> 01:26:05,534
I need you to do something
very important for me.

1056
01:26:05,664 --> 01:26:08,132
Do you understand? OK.

1057
01:26:54,784 --> 01:26:56,900
Did you bring what I wanted?

1058
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:06,183
Let her go.

1059
01:27:17,824 --> 01:27:19,098
Thank God!

1060
01:27:19,224 --> 01:27:21,180
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1061
01:27:21,304 --> 01:27:23,579
I thought I'd never see you again.

1062
01:27:26,344 --> 01:27:28,983
Did you make the broadcast?

1063
01:27:29,104 --> 01:27:30,583
No.

1064
01:27:32,104 --> 01:27:33,298
Sebastian?

1065
01:27:35,744 --> 01:27:36,938
(Sighs) No.

1066
01:27:38,304 --> 01:27:39,532
(Sobs)

1067
01:27:39,664 --> 01:27:41,495
Everything will be OK.

1068
01:27:47,064 --> 01:27:49,180
I would have liked
to know you better.

1069
01:27:50,424 --> 01:27:52,460
I don't understand.

1070
01:27:53,144 --> 01:27:55,260
Now I need you to run.

1071
01:27:56,584 --> 01:27:59,894
- Anders...
- Go. Go.

1072
01:28:07,864 --> 01:28:09,377
Go!

1073
01:28:37,784 --> 01:28:40,742
The code is 1216.

1074
01:28:45,784 --> 01:28:49,220
You missed a card
when you searched me Avnevi.

1075
01:28:49,344 --> 01:28:51,539
The real one's on its way
to a human rights group,

1076
01:28:51,664 --> 01:28:54,098
courtesy of a brave little girl.

1077
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:57,622
It's over.

1078
01:29:03,184 --> 01:29:05,300
And how did you think
you could survive this?

1079
01:29:06,264 --> 01:29:07,697
I didn't.

1080
01:29:29,064 --> 01:29:30,463
(Gunshot)

1081
01:30:01,064 --> 01:30:03,339
I thought I told you to run!

1082
01:30:39,904 --> 01:30:42,259
I wanna see him
one last time, OK?

1083
01:31:09,304 --> 01:31:10,942
This...

1084
01:31:11,584 --> 01:31:13,575
This is where I left him.

1085
01:31:14,664 --> 01:31:16,461
I fucking left him.

1086
01:31:44,184 --> 01:31:46,254
(Shouting)

1087
01:31:46,384 --> 01:31:48,340
Anders!

1088
01:31:52,744 --> 01:31:56,180
- Hey, Rezo!
- We need your help.

1089
01:31:56,304 --> 01:31:57,498
- OK.
- Right.

1090
01:31:57,624 --> 01:32:00,013
- Anders.
- Sebastian?

1091
01:32:01,024 --> 01:32:04,175
Sebastian! What the fuck?

1092
01:32:04,304 --> 01:32:07,137
- I played dead.
- Are you OK?

1093
01:32:08,024 --> 01:32:09,821
- Can we move you?
- Yeah.

1094
01:32:09,944 --> 01:32:11,616
Let's get him out of here.

1095
01:32:11,744 --> 01:32:12,779
(Speaks Georgian)

1096
01:32:18,184 --> 01:32:19,981
- You all right, bucko?
- Yeah.

1097
01:32:40,384 --> 01:32:43,535
Hold on, we gotta stop.
Put him down.

1098
01:32:55,184 --> 01:32:58,062
Don't resist, Captain.

1099
01:33:18,064 --> 01:33:20,339
- Anders?
- There's nowhere to run.

1100
01:33:20,464 --> 01:33:22,455
Even if we could.

1101
01:33:44,944 --> 01:33:46,855
Sir, they're not resisting.

1102
01:34:05,424 --> 01:34:07,813
(Speaks Georgian)

1103
01:34:28,544 --> 01:34:31,297
Get away from here!

1104
01:34:35,064 --> 01:34:36,053
Go!

1105
01:34:39,824 --> 01:34:42,258
There's been enough killing.

1106
01:35:03,784 --> 01:35:05,775
(Cheering and applause)

1107
01:35:24,544 --> 01:35:29,095
Today the forces of occupation
have gathered at our gates.

1108
01:35:29,224 --> 01:35:31,215
(Jeering and booing)

1109
01:35:34,104 --> 01:35:37,540
And we know that this empire
is very powerful.

1110
01:35:37,664 --> 01:35:40,542
They have lots of tanks.
They have lots of planes.

1111
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:45,533
But we have something
that is more precious.

1112
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:49,259
We have the love for freedom, and
we have the love for independence!

1113
01:35:49,384 --> 01:35:51,375
(Cheering)

1114
01:35:51,504 --> 01:35:54,860
We stand here today
as one proud independent nation.

1115
01:35:54,984 --> 01:35:57,452
Just like the Finns,
just like the Czechs,

1116
01:35:57,584 --> 01:35:59,939
and just like
the Hungarians before us.

1117
01:36:02,224 --> 01:36:05,500
And we tell them today,
in front of the whole world,

1118
01:36:05,624 --> 01:36:09,094
that freedom will not retreat,
freedom will not surrender!

1119
01:36:10,544 --> 01:36:13,581
We may be besieged,
but we are not alone.

1120
01:36:13,704 --> 01:36:18,380
Standing with us here tonight
are six European presidents

1121
01:36:18,504 --> 01:36:20,813
who have travelled
thousands of miles

1122
01:36:20,944 --> 01:36:22,935
in defiance of fear and threats!

1123
01:36:24,864 --> 01:36:26,741
These six men are here

1124
01:36:26,864 --> 01:36:29,094
because they know
the issue of independence

1125
01:36:29,224 --> 01:36:31,454
is being decided here tonight!

1126
01:36:31,584 --> 01:36:33,575
(Cheering)

1127
01:36:35,224 --> 01:36:40,423
May God bless the Georgian people!
Long live a free Georgia!

1128
01:36:40,544 --> 01:36:42,535
(Cheering)

1129
01:36:47,544 --> 01:36:50,456
Georgia! Georgia! Georgia!

1130
01:36:55,264 --> 01:36:57,255
(Chanting continues)

1131
01:37:10,224 --> 01:37:12,419
(Church bells ringing)

1132
01:37:12,544 --> 01:37:14,694
They say you're gonna
make a full recovery.

1133
01:37:14,824 --> 01:37:18,658
Yeah? Six months!

1134
01:37:18,784 --> 01:37:22,572
And... our footage?

1135
01:37:22,704 --> 01:37:25,776
It's out. Human Rights Watch has it.

1136
01:37:25,904 --> 01:37:29,260
It's getting a lot of hits and
people are starting to pay attention.

1137
01:37:30,744 --> 01:37:32,700
Not bad for a loose cannon.

1138
01:37:33,464 --> 01:37:35,136
Thanks, bucko.

1139
01:37:35,264 --> 01:37:38,415
'Despite the ceasefire
and pledges to withdraw,

1140
01:37:38,544 --> 01:37:41,502
'the Russian troops and tanks
remain in Gori,

1141
01:37:41,624 --> 01:37:43,854

'and nothing but stories
of violence, looting and killings.

1146
01:37:53,344 --> 01:37:55,335
The war lasted five days.

1147

'More than 100,000 people
have lost their homes...

Several hundred people were killed,
including five reporters.

1149

'... since this war began
just nine days ago.

'People keep asking me
how can this still be happening... '

1151
01:38:06,344 --> 01:38:09,256
An estimated 50,000 people
were made homeless,

01:38:09,384 --> 01:38:12,376
their villages permanently
destroyed or occupied.

1153
01:38:12,504 --> 01:38:17,532
Many still live in refugee camps.

1154
01:38:19,424 --> 01:38:21,984
Despite demands from Europe
and the United States to withdraw,

1155
01:38:22,104 --> 01:38:24,698
the regions of South Ossetia
and Abkhazia remain occupied

1156

by Russian forces.

1157
01:38:26,864 --> 01:38:28,855
This nation is right now
fighting for its survival.

1158
01:38:28,984 --> 01:38:33,739
Georgia continues its quest
to integrate with the West.

'This is Thomas Anders
reporting in Georgia.'

My husband, Mikheil Taboshvili.
Killed in Eredvi village.

1161

My father.

My mother, Natalia Okropiridze.

1164
01:38:57,664 --> 01:39:03,022
As my parents were being evacuated
and they were crossing the road,

1165
01:39:04,184 --> 01:39:10,054
a mine exploded in front of their car and
shrapnel hit her straight in the temple.

1166
01:39:10,184 --> 01:39:12,823
She died on the spot.

Our grandmother.

My parents were tortured.
Their throats were slit.

1171
01:39:27,304 --> 01:39:32,014
They were buried in our backyard,
and that's all we know.

1172
01:39:33,784 --> 01:39:36,457
This is Nodar Otiashvili, my father.

1173
01:39:37,744 --> 01:39:41,657
We used to live
in Kvemo Achabeti village.

1174

I am the son of Socrate Gogidze.

1175
01:39:47,704 --> 01:39:52,175
I was told by the Red Cross

1176
01:39:52,304 --> 01:39:54,454
that he was buried in our garden.

1177

He had been hanged.

I am Marina Kakhbiashvili.
I used to live in Kehvi village.

On August 8th, we left.

1180
01:40:11,664 --> 01:40:15,179
My husband stayed there.
My son and my husband.

1181
01:40:15,304 --> 01:40:19,217
My son left that night.
My husband stayed in the house.
