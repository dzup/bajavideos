1
00:00:11,171 --> 00:00:12,988
Calm

2
00:00:13,227 --> 00:00:15,716
Your feel more and more calm...

3
00:00:16,444 --> 00:00:17,852
Now imagine a screen...

4
00:00:18,587 --> 00:00:21,483
A movie screen that opens before you

5
00:00:22,516 --> 00:00:24,827
Create on it any place you like

6
00:00:26,162 --> 00:00:27,634
Concentrate on your breathing

7
00:00:28,043 --> 00:00:31,090
Helping your body to relax...feel at peace

8
00:00:31,602 --> 00:00:36,194
You don't have to change it.
Just let it come and go

9
00:00:36,394 --> 00:00:39,689
Come and go...

10
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:44,233
Now...

11
00:00:44,448 --> 00:00:45,711
You are there

12
00:00:46,897 --> 00:00:48,409
Pay attention to the details

13
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:52,096
The colors

14
00:00:53,672 --> 00:00:54,992
The textures

15
00:00:56,935 --> 00:00:58,063
The light

16
00:01:00,064 --> 00:01:02,823
The temperature. Feel the temperature

17
00:01:06,206 --> 00:01:09,318
Allow this calm view to develop before you

18
00:01:12,542 --> 00:01:15,766
The feeling of peace is infinite...

19
00:01:20,494 --> 00:01:22,190
It's raining cats and dogs

20
00:01:23,004 --> 00:01:24,884
Are you sure this is closed

21
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:28,365
Are you more calm now?

22
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:31,212
Well, is not easy.
With that view I have in front

23
00:01:31,444 --> 00:01:32,420
What view?

24
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:34,939
I can see through your skirt

25
00:01:36,372 --> 00:01:39,643
You are such a pig!
You know what, I won't read you anymore.

26
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:42,802
Besides, is almost time.
I'm going to pick her up

27
00:01:42,948 --> 00:01:44,875
Ok, I’ll stand up and prepare some coffee

28
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,555
Would you like some music?

29
00:01:47,771 --> 00:01:49,090
Ok, whatever is on

30
00:01:51,323 --> 00:01:53,722
Ok, I’ll leave you with your Wagner

31
00:01:55,065 --> 00:01:55,792
See you in a while

32
00:02:31,309 --> 00:02:35,213
OUT TO SEA

33
00:02:40,508 --> 00:02:43,677
Julia, get in the car.
You're going to freeze

34
00:02:56,427 --> 00:03:00,395
You are Gené, right. I am Mark, hello

35
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:01,891
And Julia?

36
00:03:07,874 --> 00:03:09,474
It looks like Galicia doesn't like us

37
00:03:09,882 --> 00:03:11,754
Yeah, well, it's February.

38
00:03:12,946 --> 00:03:14,202
How was your flight?

39
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:16,026
Fine. We finally meet

40
00:03:16,401 --> 00:03:19,498
Would you mind coming with me in the car?

41
00:03:23,706 --> 00:03:25,637
We had agreed that only one
person would come

42
00:03:25,786 --> 00:03:26,657
Yes, of course

43
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:29,386
- And..?
- Oh, Mark? He's only here to take notes

44
00:03:29,481 --> 00:03:33,512
- Ok. Do you trust him?
- Yes. Well...he works at the firm

45
00:03:33,687 --> 00:03:37,473
Look, I’m not sure if you are aware of the step
that Ramon has to take

46
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,799
Of course I know the step Ramon has to take.
We've talked about it

47
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:43,576
Today it's you, then its the press, then it's the television.

48
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,856
Ramon is afraid that this could be taken
in the wrong direction

49
00:03:47,207 --> 00:03:51,495
All I can tell you is that I’ve
come to do things as best as possible

50
00:03:51,728 --> 00:03:52,831
I hope so...

51
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:56,135
And I remind you that for me this is really important

52
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,622
Not only professionally...

53
00:04:04,054 --> 00:04:07,077
Believe me
I understand Ramon very well

54
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:27,699
- Hello
- Hello

55
00:04:28,715 --> 00:04:29,659
My name is Julia

56
00:04:30,252 --> 00:04:31,196
You are the lawyer

57
00:04:32,243 --> 00:04:33,803
This is Manuela. Ramon's sister in law

58
00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:38,354
- Do you want help?
- No, no. It's fine

59
00:04:41,258 --> 00:04:42,547
They're here

60
00:04:51,912 --> 00:04:53,160
- Hello
- Hello

61
00:04:54,441 --> 00:04:55,729
Excuse me for not giving you my hand

62
00:04:57,544 --> 00:04:58,760
How come?

63
00:05:01,431 --> 00:05:02,776
They tell me you are a little nervous

64
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,999
- Well, let's see. The first thing is breakfast
- What time?

65
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:16,096
9:30. Don't think that I like to wake up early

66
00:05:19,502 --> 00:05:23,013
- After that, I listen to the radio for bit
- What do you like to listen to?

67
00:05:24,127 --> 00:05:28,342
- A little of everything. Mostly debates.
- You like debates?

68
00:05:29,927 --> 00:05:31,540
Yes, yes. I like the party

69
00:05:37,445 --> 00:05:41,019
See. This is my personal computer

70
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:47,316
- Did you design it?
- Yes, I like inventions.

71
00:05:47,852 --> 00:05:50,731
My father or my nephew builds them

72
00:05:54,018 --> 00:05:56,330
You are so serious all of a sudden

73
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:04,413
Why dying?

74
00:06:08,876 --> 00:06:17,476
Well, let's see. I want to die because
for me, life in this way...is not worthy

75
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:27,451
I can understand if other tetraplegic could
feel offended when I say life like this is not worthy

76
00:06:28,386 --> 00:06:31,754
But I don't judge anyone.

77
00:06:32,363 --> 00:06:36,514
Who am I to judge those that want to live?

78
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:41,689
That's why I ask not to be judged nor the
person that helps me to die

79
00:06:41,858 --> 00:06:43,458
And do you think someone is going to help you?

80
00:06:45,584 --> 00:06:51,800
Well, that would depend on the ones taking the decision.
If they manage to conquer their fears

81
00:06:53,368 --> 00:06:57,440
Is not such a big deal. Death has always been there
and always will be

82
00:06:57,999 --> 00:07:04,128
In the end we all get there. All of us.
It is a part of us

83
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:08,222
Why are they so surprised
because I say I want to die?

84
00:07:08,926 --> 00:07:11,774
As if it is contagious

85
00:07:14,286 --> 00:07:18,909
If we finally go to trial, they will ask you
why you don't seek alternatives to your disability

86
00:07:19,813 --> 00:07:22,942
Why do you reject the wheel chair?

87
00:07:23,246 --> 00:07:29,781
To accept the wheelchair would be like
accepting breadcrumbs of what used to be my freedom

88
00:07:30,028 --> 00:07:34,268
Look, you are sitting there, less than 2 meters away

89
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,812
What are 2 meters?

90
00:07:37,675 --> 00:07:40,475
An insignificant trip for any human being

91
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:53,681
Well, for me, those 2 meters, necessary to get to you
and being able to touch you, is an impossible journey...

92
00:07:53,882 --> 00:07:57,233
...a chimera, a dream

93
00:07:59,753 --> 00:08:01,705
That's why I want to die

94
00:08:03,392 --> 00:08:05,896
The three hours have passed, Ramon

95
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:07,921
She has to change my posture

96
00:08:08,392 --> 00:08:10,143
Would you mind waiting downstairs?

97
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:16,999
He called us a year ago.
He wanted us to, literally, help him die

98
00:08:19,088 --> 00:08:26,446
I told him that we could provide psychological help,
legal support. But we wouldn't put the cyanide in his mouth

99
00:08:27,543 --> 00:08:31,750
He got very mad. He called us liars.
I had to hang the phone

100
00:08:32,485 --> 00:08:36,806
A few days later he called again, more calm.
I was surprised at how decided he was

101
00:08:36,998 --> 00:08:38,894
- He has ever hesitated?
- Never

102
00:08:39,621 --> 00:08:40,989
That is very important

103
00:08:43,852 --> 00:08:45,941
- And how long has he been like this?
- 26 years

104
00:08:46,374 --> 00:08:49,765
His mother used to take care of him but
when she died, his sister in law took over

105
00:08:50,804 --> 00:08:51,892
How do you feel?

106
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,581
Fine, this arm...a little higher

107
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,003
I'm going to change the catheter

108
00:08:59,346 --> 00:09:03,659
- Not now Manuela
- Is just a moment. Let them wait

109
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:06,522
She is married to Jose, Ramon's brother

110
00:09:07,075 --> 00:09:10,562
They live of the farm and a little orchard they have

111
00:09:11,242 --> 00:09:13,802
And what do they think about this?

112
00:09:18,377 --> 00:09:19,352
Ideas are free.

113
00:09:20,704 --> 00:09:23,191
But I think that is not right

114
00:09:25,456 --> 00:09:26,344
But why not?

115
00:09:27,391 --> 00:09:30,815
I want what's best for him.
Everyone in this house wants that

116
00:09:33,655 --> 00:09:35,255
Then why would he want to die?

117
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:37,429
I cannot get that into my head

118
00:09:37,605 --> 00:09:38,934
Is not rational, as he says

119
00:09:41,569 --> 00:09:47,923
I cannot give it to him and I don't give my
authorization to do it in this house

120
00:09:56,831 --> 00:09:58,840
Hello

121
00:10:01,846 --> 00:10:04,607
- Don't leave that there Javi!
- Oh come on mom!

122
00:10:04,957 --> 00:10:06,294
Take it to your room

123
00:10:08,886 --> 00:10:10,606
Your uncle wants you to check the machine

124
00:10:13,093 --> 00:10:14,557
- The bag...
- Yes!

125
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:23,901
- What's wrong?
- The roller is a little stuck

126
00:10:29,732 --> 00:10:32,555
- Didn't you have exam today?
- No. And the lawyer

127
00:10:35,682 --> 00:10:38,753
She is with Gené and grandpa.
He took them to the beach

128
00:10:39,067 --> 00:10:42,818
They might end up in Corunna.
With that head of him

129
00:10:43,665 --> 00:10:45,738
Don't talk like that about your grandfather

130
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,466
His mind is completely gone

131
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,257
Of course, he is old, what do you want?

132
00:10:50,433 --> 00:10:52,465
Well, that he stays out of the way

133
00:10:52,901 --> 00:10:54,197
He is all day at home...

134
00:10:55,284 --> 00:10:56,414
As if we needed him.

135
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:04,996
What

136
00:11:11,491 --> 00:11:15,011
Look, one day...I don't know when,
maybe in a long time...

137
00:11:15,267 --> 00:11:21,667
One day you are going to regret so much, so much what you just said.
That you will want the ground to swallow you

138
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:28,078
- But why?
- One day, you'll see. One day...

139
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:37,261
Here the ocean is very treacherous.
Those who dare bathe in it, have to be very careful

140
00:11:38,726 --> 00:11:40,494
My son jumped from here.

141
00:11:41,182 --> 00:11:42,797
I don't know what he was thinking.

142
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:55,053
He jumped exactly when the water was receding
and he hit his neck against the sand

143
00:11:56,854 --> 00:12:02,982
This is very very sad.

144
00:12:06,045 --> 00:12:10,677
God wants him to keep on living.

145
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:13,763
But you know that he doesn't want to live anymore

146
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:20,219
But, he never told me anything,
he never told me...he never told me anything

147
00:13:12,915 --> 00:13:19,873
Look, we will win Heaven, because
we have spent our whole lives in Hell

148
00:13:23,016 --> 00:13:32,287
I tape this image so the judges or politicians
or whoever has to decide

149
00:13:33,664 --> 00:13:34,945
understand better...

150
00:13:35,912 --> 00:13:43,623
Apparently they can't identify with the psychological pain of the person,
then maybe this way they'll understand that this is not life

151
00:13:43,984 --> 00:13:46,174
Why do you smile so much Ramon?

152
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:50,614
When you can't escape and depend
constantly on others

153
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:56,101
You learn to cry by laughing

154
00:14:31,824 --> 00:14:33,954
Good morning

155
00:14:34,266 --> 00:14:36,970
- Does Ramon Sampedro lives here?
- Yes, what do you want?

156
00:14:38,905 --> 00:14:42,088
I was taking a ride and thought
about visiting him

157
00:14:43,713 --> 00:14:45,665
I heard lots of people come to see him

158
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,648
Ok

159
00:14:54,543 --> 00:14:55,582
Just a little while

160
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,246
My name is Rosa

161
00:15:07,118 --> 00:15:08,077
Come closer

162
00:15:18,445 --> 00:15:19,244
Where are you from?

163
00:15:19,566 --> 00:15:22,037
Boiro. I came on my bike

164
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,292
Oh God, I feel like such a fool

165
00:15:31,956 --> 00:15:35,737
- Why?
- Well, because I don't know what to say. Since I don't know you

166
00:15:36,764 --> 00:15:42,954
Don't worry about that. I can't do anything else.
Please, have a seat.

167
00:15:48,106 --> 00:15:49,210
Why did you came?

168
00:15:54,168 --> 00:15:58,665
You're not making it easy.
What do you do?

169
00:15:59,311 --> 00:16:00,688
I work in a conserve factory

170
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,199
and I’m also a radio host at Radio Boiro,
Wednesdays and Fridays

171
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:08,079
- So, maybe I’ve heard you sometime
- Yes?

172
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:15,183
- But is only an amateur thing... - No,
you are pretty good - Yes, apparently, eh?

173
00:16:16,469 --> 00:16:20,205
The thing is to get started, after
that no one can stop me

174
00:16:20,421 --> 00:16:22,725
- I have 2 little sons
- Your husband?

175
00:16:16,462 --> 00:16:32,572
Let's see. I had a boyfriend, the
father of my youngest son...

176
00:16:32,917 --> 00:16:37,644
but he also left me...we left him.
So now I’m alone but happy

177
00:16:38,391 --> 00:16:42,398
I was asking in case I had any chance...

178
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,093
Why do you laugh?

179
00:16:51,908 --> 00:16:53,190
Sorry...

180
00:16:54,076 --> 00:16:55,556
It's ok, I was joking

181
00:16:57,085 --> 00:17:01,212
Besides, I don't think I’d be willing to take on
two children, I have enough with my nephew

182
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,636
I saw you on TV the other day

183
00:17:06,387 --> 00:17:08,444
hmmm...see, now we are getting closer

184
00:17:10,483 --> 00:17:11,555
Closer to what?

185
00:17:11,786 --> 00:17:13,523
To the reason why you came

186
00:17:15,322 --> 00:17:20,522
I heard what you said and then I saw your
eyes, that are really pretty

187
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:21,267
Thanks

188
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:26,658
And I thought, those eyes full of life!
Why would someone with those eyes want to die

189
00:17:27,976 --> 00:17:31,986
Look, we all have problems sometimes and
we don't have to run away of them, you know?

190
00:17:32,392 --> 00:17:38,360
- No, I don't run away of my problems...
- Yes, of course you do. That's why I wanted to come

191
00:17:38,664 --> 00:17:40,080
What for?

192
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,327
To give you reasons to live

193
00:17:46,063 --> 00:17:50,471
- To tell you that life...
- Life what?

194
00:17:55,398 --> 00:17:56,630
Is worth it

195
00:17:59,726 --> 00:18:04,709
Let's see, did you came here to
see me or to convince me?

196
00:18:04,893 --> 00:18:07,012
No, I came because I want to
be your friend Ramon

197
00:18:07,557 --> 00:18:10,365
If you want to be my friend, Rosa,
you should start by respecting my will

198
00:18:13,716 --> 00:18:14,803
How can you be so closed?

199
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:18,724
Don't judge me. Don't judge me Rosa.
Not in my own house

200
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:21,212
Or do you want me to judge you?

201
00:18:22,228 --> 00:18:26,979
Do you want me to judge you?
Why don't we talk about the real reason you came

202
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:31,906
Why don't we talk about the fact that you are
clearly a frustrated woman...

203
00:18:32,427 --> 00:18:35,762
that woke up this Saturday looking for
ways of giving reason to your own life

204
00:18:39,747 --> 00:18:41,994
Yes, run. You that can.

205
00:18:49,443 --> 00:18:52,394
Thanks a lot.
So you don't want me to put you anything?

206
00:18:52,641 --> 00:18:55,810
- No, dear. Just stay as cheerful. Good night
- Good night

207
00:18:57,002 --> 00:19:00,891
Well, it's 8:45 and here we are at Radio Boiro.

208
00:19:01,146 --> 00:19:04,810
I remind you that you can call
and request your favorite song

209
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:13,920
Before I continue...I would like to dedicate the
next song to someone that maybe is listening tonight

210
00:19:14,792 --> 00:19:16,919
I know he listens to the radio a lot

211
00:19:19,527 --> 00:19:22,631
I would love it for him to call me someday
and ask for a song

212
00:19:23,336 --> 00:19:28,291
Although I know he won't because...the last time
we saw each other we didn't end up in good terms

213
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:31,862
But for what it's worth,
I’d like to tell him I'm sorry

214
00:19:32,726 --> 00:19:36,918
I'm sorry I judged you Ramon, I am
such a fool and I can't help it

215
00:19:37,773 --> 00:19:44,510
Enough...for you my friend, Ramon,
"Negra Sombra" (Black Shadow)

216
00:20:14,915 --> 00:20:16,896
- Yes?
- Hello

217
00:20:17,087 --> 00:20:18,736
Gené! How are you?

218
00:20:18,936 --> 00:20:23,144
Well, still at the office.
You are giving us too much work, Ramon

219
00:20:23,879 --> 00:20:24,847
I'm just kidding

220
00:20:25,949 --> 00:20:29,623
Hey, the report was spectacular.
We have received a lot of support calls

221
00:20:29,926 --> 00:20:33,078
- This will be really great for the trial
- If you say so...

222
00:20:33,518 --> 00:20:38,416
Oh, come on! You have to improve that mood,
otherwise we won't be able to do anything

223
00:20:38,617 --> 00:20:41,207
- You knew we had to do this.
- Yes, I know, I know

224
00:20:41,704 --> 00:20:47,599
Julia, the lawyer, wants to see you again
and this time for longer

225
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:50,111
Has she fallen in love with me?

226
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,191
You wish handsome!
besides, she is married

227
00:20:53,407 --> 00:20:56,381
No, she says she needs to know you
better to prepare the case

228
00:20:56,614 --> 00:20:58,703
That's what they all say

229
00:20:59,014 --> 00:21:03,413
Wait...
2 minutes and I’m there

230
00:21:03,685 --> 00:21:09,293
Hey, did you know that the guy that came
with her wants to go out with me

231
00:21:11,589 --> 00:21:14,716
- Are you leaving me for a lawyer?
- No

232
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,820
You are missing on it

233
00:22:28,997 --> 00:22:30,316
I see it quite well

234
00:22:31,012 --> 00:22:31,765
Your leg

235
00:22:33,571 --> 00:22:34,676
Well, yes..it moves

236
00:22:35,644 --> 00:22:40,972
Let's see...this is going to be easy.
You only need to answer with your heart

237
00:22:41,499 --> 00:22:42,668
With the head, you mean..

238
00:22:44,203 --> 00:22:46,067
With the head.
You don't mind if I record it, right?

239
00:22:51,771 --> 00:22:53,658
Let's begin with your youth, before your accident.

240
00:22:55,226 --> 00:22:56,329
What did you do then?

241
00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:00,065
Is that necessary?
I had forgot all about it.

242
00:23:01,778 --> 00:23:03,058
Is your memory that bad?

243
00:23:03,657 --> 00:23:08,160
No. I just thought we would talk about
my suicide demand

244
00:23:10,721 --> 00:23:14,065
We will Ramon. Is just that is very important
that the judge identifies with you

245
00:23:14,783 --> 00:23:16,079
and that he understands you.

246
00:23:16,632 --> 00:23:19,599
For that I need to know who is
Ramon Sampedro and who he was

247
00:23:22,287 --> 00:23:24,551
That way, you will use it against me later.

248
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,470
You are such a Galician!

249
00:23:29,287 --> 00:23:31,686
- I'm your lawyer, I’m on your side
- Ok

250
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:41,757
When I was 19, I packed my things and
I went around the world

251
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:45,646
I was doing that for a couple of years,
until the accident

252
00:23:46,517 --> 00:23:49,845
Wait, wait. You went around the world with
only 20 years?

253
00:23:50,525 --> 00:23:52,700
You just don't know how.
Ship mechanic.

254
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:57,452
I always tell my nephew.
To travel without money, become a sailor.

255
00:24:00,908 --> 00:24:01,643
What?

256
00:24:02,035 --> 00:24:03,251
Looking for proof?

257
00:24:04,363 --> 00:24:06,878
No, is that I can't see a single picture
of you around here

258
00:24:08,051 --> 00:24:09,387
How were you in your younger years?

259
00:24:10,027 --> 00:24:13,001
Why? Am I so ugly now, or what?

260
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:18,536
Ok, I won't ask you anything else. That's it

261
00:24:24,969 --> 00:24:26,385
You don't like looking into the past, right?

262
00:24:26,618 --> 00:24:28,777
Of course not, I look into the future.

263
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:34,215
- And what is the future for you?
- Death, just like for you

264
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,704
Don't you think about death?
I'm not the only one who thinks about it.

265
00:24:40,976 --> 00:24:42,998
Yes, yes. Of course I think about it

266
00:24:45,218 --> 00:24:47,513
I just try that it doesn't become
my only thought

267
00:24:58,457 --> 00:25:00,032
Tomorrow is going to rain

268
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,143
Tomorrow is going to rain

269
00:25:23,094 --> 00:25:24,405
I think he whistled

270
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:28,108
- I didn't hear a thing
- Yes, he did

271
00:25:38,324 --> 00:25:41,357
- What do you want?
- The game already started

272
00:25:42,331 --> 00:25:44,380
But you know I don't like soccer

273
00:25:45,964 --> 00:25:47,331
Why don't you watch it downstairs

274
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:54,706
Hey, if you want to convince me
you need to give me a rational justification

275
00:26:05,066 --> 00:26:06,154
The "Depor" is playing

276
00:26:08,537 --> 00:26:10,544
That is not a rational justification

277
00:26:11,441 --> 00:26:13,521
- But it is important
- Why?

278
00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:17,673
Because it is decisive for the league.
If they loose this one, they can only make it to second place

279
00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:21,408
OK, turn it on

280
00:26:26,248 --> 00:26:28,201
- Can you see?
- Yes

281
00:26:37,624 --> 00:26:39,172
Did you hear him whistle too?

282
00:26:42,932 --> 00:26:45,075
Ramon told me you asked about the pictures

283
00:26:46,147 --> 00:26:46,828
Yes

284
00:26:47,931 --> 00:26:49,623
There's gotta be one somewhere

285
00:26:50,363 --> 00:26:51,331
I'll look for them tomorrow

286
00:26:51,425 --> 00:26:52,744
Thanks

287
00:26:54,408 --> 00:26:56,465
If you need more blankets, look in the closet

288
00:26:58,387 --> 00:27:00,267
In June, it is still cold at night

289
00:27:00,916 --> 00:27:01,659
Manuela...

290
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:07,564
- No, no, no
- Yes, yes, yes

291
00:27:08,147 --> 00:27:09,674
I cannot accept this, I can't

292
00:27:09,906 --> 00:27:13,177
Manuela, I’m going to stay a couple of days.
The least I can do is contribute with something

293
00:27:13,419 --> 00:27:15,438
But added to the fact that you are
doing it for free

294
00:27:17,509 --> 00:27:20,756
I'm doing this because I want to.
Manuela, please...

295
00:27:22,428 --> 00:27:26,380
Ok. Anything that you need, please let me know

296
00:27:27,933 --> 00:27:28,626
Thanks

297
00:27:29,668 --> 00:27:31,243
What are you plotting over there?

298
00:27:31,963 --> 00:27:32,731
Nothing

299
00:27:36,883 --> 00:27:38,907
It's a shame you can't see the sea from here

300
00:27:39,634 --> 00:27:40,770
Is better like that

301
00:27:42,683 --> 00:27:44,962
That way I can see it when I want to

302
00:27:46,522 --> 00:27:47,913
How come?

303
00:27:50,938 --> 00:27:57,120
When I want to, I concentrate and
take a step to the sea

304
00:27:58,521 --> 00:27:59,584
Flying

305
00:28:00,209 --> 00:28:02,128
I imagine that the sea means a lot to you

306
00:28:04,136 --> 00:28:05,998
Well, the sea gave me life and
then took it away

307
00:28:07,007 --> 00:28:08,599
I don't know if that means anything

308
00:28:11,808 --> 00:28:14,319
Give me some details about that day.
The day that your life changed, ok?

309
00:28:15,407 --> 00:28:16,215
Whatever you say.

310
00:28:17,184 --> 00:28:18,728
Ok, first...

311
00:28:20,744 --> 00:28:22,071
...when did it happen?

312
00:28:23,025 --> 00:28:24,849
August 23rd of '68

313
00:28:26,655 --> 00:28:33,591
- You still lived with your parents?
- Yes. I was still a kid

314
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:42,503
- Were you alone at the beach that day?
- No, I was with some friends, town's folk

315
00:28:45,654 --> 00:28:50,085
But how is it that someone so familiar with the sea
didn't calculate the receding

316
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:54,557
I was distracted

317
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,693
Distracted?

318
00:28:58,708 --> 00:29:02,300
Yes, I was thinking about things

319
00:29:05,515 --> 00:29:06,516
And?

320
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:28,689
Ok. Leave it alone. It doesn't matter

321
00:29:29,584 --> 00:29:31,521
I can see you don't want to
talk about it either

322
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,512
No. I'm just remembering

323
00:29:54,155 --> 00:29:59,102
When I realized I was in the air,
jumping on an almost empty pool

324
00:30:08,269 --> 00:30:13,334
- Were you left unconscious?
- No. I was just there...face down

325
00:30:14,053 --> 00:30:15,245
Floating

326
00:30:19,356 --> 00:30:21,868
You know is true what they say about those
that are about to die

327
00:30:22,076 --> 00:30:25,988
that all of a sudden you get to see the
most important moments of your life

328
00:30:26,748 --> 00:30:27,851
That happened to me

329
00:30:30,715 --> 00:30:32,011
And what did you see?

330
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:37,524
They say that those that drown, after all the
air has been expelled, die instantly

331
00:31:38,301 --> 00:31:41,997
A sweet death.
I should have died then

332
00:31:56,907 --> 00:32:00,739
- Do you still see all this people?
- Some I do, some I don't

333
00:32:03,962 --> 00:32:08,098
- Who is this girl?
- Some girl

334
00:32:11,312 --> 00:32:13,762
Well, she appears in many pictures

335
00:32:18,118 --> 00:32:20,741
She lived in the town.
Can I have a puff?

336
00:32:22,028 --> 00:32:25,531
- Do you smoke?
- From time to time in case it kills me

337
00:32:26,123 --> 00:32:27,356
but nothing...

338
00:32:35,308 --> 00:32:39,932
- She was my girlfriend
- Your girlfriend? And what happened to her?

339
00:32:43,749 --> 00:32:51,023
There was a time when she used to go to the hospital.
One day she said something foolish about getting married

340
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:59,429
And I told her to get out of there, try to resume her
life the best way she could and that she should forget about me

341
00:33:02,198 --> 00:33:03,628
But, did you love her?

342
00:33:05,389 --> 00:33:06,653
That was not the issue

343
00:33:10,053 --> 00:33:11,173
How come?

344
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:16,787
The issue was if I wanted to love her in this condition

345
00:33:18,756 --> 00:33:20,604
Are you telling me you refuse to love because...

346
00:33:22,364 --> 00:33:23,876
Because I can't love

347
00:33:24,595 --> 00:33:25,834
Just like that

348
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:34,738
So, what I have to tell the judge is that, in your opinion,
tetraplegics have no right to fall in love

349
00:33:34,962 --> 00:33:41,450
But who's talking about tetraplegics?
I'm talking about me, Ramon Sampedro

350
00:33:52,345 --> 00:33:54,217
There are other ways of making love

351
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,664
Yes of course

352
00:34:02,015 --> 00:34:04,688
Has any girl kissed you in the past 27 years?

353
00:34:09,479 --> 00:34:12,022
Now you are going to show me how, no?

354
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,838
- The girl from Borio is here
- The girl from Borio?

355
00:34:20,874 --> 00:34:23,645
- Christian, I told you to come here
- Rosa!

356
00:34:24,661 --> 00:34:26,684
- Hi Ramon
- I told you to come here!

357
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:30,612
Leave him, it's ok.
Are you good or bad?

358
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:35,941
- Bad.
- Then we will get along fine

359
00:34:36,668 --> 00:34:38,461
- I'm Julia
- I'm Rosa, nice to meet you

360
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:40,388
I'm sorry to have interrupted you

361
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:43,564
I'll go for a while and leave you alone

362
00:34:49,467 --> 00:34:51,899
- How are you?
- Fine

363
00:34:52,339 --> 00:34:55,991
I hope you are not here to give me some of
those reasons to live you always bring

364
00:34:56,452 --> 00:34:59,401
No. No way.
Well, I don't know...

365
00:35:00,112 --> 00:35:02,850
I wanted to see you.
And wanted you to meet my sons

366
00:35:03,113 --> 00:35:04,026
That's better

367
00:35:05,936 --> 00:35:10,360
Christian, behave yourself.
We are not at home.

368
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:13,464
This is Samuel.
Sami, say hello

369
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,016
Hi, Sami.

370
00:35:19,136 --> 00:35:22,519
- Why are you in bed?
- Because he can't move, I already explained it to you

371
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:24,968
Is it true you can't feel a thing?

372
00:35:29,221 --> 00:35:33,086
What happens to you now?
Are you hot?

373
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:36,150
Is just that with this weather you never know.

374
00:35:36,813 --> 00:35:44,013
We are on strike because there's been a month
since they paid us. So it's like Sunday for us

375
00:35:44,365 --> 00:35:48,812
I made the breakfast, we took the bus
and we came to see you

376
00:35:52,045 --> 00:35:53,235
- What happened?
- Nothing

377
00:35:56,795 --> 00:35:58,635
Samuel, why are you crying now?

378
00:36:01,243 --> 00:36:01,915
Manuela...

379
00:36:05,818 --> 00:36:07,851
What do you think about all this?
Tell me the truth

380
00:36:09,003 --> 00:36:10,386
What do I think about what?

381
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:15,769
That your brother in law wants to die

382
00:36:17,465 --> 00:36:18,705
That’s what he wants

383
00:36:20,649 --> 00:36:21,433
Ok, but...

384
00:36:24,394 --> 00:36:28,608
...but you. What would you want?
What would you prefer?

385
00:36:30,145 --> 00:36:32,393
What I prefer has no importance

386
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:36,127
Ramon wants to die.
Everything is quite clear for me

387
00:36:38,992 --> 00:36:42,304
- Would you like to see a thing?
- A thing?

388
00:36:43,446 --> 00:36:44,638
Yes, come

389
00:36:50,555 --> 00:36:53,403
- Christian, leave that alone
- Leave me alone!

390
00:36:54,347 --> 00:36:56,178
I'm going to leave your ass like
a ripe tomato

391
00:37:18,601 --> 00:37:20,048
Almost all of them are poems

392
00:37:24,104 --> 00:37:25,625
I never threw anything away

393
00:37:26,281 --> 00:37:29,896
I couldn't do it.
It takes a lot of effort for him to write them

394
00:37:30,055 --> 00:37:31,913
And his handwriting...
Look...

395
00:37:35,623 --> 00:37:37,687
I never saw such a beautiful handwriting

396
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:45,702
- Ok. I'll be downstairs
- Manuela

397
00:37:47,151 --> 00:37:48,926
Is going to take me a while to read all of this

398
00:37:49,174 --> 00:37:53,286
- Would you mind telling Ramon that...
- That you went to the beach

399
00:37:54,765 --> 00:37:57,389
- ...to take a walk
- Thanks

400
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:08,573
Of course it is the first and the
last time I bring you here

401
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:11,340
- But mom, that guy is faking it
- The last time!

402
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:22,045
- Did she tell you when would she be back?
- Just to take a walk

403
00:38:22,821 --> 00:38:24,413
That way you can take a nap

404
00:38:26,438 --> 00:38:29,276
- You can't complain
- Why?

405
00:38:31,363 --> 00:38:35,316
Not a minute passes by that a woman
comes into this house. Are you building a harem?

406
00:38:38,419 --> 00:38:42,130
Manuela, you know I’m only married to one

407
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,971
Yes, with Death

408
00:39:01,928 --> 00:39:03,808
- Do you want anything else?
- No

409
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:28,748
They told me you were here.
And I came flying

410
00:43:31,847 --> 00:43:32,998
Manuela...

411
00:43:43,951 --> 00:43:44,957
Hi

412
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:48,380
How was the walk?

413
00:43:50,101 --> 00:43:51,389
I've been reading Ramon

414
00:43:53,044 --> 00:43:55,069
I've been reading all that you have done.

415
00:43:57,588 --> 00:43:58,820
You know what?

416
00:44:02,667 --> 00:44:03,838
What you have written...

417
00:44:06,221 --> 00:44:07,293
...is wonderful

418
00:44:10,484 --> 00:44:13,820
So...you are not only a lawyer,
but also a writer

419
00:44:15,742 --> 00:44:17,180
Ok. Make fun of me.

420
00:44:18,371 --> 00:44:19,915
But I tell you that this can be published

421
00:44:20,211 --> 00:44:23,658
Of course it can be published.
Nowadays you can publish almost anything

422
00:44:24,618 --> 00:44:26,715
I don't see a better way to support your demand

423
00:44:29,811 --> 00:44:30,587
Is your voice

424
00:44:33,209 --> 00:44:38,408
Look Julia, this was more clear
at the beginning

425
00:44:39,817 --> 00:44:44,814
You came here with a purpose, to help me

426
00:44:45,838 --> 00:44:51,486
Instead of that, you start questioning everything.
Looking for reasons...

427
00:44:52,413 --> 00:44:56,045
You get inside my feelings...

428
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,051
Do you want me to leave?

429
00:45:10,635 --> 00:45:15,179
What I want right now is a cigarette, please

430
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:20,882
Sure.

431
00:45:24,801 --> 00:45:25,946
I'll go get them

432
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:07,746
Julia, what happened?

433
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:14,709
Are you alright?

434
00:46:20,564 --> 00:46:21,597
Manuela!

435
00:46:43,314 --> 00:46:48,545
Is not about what happened,
but about what could happen.

436
00:46:51,129 --> 00:46:55,929
Because...one day...is the legs

437
00:46:56,144 --> 00:46:59,908
But on another day...

438
00:47:01,724 --> 00:47:04,644
...you can go blind

439
00:47:07,077 --> 00:47:08,475
And you can get better or not

440
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:11,740
I had been lucky so far

441
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:16,723
but then comes the next stroke

442
00:47:18,387 --> 00:47:21,331
and the next, and the next

443
00:47:21,898 --> 00:47:24,562
and no one can tell you when
or how they are going to be

444
00:47:24,874 --> 00:47:27,962
No one can tell what is going
to be left of you if anything at all

445
00:47:29,929 --> 00:47:31,209
Your husband is very optimistic

446
00:47:33,833 --> 00:47:37,537
And what is it good for?
If there's not even medication for this

447
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:46,975
What's the point of standing up, working, getting your
hopes up if at the end comes the next stroke and you fall again

448
00:47:47,215 --> 00:47:48,903
and you feel again like shit

449
00:47:50,142 --> 00:47:51,613
Is ridiculous

450
00:47:55,974 --> 00:47:58,157
I called you because I want
to become a member of DMD

451
00:48:04,302 --> 00:48:07,148
I had thought about it 2 years
ago when I was diagnosed

452
00:48:09,323 --> 00:48:10,867
but I backed out at the last moment

453
00:48:11,811 --> 00:48:12,930
But not after this...

454
00:48:15,603 --> 00:48:16,602
...not after this.

455
00:48:17,659 --> 00:48:19,466
I can't take it anymore.
This isn't life

456
00:48:26,898 --> 00:48:28,057
Does your husband know?

457
00:48:31,064 --> 00:48:32,705
- I don't know if I want to tell him
- You should

458
00:48:37,112 --> 00:48:39,850
Fear is a very powerful weapon.

459
00:48:42,391 --> 00:48:44,640
Fear doesn't give you freedom to decide

460
00:48:45,473 --> 00:48:48,055
What you are telling me right now
is a product of that fear

461
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:53,575
Maybe, later, you will back out,
precisely out of fear

462
00:48:54,176 --> 00:48:56,254
Do not act based on fear.

463
00:48:56,322 --> 00:48:59,346
You are supposed to support people
that want to commit suicide, right?

464
00:48:59,461 --> 00:49:00,414
No.

465
00:49:03,325 --> 00:49:09,105
Do you think that I go around telling people with problems
that the best is to get out of the way

466
00:49:10,149 --> 00:49:16,984
No. What we support is freedom.
The freedom of those that want to live and those that want to die

467
00:49:17,092 --> 00:49:18,317
Is very different

468
00:49:19,396 --> 00:49:24,419
And CADASIL is a very fucked up disease, I agree

469
00:49:26,508 --> 00:49:29,100
But I only ask that you think it a little bit more

470
00:49:36,147 --> 00:49:37,452
Ramon, gave me this for you

471
00:49:45,789 --> 00:49:48,914
If you want, we can talk some other day about this

472
00:49:59,808 --> 00:50:00,823
How do you see her?

473
00:50:02,616 --> 00:50:03,616
Fine

474
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:08,087
Really?
I also think she is fine

475
00:50:09,416 --> 00:50:13,791
- Ok. Nice to meet you
- Thanks for coming

476
00:50:14,407 --> 00:50:14,999
You are welcome

477
00:50:15,571 --> 00:50:17,710
- I'll stay a while longer
- OK

478
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:36,844
Dear Julia...When Gené told me that a lawyer wanted my case

479
00:50:38,356 --> 00:50:40,949
there was something that
influenced my decision

480
00:50:41,573 --> 00:50:44,954
and it was the fact that the lawyer
suffered a degenerative disease

481
00:50:45,683 --> 00:50:48,587
I thought that only someone in that
condition could really understand mine

482
00:50:50,042 --> 00:50:51,170
And shared my hell

483
00:50:51,635 --> 00:50:57,514
Now I know that living in that hell is sometimes
worth it, if one gets to meet people like you

484
00:51:01,034 --> 00:51:03,681
Is worth it to have shared a cigarette with them

485
00:51:04,226 --> 00:51:08,089
or, like right now, caressing them even if its just
by writing some foolishness like this

486
00:51:08,529 --> 00:51:10,968
And talking about foolishness,
I'm correcting my writings

487
00:51:11,537 --> 00:51:13,840
With the hope that you will come soon
and give me a hand

488
00:51:14,197 --> 00:51:17,751
For now, my nephew Javi is helping me
by copying them on his computer

489
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:21,146
For the rest, life continues just the same, you know

490
00:51:21,802 --> 00:51:25,462
Manuela kept the whole month covering me
so next year doesn't catch me off guard

491
00:51:26,106 --> 00:51:31,729
Javi keeps fighting with his grandpa and sometimes
I make up little chores so they spend more time together

492
00:51:31,961 --> 00:51:36,256
This month some friends came to visit.
Some of them have been doing it for 25 years

493
00:51:36,705 --> 00:51:38,601
and that keeps surprising me

494
00:51:39,025 --> 00:51:40,961
They enjoy telling me their stories

495
00:51:42,287 --> 00:51:44,351
Do you remember Rosa?
The girl from the conserve factory.

496
00:51:44,696 --> 00:51:46,400
I think she found here some kind of refuge

497
00:51:46,743 --> 00:51:50,830
The other day she wanted to help Manuela to
change my clothes, and they ended up arguing

498
00:51:51,111 --> 00:51:56,869
I proved again that when you depend on someone
for everything, you lose your privacy

499
00:51:57,183 --> 00:52:03,583
Well...I hope to keep my little kingdom in order
until you can cheer me up with your presence

500
00:52:04,094 --> 00:52:04,870
A big hug.

501
00:52:13,293 --> 00:52:13,981
What's going on?

502
00:52:15,388 --> 00:52:16,541
Let's see. What does it say here?

503
00:52:18,914 --> 00:52:21,497
"No es asi la vida que va" (The life that goes is not like that)

504
00:52:21,658 --> 00:52:25,610
No sir. It has to say
"No es así la vida. Qué va" (Life is not like that. No way)

505
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:28,549
- No
- Yes. And that "Qué" has accent

506
00:52:28,805 --> 00:52:31,789
That "Qué" has accent. Do you see it?
Right there.

507
00:52:33,116 --> 00:52:35,981
"Death is my friend,"
where's the colon?

508
00:52:37,109 --> 00:52:39,325
What are they teaching you in school?

509
00:52:40,172 --> 00:52:41,995
You have to pay attention to what I give you

510
00:52:42,963 --> 00:52:44,688
Even your grandpa would do it better

511
00:52:46,131 --> 00:52:49,202
Look Javi, if this is the way you are going to help
I rather you didn't do it, ok?

512
00:52:49,626 --> 00:52:51,196
Because you make me work twice

513
00:52:54,771 --> 00:52:56,739
Give me the stick.
Give me the stick

514
00:52:58,028 --> 00:53:00,330
Put a little more attention, ok?

515
00:53:11,618 --> 00:53:13,849
- Javi, what happened?
- Nothing

516
00:53:31,696 --> 00:53:34,607
Dear Ramon...please forgive me for taking so
long in answering your letter

517
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:40,846
But the doctors have limited me the use of the computer
and in general, any activity that doesn't make me use my legs

518
00:53:41,813 --> 00:53:45,565
They assure me that I’ll be able to walk again
but they say that I shouldn't continue with your case

519
00:53:47,429 --> 00:53:50,021
In the physical therapy room there's a huge window

520
00:53:51,108 --> 00:53:55,349
Sometimes I imagine that I go through it and fly,
like you, over Barcelona

521
00:53:55,988 --> 00:53:59,909
I reach the sea and keep flying until I can only
see that endless line of water

522
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:07,204
And think, foolish me, that if you do the same
from Corunna, maybe you'll go around the world again

523
00:54:07,555 --> 00:54:10,731
And we end up finding each other in
some part of the planet

524
00:54:12,851 --> 00:54:16,203
I identify with you when you mention
the lack of freedom and privacy

525
00:54:17,162 --> 00:54:21,135
I try to bear with it, mainly for my husband
that takes care of me with much dedication

526
00:54:22,034 --> 00:54:24,801
But at the same time, I refuse to fall
into this inertia

527
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:29,646
where I just can be grateful for what is given because
I have no other choice but to accept it

528
00:54:29,778 --> 00:54:31,697
I wish I’ll be able to see you in a couple of months

529
00:54:31,929 --> 00:54:33,985
And I keep my promise of helping you
with the book

530
00:54:34,378 --> 00:54:38,888
Until then receive the thanks and
a hug from a very good friend

531
00:54:42,771 --> 00:54:47,402
I knew this could happen, I knew it.
We are going to have to try again

532
00:54:47,906 --> 00:54:50,570
No Mark, how can you say
that we have to try again?

533
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:03,965
As if justice is so swift in
this country

534
00:55:07,703 --> 00:55:10,408
No. And now it is me the one
that has to tell him

535
00:55:28,177 --> 00:55:34,938
The demand of the tetraplegic Ramon Sampedro requesting the euthanasia
was rejected yesterday by the tribunals due to defects in its form

536
00:55:35,205 --> 00:55:38,809
The sentence says that the judicial process
should have been started in Corunna

537
00:55:39,393 --> 00:55:42,394
where he resides, and not in Barcelona

538
00:55:42,848 --> 00:55:49,062
Many voices have been raised due to this case
among them is priest's Francisco de Galdar

539
00:55:49,318 --> 00:55:50,592
tetraplegic like Ramon

540
00:55:51,176 --> 00:55:54,526
Ramon says he doesn't want to
live anymore, but I wonder

541
00:55:55,295 --> 00:56:02,957
isn't it possible that Ramon is asking of society,
of all of us, some kind of attention

542
00:56:03,374 --> 00:56:04,613
What is he talking about?

543
00:56:05,222 --> 00:56:10,741
Maybe is that the people that surround him doesn't
provide the love or support that he needs

544
00:56:11,549 --> 00:56:12,405
That moron

545
00:56:13,213 --> 00:56:16,532
Couldn’t it be possible that what Ramon is
asking is for more love?

546
00:56:17,293 --> 00:56:24,520
I would really like to talk to him and convince him
that there are many reasons to keep on living

547
00:56:25,587 --> 00:56:27,035
Aren't you going to school?

548
00:56:36,746 --> 00:56:38,179
I hope you are happy now!

549
00:56:39,626 --> 00:56:41,010
Our whole family humiliated
on television

550
00:56:43,747 --> 00:56:47,202
But keep it up, keep it up.
Until our faces fall out of embarrassment

551
00:56:48,441 --> 00:56:50,345
And you dad? Aren't you going to tell him anything?

552
00:56:50,761 --> 00:56:54,149
Don't involve dad in this.
Whatever you have to tell me, do it and be done with it

553
00:57:02,995 --> 00:57:06,136
I'm going to tell you something Ramon.
I am the older brother

554
00:57:06,208 --> 00:57:08,228
Listen to me, listen to me for a moment

555
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:10,344
What if you have an accident tomorrow
and you die?

556
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:14,910
Have you thought about it?

557
00:57:15,919 --> 00:57:19,518
What would happen to me?
I would have to take care of the family, right?

558
00:57:20,343 --> 00:57:24,574
Of your wife, your son, dad...
With that miserable pension of mine

559
00:57:25,726 --> 00:57:29,397
If I stay alive, I’ll make
things a lot more difficult

560
00:57:30,942 --> 00:57:34,878
I'm going to tell you something Ramon.
I am the older brother

561
00:57:35,133 --> 00:57:39,796
I am the older here. And while I’m alive,
no one is getting killed here

562
00:57:40,347 --> 00:57:43,340
No one in this house is getting killed.
Put that in your head, Ramon

563
00:57:43,763 --> 00:57:44,707
No one!

564
00:58:11,994 --> 00:58:15,752
- Ok, son. I'll leave
- See you tomorrow dad

565
00:58:35,335 --> 00:58:36,367
I'll go

566
00:58:39,351 --> 00:58:40,895
Hi Manuela, I came to see Ramon

567
00:58:41,387 --> 00:58:43,278
But, do you know what time it is?

568
00:58:43,526 --> 00:58:46,445
I know. I couldn't come sooner.
I'll explain it to Ramon

569
00:58:46,966 --> 00:58:50,648
I don't think he's in the mood of visits.
He had a bad day

570
00:58:51,206 --> 00:58:53,165
Why don't you come tomorrow?
Or the day after?

571
00:58:53,541 --> 00:58:54,413
It's important

572
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,368
The conserve factory is closing

573
00:58:58,975 --> 00:59:01,999
That things are not going well.
That there's no money to pay us

574
00:59:02,727 --> 00:59:03,966
And that we are fired

575
00:59:04,286 --> 00:59:06,328
There's no right, damn it!

576
00:59:06,363 --> 00:59:07,291
There's no right.

577
00:59:11,436 --> 00:59:13,667
- Forgive me Ramon
- I have nothing to forgive

578
00:59:14,786 --> 00:59:18,770
Cry all you want.
I wish I could stand up and give you a hug

579
00:59:22,516 --> 00:59:24,730
Now that I had started to save some money

580
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:28,762
I wanted to buy you a telescope
for the day of the Wise Men

581
00:59:29,082 --> 00:59:30,801
You don't have to buy me anything, Rosa

582
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:33,026
I will get really mad if you spend one cent on me

583
00:59:33,393 --> 00:59:34,777
But I really wanted to

584
00:59:38,305 --> 00:59:41,265
- I wanted to give you something
- But why do you have to give me anything?

585
00:59:42,088 --> 00:59:44,696
Because you game me a lot Ramon,
you have no idea

586
00:59:52,183 --> 00:59:54,662
No man has never been so kind to me
as you have been

587
00:59:55,495 --> 00:59:56,951
Was it that bad?

588
01:00:06,118 --> 01:00:07,742
Now, I don't complicate things

589
01:00:08,446 --> 01:00:11,774
Now I know that the problem must be me, right

590
01:00:13,749 --> 01:00:15,638
That men doesn't like me or something

591
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:18,764
What do you say, Rosa?
How is that even possible?

592
01:00:20,869 --> 01:00:23,596
Wasn't that what you told me when I came
here the first time?

593
01:00:24,421 --> 01:00:25,692
Frustrated woman, you said

594
01:00:27,772 --> 01:00:33,828
Yes, yes. If I called you that then,
now I call you strong and brave

595
01:00:34,523 --> 01:00:39,206
and kind and beautiful. And I call an imbecile
to those who can't see it

596
01:00:44,275 --> 01:00:45,402
Rosa, please stop it.

597
01:00:45,873 --> 01:00:48,345
You make me feel like a priest and
I hate them enough already

598
01:00:48,618 --> 01:00:50,721
Sit over here, come on sit.

599
01:00:56,545 --> 01:00:58,932
And leave my hand alone, you know I can't feel it

600
01:01:01,608 --> 01:01:03,496
My son says you are faking it.

601
01:01:11,598 --> 01:01:14,855
But you do feel your face, right?

602
01:01:28,333 --> 01:01:35,893
I wish I could help you.
I would do anything to help you.

603
01:01:36,173 --> 01:01:38,189
You would help me?

604
01:01:38,437 --> 01:01:39,661
Yes

605
01:01:41,444 --> 01:01:46,364
Don't worry. I have it all planned
so that no one ends up in jail

606
01:01:47,339 --> 01:01:49,890
I have some friends that are willing to help

607
01:01:51,412 --> 01:01:54,595
I only need one more.
Someone brave, like you

608
01:01:54,884 --> 01:01:58,348
No.

609
01:01:59,867 --> 01:02:01,419
Help you heal...

610
01:02:03,594 --> 01:02:05,338
not die

611
01:02:19,032 --> 01:02:22,599
Come un guys, let's go.

612
01:02:28,392 --> 01:02:29,960
Are you holding him?

613
01:02:37,407 --> 01:02:39,207
He won't fit through here

614
01:02:47,441 --> 01:02:50,558
Ramon says that he understands the situation
but that he won't come down

615
01:02:56,829 --> 01:02:59,365
Ok. It doesn't matter.
Brother Andres

616
01:03:04,588 --> 01:03:07,860
Go upstairs and tell Ramon

617
01:03:16,195 --> 01:03:21,842
...and since we are inside eternity.
Life doesn't belong to us...

618
01:03:22,291 --> 01:03:27,772
and we take to ridiculous extremes the
bourgeois definition of private property

619
01:03:30,137 --> 01:03:31,057
You are killing me

620
01:03:31,698 --> 01:03:35,321
But if Church was the first one in
secularize the private property

621
01:03:37,305 --> 01:03:38,508
- I can't tell him that
- How come?

622
01:03:39,139 --> 01:03:40,387
Should I tell him that?

623
01:03:43,707 --> 01:03:51,526
Freedom to choose my beliefs...no, his beliefs
and decide over his life

624
01:03:53,114 --> 01:03:54,666
Ok, now you tell him

625
01:03:57,346 --> 01:04:00,874
Why does the Church keep with such passion
that posture of terror of death?

626
01:04:01,473 --> 01:04:04,169
Because it knows that it would lose
a great amount of its customers

627
01:04:04,393 --> 01:04:06,601
if people lose their fear to the
Great Beyond

628
01:04:07,393 --> 01:04:13,689
He reminds you that according to the polls,
67% of the Spanish are in favor of euthanasia

629
01:04:13,969 --> 01:04:18,000
Very well, very well. Now you tell him
that moral issues are not resolved through polls

630
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:22,903
Because most of the German people was
also in favor of Hitler

631
01:04:23,168 --> 01:04:25,512
Now he is going to compare me to Hitler.
That is very rude

632
01:04:26,103 --> 01:04:26,975
No, not that

633
01:04:29,463 --> 01:04:31,759
Ask him what does Hitler has to do with anything

634
01:04:32,763 --> 01:04:38,198
No wait...
Padre Francisco, do you hear me?

635
01:04:39,622 --> 01:04:41,718
Yes. Ramon I can hear you

636
01:04:42,333 --> 01:04:44,246
Why do you mix pears with apples?

637
01:04:45,261 --> 01:04:47,453
I hope you didn't come here to do demagoguery.

638
01:04:47,917 --> 01:04:50,156
Because you Jesuits know a lot about that.

639
01:04:50,485 --> 01:04:52,182
No, no. Of course not.

640
01:04:52,356 --> 01:04:55,412
But since you bring up demagoguery, my dear Ramon.

641
01:04:56,987 --> 01:05:01,379
Don't you think that what's really demagogic is
to say "Death with dignity"

642
01:05:02,875 --> 01:05:06,994
Why don't you leave the euphemisms aside and
call things by its name, with all its rawness

643
01:05:07,079 --> 01:05:08,579
"I take my life" and that's it...

644
01:05:09,658 --> 01:05:15,507
It keeps surprising me your interest in my life,
when the Institution that you represent

645
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:22,929
accepts the death penalty and condemned for centuries
to the bonfire those who didn't think in the right way

646
01:05:23,033 --> 01:05:25,396
Now it is you the one doing demagoguery

647
01:05:25,497 --> 01:05:30,169
Yes of course, but leaving the euphemisms aside, as you say
that's what you would have done with me, right?

648
01:05:30,681 --> 01:05:32,040
Burn me alive

649
01:05:32,784 --> 01:05:34,712
Burn me for defending my freedom

650
01:05:35,698 --> 01:05:36,823
Ramon, my friend...

651
01:05:37,352 --> 01:05:38,031
Friend?

652
01:05:38,345 --> 01:05:41,375
Ramon, my friend. A freedom that
eliminates life is not freedom

653
01:05:41,792 --> 01:05:43,768
And a life that eliminates freedom is not life either

654
01:05:44,911 --> 01:05:47,520
Don't call me friend!
And leave me alone

655
01:05:53,494 --> 01:05:54,640
Come on. Let's go

656
01:05:59,847 --> 01:06:05,713
You...you that look like kind people,
give this man reasons to live

657
01:06:07,533 --> 01:06:12,788
Prove to him that life is not only
moving your arms and running around

658
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:17,720
or kicking a ball.
Damn it! Life is something else, really

659
01:06:18,752 --> 01:06:22,192
Life is so much more.
Hear it from me.

660
01:06:25,495 --> 01:06:27,951
And what do you want us to do?

661
01:06:28,199 --> 01:06:30,247
That we gag him so he doesn't talk?

662
01:06:31,063 --> 01:06:33,646
Or that we put him to sleep with a
rattle like a little kid

663
01:06:36,774 --> 01:06:41,126
Look. you appeared on TV and
something that I can't take out of my head

664
01:06:41,797 --> 01:06:42,790
Manuela, leave it alone

665
01:06:43,212 --> 01:06:46,468
You said that Ramon's family didn't
give him enough love...

666
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:51,005
you should know that in this house no one
stopped loving Ramon for one single day

667
01:06:51,452 --> 01:06:52,292
Not one day

668
01:06:54,245 --> 01:06:59,412
I've been looking after him for many years
and I love him like a son

669
01:07:03,722 --> 01:07:05,699
I don't know which one of you is right

670
01:07:06,506 --> 01:07:11,119
And I don't know if it's true what you say
about life belonging to God and not to us

671
01:07:13,244 --> 01:07:15,074
but I do know one thing

672
01:07:16,090 --> 01:07:18,441
you have a very big mouth

673
01:07:38,688 --> 01:07:42,063
Rosa, I told you that is not
necessary. I already shaved Ramon

674
01:07:42,296 --> 01:07:44,270
Yes, yes. But I know a better way

675
01:07:48,542 --> 01:07:49,519
Where do you have the soap?

676
01:07:52,583 --> 01:07:53,390
They're here

677
01:08:07,294 --> 01:08:10,356
I don't feel anything.
Are you sure there's a child in there?

678
01:08:10,716 --> 01:08:12,053
7 months old, darling

679
01:08:13,301 --> 01:08:15,521
- Well, he's not moving
- You're the one that doesn't move

680
01:08:15,676 --> 01:08:17,372
- Now, now, now
- See

681
01:08:18,550 --> 01:08:21,580
- He's happy to see you
- How are you going to call him?

682
01:08:21,876 --> 01:08:23,716
We still don't know

683
01:08:24,755 --> 01:08:29,154
Well, call him Ramon and that way one day
when he asks why, you can tell him my story

684
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:31,474
Is better if you tell him

685
01:08:37,522 --> 01:08:40,082
There's someone else who will
be really happy to see you

686
01:08:45,706 --> 01:08:49,081
- No, no. Not like that
- Grandpa, shut up

687
01:08:59,336 --> 01:09:02,839
- How come you didn't say anything?
- We wanted to surprise you

688
01:09:03,488 --> 01:09:05,863
This a great Wise Men's day present

689
01:09:06,035 --> 01:09:08,270
I'm going to open the windows,
it's really hot in here

690
01:09:08,575 --> 01:09:10,767
We better get out and
leave you alone for a while

691
01:09:20,229 --> 01:09:21,478
How are you sailor?

692
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:29,805
- Do you drink coffee Mark?
- Yes, please

693
01:09:30,213 --> 01:09:32,854
- How are you Rosa?
- Fine

694
01:09:33,189 --> 01:09:35,381
Ramon told me that you had found a new job

695
01:09:36,094 --> 01:09:38,044
Yes, caring for some elderly people

696
01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:42,235
Does that woman is going to stay long?

697
01:09:43,508 --> 01:09:46,403
A couple of weeks, depending on how
long the book takes

698
01:09:47,876 --> 01:09:51,915
Well, I guess I won't be able to shave him.
See you some other time

699
01:09:52,203 --> 01:09:53,241
Bye Rosa

700
01:09:54,547 --> 01:09:57,602
Ok, the judges have their hands
tied because of the legislation

701
01:09:58,785 --> 01:10:01,165
We are going to try to
obtain a statement

702
01:10:01,741 --> 01:10:05,261
where we recommend to the government
changes to the penal code

703
01:10:05,613 --> 01:10:08,477
- The government?
- The government is there to serve us, Javi

704
01:10:08,774 --> 01:10:09,957
Your uncle is more important

705
01:10:10,669 --> 01:10:13,724
The jury will not dare agree with us,
we already know that

706
01:10:14,734 --> 01:10:17,076
But we cannot fail on the
regional audience

707
01:10:20,811 --> 01:10:22,875
Javier, help me with the cows

708
01:10:31,707 --> 01:10:35,202
We have to convince the judges that
Ramon is complete sane and lucid

709
01:10:36,218 --> 01:10:39,193
It would help us a lot
if he would make a declaration

710
01:10:39,697 --> 01:10:43,233
Manuela, we have to take Ramon
out of the house

711
01:10:46,153 --> 01:10:48,105
Can you tell me what were
you doing in there?

712
01:10:49,332 --> 01:10:51,465
Do you know what are they talking about?
What they want?

713
01:10:52,049 --> 01:10:53,800
And what do I do?
Lock myself up in the room?

714
01:10:53,999 --> 01:10:55,593
Do you understand what they really want?

715
01:10:58,296 --> 01:11:00,064
What happens if he wins the trial?

716
01:11:01,023 --> 01:11:07,070
Your uncle gets injected and dies, like a dog.
And you never see him again

717
01:11:07,928 --> 01:11:09,246
You will never see him again, Javier

718
01:11:09,939 --> 01:11:11,298
Or do you think death is so great?

719
01:11:12,706 --> 01:11:14,562
Please use your head

720
01:11:15,019 --> 01:11:16,945
Death is a very serious thing, you hear me?

721
01:11:17,609 --> 01:11:20,493
- Your uncle dies and you won't see him again.
- Leave me alone

722
01:11:27,866 --> 01:11:30,933
Is not that he doesn't feel like it, he
just doesn't want to use the chair

723
01:11:32,585 --> 01:11:36,080
Taking him out of the house once or twice
a year is an accomplishment

724
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:40,440
Well, this one has to be one of those times.
It is very important that Ramon takes this trip.

725
01:11:42,441 --> 01:11:43,768
And when would that be?

726
01:11:45,207 --> 01:11:47,912
I estimate that the trial will take place in the spring

727
01:11:48,104 --> 01:11:50,399
So we still have time to propose it to him.

728
01:11:51,830 --> 01:11:55,134
There's only one thing worse than the death of a son

729
01:11:56,606 --> 01:11:58,294
and that is he wanting to die

730
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:27,732
Well, let's get to work

731
01:13:17,822 --> 01:13:23,949
"...get inside of you, eternally,
my seducer lover, beloved sea"

732
01:13:26,965 --> 01:13:28,909
Can you really smell the sea from here?

733
01:13:29,134 --> 01:13:31,684
Yes, and sometimes in the morning if there's wind

734
01:13:33,316 --> 01:13:36,956
and the window is open,
I can smell it as if I was there

735
01:13:38,332 --> 01:13:39,572
You have a very good nose

736
01:13:39,789 --> 01:13:44,316
Smells are probably what cause me
more intense sensations

737
01:13:46,156 --> 01:13:47,570
More fantasies

738
01:13:51,138 --> 01:13:53,026
...your smell, for example.

739
01:13:56,410 --> 01:13:58,051
My smell

740
01:13:59,634 --> 01:14:04,506
Yes, is the first thing I imagine when
I day dream about you

741
01:14:07,037 --> 01:14:08,093
Really?

742
01:14:09,981 --> 01:14:12,982
- And what are those dreams about?
- Just things

743
01:14:15,572 --> 01:14:17,773
They all have one thing in common...

744
01:14:18,915 --> 01:14:21,343
In all of them I can move...

745
01:14:23,394 --> 01:14:30,678
and I stand up and travel wherever
I imagine you are at that moment

746
01:14:32,939 --> 01:14:35,458
And if I imagine that you are here, for example

747
01:14:38,090 --> 01:14:40,283
I just get close to you

748
01:14:42,682 --> 01:14:45,361
And do what I have been
wishing to do so many times

749
01:14:45,897 --> 01:14:50,993
Then your smell becomes
stronger and I get dizzy

750
01:14:52,913 --> 01:14:58,471
I can feel your heart beat
then I feel your hands

751
01:15:01,048 --> 01:15:05,232
And then I lose my mind...
I lose my mind

752
01:15:37,804 --> 01:15:38,894
Is the water ok?

753
01:16:00,938 --> 01:16:02,106
Julia...

754
01:16:04,410 --> 01:16:06,073
Julia, are you awake?

755
01:16:08,698 --> 01:16:09,481
Yes

756
01:16:11,992 --> 01:16:12,897
I can't sleep

757
01:16:15,888 --> 01:16:16,960
Why is that

758
01:16:18,904 --> 01:16:21,856
I have an itching in one leg,
can you come and scratch it?

759
01:16:23,008 --> 01:16:23,855
...the leg

760
01:16:43,503 --> 01:16:45,015
I brought him some "filloas"

761
01:16:46,638 --> 01:16:48,502
- I know he likes them - Rosa,
please listen -I made them

762
01:16:50,117 --> 01:16:54,907
I've told you that you don't have to cook him
anything, or bathe him or shave him. Nothing

763
01:16:55,003 --> 01:16:56,579
I take care of Ramon.
Get it?

764
01:16:58,787 --> 01:17:02,506
- Ok, then I want to hear it from him
- No, he already told me

765
01:17:04,059 --> 01:17:05,882
Besides, he is very busy now.

766
01:17:07,771 --> 01:17:09,234
Is he with her?

767
01:17:15,785 --> 01:17:19,850
I wish I was a lawyer too.
But of course...

768
01:17:28,536 --> 01:17:32,496
- Don't cry Rosa, don't cry
- If you don't want to see me, please tell me

769
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:36,024
- Of course I want to see you
- It doesn't look that way

770
01:17:36,447 --> 01:17:37,687
Really, what are you...

771
01:17:40,294 --> 01:17:42,183
Rosa...
Rosa...

772
01:17:43,895 --> 01:17:44,918
She hung up

773
01:17:48,015 --> 01:17:51,621
Do you mind dialing the number again
and giving me a minute alone

774
01:18:04,236 --> 01:18:06,644
What's going on between you two, Ramon?

775
01:18:10,937 --> 01:18:12,233
But Julia...

776
01:18:14,528 --> 01:18:16,464
Why would I need to explain anything to you?

777
01:18:17,397 --> 01:18:21,759
I don't understand why you answer me like that,
because then I don't know what I’m doing here.

778
01:18:24,379 --> 01:18:27,786
Unless of course, you think that there's
nothing happening here

779
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:30,227
The kiss you gave me yesterday meant nothing?

780
01:18:33,786 --> 01:18:35,026
Look at you

781
01:18:37,251 --> 01:18:38,818
Look at you sitting there

782
01:18:40,722 --> 01:18:42,178
Look at you

783
01:18:43,329 --> 01:18:45,394
And now look at me

784
01:18:47,945 --> 01:18:49,683
Where are we going Julia?

785
01:18:51,585 --> 01:18:53,081
Look at us

786
01:18:54,544 --> 01:18:56,089
I haven't finished

787
01:18:58,240 --> 01:18:59,776
What do you think?

788
01:19:00,704 --> 01:19:02,822
That I don't think about what happened to me?

789
01:19:03,984 --> 01:19:06,830
Of course, I think about it. Frequently.

790
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,551
Every single day. It's like a nightmare.

791
01:19:14,622 --> 01:19:18,374
And I know that it will only get worse and worse
until I end up like a vegetable

792
01:19:18,910 --> 01:19:22,630
So I have reached a conclusion and I rather...

793
01:19:31,948 --> 01:19:33,230
I'm going to do it Ramon.

794
01:19:37,204 --> 01:19:39,648
I'm going to take my own life

795
01:19:48,584 --> 01:19:54,303
But before I do it, if you want to, my love...

796
01:19:57,087 --> 01:19:59,534
I would like to help you.

797
01:20:04,645 --> 01:20:06,188
Leave together...

798
01:20:12,565 --> 01:20:16,325
You don't say anything?
You didn't expect this.

799
01:20:20,148 --> 01:20:21,484
When?

800
01:20:23,908 --> 01:20:28,531
I don't know. We are almost done
with the book and...

801
01:20:31,003 --> 01:20:38,786
I'll go to Barcelona and look for an editor
so you can publish it.

802
01:20:39,179 --> 01:20:47,546
And then I’ll come back with the first copy.
That same day, Ramon. That same day.

803
01:20:49,416 --> 01:20:53,127
Listen to me, in the worst case scenario
we would win the public support.

804
01:20:53,368 --> 01:20:55,807
If the verdict is negative the
discussion will be more heated

805
01:20:56,193 --> 01:21:00,262
- Don't be stupid...I can't
understand... - Are you ok? - Yes, Yes

806
01:21:01,703 --> 01:21:03,150
News, what news?

807
01:21:05,167 --> 01:21:09,725
Mark, please be careful. It's ok, it's ok.
What happened Ramon?

808
01:21:09,912 --> 01:21:11,192
We are here.

809
01:21:13,455 --> 01:21:18,688
I understand Ramon, I understand.
But that doesn't matter

810
01:21:18,935 --> 01:21:26,391
Listen to me, if no one takes this step. If everyone hides their
heads and doesn't even try to confront the state, the judges...

811
01:21:41,180 --> 01:21:44,428
And what do we do now Manuela?
I mean, with the trip to Corunna.

812
01:21:44,860 --> 01:21:46,733
Do I go there and waste my time?

813
01:21:47,068 --> 01:21:49,045
Knowing that they won't listen to me.

814
01:21:49,508 --> 01:22:01,099
Well, I think that today it is a waste of time but
maybe tomorrow it could be useful for someone else

815
01:22:11,850 --> 01:22:14,021
Ok. Let's go and see those judges in the face

816
01:22:19,408 --> 01:22:22,344
- Javi, where is the chair
- The chair?

817
01:22:23,345 --> 01:22:25,050
I don't know, it's probably in the back.

818
01:22:25,384 --> 01:22:31,048
Well, I want you to take it out and clean it up. Then bring
grandpa and I’ll explain. We are going to make some changes

819
01:22:33,135 --> 01:22:34,863
Are going to put a motor?

820
01:22:34,887 --> 01:22:38,768
- You have to cut here and here
- Let the back move, right?

821
01:22:39,056 --> 01:22:47,288
You have to cut these pipes down here and then join them
with bolts so they move as hinges. Are you getting this?

822
01:22:48,062 --> 01:22:50,224
- Yes, yes
- And you dad?

823
01:22:50,415 --> 01:22:54,815
Your going to be lying down son.
You might fall sleep at the trial

824
01:22:54,983 --> 01:22:57,792
Is not like they're saying anything interesting, dad.

825
01:23:15,613 --> 01:23:17,141
Die to Live

826
01:23:19,389 --> 01:23:21,647
LETTERS FROM HELL

827
01:23:22,198 --> 01:23:24,338
You should put a pillow here
to support my head

828
01:23:24,490 --> 01:23:27,270
In case I fall backwards and break my neck

829
01:23:27,502 --> 01:23:33,029
Hey, Javi. Do you get it? Break
my neck... Break my neck...

830
01:23:46,972 --> 01:23:48,708
Grandpa

831
01:23:49,476 --> 01:23:52,732
Look, if you're going to help me like that,
is better if you do nothing

832
01:24:11,545 --> 01:24:14,985
- Am I tying you too tight?
- You're asking me?

833
01:24:22,504 --> 01:24:25,865
Wait a moment please.
Ramon

834
01:24:26,104 --> 01:24:28,705
Manuela, please.
As if I don't look ridiculous enough

835
01:24:28,992 --> 01:24:30,744
Better this than catching a cold

836
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:36,551
And don't you dare, taking it off

837
01:24:42,142 --> 01:24:43,782
You are Ramon Sampedro, right?

838
01:24:44,983 --> 01:24:47,950
I really wished it was me the
one to take you.

839
01:25:49,971 --> 01:25:54,404
Living is a right,
not an obligation!

840
01:25:54,405 --> 01:25:59,376
- Look at all the people here
- Who did we kill, eh?

841
01:26:00,326 --> 01:26:04,782
Ramon, do you feel alone because you
are the only Spanish to have requested euthanasia?

842
01:26:05,062 --> 01:26:11,822
Yes, well, the first one in requesting it in a public manner.
But this has been happening for many years.

843
01:26:12,030 --> 01:26:14,157
What do you expect from the judges?
What are you going to tell them?

844
01:26:15,301 --> 01:26:20,780
I just want to tell them that
I’m completely sane and lucid

845
01:26:22,538 --> 01:26:23,969
Silence

846
01:26:29,513 --> 01:26:30,689
Can we talk later?

847
01:26:31,464 --> 01:26:32,577
Silence, please

848
01:26:34,871 --> 01:26:38,663
In a state declared as lay and that recognizes
the right to the private property

849
01:26:38,831 --> 01:26:43,799
and which constitution expresses also the right
not to suffer tortures or degrading treatments

850
01:26:44,351 --> 01:26:48,551
is correct to say, that whomever sees his position as
degrading, as in Ramon Sampedro's case,

851
01:26:49,461 --> 01:26:51,646
should be able to decide over his own life

852
01:26:51,975 --> 01:26:57,054
in fact, no one that attempts suicide
and survives is judged afterwards

853
01:26:58,238 --> 01:27:02,933
but...
when you need the help of someone else

854
01:27:03,933 --> 01:27:07,517
to die with dignity, then the state interferes with
the freedom of the people and tells them

855
01:27:07,708 --> 01:27:10,613
that the life they are living is not theirs,
that they can't make decisions about it

856
01:27:10,870 --> 01:27:14,908
This, Your Honor, can only be done based on
metaphysical beliefs, or religious

857
01:27:16,316 --> 01:27:18,875
In a state, I repeat...

858
01:27:20,116 --> 01:27:21,971
that is declared lay

859
01:27:23,170 --> 01:27:27,915
Your Honor, I ask for a legal answer,
but above all, rational

860
01:27:28,659 --> 01:27:30,210
and human

861
01:27:32,546 --> 01:27:38,640
And now, with your permission,
Ramon Sampedro would like to read something

862
01:27:40,010 --> 01:27:41,617
Overruled

863
01:27:42,057 --> 01:27:46,058
My client want to address you directly so you
hear from his own voice...

864
01:27:46,289 --> 01:27:48,928
You know perfectly well the process

865
01:27:49,544 --> 01:27:52,065
Of course I know it, I know it perfectly

866
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:57,392
But I didn't know that it was so irrelevant
for you to give three minutes of your time

867
01:27:57,439 --> 01:27:58,127
Three...

868
01:27:59,368 --> 01:28:01,615
To listen to a man that has been waiting
for 28 years

869
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:03,920
If you want to change the process...

870
01:28:04,223 --> 01:28:05,575
change the laws

871
01:28:06,792 --> 01:28:08,535
Yes, of course.
I know that already.

872
01:28:09,862 --> 01:28:11,671
This case is ready for a sentence.

873
01:28:25,110 --> 01:28:28,557
Well...I knew you were not going
to take it seriously.

874
01:28:29,384 --> 01:28:33,980
That's what all men do. Laugh at me.
You were not going to be different

875
01:28:34,237 --> 01:28:38,676
Rosa, forgive me. Is just that lately
a little of everything happens to me

876
01:28:40,412 --> 01:28:41,979
- And...I’m a little overwhelmed.
- Why?

877
01:28:42,690 --> 01:28:45,124
Is not allowed to fall in love
with a tetraplegic or what?

878
01:28:45,299 --> 01:28:46,500
Is it that weird?

879
01:28:48,106 --> 01:28:54,347
Well, maybe we should clear up some things.
Specially if we are talking about something as complex as love.

880
01:28:54,570 --> 01:28:56,339
- Complex?
- Yes Rosa, complex.

881
01:28:56,843 --> 01:29:03,546
No matter how much you tell me that you love me,
I will never be sure of how real is your love

882
01:29:03,825 --> 01:29:09,333
or if it's just an idealization of a man you wanted
to find but couldn't or didn't last.

883
01:29:09,505 --> 01:29:13,217
But what are you talking about Ramon?
Don't try to confuse me

884
01:29:13,416 --> 01:29:17,824
Either you love or you don't.
You can't rationalize love

885
01:29:21,666 --> 01:29:25,240
Well, if that's the case, what do you want me to do?
You want me to move in with you?

886
01:29:25,930 --> 01:29:28,393
For me is enough to know that
I can visit you from time to time

887
01:29:28,682 --> 01:29:31,201
Of course you can.
Of course you can

888
01:29:32,787 --> 01:29:34,761
Yes, but for how long?

889
01:29:36,209 --> 01:29:39,672
Rosa. You wouldn't ask me
to stay alive for you, right?

890
01:29:41,057 --> 01:29:42,784
What if I told you that...

891
01:29:47,344 --> 01:29:49,216
that you give me strength to live Ramon

892
01:29:49,592 --> 01:29:52,463
Wait wait. Stop this thing for a moment

893
01:29:53,535 --> 01:29:54,775
Sit over there.

894
01:29:58,823 --> 01:30:03,711
- Let's see. Do you love your children?
- Of course I do.

895
01:30:04,711 --> 01:30:06,750
Well, there you have the strength to live

896
01:30:07,381 --> 01:30:09,933
Don't give me that responsibility Rosa

897
01:30:10,158 --> 01:30:14,589
Is that what you call love?
Keep me here against my will?

898
01:30:15,437 --> 01:30:16,636
Look...

899
01:30:17,804 --> 01:30:22,364
The person that really loves me is
the one that will help me die.

900
01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:26,058
That is love, Rosa

901
01:30:31,707 --> 01:30:35,795
Dear Julia...yesterday I received the sentence
of the provincial audience

902
01:30:36,507 --> 01:30:42,599
the judges understand that I want to die, but
remind me that to help me, would be punishable by law

903
01:30:43,122 --> 01:30:46,018
In other times, this would have affected me a lot

904
01:30:46,370 --> 01:30:50,947
Pushing me into that alley without exit where
days and nights never end

905
01:30:51,825 --> 01:30:56,720
But now I feel that everything is rushing by
and that the publication of the book will happen any day now

906
01:30:58,121 --> 01:31:01,348
And with it you will return Julia.
My Juliet...

907
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:05,128
It will be the sweetest death that I could ever imagine

908
01:31:05,336 --> 01:31:07,577
It will be love, pure and shared

909
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,496
And it will be the return to balance.
Finally to balance

910
01:31:13,351 --> 01:31:14,791
A kiss, my dear friend

911
01:32:11,957 --> 01:32:13,336
Ok, see you later

912
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:24,712
Should I open it?

913
01:32:28,856 --> 01:32:30,384
Is the book!

914
01:32:32,493 --> 01:32:35,310
Look, is the book.
You are on the cover

915
01:32:41,922 --> 01:32:43,704
It smells great

916
01:32:50,381 --> 01:32:51,550
Is for you

917
01:32:55,534 --> 01:32:56,845
I'm going to show it to mom

918
01:33:27,385 --> 01:33:35,441
Why...why...
why can't I be happy with this life?

919
01:33:35,617 --> 01:33:37,650
I'm going to give you a tranquilizer

920
01:33:37,738 --> 01:33:41,266
Why do I want to die?
Why do I want to die?

921
01:33:52,336 --> 01:33:53,585
Give me two more Manuela.

922
01:33:54,217 --> 01:33:56,424
Manuela, for crying out loud, two more
pills are not going to kill me

923
01:33:56,766 --> 01:33:57,895
Give me two more

924
01:34:04,573 --> 01:34:05,864
You'll feel better soon

925
01:34:48,762 --> 01:34:51,954
- How do you feel?
- Fine

926
01:34:53,393 --> 01:34:54,539
What time is it?

927
01:34:54,801 --> 01:34:57,533
11:00 am. I didn't want to wake you up today

928
01:34:59,969 --> 01:35:02,265
The girl from Boiro has called three times already

929
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:04,768
What did she want?

930
01:35:05,512 --> 01:35:08,288
She says she has to talk to you about
something important

931
01:35:08,895 --> 01:35:13,815
- For her it is always important
- Dial the number for me please

932
01:35:14,967 --> 01:35:17,662
Are you going to call her?
Why don't you wait for her to call back?

933
01:35:17,839 --> 01:35:21,950
But she can barely pay her phone bill.
Dial the number please

934
01:35:24,607 --> 01:35:27,790
Of course Ramon.
You always so kind

935
01:35:34,470 --> 01:35:36,797
- Ramon?
- What's going Rosa?

936
01:35:38,108 --> 01:35:40,036
I need to see you. I have to talk to you

937
01:35:40,453 --> 01:35:44,422
- You said I should call you before visiting you
- Yes. Did something happened?

938
01:35:45,460 --> 01:35:47,052
Can I come now?

939
01:35:48,787 --> 01:35:54,119
Look Ramon, you said you had a plan or something

940
01:35:55,710 --> 01:36:00,294
That you had figured out a way of doing what you want to do,
if the judges decided against you

941
01:36:00,470 --> 01:36:02,197
Yes, Rosa, but I already asked you to
forgive me, right?

942
01:36:02,503 --> 01:36:03,782
I told you to forget about it

943
01:36:04,149 --> 01:36:05,654
Yes.
But I can't

944
01:36:05,869 --> 01:36:07,149
I can't, you know

945
01:36:07,781 --> 01:36:14,388
Because last month the audience said no.
And you are still thinking about doing it

946
01:36:14,589 --> 01:36:17,788
Is that what worries you?
That I get my way?

947
01:36:18,877 --> 01:36:21,901
- So, are you going to do it?
- Is not that easy, Rosa. But don't worry

948
01:36:22,668 --> 01:36:24,525
You will be the last person to find out.

949
01:36:32,508 --> 01:36:33,715
Ramon...

950
01:36:35,331 --> 01:36:41,851
Is that I realized...
I understood what you said in Corunna.

951
01:36:43,002 --> 01:36:46,298
"The person that really loves me will
be the one to help me"

952
01:36:46,682 --> 01:36:49,386
I'm completely sure about what I feel Ramon

953
01:36:50,498 --> 01:36:52,306
I love you

954
01:36:56,280 --> 01:36:58,169
Do you want me to help you?

955
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:02,561
Rosa...

956
01:37:03,416 --> 01:37:09,143
I'm not joking Ramon.
Do you want me to help you?

957
01:37:14,079 --> 01:37:17,086
But what are you going to tell him?
Jose wait...

958
01:37:20,655 --> 01:37:22,319
Did you hear me!
I will not allow this

959
01:37:22,558 --> 01:37:26,549
And what are you going to do?
Strap me to the bed?

960
01:37:28,239 --> 01:37:31,141
Or are you going to fill me with sleeping pills
like they used to do at the hospital?

961
01:37:31,405 --> 01:37:33,120
- No one is going to prevent me of getting out of here
- I will

962
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:34,680
- Not even you
- I will

963
01:37:35,088 --> 01:37:36,424
Will see about that!

964
01:37:36,704 --> 01:37:38,551
Or is it that I mean nothing in this house?

965
01:37:39,001 --> 01:37:41,184
I am the older brother
I am the head of the family

966
01:37:41,625 --> 01:37:43,935
Do you think that means anything to me?

967
01:37:45,443 --> 01:37:46,544
At my age?

968
01:37:47,327 --> 01:37:50,894
For me what counts is what people have in their
heads, and you have nothing in yours

969
01:37:51,942 --> 01:37:56,407
I will not be a slave of your ignorance
anymore or of your prude conscience

970
01:37:56,589 --> 01:37:59,263
An what about me?
I am also a slave

971
01:38:00,429 --> 01:38:02,758
How do you think I felt when I left the sea?

972
01:38:03,445 --> 01:38:06,437
All my life here, living out of this
fucking orchard

973
01:38:08,004 --> 01:38:10,684
To be with you.
To be only with you

974
01:38:11,300 --> 01:38:14,829
Me, my wife and my son.
All slaves!

975
01:38:32,873 --> 01:38:36,449
- Hello
- Hello

976
01:38:39,567 --> 01:38:42,407
- Your uncle is going to Boiro
- Boiro?

977
01:38:43,366 --> 01:38:44,694
What for?

978
01:38:45,870 --> 01:38:47,574
To spend some time there, he says

979
01:38:48,757 --> 01:38:51,494
He's leaving with that woman, Rosa

980
01:38:55,029 --> 01:38:58,301
- Are they getting married?
- No they're not

981
01:39:06,101 --> 01:39:07,284
What is that about you leaving?

982
01:39:09,059 --> 01:39:10,100
For how long?

983
01:39:12,467 --> 01:39:14,508
I want to give you my book.
It's over there.

984
01:39:18,020 --> 01:39:22,362
- But aren't there any more, or what?
- Yes of course, but that one is the first copy

985
01:39:24,347 --> 01:39:25,763
Open it at the bookmark

986
01:39:28,537 --> 01:39:32,081
- "To my son"?
- Yes. Read it please.

987
01:39:34,066 --> 01:39:34,962
To my son

988
01:39:35,938 --> 01:39:38,241
Forgive me son for not being born

989
01:39:38,785 --> 01:39:40,369
It wasn't my fault to leave you behind

990
01:39:41,385 --> 01:39:44,217
It were the roses the ones afraid

991
01:39:45,136 --> 01:39:47,296
Forgive me for not had been able to play with you

992
01:39:48,033 --> 01:39:50,817
I don't know if you were born after I passed

993
01:39:51,152 --> 01:39:52,849
Remember always that I still love you

994
01:39:53,737 --> 01:39:56,224
Give a kiss to your mother from me

995
01:39:56,426 --> 01:39:57,762
And don't keep any resentments towards me

996
01:39:58,114 --> 01:39:59,075
Is not good to hate.

997
01:39:59,658 --> 01:40:00,779
So...did you get it?

998
01:40:01,610 --> 01:40:03,177
- Yes
- Let's see

999
01:40:04,258 --> 01:40:11,713
Well, it's about a son you never had and
this is like you are speaking to him

1000
01:40:12,721 --> 01:40:14,496
And you ask for forgiveness for not having him

1001
01:40:15,208 --> 01:40:16,982
Ok. But what did I added down there?

1002
01:40:20,536 --> 01:40:24,575
- "To Javier"
- So? - So what?

1003
01:40:26,096 --> 01:40:28,022
Don't you see what I’m trying to say?

1004
01:40:29,838 --> 01:40:31,358
But I’m not your son

1005
01:40:31,646 --> 01:40:33,007
Of course not...

1006
01:40:33,161 --> 01:40:36,167
But if I’m dedicating you that poem,
is for a reason, no?

1007
01:40:39,694 --> 01:40:41,278
But I’m not your son

1008
01:40:41,574 --> 01:40:45,896
I don't know what is that they teach you at school.
Get out of here. Get out.

1009
01:40:46,786 --> 01:40:48,329
You are all so weird

1010
01:40:55,528 --> 01:40:58,359
Ramon? How are you?
Wait a moment, I can't hear you

1011
01:41:01,206 --> 01:41:05,278
- Tell me dear
- I'm leaving tomorrow

1012
01:41:05,535 --> 01:41:08,016
Yes, Rosa told me this afternoon.
I'm sure you are impatient

1013
01:41:08,446 --> 01:41:09,151
A little

1014
01:41:10,271 --> 01:41:14,142
Hey Ramon, I’ve been researching
about that thing you know...

1015
01:41:15,071 --> 01:41:17,541
- What? - Well that
thing... - The powder?

1016
01:41:18,006 --> 01:41:25,645
Yes, the powder. You have to calculate an exact dose of 200 mg.
But it is probable that it is a little painful...just so you know.

1017
01:41:25,845 --> 01:41:35,876
Gené. I think is best if you forget about all this.
It worries me that someday you could be implicated in this.

1018
01:41:37,043 --> 01:41:44,555
In fact, that's why I’m calling, I want to
say good bye and we shouldn't talk again

1019
01:41:45,203 --> 01:41:48,907
Is for your security.
You shouldn't even talk to Mark about this.

1020
01:41:51,491 --> 01:42:00,969
- Yes, yes. I understand. So this is farewell.
- Is better this way

1021
01:42:03,153 --> 01:42:07,993
Ok, ok...ok.
Let me tell you something...

1022
01:42:08,745 --> 01:42:12,023
Ramon, think it through all the times that is necessary.

1023
01:42:12,272 --> 01:42:20,951
Don't feel pressured. I mean, don't do it to set an example
or to not disappoint the public, or us or the association

1024
01:42:21,368 --> 01:42:25,222
No one is pushing you to do it,
do you understand me?

1025
01:42:28,678 --> 01:42:32,799
- Do you understand me Ramon?
- Not you too, Gené, please

1026
01:42:40,300 --> 01:42:45,765
- I'm sorry Ramon
- Goodbye Gené

1027
01:42:47,868 --> 01:42:50,803
Have a nice journey, partner.

1028
01:43:32,983 --> 01:43:34,271
Good bye Manuela...

1029
01:43:38,976 --> 01:43:40,542
and you Javi, please be good

1030
01:43:41,271 --> 01:43:43,511
I understood what you meant with the poem

1031
01:43:46,807 --> 01:43:47,905
Come here a moment

1032
01:43:52,984 --> 01:43:54,111
Give me a hug

1033
01:44:15,765 --> 01:44:17,907
Do me favor.
Take care of your grandpa

1034
01:44:24,643 --> 01:44:26,082
Well Ramon, here we go.

1035
01:44:44,394 --> 01:44:46,321
Can you close the door, kid?

1036
01:44:59,815 --> 01:45:01,143
Come on, close it.

1037
01:45:42,946 --> 01:45:44,763
What are you going to do in Boiro chief?

1038
01:45:46,059 --> 01:45:49,578
I'm going to the beach.
For a change of view.

1039
01:45:50,339 --> 01:45:53,153
A change of view? That's great

1040
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:16,030
This is the best I could find with the money you gave me.

1041
01:46:16,432 --> 01:46:19,447
And I told them about the view.
Do you like it?

1042
01:46:20,720 --> 01:46:25,143
- Where do I sign? -
What for? - To marry you.

1043
01:46:30,582 --> 01:46:32,078
He fell asleep

1044
01:46:33,246 --> 01:46:35,118
Of course.
Since I don't move at all.

1045
01:46:49,736 --> 01:46:53,291
Ramon. If there's really life after death...

1046
01:46:55,699 --> 01:46:58,650
I know this is going to sound foolish, but...

1047
01:47:00,987 --> 01:47:03,843
- Please send me a sign?
- A sign?

1048
01:47:04,076 --> 01:47:11,659
Anything. I never was scared of spirits.
I will be very alert. Waiting. Will you do it?

1049
01:47:11,953 --> 01:47:13,650
Of course.

1050
01:47:13,961 --> 01:47:28,048
But, between you and me, I think that after we die
there's nothing. Just like before we are born. Nothing

1051
01:47:30,656 --> 01:47:32,640
How can you be so sure Ramon?

1052
01:47:32,975 --> 01:47:34,208
No one knows that

1053
01:47:34,432 --> 01:47:35,952
No I’m not sure.

1054
01:47:36,160 --> 01:47:45,391
Is just a feeling. Is like when my father
looks at the sky and says "Tomorrow is going to rain" and it does

1055
01:47:46,702 --> 01:47:48,758
Is a feeling.

1056
01:47:52,151 --> 01:47:56,430
But there's something you shouldn't forget.
I'm going to be in your dreams

1057
01:47:57,670 --> 01:48:03,207
I'm going to come at night to your bed
and we will make love

1058
01:48:03,581 --> 01:48:06,468
And in case I don't tell you in your dreams
I tell you now

1059
01:48:09,021 --> 01:48:15,029
Thanks Rosa, from the bottom of my heart.
Thanks

1060
01:48:31,844 --> 01:48:38,501
Judges, political and religious authorities.
What does dignity mean to you?

1061
01:48:39,556 --> 01:48:45,516
Whatever the answer of your conscience
know that for me, this is not a worthy life.

1062
01:48:47,084 --> 01:48:51,251
I would have liked to at least die with dignity

1063
01:48:51,595 --> 01:48:59,923
Today, tired of the institutional laziness,
I see myself forced to do it in hiding, like a criminal

1064
01:49:00,115 --> 01:49:03,011
You should know that the processes conducting to my death

1065
01:49:03,939 --> 01:49:09,298
has been carefully divided in small actions that do
not constitute a crime by themselves

1066
01:49:09,609 --> 01:49:12,977
and have been executed by several friendly hands

1067
01:49:13,178 --> 01:49:16,464
if even then, the state insists in punishing my helpers

1068
01:49:16,593 --> 01:49:21,881
I would suggest that you cut their hands, because
that is all that they contributed

1069
01:49:22,488 --> 01:49:26,448
The head, I mean the conscience was provided by me

1070
01:49:27,528 --> 01:49:31,136
As you can see, to my side I have a
glass of water

1071
01:49:31,823 --> 01:49:35,655
that contains a dose of potassium cyanide

1072
01:49:37,079 --> 01:49:39,383
when I drink it I will cease to exist

1073
01:49:40,150 --> 01:49:44,231
relinquishing my most precious property. My body

1074
01:49:45,773 --> 01:49:51,254
I believe that living is a right
not an obligation, as has been in my case

1075
01:49:51,989 --> 01:50:00,684
forced to accept this sad situation during 28 years,
4 months and some days

1076
01:50:01,996 --> 01:50:08,220
After all this time I make a balance of the
road traveled and I can't account for the happiness

1077
01:50:09,620 --> 01:50:15,428
Only the time that passed against my will,
during most of my life

1078
01:50:16,763 --> 01:50:19,299
will be my ally from now on

1079
01:50:20,163 --> 01:50:32,505
Only time and the evolution of consciences will decide
one day if my request was reasonable or not.

1080
01:51:07,063 --> 01:51:08,567
Well...

1081
01:51:18,404 --> 01:51:19,982
It's hot...

1082
01:52:36,294 --> 01:52:40,712
- And Mark, is he coming?
- He is with our son on the beach. He loves the sea

1083
01:52:41,632 --> 01:52:43,965
- They can't be thinking about getting in
- No! It's too cold

1084
01:52:44,023 --> 01:52:45,932
- How are you?
- Fine

1085
01:52:48,591 --> 01:52:51,764
- Is she going to understand me?
- Yes...

1086
01:52:51,940 --> 01:52:58,316
- I mean, does she still follow conversations and such
- Yes, yes. Sometimes is a little difficult, but..

1087
01:53:00,474 --> 01:53:04,745
- Well...I'll go see her, see you later
- See you later

1088
01:53:20,705 --> 01:53:21,930
Hello Julia

1089
01:53:23,905 --> 01:53:26,048
Hello. How are you?

1090
01:53:27,144 --> 01:53:31,968
- Fine, and you?
- Well...here

1091
01:53:38,087 --> 01:53:40,975
You have a very nice house. Very beautiful

1092
01:53:46,758 --> 01:53:48,981
Well, you know that Ramon left me many letters.

1093
01:53:49,206 --> 01:53:53,638
I think that he had fun leaving
writings around after he died

1094
01:53:54,949 --> 01:53:56,909
The thing is that the other day

1095
01:53:57,286 --> 01:53:59,325
I found this letter for you.

1096
01:54:06,021 --> 01:54:07,693
Ramon who?

1097
01:54:13,460 --> 01:54:16,795
Ramon Sampedro...
Your friend

1098
01:54:18,924 --> 01:54:22,082
I introduced you two.
Do you remember?

1099
01:54:25,067 --> 01:54:26,794
You?

1100
01:54:27,891 --> 01:54:29,530
Yes

1101
01:54:49,608 --> 01:54:51,617
It's very nice in here.

1102
01:55:00,503 --> 01:55:02,870
Out to sea,
Out to sea

1103
01:55:03,367 --> 01:55:05,023
And in the weightlessness of the bottom

1104
01:55:05,183 --> 01:55:06,431
where dreams come true

1105
01:55:06,848 --> 01:55:09,265
two wills come together to make a wish come true

1106
01:55:09,968 --> 01:55:11,136
Your look and my look

1107
01:55:11,777 --> 01:55:13,488
like an echo repeating, without words

1108
01:55:14,016 --> 01:55:15,777
Deeper,
Deeper

1109
01:55:16,232 --> 01:55:18,800
beyond everything through the blood and the bones

1110
01:55:20,247 --> 01:55:21,383
But I always wake up

1111
01:55:21,646 --> 01:55:23,359
and I always wish I’d be dead

1112
01:55:24,008 --> 01:55:25,511
to stay with my mouth

1113
01:55:25,896 --> 01:55:27,095
entangled in your hair
