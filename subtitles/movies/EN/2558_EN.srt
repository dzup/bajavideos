1
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:11,700
BORN AND BRED

2
00:04:27,126 --> 00:04:28,388
Daddy.

3
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:31,190
Daddy, wake up!

4
00:04:38,771 --> 00:04:40,432
Come on, Daddy!

5
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,973
What are you doing here?

6
00:04:42,508 --> 00:04:43,600
What time is it?

7
00:04:47,513 --> 00:04:50,004
You shouldn't be
in Mummy's and Daddy's bed.

8
00:04:52,719 --> 00:04:54,619
It's nine! We overslept!

9
00:04:56,055 --> 00:04:57,044
Come on!

10
00:05:00,827 --> 00:05:03,091
We're going to be late, come on.

11
00:05:11,137 --> 00:05:14,072
Jose, ask Anita
to dress you for school.

12
00:05:14,173 --> 00:05:15,663
Anita, will you dress me?

13
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:22,741
Excuse me.

14
00:05:28,821 --> 00:05:30,948
- Didn't you hear the alarm clock?
- No.

15
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,079
No?

16
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:36,087
Me neither.

17
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:55,142
No, I don't like it.
Dad, come here! Dad!

18
00:05:56,449 --> 00:05:58,041
Are you having yogurt or juice?

19
00:05:58,251 --> 00:05:59,445
Yogurt.

20
00:06:02,822 --> 00:06:06,690
I said I don't like it...
I don't want to!

21
00:06:06,793 --> 00:06:08,886
Jose! You can't throw
your socks like that!

22
00:06:09,095 --> 00:06:10,653
Stop winding Anita up.

23
00:06:11,564 --> 00:06:14,124
Good morning, Sir.
Everything is ready.

24
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:16,066
Hurry up or we'll be late.

25
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:17,431
I'm coming!

26
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:29,141
Anita, have you seen my blue sandals?

27
00:06:29,582 --> 00:06:32,142
Yes, they are in the laundry.

28
00:06:33,686 --> 00:06:36,655
- Where?
- In the laundry, Madam.

29
00:06:36,923 --> 00:06:38,515
Thanks.

30
00:06:56,108 --> 00:06:57,939
What a morning, sweetie!

31
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:04,441
Good morning, Anita.

32
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,778
Good morning, Madam.

33
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:07,648
Jose won't come back for lunch.

34
00:07:07,753 --> 00:07:10,745
My mother will pick her up.
Just leave some dinner ready.

35
00:07:13,726 --> 00:07:15,921
- Thanks a lot.
- Your mother called last night.

36
00:07:16,028 --> 00:07:17,086
And?

37
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,057
She wants to talk to you.

38
00:07:19,665 --> 00:07:20,996
- Call her.
- Later.

39
00:07:23,202 --> 00:07:26,000
Anita, have you got Jose's
things? It's late.

40
00:07:26,105 --> 00:07:28,039
Yes, Madam. I'm just sorting them.

41
00:07:31,644 --> 00:07:33,839
Are you ready, sweetheart?

42
00:07:34,847 --> 00:07:35,836
She hasn't finished.

43
00:07:35,948 --> 00:07:38,542
Okay, have a little more.
She'll eat at school.

44
00:07:38,651 --> 00:07:39,811
The coffee!

45
00:07:42,822 --> 00:07:44,687
- We're ready, Madam!
- Great.

46
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:48,021
Hurry, sweetie, you're late.
You'll eat at the nursery.

47
00:07:48,761 --> 00:07:50,058
Bye!

48
00:07:51,998 --> 00:07:53,090
See you later.

49
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,667
Take this. Bye!

50
00:07:56,202 --> 00:07:56,964
Bye!

51
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:28,959
Their agent will contact you directly.

52
00:08:32,204 --> 00:08:33,432
Everything fits
into one container:

53
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:36,633
Lamps, furniture, sofas,
tables, everything.

54
00:08:37,743 --> 00:08:40,041
When will they confirm
its arrival in Milan?

55
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:41,806
Just a second, can you hold?

56
00:08:42,048 --> 00:08:44,073
You forgot to send me the samples.

57
00:08:44,183 --> 00:08:45,650
I forgot. I've just finished.

58
00:08:45,751 --> 00:08:48,652
But at least let me tell you
how it went!

59
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:57,788
I found another one.

60
00:08:57,897 --> 00:08:59,660
Hi. It's really nice!

61
00:08:59,865 --> 00:09:01,059
It's a good one.

62
00:09:01,534 --> 00:09:03,092
Look, what do you think?

63
00:09:06,172 --> 00:09:08,663
I'd try more saturated colors.

64
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,570
I was looking at the
upholstery samples...

65
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:13,338
for the hotel lounge...

66
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:16,913
Here, I think white would work best.

67
00:09:17,016 --> 00:09:17,880
Looks good.

68
00:09:17,984 --> 00:09:19,349
Yes. There's
another option though.

69
00:09:19,452 --> 00:09:21,477
That's really nice.

70
00:09:25,391 --> 00:09:26,915
Isn't it too much work?

71
00:09:27,727 --> 00:09:30,093
Not at all. We have two months.

72
00:09:30,196 --> 00:09:32,528
But we are talking about 30-35 rooms.

73
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:35,758
But 20 are identical.
There are only 10 exclusive ones.

74
00:09:35,901 --> 00:09:38,062
It will be fine!

75
00:09:39,605 --> 00:09:42,005
Look, here are some bed options.

76
00:09:44,143 --> 00:09:45,974
- Aren't they nice?
- Yes.

77
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:47,978
And your lamps will go nicely.

78
00:09:48,214 --> 00:09:50,614
Milli, you just
blew smoke in my face!

79
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,011
Come on! What's wrong with you?

80
00:09:53,753 --> 00:09:56,415
- When will you stop smoking?
- I need time.

81
00:10:03,229 --> 00:10:05,527
- Don't press so hard.
- Jose, it's bedtime!

82
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,497
Coming, mom!

83
00:10:08,601 --> 00:10:09,932
Come on, sweetie.

84
00:10:10,136 --> 00:10:12,536
Pess gently
or the paper will tear.

85
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:14,438
Coming, Mummy!

86
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,837
Come on, Jose.

87
00:10:18,244 --> 00:10:19,609
Come on, sweetie.

88
00:10:19,712 --> 00:10:20,804
Coming!

89
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:24,413
That's pretty!

90
00:10:24,517 --> 00:10:26,041
- Yes!
- You worked hard!

91
00:10:26,218 --> 00:10:28,152
I drew the house and he coloured it.

92
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:29,915
It's very good!

93
00:10:30,189 --> 00:10:31,918
Kiss Daddy goodnight.

94
00:10:32,024 --> 00:10:34,686
- Can I do a bit more?
- No, no, it's very late.

95
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,521
Let her, she's not finished yet.

96
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:38,927
That's it.
What a pretty blue!

97
00:10:39,031 --> 00:10:40,430
- A kiss for Dad.
- Now the green one!

98
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:41,693
No, that's enough.

99
00:10:41,801 --> 00:10:43,564
You have school tomorrow.

100
00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:45,432
A kiss for Daddy.
Let's go.

101
00:10:46,672 --> 00:10:50,506
What are you two whispering about?
Tidy the things.

102
00:10:50,976 --> 00:10:53,536
- Let's go brush your teeth.
- Jose!

103
00:10:54,146 --> 00:10:55,636
Off to sleep!

104
00:10:57,249 --> 00:10:59,581
I don't want to go to sleep...

105
00:11:53,739 --> 00:11:54,899
I love you.

106
00:12:02,882 --> 00:12:04,076
I love you.

107
00:12:04,884 --> 00:12:06,078
I love you too.

108
00:12:12,424 --> 00:12:13,891
Are you going to leave me?

109
00:12:14,126 --> 00:12:17,186
You're such a bore!

110
00:12:18,097 --> 00:12:19,621
You're always fighting me.

111
00:12:19,732 --> 00:12:21,893
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you like the fight.

112
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:23,662
- No.
- Yes, you do!

113
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:25,498
- No.
- Yes, yes, yes.

114
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,199
No, there's nothing wrong.
We're just tired...

115
00:12:29,475 --> 00:12:32,808
that's all.
Everything's fine.

116
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:46,691
What if we go away
for a few days...

117
00:12:46,926 --> 00:12:48,484
But, where to?

118
00:12:48,861 --> 00:12:50,590
To Victoria's country house.

119
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,222
When?

120
00:12:52,464 --> 00:12:53,863
Tomorrow... perhaps.

121
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,592
- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow.

122
00:12:55,701 --> 00:12:57,794
Not tomorrow. It's a working day.

123
00:12:57,903 --> 00:13:00,371
Come on!
Let's take a few days off.

124
00:13:03,943 --> 00:13:07,674
- I won't fall! I won't fall!
- Jose, you're going to fall, stop.

125
00:13:10,516 --> 00:13:13,451
That's enough, you're going
to fall, stop it.

126
00:13:13,552 --> 00:13:19,752
I won't fall! I won't fall!

127
00:13:20,659 --> 00:13:22,456
Jose, what did Mummy say?

128
00:13:22,595 --> 00:13:23,755
I want to go now.

129
00:13:23,863 --> 00:13:24,955
We're going soon...

130
00:13:25,064 --> 00:13:28,056
but first finish your cereal.

131
00:13:28,234 --> 00:13:29,599
I have finished.

132
00:13:29,702 --> 00:13:32,500
No cheating,
there's still a lot left.

133
00:13:32,805 --> 00:13:34,796
Are you happy to miss school?

134
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,702
Yes.

135
00:13:36,675 --> 00:13:38,506
Let's go then.

136
00:13:39,044 --> 00:13:42,844
Go fetch your things, we're off.
Darling, I left the ice box for you.

137
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:44,040
OK.

138
00:13:44,183 --> 00:13:45,616
Are you taking your toys?

139
00:13:45,718 --> 00:13:46,616
Yes.

140
00:14:03,102 --> 00:14:05,434
Jose, look what
you are leaving behind!

141
00:14:05,537 --> 00:14:08,404
Thanks Anita. I'll miss you.

142
00:14:08,507 --> 00:14:10,737
Anita, if necessary,
you can call me.

143
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,105
Very well, Madam, I'll see you.

144
00:14:26,558 --> 00:14:27,650
Hello!

145
00:14:28,494 --> 00:14:30,519
Hello, my darling! How are you?

146
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:31,755
Hello, mom.

147
00:14:31,864 --> 00:14:34,628
Hello, Milli. How are you, my dear?
You okay?

148
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,858
- How's everything, Santi?
- Hello, Victoria.

149
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:38,193
Thank you.

150
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:43,405
Look what I have for you...
as promised.

151
00:14:44,076 --> 00:14:46,544
Let's see if you like it, sweetie.

152
00:14:46,645 --> 00:14:47,703
Thank you.

153
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,777
This is Pedro's salary from
last month.

154
00:14:51,884 --> 00:14:52,976
Ah, great.

155
00:14:53,085 --> 00:14:55,553
And this is for the bathroom work.

156
00:14:55,654 --> 00:14:56,621
Fine.

157
00:14:56,722 --> 00:15:00,419
And of course, the keys
which you're familiar with, so...

158
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:01,515
That's great.

159
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:05,986
You can wear it in the evening.
It gets chilly in the country.

160
00:15:06,165 --> 00:15:09,498
When will you stay over
with Grannie? When?

161
00:15:09,601 --> 00:15:11,068
Next week...

162
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,535
when we get back.

163
00:15:12,638 --> 00:15:13,900
After the trip, right?

164
00:15:14,073 --> 00:15:20,501
Good. I'll be waiting
for you. Come back soon.

165
00:15:37,429 --> 00:15:39,522
- Here, dear.
- Mummy, I want to stop.

166
00:15:39,631 --> 00:15:42,964
Come on, not now, Jose,
don't start. It's a long trip.

167
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:44,532
Here, Santi.

168
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:45,927
Thanks.

169
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,741
Mummy, can you tell me a story?

170
00:15:56,849 --> 00:15:58,214
OK, a story...

171
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:02,418
Once upon a time, there was a bear
who liked honey so much.

172
00:16:02,521 --> 00:16:05,490
One day, whilst walking in the forest
he met a little boy...

173
00:16:05,624 --> 00:16:09,560
And the little boy said...
You! Come on!

174
00:16:10,796 --> 00:16:12,457
"Hello, Mr Bear."

175
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:14,657
Come on, give it a bit more sentiment!

176
00:16:15,534 --> 00:16:17,434
"Good day, Mr Bear!"

177
00:16:19,538 --> 00:16:21,506
And the bear said:

178
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:24,542
"What are you doing in my forest?"

179
00:16:24,643 --> 00:16:26,042
"I'm eating your honey."

180
00:16:26,145 --> 00:16:28,375
"How can you eat my honey?"

181
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,970
"I want you to leave my forest!"

182
00:16:36,522 --> 00:16:39,514
Lie down, sweetie. Go on!

183
00:16:39,825 --> 00:16:40,951
Lie down properly.

184
00:16:42,094 --> 00:16:43,527
Go on!

185
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:45,391
- Go on.
- Mummy...

186
00:16:45,497 --> 00:16:47,055
What is it, baby?

187
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:51,102
- I want to be at the front.
- Go on, sit back.

188
00:16:51,804 --> 00:16:55,706
- I want to sleep at the front with you!
- No, we'll be there soon.

189
00:16:55,808 --> 00:16:58,003
- Please, mom!
- You can't ride at the front.

190
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,873
- Sit back.
- No. - Lie back, Jose.

191
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:01,468
Come on, Jose, sit back.

192
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,480
- Daddy, you tell her!
- No, no...

193
00:17:03,582 --> 00:17:05,743
Don't insist, sweetie, you can't.

194
00:17:05,851 --> 00:17:07,910
Jose, you can't.

195
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,113
Children must ride at the back.
Lie down properly.

196
00:17:10,389 --> 00:17:12,653
- I want to be at the front.
- Lie back!

197
00:17:12,758 --> 00:17:14,589
- You're making us a cross!
- Please, mummy!

198
00:17:14,827 --> 00:17:16,419
Jose, lie back!

199
00:17:16,528 --> 00:17:18,758
I want to be at the front.

200
00:17:18,864 --> 00:17:19,922
Jose, stop it!

201
00:17:20,032 --> 00:17:22,125
Josefina, sit back please!

202
00:17:22,401 --> 00:17:23,993
- Let me be at the front!
- Sit back!

203
00:17:24,103 --> 00:17:25,502
- Josefina, stay still, please.
- Stop it!

204
00:17:25,604 --> 00:17:26,764
I said sit back!

205
00:17:26,872 --> 00:17:28,499
- Stop yelling at her!
- What?

206
00:17:28,607 --> 00:17:29,699
- Sit back and shut up!
- I hate you!

207
00:17:29,808 --> 00:17:31,173
Stop it!
Watch out!

208
00:17:33,078 --> 00:17:33,976
Slow down!

209
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:11,474
Milli!
Jose!

210
00:18:17,823 --> 00:18:18,949
Milli!

211
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:21,958
Jose!

212
00:22:07,886 --> 00:22:08,784
Good day.

213
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:13,686
OK... what's up? Some furs!

214
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:15,054
How much?

215
00:22:15,193 --> 00:22:18,390
I've been paying 20
but make it 18 each.

216
00:22:18,697 --> 00:22:22,098
- Take it or leave it.
- 20 and we have a deal.

217
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,532
- No. I said 18.
- Let it go, Robert.

218
00:22:24,903 --> 00:22:25,801
OK...

219
00:22:25,904 --> 00:22:27,166
18. How much for the hare?

220
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:29,031
And what about the hare?

221
00:22:30,108 --> 00:22:31,473
15 pesos.

222
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:37,712
No. For the hare, I'll give you 10, no
more. And just to give you the business.

223
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:39,875
That's my price.
Can't pay more.

224
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:41,043
Go on, Robert.

225
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:44,455
I won't sell them now.
I'll have to store them...

226
00:22:44,556 --> 00:22:46,717
for at least a year.

227
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:49,419
- Fair enough.
- Help yourselves to some food?

228
00:23:08,747 --> 00:23:09,714
Thanks.

229
00:23:12,884 --> 00:23:15,148
Come on, Cachilo, let's go.

230
00:23:15,887 --> 00:23:17,855
Bye, Santiaguito. Bye, Robert.

231
00:23:17,956 --> 00:23:18,786
Bye!

232
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:19,879
Bye!

233
00:23:22,761 --> 00:23:25,025
You dropped some cards.

234
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:29,667
- Can I take them?
- Yes.

235
00:23:33,905 --> 00:23:35,395
Isn't Betty here today?

236
00:23:35,507 --> 00:23:39,876
She took the little one
to the clinic. He's not well.

237
00:25:18,109 --> 00:25:19,667
Ready, boys?

238
00:25:20,111 --> 00:25:21,408
What for?

239
00:25:22,881 --> 00:25:24,872
To go to Riojano's bar!

240
00:25:53,845 --> 00:25:55,745
There's nothing to do over there.

241
00:25:56,481 --> 00:25:58,210
Why are they asking us to go anyway?

242
00:25:58,483 --> 00:26:01,350
Rosales wants us there anyhow...

243
00:26:01,453 --> 00:26:04,354
even to stand around.

244
00:26:04,756 --> 00:26:06,951
Even if no planes come in...

245
00:26:07,092 --> 00:26:09,856
just for the sake of it.

246
00:26:10,662 --> 00:26:11,754
One more glass, please, Riojano!

247
00:26:12,063 --> 00:26:13,860
Right away.

248
00:26:13,965 --> 00:26:15,762
How was the hunting?

249
00:26:15,867 --> 00:26:19,928
OK. But he's paying less
and less for the skins.

250
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:23,166
Riojano is turning foxy.

251
00:26:23,575 --> 00:26:25,543
He used to pay OK.

252
00:26:27,045 --> 00:26:29,036
Not anymore.

253
00:26:30,148 --> 00:26:32,139
And this one?
Is he learning?

254
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:33,849
Sort of.

255
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:37,851
Good day.

256
00:26:38,123 --> 00:26:39,454
Good day.

257
00:26:40,025 --> 00:26:41,492
- Hi, Betty.
- Hi.

258
00:26:41,593 --> 00:26:43,527
Hi, Johny, how's my top boy?

259
00:26:46,598 --> 00:26:49,567
I'll show you a great hunting spot.

260
00:26:49,901 --> 00:26:52,734
He'll have a good chance to practice.

261
00:26:52,837 --> 00:26:54,737
There's plenty of beautiful foxes!

262
00:26:58,076 --> 00:27:00,704
- What's that?
- My new cell phone.

263
00:27:00,812 --> 00:27:04,805
- Well, a new cell phone!
- Hello, hello.

264
00:27:14,859 --> 00:27:17,453
You've got to fix that van.

265
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:19,914
- Hello?
- Hello, Victoria?

266
00:29:20,852 --> 00:29:22,820
No, Victoria is not here.

267
00:29:22,921 --> 00:29:24,821
Can I take a message?

268
00:29:25,924 --> 00:29:27,789
Can you put Jose on?

269
00:29:29,794 --> 00:29:32,422
Sir, with Jose I cannot...

270
00:29:32,564 --> 00:29:33,826
Pardon?

271
00:29:34,866 --> 00:29:37,357
- Come on, Santiago!
- Who's calling?

272
00:29:38,636 --> 00:29:40,035
Don't leave it all to me!

273
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,527
Watch your heads, please.

274
00:30:48,006 --> 00:30:51,908
Follow the path, please.
Good morning, Sir. Follow the path.

275
00:30:54,145 --> 00:30:55,908
Taking the bus, Sir?

276
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,140
Then, stay on the path, Sir.

277
00:31:03,021 --> 00:31:04,181
This way, please.

278
00:31:06,224 --> 00:31:07,191
Thank you.

279
00:31:09,227 --> 00:31:11,388
Hello.
Your name, Sir?

280
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:13,397
Your name?

281
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:18,995
35 kilos to Calafate.

282
00:31:23,141 --> 00:31:25,803
- You need to handle things
more carefully. - Good, Sir.

283
00:31:25,977 --> 00:31:27,877
Careful, that's very fragile.

284
00:31:28,513 --> 00:31:29,605
OK, Rosales.

285
00:31:30,515 --> 00:31:33,416
Another 25 kilos to Calafate.

286
00:32:13,124 --> 00:32:15,183
Was it that bad? Your work.

287
00:32:17,595 --> 00:32:19,187
No. Sort of.

288
00:32:32,643 --> 00:32:35,134
Or, did you leave a woman behind, ah?

289
00:32:39,817 --> 00:32:40,806
No.

290
00:32:50,928 --> 00:32:52,793
OK, Riojano.

291
00:33:01,873 --> 00:33:04,364
- Hi, Betty.
- Hi. How are you?

292
00:33:04,475 --> 00:33:05,703
- How are things?
- Fine... and you?

293
00:33:05,843 --> 00:33:08,073
- Can I have some ice?
- Just a minute.

294
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:10,546
Listen...

295
00:33:10,748 --> 00:33:13,615
We should fix a date.

296
00:33:20,825 --> 00:33:23,419
Stop the chatting.
There's work to do.

297
00:33:29,534 --> 00:33:31,695
Go, you're my man Robert!

298
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:46,881
There Jonny, great!

299
00:33:47,718 --> 00:33:49,049
Thanks, mate.

300
00:33:49,787 --> 00:33:51,812
It's all a fix. Favouritism.

301
00:33:51,923 --> 00:33:55,017
Let's go, Dad.
See you later.

302
00:33:55,259 --> 00:33:56,453
Bye.

303
00:33:56,828 --> 00:33:58,819
- Sorry, boys.
- Hurry up!

304
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,488
Pass me my jacket, will you?

305
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,466
- Good evening.
- Bye, Cacique.

306
00:34:08,806 --> 00:34:10,000
It's real punishment.

307
00:34:11,476 --> 00:34:14,138
Melchora's been in agony
for two years now.

308
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,847
It's killing him.

309
00:34:17,548 --> 00:34:19,709
No, it's his wife who's dying.

310
00:34:30,595 --> 00:34:33,393
Stop! Stop! Stop!

311
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:36,834
What's wrong?

312
00:34:37,902 --> 00:34:39,733
What is it, Santiago?

313
00:34:42,707 --> 00:34:44,072
What did you see?

314
00:34:51,916 --> 00:34:52,883
Get out of the way!

315
00:34:54,919 --> 00:34:56,944
What did you see, Santiago?

316
00:35:04,729 --> 00:35:07,562
What's wrong, asshole?

317
00:35:07,765 --> 00:35:10,529
Nothing.
It was nothing.

318
00:35:14,172 --> 00:35:15,764
You're such a dickhead!

319
00:35:44,569 --> 00:35:50,007
Good morning. TWR Foxtrot Alfa 510,
from Comodoro to Rio Turbio.

320
00:35:50,841 --> 00:35:55,210
It's a Papa Alfa 28.
Flying VFR 075.

321
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,412
Request runaway conditions.
Over.

322
00:35:58,849 --> 00:36:01,340
Good morning, Foxtrot Alfa 510!

323
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,683
Weather conditions here...

324
00:36:04,855 --> 00:36:07,119
are below the minimum.

325
00:36:07,825 --> 00:36:13,161
You'll have to decide...
whether to cancel the flight.

326
00:36:13,431 --> 00:36:14,693
Over.

327
00:36:15,132 --> 00:36:16,929
Will you pour me some tea?

328
00:36:17,034 --> 00:36:18,501
Yes.

329
00:36:19,537 --> 00:36:21,698
This flight is turning around.

330
00:36:21,806 --> 00:36:23,637
The weather's too rough.

331
00:36:23,741 --> 00:36:25,504
Awful weather.

332
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:29,442
How many passengers are downstairs?

333
00:36:29,547 --> 00:36:31,913
- Five.
- Five.

334
00:36:37,822 --> 00:36:39,881
Can I have your attention, please?

335
00:36:43,928 --> 00:36:45,987
Please, Sir, wake up.

336
00:36:48,566 --> 00:36:50,397
Wake up, please, Sir.

337
00:36:51,902 --> 00:36:56,430
Sir? I'm afraid the
flight's been cancelled.

338
00:36:56,574 --> 00:36:58,804
Not again! Goddam it!

339
00:36:59,477 --> 00:37:01,468
I'm sorry you waited in vain.

340
00:37:01,579 --> 00:37:04,514
- My family's waiting!
- I gotta get to work, boss.

341
00:37:04,715 --> 00:37:08,344
- What am I supposed to do now?
- I've just been informed myself.

342
00:37:09,053 --> 00:37:12,819
We inform all passengers
travelling on flight 097...

343
00:37:12,923 --> 00:37:17,519
to El Calafete and Santa Cruz,
that due to...

344
00:37:17,628 --> 00:37:20,756
critical runway conditions,
the flight has been cancelled.

345
00:37:20,865 --> 00:37:23,163
We apologise for any inconvenience.
Thank you.

346
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,178
Stop the car!
Look over there!

347
00:37:35,446 --> 00:37:36,845
- Let's take it!
- Sure!

348
00:37:36,947 --> 00:37:38,437
The poor thing is lost.

349
00:37:47,725 --> 00:37:48,953
Give me a hand, Santiago.

350
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,868
- Poor thing.
- Have you got it?

351
00:37:58,035 --> 00:38:00,003
Robert, make some room on the truck.

352
00:38:04,842 --> 00:38:07,367
Up! That's it.

353
00:38:11,816 --> 00:38:13,147
A professional job.

354
00:38:15,152 --> 00:38:17,916
- What a stink.
- The poor animal is frightened.

355
00:38:23,461 --> 00:38:25,827
Ride on my brave cowboys!

356
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:36,570
This is some lamb!

357
00:38:36,874 --> 00:38:38,774
We'll have to roast it
at the weekend, right?

358
00:38:38,876 --> 00:38:41,606
Otherwise Rosales and the others...

359
00:38:41,712 --> 00:38:43,839
will want to crash the party.
Parasites!

360
00:38:43,948 --> 00:38:44,915
I guess so.

361
00:38:45,216 --> 00:38:46,615
Hello!

362
00:38:47,685 --> 00:38:50,415
Hello. Yeah...

363
00:38:50,888 --> 00:38:52,788
What's wrong?

364
00:38:53,991 --> 00:38:56,425
Wait! Just a second!

365
00:38:58,129 --> 00:39:00,393
Are you crazy?

366
00:39:00,831 --> 00:39:04,130
Don't fuck with me.
I've got nothing to do with this!

367
00:39:05,803 --> 00:39:07,395
Hello there, Muddy!

368
00:39:11,976 --> 00:39:13,443
Morning, Robert.

369
00:39:13,611 --> 00:39:15,806
Morning, Cacique.

370
00:39:17,848 --> 00:39:19,406
Come on Cacique, we're hungry.

371
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,915
Hi, Santi.

372
00:39:46,644 --> 00:39:48,544
Shit, we've hit a tendon!

373
00:39:53,451 --> 00:39:56,420
A bit more wood
and we're ready to go.

374
00:40:07,465 --> 00:40:09,057
How's your wife, Cacique?

375
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:15,099
I don't know. It's getting worse.
Can't last much longer!

376
00:40:15,673 --> 00:40:18,938
It's been 3 years now.
A terrible illness.

377
00:40:20,911 --> 00:40:24,108
And she suffers terribly.
She's in God's hands.

378
00:40:31,155 --> 00:40:32,713
They're hungry.

379
00:40:32,857 --> 00:40:34,825
They've not eaten
properly for a week.

380
00:40:36,126 --> 00:40:38,890
Robert, your cell phone!

381
00:40:39,997 --> 00:40:41,589
I'm not answering.

382
00:40:42,066 --> 00:40:43,897
Why not?

383
00:40:44,668 --> 00:40:47,899
It's my ex-girlfriend.
She says she's 3 months pregnant.

384
00:40:48,506 --> 00:40:51,839
Pregnant?
When did you last see her?

385
00:40:53,944 --> 00:40:56,003
Three and a half months, roughly...

386
00:40:58,482 --> 00:41:00,950
You're going to be a daddy.
Well done, Robert!

387
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,853
We'll see.

388
00:41:05,222 --> 00:41:07,417
What do you mean, we'll see?

389
00:41:08,158 --> 00:41:10,991
I'm too young,
it's too much responsibility, Cacique.

390
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:13,862
You're 30.

391
00:41:15,766 --> 00:41:16,994
I'm 29.

392
00:41:17,968 --> 00:41:21,870
A baby is always a blessing.
"They bring their bread with them."

393
00:41:23,807 --> 00:41:25,866
That's nonsense, Cacique.

394
00:41:34,051 --> 00:41:36,144
Switch it off, if you won't answer.

395
00:41:37,588 --> 00:41:39,715
Don't piss me off, Santiago.

396
00:41:40,524 --> 00:41:42,185
Easy there, Robert.

397
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,891
Stop it, boys!

398
00:41:48,265 --> 00:41:52,759
Santiago!
Calm down, both of you.

399
00:41:52,937 --> 00:41:54,427
Stop fighting.

400
00:41:54,572 --> 00:41:56,665
Pass me the wine!

401
00:41:57,274 --> 00:41:58,901
Thanks, Robert.

402
00:42:33,777 --> 00:42:36,905
What're you doing, Santiago?
You're disgusting!

403
00:42:38,449 --> 00:42:40,576
Use the fucking bucket!

404
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,881
And take it out!

405
00:43:54,925 --> 00:43:55,789
Hello?

406
00:43:56,026 --> 00:43:57,118
Hello.

407
00:43:57,261 --> 00:44:00,788
- Is that you, Santiago?
- Victoria, put me on to Jose.

408
00:44:00,898 --> 00:44:03,628
Santiago, tell me where you are.
Are you alright?

409
00:44:05,035 --> 00:44:06,696
Put me on to Jose, please.

410
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:08,838
But you can't talk to Jose.

411
00:44:09,406 --> 00:44:11,840
Don't hang up,
tell me where you are!

412
00:44:11,942 --> 00:44:13,432
Put Jose on please!

413
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:16,807
She can't talk to you.
Please, don't hang up!

414
00:45:03,894 --> 00:45:06,954
Look at me, Santiago.
I'm not fit to be a father.

415
00:45:10,033 --> 00:45:12,661
You don't know the mother.

416
00:45:17,641 --> 00:45:20,132
What if a girl called you,
before you came down here...

417
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:23,140
and said she's pregnant
and you're gonna be a daddy?

418
00:45:24,815 --> 00:45:26,146
I don't know.

419
00:45:28,919 --> 00:45:31,888
You couldn't have taken this job,
for instance.

420
00:45:32,656 --> 00:45:35,887
Even with the hardship pay,
the extra pay...

421
00:45:37,661 --> 00:45:39,856
you can't bring up a kid here.

422
00:45:40,898 --> 00:45:42,126
What's he going to do?

423
00:45:42,432 --> 00:45:46,892
Work at Riojano's bar?
Or at the airport?

424
00:45:47,971 --> 00:45:49,632
Become a policeman...

425
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:52,538
or a miner and join these zombies?

426
00:46:18,001 --> 00:46:19,628
Shut the window, Santiago!

427
00:46:27,044 --> 00:46:28,705
Throw me one.

428
00:46:41,925 --> 00:46:45,827
I don't know
Fuck off, Romina! Bye!

429
00:46:45,929 --> 00:46:47,726
I don't care!

430
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:52,061
I can't talk now. Bye.

431
00:46:53,237 --> 00:46:55,068
Oh, piss off!

432
00:47:27,804 --> 00:47:28,828
Hello.

433
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,166
Hello.

434
00:47:39,516 --> 00:47:40,710
Hello.

435
00:47:41,752 --> 00:47:43,617
Hello, Milli?

436
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,068
10 kilos, Sir.

437
00:48:05,442 --> 00:48:06,636
Very good.

438
00:48:10,681 --> 00:48:12,114
- This way.
- Three.

439
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:17,009
The plane leaves in 2 hours.

440
00:48:19,056 --> 00:48:21,581
- Hello, Sir.
- How many passengers today?

441
00:48:21,725 --> 00:48:23,158
There are three later.

442
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,894
- The plane arrives in 2 hours.
- Yes, Boss!

443
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:47,111
Line up the signals.
There's a strong wind.

444
00:48:47,451 --> 00:48:49,942
Once they've finished...

445
00:48:50,053 --> 00:48:52,783
move the tractor to the runway.

446
00:48:53,023 --> 00:48:53,921
Yes, Sir.

447
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:26,387
We inform all passengers
that the flight...

448
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:30,017
arriving from Gallegos
to Rio Turbio was cancelled.

449
00:49:32,462 --> 00:49:33,929
Your attention, please,
all passengers.

450
00:49:34,197 --> 00:49:36,358
The flight was cancelled.

451
00:49:36,466 --> 00:49:38,491
For information
check with the office.

452
00:49:38,602 --> 00:49:39,569
I want my money back.

453
00:49:40,137 --> 00:49:42,970
Did you give someone
my cell phone number?

454
00:49:43,607 --> 00:49:44,505
Pardon?

455
00:49:44,674 --> 00:49:46,733
You did, you gave someone my number.

456
00:49:47,144 --> 00:49:48,441
No.

457
00:49:54,551 --> 00:49:56,781
Someone keeps ringing you.

458
00:49:58,555 --> 00:49:59,886
Impossible.

459
00:50:03,927 --> 00:50:07,761
A middle aged lady.

460
00:50:08,665 --> 00:50:09,893
I don't know.

461
00:50:11,101 --> 00:50:13,865
Don't play smart with me, Santiago.

462
00:50:16,206 --> 00:50:17,867
This way, Boss.

463
00:50:18,575 --> 00:50:19,701
Thank you, Ortega.

464
00:50:19,876 --> 00:50:21,776
Come on, boys.
Here, with the boss.

465
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:24,469
Afternoon.

466
00:50:24,648 --> 00:50:25,876
Good afternoon.

467
00:50:27,084 --> 00:50:29,484
Runway maintenance
has been very poor.

468
00:50:29,719 --> 00:50:30,947
We do our best.

469
00:50:31,154 --> 00:50:33,122
It's not our job.

470
00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:35,524
But, I gave you an order.

471
00:50:36,193 --> 00:50:38,821
We've tried, Mr Rosales.

472
00:50:40,931 --> 00:50:42,990
We try really hard...

473
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:45,068
with what little we have.

474
00:50:45,168 --> 00:50:48,695
We need more equipment.
We tried to repair the runway, Sir.

475
00:50:48,872 --> 00:50:52,569
Watch your attitude, Cacique.
All flights will have to be cancelled.

476
00:50:52,676 --> 00:50:55,941
- We get the day off?
- No. You'll do your regular work.

477
00:50:59,749 --> 00:51:01,740
We'll be out of a job, soon.

478
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:04,948
That's right.

479
00:51:07,491 --> 00:51:08,924
They don't need 5 guys...

480
00:51:09,025 --> 00:51:10,925
to attend one plane a month.

481
00:51:17,701 --> 00:51:19,862
- I'm off, boys.
- OK.

482
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:21,733
- Bye, see you tomorrow.
- See you.

483
00:51:22,205 --> 00:51:24,435
On top of things,
this scum Rosales...

484
00:51:24,608 --> 00:51:26,769
he wants us to fix the runway.

485
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:29,435
What the hell!
It's not our job.

486
00:51:32,749 --> 00:51:34,740
What will you do without a job?

487
00:51:34,918 --> 00:51:39,582
I don't know. Go somewhere else.
I don't know.

488
00:51:58,041 --> 00:52:01,670
Santiago, I'm still
getting calls for you.

489
00:52:04,814 --> 00:52:06,714
Must be a wrong number.

490
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:09,848
What wrong number?
They must've called 10 times.

491
00:52:09,953 --> 00:52:12,478
They don't
get it wrong 10 times.

492
00:52:12,722 --> 00:52:17,921
They want the blonde guy.
They're looking for you.

493
00:52:22,899 --> 00:52:24,491
I've no idea who it is.

494
00:52:27,504 --> 00:52:29,472
Who did you fuck with?

495
00:52:33,076 --> 00:52:35,567
At least tell me what to say.

496
00:52:40,183 --> 00:52:41,810
That I'm not here.

497
00:53:54,958 --> 00:53:56,152
Go get it.

498
00:54:03,566 --> 00:54:05,830
We need a fox.

499
00:54:12,008 --> 00:54:13,976
Hell, there's nothing over there!

500
00:54:18,014 --> 00:54:19,675
It's chilly, huh?

501
00:54:22,585 --> 00:54:24,109
It might even snow.

502
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:38,663
So, Cacique, what's the plan?

503
00:54:38,768 --> 00:54:43,137
Don't worry.
The skins are good quality.

504
00:54:43,573 --> 00:54:45,564
Riojano will try to fuck us over!

505
00:54:45,742 --> 00:54:49,007
Leave him to me.
I'll deal with him.

506
00:54:51,481 --> 00:54:54,143
18... take it or leave it.

507
00:54:54,484 --> 00:54:56,918
Five skins, five times two
equals ten...

508
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:58,817
Settled: 100 pesos.

509
00:54:58,922 --> 00:55:00,412
It's the last time.

510
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:02,353
Will you give us some wine?

511
00:55:02,459 --> 00:55:04,051
Take a seat and relax.

512
00:55:04,627 --> 00:55:05,821
Relax.

513
00:55:08,998 --> 00:55:10,966
A little wine for my friends!

514
00:55:11,601 --> 00:55:13,159
- Excuse me.
- You look happy!

515
00:55:14,571 --> 00:55:15,936
Polenta and sauce.

516
00:55:16,139 --> 00:55:19,575
- What's up, Johnny?
- Nice polenta.

517
00:55:19,709 --> 00:55:20,437
Thanks.

518
00:55:21,478 --> 00:55:22,843
- Hi there, Betty.
- Hi.

519
00:55:22,946 --> 00:55:24,811
- How are you?
- Fine. You?

520
00:55:25,815 --> 00:55:27,840
Can you give me some ice?

521
00:55:28,885 --> 00:55:30,443
Coming.

522
00:55:38,628 --> 00:55:40,653
Always the same story.

523
00:55:40,764 --> 00:55:42,493
He's pulling our leg.

524
00:55:45,101 --> 00:55:47,661
Hello.
Don't you want your dummy?

525
00:56:37,153 --> 00:56:39,178
Santiago! Come here!

526
00:56:41,591 --> 00:56:42,819
Santi!

527
00:56:46,896 --> 00:56:47,920
Santiago!

528
00:56:49,999 --> 00:56:51,489
Santiago!

529
00:57:36,145 --> 00:57:37,112
Don't!

530
00:57:40,817 --> 00:57:42,546
Get your hand out of there!

531
00:57:55,465 --> 00:57:56,864
Yes, that's it.

532
00:58:02,505 --> 00:58:03,699
Come on!

533
00:58:08,978 --> 00:58:10,639
Come on, I said!

534
00:58:45,648 --> 00:58:46,774
Stop it!

535
00:58:47,183 --> 00:58:49,617
Don't! Stop! Stop!

536
00:58:49,819 --> 00:58:50,843
You fucking whore!

537
00:58:52,889 --> 00:58:53,787
What's your problem?

538
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:55,482
Relax...

539
00:58:55,725 --> 00:58:57,852
What's wrong with you?

540
00:58:58,227 --> 00:58:59,592
Let me go!

541
00:58:59,696 --> 00:59:02,631
- Let me go!
- What's wrong with him?

542
00:59:02,732 --> 00:59:04,666
Get out, get out of here!

543
00:59:05,902 --> 00:59:08,393
Faggot!
What's with you?

544
00:59:44,074 --> 00:59:46,975
Tonight I'll go

545
00:59:47,177 --> 00:59:50,908
my breathing slow

546
00:59:51,181 --> 00:59:53,911
far away, to listen

547
00:59:54,017 --> 00:59:58,147
with my eyes closed, to your song

548
01:00:41,999 --> 01:00:44,559
And at dawn

549
01:00:44,801 --> 01:00:48,100
your wise call will reach me

550
01:00:48,805 --> 01:00:51,638
Together like yesterday

551
01:00:51,909 --> 01:00:55,310
will embrace those who are gone

552
01:00:59,016 --> 01:01:00,040
Robert...

553
01:01:02,686 --> 01:01:03,846
Betty...

554
01:01:05,555 --> 01:01:06,920
Can I come in?

555
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:13,096
You always have to begin again

556
01:01:13,196 --> 01:01:15,994
Always have to keep going on

557
01:01:16,633 --> 01:01:20,091
I need to be with you

558
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:23,937
before I die

559
01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:58,969
I travel through dreams

560
01:02:00,844 --> 01:02:05,907
to find you again, my love

561
01:02:07,684 --> 01:02:13,919
in this life or another

562
01:02:14,958 --> 01:02:22,057
My heart is yours, and my soul

563
01:02:24,534 --> 01:02:27,196
My soul

564
01:03:04,074 --> 01:03:06,907
Come on over, Rober!

565
01:03:07,644 --> 01:03:10,044
You idiot!

566
01:03:11,948 --> 01:03:13,916
I made some toast.

567
01:03:19,022 --> 01:03:20,785
How are you feeling?

568
01:03:22,592 --> 01:03:23,923
Why?

569
01:03:24,494 --> 01:03:27,793
I don't know.

570
01:03:28,865 --> 01:03:29,991
I'm better.

571
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:32,660
The Meteorological Service
has issued...

572
01:03:32,769 --> 01:03:36,500
a weather warning for the region
advising the use...

573
01:03:36,606 --> 01:03:38,631
of chains when travelling by road.

574
01:03:38,809 --> 01:03:40,572
On the other hand...

575
01:03:40,744 --> 01:03:42,211
My ex-girlfriend called.

576
01:03:44,181 --> 01:03:45,648
And?

577
01:03:48,985 --> 01:03:50,953
She wants the kid.

578
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:54,953
And you?

579
01:03:57,027 --> 01:04:01,623
Well... if she wants it...
let her have it.

580
01:04:02,232 --> 01:04:03,790
OK.

581
01:04:27,991 --> 01:04:30,687
See what the storm did to the gate?

582
01:04:31,528 --> 01:04:33,621
They'll make us fix it.

583
01:04:36,967 --> 01:04:40,767
But... if this keeps up,
that will be it.

584
01:04:41,771 --> 01:04:42,965
Because of the weather?

585
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:45,904
Right.
We can go hunting with Cacique.

586
01:04:50,914 --> 01:04:53,508
Slow down!
Can't you see it's too muddy?

587
01:04:55,152 --> 01:04:57,643
You can't see anything!
Go easy there!

588
01:05:01,925 --> 01:05:03,620
Stop! Stop, you idiot!

589
01:05:04,561 --> 01:05:05,152
Stop!

590
01:05:11,101 --> 01:05:13,729
You want to drive?

591
01:05:14,571 --> 01:05:17,734
I don't drive, you fucking asshole!

592
01:05:20,544 --> 01:05:24,173
Come on!
Come here you pansy!

593
01:05:46,670 --> 01:05:48,695
Stop that! Are you crazy?

594
01:05:49,973 --> 01:05:51,167
Stop that!

595
01:05:55,979 --> 01:05:57,742
- Hello!
- Try here.

596
01:05:57,847 --> 01:05:59,280
It's Robert.

597
01:05:59,916 --> 01:06:00,940
Hello.

598
01:06:01,918 --> 01:06:03,180
Hello!

599
01:06:03,587 --> 01:06:05,885
We're stuck with the truck.

600
01:06:20,837 --> 01:06:22,065
See if it works.

601
01:06:22,239 --> 01:06:23,866
You answer it!

602
01:06:24,107 --> 01:06:25,631
What!

603
01:06:26,543 --> 01:06:29,740
You deal with it.
It's the old lady calling you!

604
01:06:29,846 --> 01:06:31,575
- You answer it!
- I'm not answering.

605
01:06:31,681 --> 01:06:34,445
I can't keep telling her
you're not here. Come on!

606
01:06:36,253 --> 01:06:38,653
You're going to have
to answer someday.

607
01:06:38,888 --> 01:06:40,219
OK. I'm sorry.

608
01:06:41,024 --> 01:06:43,458
I don't want your excuses.
Your shit...

609
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:45,084
is contaminating my life.

610
01:06:45,262 --> 01:06:46,820
I'll fix it.

611
01:06:47,297 --> 01:06:49,857
You said the same thing last week.

612
01:06:49,966 --> 01:06:51,058
I need time.

613
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:58,730
Playing tricks, Cacique?

614
01:07:04,648 --> 01:07:07,515
- Bring a towel, Johny.
- I'm coming.

615
01:07:23,066 --> 01:07:26,160
Hello, you've reached
Victoria's house...

616
01:07:26,269 --> 01:07:28,601
please leave a message. Thanks.

617
01:07:36,546 --> 01:07:39,947
Listen!
I was waiting for you.

618
01:07:41,217 --> 01:07:42,582
What's up?

619
01:07:42,686 --> 01:07:45,211
You owe me money.
It's been over a month now.

620
01:07:47,791 --> 01:07:49,816
But... why so much?

621
01:07:49,959 --> 01:07:54,157
It's for one month
and your stuff with Betty...

622
01:07:54,597 --> 01:07:56,929
OK, but Betty was
with Robert, not me.

623
01:07:57,033 --> 01:07:58,898
That's your problem and Robert's.

624
01:07:59,002 --> 01:08:00,867
Don't worry.
I'll sort it out with him.

625
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:02,460
- Take it.
- Don't worry.

626
01:08:05,141 --> 01:08:07,575
Can you sort this out?

627
01:08:07,744 --> 01:08:10,975
Give me another bottle, Riojano.

628
01:08:11,681 --> 01:08:13,945
We're celebrating a special occasion.

629
01:08:14,050 --> 01:08:15,745
I'll make an exception.

630
01:08:17,987 --> 01:08:22,890
Listen, everyone. Tonight,
let's drink to our friend...

631
01:08:22,992 --> 01:08:26,894
Robert, who is going to be a father.

632
01:08:26,996 --> 01:08:28,725
Let's do it!

633
01:08:30,934 --> 01:08:31,901
Cheers!

634
01:08:32,469 --> 01:08:33,993
Betty is going to be a Mummy!

635
01:08:34,170 --> 01:08:39,198
No. She's got nothing to do with this.
Sit down and be quiet.

636
01:08:39,876 --> 01:08:41,571
And you, don't worry.

637
01:08:41,811 --> 01:08:42,835
What's happening?

638
01:08:42,946 --> 01:08:44,174
It's not Betty.

639
01:08:44,714 --> 01:08:45,840
Let's try!

640
01:08:45,949 --> 01:08:47,917
Robert has a girl back home...

641
01:08:48,017 --> 01:08:50,611
and he just told me
he's going to be a father.

642
01:08:50,854 --> 01:08:53,084
Congratulations, Robert!

643
01:08:59,662 --> 01:09:01,152
Let's drink till dawn.

644
01:09:02,899 --> 01:09:05,697
I'm going to celebrate...

645
01:09:05,802 --> 01:09:08,896
with my friends, Cacique and Santiago.

646
01:09:09,672 --> 01:09:13,472
We're going to party all night
in Rio Turbio.

647
01:09:13,643 --> 01:09:15,133
Raise your glasses once more!

648
01:09:15,245 --> 01:09:16,712
Good health to everyone!

649
01:09:16,946 --> 01:09:18,038
Cheers!

650
01:09:18,948 --> 01:09:20,415
Cheers!

651
01:09:20,784 --> 01:09:21,876
Good evening.

652
01:09:22,152 --> 01:09:24,086
- Let's go, Daddy.
- A toast.

653
01:09:24,454 --> 01:09:25,614
I'm coming, dear.

654
01:09:25,722 --> 01:09:27,553
Mummy needs you.

655
01:09:28,591 --> 01:09:30,149
Tell mother I'm coming!

656
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:31,625
Come on, then!

657
01:09:31,728 --> 01:09:33,753
Damn it!
Are you deaf?

658
01:09:33,863 --> 01:09:35,160
Tell her I'm coming!

659
01:09:35,465 --> 01:09:35,897
Easy...

660
01:09:37,801 --> 01:09:38,768
Go on!

661
01:09:39,702 --> 01:09:41,602
Start up! Damn it!

662
01:09:42,605 --> 01:09:45,904
- Come on, boys!
- There it goes! There it goes!

663
01:09:46,976 --> 01:09:51,572
Turn it on, go Robert!

664
01:09:51,748 --> 01:09:54,216
Hurry up, faster!

665
01:09:57,954 --> 01:09:59,080
Push hard.

666
01:09:59,622 --> 01:10:00,884
Go on!

667
01:10:00,990 --> 01:10:04,585
Push hard, you bastards!

668
01:10:04,694 --> 01:10:06,127
What's with this truck!

669
01:10:06,729 --> 01:10:09,163
We'll arrive at noon...
and the girls...

670
01:10:09,265 --> 01:10:13,929
will be already asleep. Then,
we'll go to have sex between us!

671
01:10:15,972 --> 01:10:18,463
- Coming!
- Hurry up!

672
01:10:19,576 --> 01:10:21,635
It's almost dawn!

673
01:10:29,319 --> 01:10:32,049
Father, don't go. Mother is sick.

674
01:10:32,155 --> 01:10:33,952
I have to work with the boys.

675
01:10:34,057 --> 01:10:35,922
- Don't, Dad!
- Look after her!

676
01:10:36,226 --> 01:10:37,921
- Please stay home, Dad.

677
01:10:38,928 --> 01:10:39,952
Dad!

678
01:11:07,090 --> 01:11:09,115
I wanna girl!

679
01:11:17,267 --> 01:11:19,735
Take it easy
or they'll arrest us.

680
01:11:29,145 --> 01:11:30,942
Hello, girls!

681
01:11:31,114 --> 01:11:33,947
- Not here, Cacique. Come on!
- This is a book shop.

682
01:11:34,050 --> 01:11:35,950
Where the hell are these girls?

683
01:11:36,085 --> 01:11:37,245
Calm down!

684
01:11:38,087 --> 01:11:40,920
- Where the hell are they?
- Three blocks from here.

685
01:11:41,024 --> 01:11:44,050
We've walked all morning
and still not there!

686
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:45,957
Piss off, Cacique.

687
01:11:46,062 --> 01:11:48,053
You should have a good 'stag party'.

688
01:11:48,698 --> 01:11:50,962
- We're almost there.
- I pay. I'll pay!

689
01:11:58,942 --> 01:12:01,570
Bye. Good luck!

690
01:12:01,678 --> 01:12:03,145
Bye, sweetie!

691
01:12:03,746 --> 01:12:05,543
Come on Robert, I'm freezing!

692
01:12:05,648 --> 01:12:07,843
- Well, tough.
- It's cold.

693
01:12:07,951 --> 01:12:10,215
Come, take me home.

694
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:12,178
Bye, boys!

695
01:12:12,855 --> 01:12:13,913
Let's go, Cacique!

696
01:12:14,257 --> 01:12:17,920
The heat is unbearable.

697
01:12:18,027 --> 01:12:20,689
When things get mixed up...

698
01:12:20,897 --> 01:12:23,923
and roses bloom, midst the nettle...

699
01:12:25,702 --> 01:12:33,632
you no longer know what you know.

700
01:12:34,644 --> 01:12:35,269
Cheers!

701
01:12:36,646 --> 01:12:37,271
Cheers!

702
01:12:39,616 --> 01:12:40,480
Cheers!

703
01:12:40,883 --> 01:12:41,747
Cheers!

704
01:12:42,819 --> 01:12:49,588
It's my party. You must try
some of my stuff. Cacique?

705
01:12:52,028 --> 01:12:55,088
Whatever you say,
but leave me to my coca.

706
01:12:55,965 --> 01:12:57,091
Come on!

707
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:00,159
One shot.

708
01:13:00,536 --> 01:13:04,495
These, my coca leaves, so green
and lush with hope and life...

709
01:13:04,607 --> 01:13:05,539
Santiaguito!

710
01:13:05,708 --> 01:13:11,146
I'm sorry that Santiago will be
left behind, alone like a dog.

711
01:13:12,482 --> 01:13:14,450
Alone like a dog!

712
01:13:16,085 --> 01:13:20,078
Robert, dear, you're gonna be a daddy!
A good old macho!

713
01:13:24,827 --> 01:13:25,816
Here!

714
01:13:25,928 --> 01:13:27,020
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

715
01:13:27,130 --> 01:13:27,960
Cheers!

716
01:13:28,131 --> 01:13:30,964
And you? Stuffing it in, eh!

717
01:13:32,969 --> 01:13:36,097
You too Cacique, go on!

718
01:13:39,308 --> 01:13:40,900
Cheers!

719
01:13:57,794 --> 01:13:59,819
I'm not Mapuche.

720
01:13:59,929 --> 01:14:01,897
Who named you Cacique?

721
01:14:01,998 --> 01:14:05,695
A Gringo son of a bitch.

722
01:14:06,636 --> 01:14:11,767
Many years ago, I first
came here for 6 months but...

723
01:14:12,141 --> 01:14:19,138
I'm still here.
My kids were born here.

724
01:14:19,482 --> 01:14:21,916
Then, they grew up here.

725
01:14:24,754 --> 01:14:26,915
What about your kid?

726
01:14:30,593 --> 01:14:34,654
Don't know.
I won't bring him up here.

727
01:15:25,848 --> 01:15:31,787
God took her with Him
so she would no longer suffer.

728
01:15:32,955 --> 01:15:34,855
She was so good!

729
01:15:46,836 --> 01:15:51,170
Melchora, take me with you!

730
01:16:47,964 --> 01:16:51,900
I'll miss you, Mum.
Please don't leave me.

731
01:16:53,669 --> 01:16:55,967
I'll miss you so much!

732
01:16:56,739 --> 01:17:04,111
We are here to say farewell
to our good friend...

733
01:17:05,014 --> 01:17:10,179
who gave so much to our community.

734
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:13,787
May the Lord bless her...

735
01:17:13,923 --> 01:17:16,084
forever and ever. Amen.

736
01:17:18,861 --> 01:17:21,887
Goodbye, Melchora.
God bless you.

737
01:17:22,498 --> 01:17:26,628
God bless you.
You were so good to us.

738
01:17:27,637 --> 01:17:29,764
May God keep you at his side.

739
01:18:12,181 --> 01:18:13,045
Get off!

740
01:18:26,028 --> 01:18:27,757
Go, leave me alone!

741
01:19:27,156 --> 01:19:28,418
That's right.

742
01:19:30,659 --> 01:19:31,819
Lock it.

743
01:19:33,996 --> 01:19:35,122
Up here.

744
01:19:37,933 --> 01:19:39,696
On the shoulder.

745
01:19:45,141 --> 01:19:45,903
Fire.

746
01:19:50,046 --> 01:19:51,172
Open.

747
01:19:53,983 --> 01:19:54,972
Take out.

748
01:20:00,222 --> 01:20:01,553
Close.

749
01:20:02,691 --> 01:20:03,783
What's wrong?

750
01:20:05,061 --> 01:20:06,460
Close it.

751
01:20:09,532 --> 01:20:10,760
Lock it.

752
01:20:13,702 --> 01:20:14,862
On the shoulder.

753
01:20:19,708 --> 01:20:20,470
Fire.

754
01:20:24,146 --> 01:20:25,579
Fire anywhere.

755
01:20:27,083 --> 01:20:28,675
Try again.

756
01:20:29,151 --> 01:20:33,815
Listen carefully.
You have to look from this point.

757
01:20:36,759 --> 01:20:38,784
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

758
01:20:39,628 --> 01:20:41,095
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

759
01:20:41,630 --> 01:20:43,188
- Standing steady?
- Yes.

760
01:20:44,667 --> 01:20:48,000
Put it down.
Santiago, put it down!

761
01:20:48,170 --> 01:20:49,228
Who's there?

762
01:20:49,572 --> 01:20:51,597
- No one. Put it down.
- Get off!

763
01:20:51,707 --> 01:20:53,641
- Put the gun down, you moron!
- Get off!

764
01:20:53,809 --> 01:20:56,642
- Stop it! Put it down.
- Get off, Robert!

765
01:20:56,745 --> 01:20:58,269
Put it down, Santiago. Please.

766
01:21:07,490 --> 01:21:08,650
Stop, Santiago!

767
01:21:08,958 --> 01:21:10,255
There's no one there!

768
01:21:12,661 --> 01:21:13,958
There's no one, stop!

769
01:21:22,838 --> 01:21:23,736
Santiago!

770
01:21:34,984 --> 01:21:35,916
Stop!

771
01:21:39,555 --> 01:21:40,749
Who's there?

772
01:21:42,992 --> 01:21:45,222
Don't be a dickhead, put it down!

773
01:21:45,694 --> 01:21:46,888
I'm burning!

774
01:21:47,796 --> 01:21:50,264
I won't chase after you, Santiago!

775
01:21:51,634 --> 01:21:52,862
You'll hurt yourself!

776
01:22:17,526 --> 01:22:18,891
Santiago!

777
01:22:28,037 --> 01:22:29,265
Santiago!

778
01:22:57,066 --> 01:22:58,761
What's wrong?

779
01:23:02,104 --> 01:23:04,197
Cover up. You'll freeze.

780
01:23:07,009 --> 01:23:11,036
I miss Milli and Jose.

781
01:23:13,916 --> 01:23:15,907
Go find them.

782
01:23:18,954 --> 01:23:21,923
- Calm down.
- Go find them.

783
01:23:23,726 --> 01:23:27,218
- Calm down.
- Go find them.

784
01:23:27,596 --> 01:23:28,893
Sit up cover up.

785
01:23:28,998 --> 01:23:30,056
Let go!

786
01:23:30,165 --> 01:23:31,632
Stop!

787
01:23:32,968 --> 01:23:37,962
Relax, Santiago, please.
Calm down, Santiago.

788
01:23:42,311 --> 01:23:44,245
Come on, you'll freeze to death.

789
01:24:02,631 --> 01:24:07,728
Please, go get them.

790
01:24:07,903 --> 01:24:11,896
Easy, relax, tell me...
Come here, sit up straight.

791
01:24:13,809 --> 01:24:16,437
Please, Santiago, tell me.
Look at me.

792
01:24:19,948 --> 01:24:21,040
Go on.

793
01:24:27,956 --> 01:24:29,856
Come on, tell me what's wrong.

794
01:24:35,898 --> 01:24:37,160
I killed them.

795
01:24:37,499 --> 01:24:38,932
Who did you kill?

796
01:24:39,968 --> 01:24:41,595
My family.

797
01:24:45,174 --> 01:24:47,039
I killed my family.

798
01:24:47,276 --> 01:24:51,007
- What family?
- My family. I crashed the car.

799
01:24:52,047 --> 01:24:52,945
I killed them.

800
01:24:53,048 --> 01:24:57,678
But... you don't drive, Santiago.
And you have no family.

801
01:25:04,827 --> 01:25:08,490
I was in hospital a long time,
many months.

802
01:25:08,731 --> 01:25:10,892
Jose and Milli were my family.
I kept asking about them...

803
01:25:10,999 --> 01:25:14,127
but no one would give
me a straight answer.

804
01:25:14,737 --> 01:25:16,898
So, I realized what had happened.

805
01:25:17,005 --> 01:25:20,907
What could I do? Wait there and
get the answer I already knew?

806
01:25:21,543 --> 01:25:23,909
So, I pulled off
the I.V.'s and left.

807
01:25:46,702 --> 01:25:47,999
You have to help me.

808
01:25:51,774 --> 01:25:56,074
You call home.
I'll talk to Rosales tomorrow.

809
01:25:57,980 --> 01:25:59,504
It will all work out.

810
01:25:59,815 --> 01:26:02,943
Talk to Buenos Aires
and it will all work out.

811
01:26:33,048 --> 01:26:33,980
Hello.

812
01:26:35,584 --> 01:26:37,677
- Hello.
- Victoria, please.

813
01:26:38,153 --> 01:26:39,586
Santiago?

814
01:26:40,956 --> 01:26:43,550
- Is that you?
- Milli?

815
01:26:43,826 --> 01:26:45,851
Tell me where you are.
Don't hang up.

816
01:26:45,961 --> 01:26:47,622
Victoria? Who is this?
Milli?

817
01:26:47,729 --> 01:26:48,923
Are you dumb?

818
01:26:49,031 --> 01:26:50,931
Santiago, listen.
Please calm down.

819
01:26:51,033 --> 01:26:52,591
We need to talk.

820
01:26:52,968 --> 01:26:56,927
Please, Santi, we have to talk...
Where are you?

821
01:26:57,039 --> 01:26:59,132
I'll come and get you, please.

822
01:27:01,677 --> 01:27:04,043
I can't take this anymore.

823
01:27:04,446 --> 01:27:07,643
Where are you?

824
01:27:10,853 --> 01:27:13,981
Talk to me, say something!

825
01:27:25,567 --> 01:27:27,899
Hurry up. The plane's coming in.

826
01:27:28,003 --> 01:27:29,231
Right.

827
01:27:33,809 --> 01:27:35,071
Just one minute, everyone.

828
01:27:37,112 --> 01:27:39,842
We're saying farewell to a
fellow worker.

829
01:27:39,948 --> 01:27:44,908
A civilian who's leaving for
better pastures. Let's make a toast.

830
01:27:45,020 --> 01:27:47,147
I'm giving you the go ahead.

831
01:27:47,623 --> 01:27:48,590
Go ahead.

832
01:27:49,958 --> 01:27:51,084
Cheers!

833
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:52,927
Safe journey.

834
01:27:53,028 --> 01:27:54,518
Good luck!

835
01:27:54,630 --> 01:27:55,756
The best of luck.

836
01:27:56,098 --> 01:27:57,622
Cheers, Cacique.

837
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:02,903
Hand me Santiago's present, please.
A souvenir...

838
01:28:03,005 --> 01:28:04,563
- to remember us by.
- Thanks.

839
01:28:05,974 --> 01:28:08,442
A little local handicraft for you.

840
01:28:08,544 --> 01:28:09,806
Thank you.

841
01:28:09,912 --> 01:28:11,004
Let's hope he remembers us.

842
01:28:11,113 --> 01:28:12,580
It's beautiful.

843
01:28:13,649 --> 01:28:15,674
Well, then, off to work.

844
01:28:15,784 --> 01:28:19,413
Plane's coming in.
Come on, let's go.

845
01:28:19,521 --> 01:28:21,079
TWR, do you read me?

846
01:28:21,957 --> 01:28:25,484
TWR, do you read me?

847
01:28:27,996 --> 01:28:29,520
Over.

848
01:28:29,731 --> 01:28:31,892
I request runway
conditions for landing.

849
01:28:32,668 --> 01:28:35,603
All clear for landing.
No animals on the runway.

850
01:28:35,704 --> 01:28:37,569
All ready.

851
01:28:37,940 --> 01:28:39,100
Your stuff.

852
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:44,907
Good luck, Santiago.

853
01:28:45,714 --> 01:28:46,908
Thanks, Cacique.

854
01:28:47,282 --> 01:28:48,579
Take care.

855
01:28:49,184 --> 01:28:50,549
Thanks for everything.

856
01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:53,552
We'll miss you.
Call us some time.

857
01:28:57,559 --> 01:28:58,583
Bye.

858
01:28:59,628 --> 01:29:00,720
Robert...

859
01:29:00,896 --> 01:29:03,091
- Bye, my friend. Take care.
- OK.

860
01:29:05,934 --> 01:29:07,094
What about you?

861
01:29:07,469 --> 01:29:11,132
I don't know.
She'll come here with the kid...

862
01:29:11,740 --> 01:29:13,970
and we'll take off.

863
01:29:14,910 --> 01:29:16,002
OK.

864
01:29:23,018 --> 01:29:24,747
This way, please.

865
01:29:29,925 --> 01:29:33,088
Head towards the plane.
Safe flight.

866
01:29:33,195 --> 01:29:34,560
Thanks.

867
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:39,861
Don't forget to call.

868
01:29:43,839 --> 01:29:44,828
Bye, my friend.

869
01:29:44,940 --> 01:29:46,032
Bye.

870
01:29:46,541 --> 01:29:49,135
- Ring me on the cell phone.
- Sure.

871
01:33:55,957 --> 01:33:57,720
Shall we go for a walk?

872
01:34:10,772 --> 01:34:12,637
I've quit smoking.
