1
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,800
Mother, what are you...

2
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,200
I thought you were a burglar.

3
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,760
I didn't mean to scare you darling,
I was just getting a snack.

4
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,140
Go back to bed.

5
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,810
What's the matter?

6
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,040
Go on, back to bed.

7
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,370
I'll make you hot chocolate.

8
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,400
Who are you?

9
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,420
And what have you done with my mother?

10
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,300
**My  mother has never set footin this kitchen in her life.**</i>

11
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,020
<i>**And she certainly never made me
hot chocolate.**</i>

12
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,430
<i>**Unless you count ordering the maid to do it.**</i>

13
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:47,040
You're not scared of me?

14
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:50,250
I always believed I couldn't be the
only one in the world.

15
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,830
The only person who is...

16
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,590
...different.

17
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,550
And here you are.
Charles Xavier.

18
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,570
Raven.

19
00:04:05,00 --> 00:04:06,950
You're hungry and alone...

20
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,480
Take whatever you want.

21
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,920
We've got lots of food,
you don't have to steal.

22
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,310
In fact...

23
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:17,130
...you never have to steal again.

24
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,710
Heterochromia.

25
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:12,020
A gentlemen would at least offer
to buy me a drink first.

26
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,450
Newman, a pint of bitter for me
and a brandy for the lady, please.

27
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,770
- How did you know that?
- Lucky guess.

28
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,550
The name's Xavier,
Charles Xavier.

29
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,730
- How do you do...
- Amy.

30
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,720
Heterochromia is in reference to your eyes,

31
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,080
which I have to say are stunning.

32
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,460
One green, one blue. It's a mutation.

33
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,910
It's a very groovy mutation.

34
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,240
I've got news for you, Amy.
You are a mutant.

35
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,430
First you proposition a girl,
and then you call her deformed.

36
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,750
How is that seduction technique working for you?

37
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,300
I'll tell you in the morning.

38
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,980
No, seriously though, you mustn?t knock it.

39
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,990
Mutation took some single celled organisms

40
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:47,080
to being the dominant form of
reproductive life on this planet.

41
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,180
Infinite forms of variation with each generation.

42
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,320
All through, mutation.

43
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,350
Then let's reclaim that word.

44
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,300
- Mutant and proud.
- Chin, chin, hey.

45
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,350
Hi, I guess I have to buy my own drink.

46
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,370
I'm sorry, one cola.

47
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,510
Charles here was just telling me that I'm

48
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,660
like one of the first sea creatures that grew legs.

49
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,990
Tiny bit sexier.

50
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,340
I'm sorry, this is my sister, Raven.

51
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,310
-Hi, Amy.
-And what do you study?

52
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,650
- Waitressing.
- Aah.

53
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,230
Oh look, you have heterochromia too!

54
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,450
- Say what?
- Look at her eye..

55
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,700
Right, Raven get your coat please.

56
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,240
Don't talk to me, you did
that on purpose.

57
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,570
- I did not!
- Yes you did!

58
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,060
Why would I do it on purpose?
You know I can't control it sometimes.

59
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:40,100
- When I'm stressed or tired..
- You seem to be doing a perfectly
good job right now.

60
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,510
"Mutant and proud"

61
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:45,960
Why is it always the pretty mutations
or invisible ones like yours.

62
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,570
If you're a freak, better hide.

63
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,500
You're being ridiculous!

64
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:51,840
Look, I don't mean to
sound like an old fart.

65
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,320
- Which you are.
- Sometimes, but we've talked about this, Raven.

66
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,760
A small slip up is one thing.
A big one does not bear thinking about.

67
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,330
"Mutant and proud"

68
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,500
"Mutant and proud"?

69
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,820
If only...

70
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,410
- Would you date me?
- Of course I would.

71
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,370
Any young man would be lucky to have you.

72
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,660
- You're stunning!
- Looking like this?

73
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,560
Like, you...what?

74
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,090
Blue?

75
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,460
- You're my oldest friend.
- I'm your only friend.

76
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,300
Thank you for that.

77
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,660
Well?

78
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,500
I'm incapable of thinking of you that way,
I feel responsible for you.

79
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,560
Anything else would just feel wrong.

80
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,330
- But what if you didn't know me?
- Unfortunately I do know you.

81
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,620
I don't know what's got into you lately?
You're awfully concerned with your looks.

82
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:11,180
I'm sleepy.
Will you read to me?

83
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,150
I can't, I have my thesis coming up, I have to study.

84
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:16,380
Well fine. Read that new thesis
it always sends me right off.

85
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:20,080
To Homo Neanderthalensis,
his  mutant cousin Homo Sapiens,

86
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,820
was an aberration.

87
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,770
Peaceful co-habitation, if ever it existed,

88
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,200
was short lived.

89
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,550
Records show, without exception, that the
arrival of the mutated human species

90
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:35,430
in any region was followed by the immediate
extinction of their less evolved kin.

91
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:47,490
Another day at the office.

92
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,810
Is that Colonel Hendry?

93
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:52,320
- The NATO guy?
- Yeah.

94
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,800
Yes it is.

95
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,370
'Cause that's three mob bosses,

96
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,330
the Italian ambassador
and the CEO of Lockheed.

97
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,830
They can't all be communists.
This Hellfire club's gotta be something else.

98
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:09,390
Do you see that?
Hello, girls!

99
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,130
Wow, very nice.

100
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,610
Wha...what are you doing?

101
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,280
Using some equipment the CIA didn't give me.

102
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,540
Stay put.

103
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,180
- Colonel Hendry?
- Yes, ma'am.

104
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,210
Emma Frost,
Sebastian Shaw's associate.

105
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,340
And where is Mr. Shaw?

106
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:33,740
We're having a party and here's the entertainment.
Come with me.

107
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,820
Hello beautiful, how are you?

108
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:15,130
Hey baby, you want to find a quiet place?

109
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:18,520
I'm so sorry.
I've been booked by Colonel Hendry.

110
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,010
Excuse me.

111
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:44,870
- Are you sure we can't get you a refill, Bob?
- No.

112
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,290
So, I hear you blocked the proposal to position
Jupiter missiles in Turkey.

113
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:56,150
- I expect you'll reconsider.
- We've had this conversation.

114
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:59,970
You put our nukes in Turkey,
or anywhere that close to Russia,

115
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:03,540
and you're looking at war.
Nuclear war.

116
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:38,710
I don't ask for favors, Colonel.
I express my expectations.

117
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:46,430
So, let me say it again.
I expect you'll reconsider.

118
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:52,050
The only thing I will reconsider
is having another glass of that delicious champagne.

119
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:06,650
What the hell did you put in my drink?

120
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:27,690
<i>**You're thinking of running, hiding?
We'd find you, Hendry.**</i>

121
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,720
<i>**There's not a fortress in the world
that can keep us out.**</i>

122
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,790
Magnificent, isn't she, Bob?

123
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:54,140
Genetic mutation, the evolution of the human genome.

124
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,040
Where's Azazel?

125
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,800
Ah, we don't want the Colonel to be late.

126
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,00
Come here.

127
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,370
Missiles in Turkey send a very clear message.

128
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,710
We ever decide to fire them,

129
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:18,260
the Russian early warning system won't
even have time to kick in.

130
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,840
This better be important, MacTaggert

131
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,330
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

132
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:24,460
You smoking them funny cigarettes?
People don't disappear.

133
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,490
Colonel Hendry was there.
He was there McCone, in the Hellfire club.

134
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,050
Colonel Hendry?

135
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:32,830
I agree with you, General.
I've reconsidered my position.

136
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:36,00
And I now believe that we should put
Jupiter Missiles in Turkey.

137
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,110
Colonel Hendry is here.

138
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,800
So, unless he magically traveled
3,000 miles in the last ten minutes,

139
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,650
Listen to me, I suggest that you stop
wasting my time.

140
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,450
Looks like Hendry wants to start
World War III.

141
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,270
I have better things to deal with right now, MacTaggert.

142
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:49,760
Sir, I...!

143
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,520
Have you lost your mind?

144
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,910
So, now what?

145
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,830
We find an expert on genetic mutation.

146
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:03,600
<i>Professor of genetics,
Charles Francis Xavier.</i>

147
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,220
So, how does it feel to be a professor?

148
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:11,600
Oh, don't call me that. You don't get to be called a
Professor until you actually have a teaching position.

149
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:15,110
- I know, but it suits you.
- No, don't say that, do say "Lets go have a drink" tho.

150
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,580
- Let's go have a drink.
- Wonderful!

151
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,360
Let's just say I'm Frankenstein's monster.

152
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,110
I'm looking for my creator.

153
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:32,740
Drink, drink, drink!

154
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,750
Oh, I'm so proud of  you.

155
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,570
I need another drink and you
need another cola.

156
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:59,050
- Congratulations, Professor!
- Thank you very much, it's much harder than it looks, actually..

157
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,110
- No, on your presentation.
- Oh, you were at my presentation?

158
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,930
How nice of you, thank you very much.

159
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,620
- Moira MacTaggert.
- Charles Xavier.

160
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,360
Do you have a minute?

161
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:09,710
For a pretty little beam with a
mutated MCR-1 gene, I have five.

162
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:14,250
I say MCR-1, you would say
auburn hair.

163
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,870
It's a mutation, it's a very groovy mutation.

164
00:25:18,00 --> 00:25:22,360
Mutation, right, took us from single
celled organisms,

165
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,210
to the dominant form...

166
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:28,310
You know what, this routine may go over great
with the co-eds, but I'm here on business.

167
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,960
- What?
- I really need your help.

168
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,940
All right.

169
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:36,260
The kind of mutations that you were
talking about in your thesis

170
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,750
I need to know if they may have already happened.

171
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,840
In people alive today.

172
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:53,930
Professor?

173
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,410
I think we should just talk when you're sober.

174
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,850
Do you have any time tomorrow?

175
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:04,120
Something tells me you already know
the answer to your question.

176
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,390
This is very important to me.

177
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:09,990
And if I can help you, I will do my utmost.

178
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:11,670
Thank you.

179
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,660
- Still drinking champagne, Bob?
- I will pass.

180
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:22,240
Okay, well so much for the pleasantries.

181
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:26,070
I was wondering, who you told
about our little arrangement?

182
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,690
No one.

183
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,220
- He's telling the truth.
- Good.

184
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,220
Well I guess we're done here.
Let's wrap things up, shall we?

185
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:42,670
Well I knew better than to trust you.

186
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:46,740
Now you let me walk out of here
with my money.

187
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,630
Or I will pull this pin and we all die.

188
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:54,350
Go ahead, pull it.

189
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,950
I'll do it, I swear to god.

190
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,720
No you won't.

191
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:12,900
But I will.

192
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,710
You're one of them?

193
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:30,490
Very astute of you, Colonel Hendry.
You want to guess what I can do?

194
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,380
I've got the power to absorb energy.
It keeps me young.

195
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:34,950
That's the boring part.

196
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,570
The fun stuff is what I can do with it
once I got it.

197
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:48,830
The advent of the nuclear age
may have accelerated the mutation process.

198
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:53,570
Individuals with extraordinary abilities may
already be among us.

199
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,360
Thank you very much.

200
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,00
MacTaggert, you really think that some crackpot scientist,

201
00:27:58,00 --> 00:28:01,450
is going to make me believe in sparkly dames
and vanishing men?

202
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:04,210
You just bought yourself a one way ticket
back to the typing pool.

203
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,860
This meeting is over.

204
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:08,310
Uh, please sit down agent, MacTaggert.

205
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,670
I didn't really expect you to believe me.

206
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,500
Given that all you could think about during my presentation

207
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,100
was what sort of pie they were serving in the commissary.

208
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,910
It's apple pecan.

209
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,430
I haven't been entirely honest with you, luv, I'm sorry.

210
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:25,320
You see, one of the many spectacular things my
mutation allows me to do

211
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,230
is that I can read your  mind.

212
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,210
I've seen this before in a magic show.

213
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,990
Are you gonna ask us to think of a number
between one and ten now?

214
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:34,700
No, agent Stryker.

215
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:38,060
Although I could ask  you about your son William who
you were thinking about,

216
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,470
which is very nice, but I think
I'd rather ask you about the Jupiter...

217
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,100
...missiles America are currently placing in Turkey.

218
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:48,490
He's a goddamn spy!
You brought a goddamn spy!

219
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,450
I did not, I would never have brought him here!

220
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,340
How's that for a magic trick?

221
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,590
Best I've ever seen.

222
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,580
I want them out of here.

223
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:20,760
And locked down until I can figure out
what to do.

224
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,810
My facility is off site. I'll take them.

225
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,150
I can't believe this.

226
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:30,610
You'd think the director of the CIA
would have a little more composure.

227
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,050
We should be going after Shaw right now, but...

228
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,090
...instead he's up there worrying about the wrong mutants.

229
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,370
What are we doing to do, Lavene?

230
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:38,830
Lavene?
Lavene, what's wrong with you?

231
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,810
<i>**Absolutely nothing, I've just frozen him for a
moment because I'd like to talk to you.**</i>

232
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,050
<i>**It's good, isn't it?**</i>

233
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,840
<i>**I'm as interested in this Sebastian Shaw as you are,**</i>

234
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,830
<i>**...and if you still want my help, meet me on
the third floor of the parking garage.**</i>

235
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,670
I've always known that there were people like
you out there.

236
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:59,150
I've been the laughing stock of this agency
for years but I knew it.

237
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,270
You're going to love my facility.

238
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,090
- That's going to have to wait.
- Why?

239
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,030
Agent MacTaggert has to lead us to Sebastian Shaw,

240
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:06,360
and if we don't move now apparently
we're going to lose him.

241
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,200
What?

242
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:10,350
Not only can he read minds,
he can communicate with them as well.

243
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,180
Moria and I have just had a lovely conversation.

244
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,130
- Yes, we did.
- That is incredible!

245
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:18,510
But I cannot take you anywhere else,
without permission from upstairs.

246
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,680
- Would you like to see one more magic trick?
- Okay.

247
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,310
- Get in the car.
- Good idea.

248
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:43,930
Herr Doctor...

249
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,710
He's here to kill you.

250
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,800
Emma...

251
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,680
We don't harm our own kind.

252
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:22,650
Ah, now it's a party.

253
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:28,100
This is the US Coast Guard.
Do not attempt to move your vessel.

254
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,960
Stay where you are.

255
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,160
They have a telepath.

256
00:31:41,00 --> 00:31:42,250
I've lost Shaw!

257
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,210
I've lost, I've lost Shaw.

258
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:47,00
There's, there's something blocking me.
This has never happened to me before.

259
00:31:47,00 --> 00:31:48,740
I think there's someone like
me on that ship.

260
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:51,560
- Like you?
- I'm sorry, a telepath.

261
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,560
This is incredible, I can actually feel
her inside my mind.

262
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:56,420
I'm very sorry, but I don't think I'm
going to be much help to you tonight.

263
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,480
You're on your own.

264
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,120
- Oh my god.
- Jesus.

265
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,450
Get inside.

266
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,710
Stop, stop, stop!

267
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:27,290
Charles!
You okay?

268
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,850
There's someone else out there.

269
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:33,870
There!

270
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:37,800
Time to go.

271
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,090
Let go!

272
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,320
Better let it go!

273
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,150
You've got help him...there's
someone in the water, help him!

274
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,550
Let it go!
You have to let it go!

275
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,830
<i>**You can't, you'll drown.
You have to let go.**</i>

276
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:05,540
<i>**I know what this means to you
but you're going to die.**</i>

277
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:09,690
<i>**Please, Erik, calm your mind.**</i>

278
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,130
Get off of me, get off!

279
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,350
Calm down, please.
We're here!

280
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:26,410
- Who are you?
-  My name's Charles Xavier.

281
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,330
You were in my head.

282
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:29,890
How did you do that?

283
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:31,250
You have your tricks, I have mine.

284
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,680
I'm like you, just calm your mind.

285
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:39,660
- I thought I was alone.
- You're not alone.

286
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:44,290
Erik, you're not alone.

287
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,760
Welcome to my facility.

288
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,070
My mission has been to investigate the

289
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:11,530
application of paranormal powers
for military defense.

290
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,870
Or offense.

291
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,140
This guy, Shaw, Schmidt, whatever
you want to call him.

292
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,890
He's working with the Russians.

293
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:19,500
We might need your help to stop them.

294
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:20,460
Marvelous.

295
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:23,180
So we're to be the CIA's new
mutant division, yes?

296
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:25,480
Something like that.

297
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:33,080
It's a supersonic. The most advanced plane
ever built.

298
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:37,270
You should see it in real life.
It's incredible.

299
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:41,080
Hank, these are the special new recruits I
was telling you about.

300
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,130
This is Hank McCoy,

301
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:44,140
one of our most talented young researchers.

302
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,690
How wonderful, another mutant.
Already here.

303
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,390
- Why didn't you say?
- Say what?

304
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,130
Because you don't know.

305
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,870
I am so, so terribly sorry.

306
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,540
Hank?

307
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,550
You didn't ask, so I didn't tell.

308
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:06,320
So  your mutation's what?
You're super smart?

309
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:09,530
I'll say, Hank here graduated Harvard at the age of fifteen.

310
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,320
I wish that's all it was.

311
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,890
You're among friends now, Hank.
You can show off.

312
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,420
Splendid.

313
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,040
- Sorry.
- Yes, yes.

314
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:56,900
- You're amazing.
- Really?

315
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:05,310
The presence of U.S. missiles in Turkey
represents an unprecedented threat

316
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,020
to the people of the Soviet Union.

317
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:10,650
warned Russian Foreign Minister Gromeko earlier today.

318
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:15,920
But he was quick to insist the Russians
would not be the first to initiate any military action.

319
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,270
Yeah, we'll fix that as soon as
we get to Russia.

320
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,880
- Unless the CIA find us first.
- I'll take care of them too.

321
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:28,930
If that telepath gets inside your head,
he won't be as much fun as I am.

322
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:31,220
Already in hand, my love.

323
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,900
The Russians...

324
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,620
...made me this.

325
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:51,380
So, what am I thinking?

326
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,850
I don't know.

327
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:08,280
I was thinking that you are the most exquisite
thing I've ever seen in my life.

328
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,770
And that this needs ice.

329
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:16,780
Fetch me some.

330
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,190
There's a good girl.

331
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:46,820
I, I promised myself I'd find a cure
ever since I was a little boy.

332
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:50,530
You have no idea what I'd give to feel...

333
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:52,770
- ...normal.
- Normal.

334
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,320
Charles has never understood.

335
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:02,830
He's different, but he's never had to hide.

336
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:07,570
Hank this serum that you're making,
it doesn't affect abilities, right?

337
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:10,260
Just appearance.
Normalizes it.

338
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,520
Yeah.

339
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:13,970
Do you think it would work on me?

340
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,500
I can look into it, if you'd like.

341
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,980
That's the least I can do after asking you to
come down here to such a weird request.

342
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:21,840
I have to admit,

343
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,490
usually when guys ask me out they're
not after my blood.

344
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:30,800
S..sorry, I didn't intend to be forward.
I was just...I was excited.

345
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:32,980
You know, the nature of your mutation.

346
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:36,170
If any genes hold the key to changing appearance,
it's yours.

347
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:40,540
Hank, you aren't being forward,
that's kinda what I meant.

348
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:46,300
- No, but I'm just sorry if you thought I was.
- And I'm sorry that you weren't.

349
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:50,100
Go ahead, take the blood.

350
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,200
Sorry, did I hurt you?

351
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,680
Kinky!

352
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:14,090
By the way, if I looked like you,
I wouldn't change a thing.

353
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:43,550
What I know about you, I'm surprised
you've managed to stay this long.

354
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:48,410
- What do you know about me?
- Everything.

355
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,580
Then you know to stay out of my head.

356
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:54,080
I'm sorry Erik, but I've seen what
Shaw did to you.

357
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,840
I felt your agony.

358
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:01,740
I can help you.

359
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:09,440
I don't need your help.

360
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,570
Don't kid yourself. You needed my help last night.

361
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,760
It's not just me you're walking away from.

362
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:18,440
Here you have the chance to be part of
something much bigger than yourself.

363
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,740
I won't stop you leaving. I could.

364
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:28,160
But I won't.

365
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,510
Shaw's got friends.

366
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,770
You could do with some.

367
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:44,500
Hank turned that radar installation into
a transmitter.

368
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,640
It's designed to amplify brain waves,

369
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:49,070
...so it could enhance your telepathic powers.

370
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:51,560
Help us find other mutants for our division.

371
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:53,590
What if they don't want to be found by you?

372
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:55,130
Erik.

373
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:57,050
You decided to stay.

374
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:03,090
If a new species is being discovered,
it should be by its own kind.

375
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:05,940
Charles and I find the mutants,
no suits.

376
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,680
First of all, that's my machine out there.

377
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:09,00
Second of all, and much more importantly,

378
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,620
this is Charles' decision.

379
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:13,470
Charles is fine with the CIA being involved.
Isn't that right?

380
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:19,080
No, I'm sorry but, I'm with Erik.

381
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:21,520
We'll find them alone.

382
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:24,230
What if I say no?

383
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,110
Then good luck using your installation without me.

384
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:42,260
I call it Cerebro.

385
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:45,760
- Isn't that Spanish for "brain"?
- Yes.

386
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,590
Okay so, the electrodes connect
Charles to the transmitter on the roof.

387
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:51,400
When he picks up a mutant

388
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,540
his brain sends a signal through a relay

389
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:56,110
and then the co-ordinates of their
location are printed out here.

390
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:59,280
- You designed this?
- Yeah.

391
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,200
- What an adorable lab rat you make, Charles.
- Don't spoil this for me, Erik.

392
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,690
I've been a lab rat, I know one when I see one.

393
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,760
Okay, great...

394
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,840
- Are you sure we can't shave your head?
- Don't touch my hair.

395
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,560
It's working!

396
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,580
With that Daddy-O, you get a private dance.

397
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:23,460
You cats know it's double for both, right?

398
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:26,490
No, that won't be necessary.
although I'm sure we...

399
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:29,050
We were thinking, we'll show you ours,

400
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:31,020
...if you show us yours.

401
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,370
Baby, that is not the way it works around here.

402
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:38,780
- More tea, Vicar?
- Don't mind if I do.

403
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,540
My turn.

404
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:02,080
How would you like a job where you
get to keep the clothes on?

405
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:09,980
- Where to fellas?
- Richmond, Virginia.

406
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:12,950
Right, so you want the airport, the station, what?

407
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,840
No, we were rather hoping you would
take us all the way.

408
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,510
That's a six hour drive.

409
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,240
That will give us plenty of time to talk.

410
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:26,310
What the hell does the government want
with a guy like Alex Summers?

411
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,530
I hope you're not planning on putting him with others.

412
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:32,140
First guy I ever met who actually
prefers solitary confinement.

413
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:43,940
- Crazy, huh?
- What?

414
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:46,850
You like fish, I like fish too.

415
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:49,860
Maybe we should bite
some time and talk about it.

416
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:54,100
I'd rather go out with the fish.

417
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,450
These fish?

418
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,710
- Excuse me I'm Erik Lensher.
- Charles Xavier.

419
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,320
Go fuck yourself.

420
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:44,770
- There's nothing on radar?
- Nothing.

421
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:46,440
- Sonar?
- Niet.

422
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:49,180
Then we have a problem.

423
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,190
Beautiful, isn't it?

424
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:14,330
The reason we exist.
We are the children of the atom, my love.

425
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:16,060
We have a situation.

426
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,00
The telepath...

427
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,080
I shouldn't be able to feel him at this distance.

428
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:22,280
It's like his reach is...

429
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:24,370
...amplified.

430
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:28,460
They're recruiting.

431
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:31,970
You go on to Russia,
I'll handle him.

432
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:35,230
I can't stop thinking about the others out there.

433
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:37,560
All those minds that I touched.

434
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:43,770
I could feel them: their isolation, their hopes,
their ambitions.

435
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:47,010
I tell you, it's the start of something
incredible, Erik.

436
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:50,040
- We can help them.
- Can we?

437
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:54,030
Identification, that's how it starts.

438
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,020
Then ends with being rounded up,
experimented on, eliminated.

439
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:00,690
Yeah, not this time.

440
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:04,490
We have common enemies, Shaw and the Russians.
They need us.

441
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:05,870
For now.

442
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:12,910
We should think of code names.

443
00:48:13,00 --> 00:48:15,120
We're government agents now,
we should have secret code names.

444
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:19,130
- I want to be called, Mystique.
- Damn, I wanted to be called Mystique.

445
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:21,130
- Well tough, I called it.

446
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:25,720
And I'm way more mysterious than you.

447
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:31,310
- Darwin, what about you?
- Well, uh, Darwin's already a nickname.

448
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:35,280
And you know, sort of fits.
Adapt to survive and all.

449
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:37,070
Check this out.

450
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:52,040
- Thank you, thank you.
- Bravo, bravo.

451
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:55,370
- What about you?
- I'm going to be...

452
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,350
...Banshee.

453
00:48:57,470 --> 00:48:59,070
Why do you want to be named
after a wailing spirit?

454
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:00,800
You might want to cover your ears.

455
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:16,860
Your turn.

456
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:21,500
My stage name is Angel.
Kind of fits.

457
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,910
- You can fly?
-  Ah, hah. And uh...

458
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:37,00
- What's your name?
- How about Big Foot?

459
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,490
Well you know what they say
about guys with big feet?

460
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:41,920
And uh, yours are kind of small.

461
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,550
Okay, now.

462
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:46,360
Alex, what is your gift?
What can you do?

463
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:50,160
Uh, it's not um, I just can't do it.

464
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:52,710
- I can't do it in here.
- Can you do it out there?

465
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:54,630
- Why don't you just do it out there.
- Come on.
-Come on, Alex.

466
00:49:54,760 --> 00:50:00,590
Alex! Alex!

467
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:03,190
That's the spirit.

468
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:04,820
Get down when I tell you.

469
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,510
Get back.

470
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,510
Get back!

471
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:22,060
Whatever...

472
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:39,350
We've got intel that Shaw is meeting with
the Russian defense chief in Moscow.

473
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:41,160
So go ahead, say it.

474
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:43,810
I'm not here to say "I told you so",
you know why I'm here.

475
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:46,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Clearance to bring
along your mutants.

476
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:48,180
Fight fire with fire.

477
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:49,820
Makes sense.

478
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,790
Wait, you're okay with this?

479
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:54,580
Sending in a bunch of untrained
unauthorized freaks?

480
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:58,540
These "freaks" are dedicated hard working people.

481
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,350
Plane leaves for Russia in an hour.

482
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,350
I'm telling you these kids
are not ready for Shaw.

483
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:06,200
I think they're going to surprise you.
They are an exceptional bunch of young people.

484
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:07,370
What the hell?

485
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:20,780
Harder!

486
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:26,690
What are  you doing?

487
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:34,570
- Who destroyed the statue?
- It was, Alex.

488
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:38,570
No Havok! We have to call him, Havok.
That's his name now.

489
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:41,690
And we were thinking, you should be, Professor X

490
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,420
And you should be Magneto.

491
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:47,090
Exceptional.

492
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,040
I expect more from you.

493
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:14,050
We got a problem.

494
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:16,580
- What?
- I'm so sorry, this wasn't on the map.

495
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:24,290
No matter what happens, act normally.

496
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:25,780
I'll take care of this, all right?

497
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:28,430
Now listen to me..

498
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:33,750
To our farm.

499
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,230
Oh, easy, easy.
Take it easy, chaps.

500
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,230
- Where's Shaw?
- I don't know.

501
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:34,950
If she's the telepath, and I read her, she'll know we're here.

502
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:38,090
Let me try something else.

503
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:57,620
Shaw sends his apologies, but
he's indisposed.

504
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:59,100
He asked me to come in his place.

505
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:04,110
But between you and I honey,
I'm a lot better company.

506
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:06,230
Please come in.

507
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:11,830
He's not coming.

508
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:17,780
- So, what now, boss?
- Now, nothing. We're here for Shaw.

509
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,360
- Mission aborted
- The hell it is.

510
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:21,780
- Erik.
-She's his right hand woman.

511
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:23,190
That's good enough for me.

512
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:25,790
The CIA invading the home of a senior
Soviet official.

513
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,380
- Are you crazy?
- I'm not CIA.

514
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:30,310
Erik!

515
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:40,220
So you must be busy planning your next move,

516
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:43,650
but with the Americans refusing to remove
their missiles from Turkey.

517
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:48,070
You know I can't talk about those things, Miss Frost.

518
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:49,850
Emma.

519
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:56,550
And don't worry, you don't have to say a word.

520
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:14,130
He's going to start world war III single handed.

521
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:16,060
- We have to do something.
- Like what?

522
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:18,130
- We're moving out.
- You can't.

523
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:35,300
I'm sorry, I can't leave him.

524
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,050
For god's sake, Erik...

525
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:49,370
Be calm.

526
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:05,950
You're beautiful, so beautiful...yes.

527
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,920
Pathetic.

528
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:20,770
Nice trick.

529
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,220
Who are you?

530
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:28,980
Go to sleep.

531
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:39,280
You can stop trying to read my mind, sugar.

532
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:43,930
You're never going to get anything
from me while I'm like this.

533
00:56:56,090 --> 00:56:57,760
So then you can just tell us.

534
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:01,660
Where is Shaw?

535
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:08,930
Erik.

536
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:16,420
Erik, that's enough.

537
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:26,400
Erik, that's enough!

538
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:36,850
All yours.

539
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:40,120
She won't be shifting into diamond form again.

540
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:43,280
But if she does, just give her a gentle tap.

541
00:58:08,330 --> 00:58:10,850
<i>We are the children of the atom.</i>

542
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,780
<i>Radiation gave birth to mutants.</i>

543
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:17,940
<i>What will kill the humans,
will only make us stronger.</i>

544
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:23,890
Beautiful, isn't it?

545
00:58:26,790 --> 00:58:29,020
This is worse that we previously imagined.

546
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:32,850
We're taking you with us.

547
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:36,520
- CIA will want to question you themselves.
- I doubt it.

548
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,110
They have bigger things to worry about right now.

549
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:46,890
Whoa, all right.

550
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:51,490
- Jesus, man you are killing me.
- Don't beat yourself up, we got a lot of spare time.

551
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:59,070
Oh, I didn't know the circus was in town.

552
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:01,640
Hey come on honey, give us a little, uh...

553
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:05,920
No? Come on, let's see the foot.
There it is, come on Bigfoot let's go.

554
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,870
Hey, hey come on, hey.

555
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,140
They're just guys being stupid.

556
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:17,630
Guys being stupid I can handle.
Okay, I've handled that my whole life.

557
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:20,060
But I'd rather have a bunch of guys
stare at me with my clothes off,

558
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:22,450
than the way these ones stare at me.

559
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:24,640
At us.

560
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,490
What was that?

561
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:37,340
I don't know, but something doesn't feel right.

562
00:59:46,00 --> 00:59:50,150
- No news of Shaw?
- Not a peep, nothing through that back channel.

563
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:04,080
What is that?

564
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:22,590
We have an intruder on the main atrium.

565
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:25,350
- Where are the mutants?
- You take another step, I'm going to put you down.

566
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:27,990
Of course you will, but where do I find
the more evolved people?

567
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:30,740
Send back-up now!

568
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:36,290
Get back, get back, do not leave that room.
We're under attack.

569
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:38,560
- Look out!
- Shoot it, shoot it!

570
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:52,870
Where are the mutants?

571
01:00:53,090 --> 01:00:55,030
Put that man down or we will open fire.

572
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:21,980
Stay here my ass.
Let's go!

573
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:28,730
- Get back!
- We can help, we can help!

574
01:02:27,370 --> 01:02:30,080
Wait, wait, you want the mutants?
They're right through that door.

575
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:31,480
Just let us normal people go.

576
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:32,830
We're no threa...

577
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:42,820
Where's the telepath?

578
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:45,260
- Not here.
- Too bad.

579
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:47,690
Well, at least I can take this silly thing off.

580
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:52,800
Good evening
My name's Sebastian Shaw.

581
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:57,160
And I am not here to hurt you.

582
01:02:57,490 --> 01:02:58,250
Freeze!

583
01:02:59,060 --> 01:02:59,890
Azazel...

584
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:06,240
My friends, there's a revolution coming.

585
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:09,840
When mankind discovers who we are,
what we can do

586
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,660
each of us will face a choice:

587
01:03:12,510 --> 01:03:16,800
Be enslaved, or rise up to rule.

588
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:20,190
Choose freely, but know that if you are not with us,

589
01:03:20,190 --> 01:03:23,540
then by definition you are against us.

590
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:30,110
So, you can stay, and fight for the
people who hate, and fear you.

591
01:03:30,970 --> 01:03:34,960
Or you can join me,
and live like kings.

592
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:42,200
And Queens.

593
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:55,130
- Angel?
- Are you kidding me?

594
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,950
Come on, we don't belong here.

595
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:01,670
And that's nothing to be ashamed of.

596
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,010
We have to do something.

597
01:04:23,210 --> 01:04:26,090
Stop. I'm coming with you.

598
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:30,810
Good choice.

599
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,400
So tell me about your mutation.

600
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:36,640
Well, I adapt to survive.

601
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:43,020
- So I guess I'm coming with you.
- I like that.

602
01:04:49,630 --> 01:04:51,740
- Alex,...............do it!
- Get down!

603
01:04:57,270 --> 01:04:58,650
Protecting your fellow mutants?

604
01:05:00,050 --> 01:05:02,920
It's a noble gesture.
Feels good.

605
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:10,430
Adapt to this.

606
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:43,030
Maybe I wasn't clear enough.

607
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,270
You will make this happen.

608
01:06:51,350 --> 01:06:53,740
Let's see what KGB think about this.

609
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:22,450
Raven.

610
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:30,410
We've made arrangements for you to
be taken home immediately.

611
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:31,980
- We're not going home.
- What?

612
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:35,760
- He's not going back to prison.
- They killed Darwin.

613
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,230
All the more reason for you to leave.

614
01:07:37,450 --> 01:07:38,320
This is over.

615
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:42,700
Darwin's dead, Charles.
And we can't even bury him.

616
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,650
We can avenge him.

617
01:07:50,00 --> 01:07:51,290
Erik, word please.

618
01:07:55,170 --> 01:07:57,670
- They're just kids.
- No, they were kids.

619
01:07:58,210 --> 01:08:00,270
Shaw has his army, we need ours.

620
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:09,160
We'll have to train.
All of us.

621
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:11,740
- Yes?
- Yeah.

622
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:13,840
But we can't stay here.

623
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:16,630
Even if they reopen the department,
it's not safe.

624
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:19,480
We've got nowhere to go.

625
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:23,280
Yes, we do.

626
01:08:23,890 --> 01:08:25,620
The law says we've got to turn her over.

627
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:27,860
The law applies to human beings.

628
01:08:28,090 --> 01:08:31,030
The same laws don't apply to mutants.
They're too dangerous.

629
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:34,850
Times like this, security is more
important than liberty.

630
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:39,850
- There's a war coming, John.
- Yes, but a war with who?

631
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:54,640
Excellent question.

632
01:08:55,630 --> 01:08:57,380
Though I won't call it a war exactly.

633
01:08:58,370 --> 01:09:01,180
That suggests both sides stand an
equal chance of winning.

634
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:18,890
The Russians have sent their warheads to Cuba.

635
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:21,320
We have a week before their ship hits the coast.

636
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:25,540
Our fleet can be on this line,
when the Russian missile ship arrives.

637
01:09:26,210 --> 01:09:30,970
If that ship crosses the line, they will have
declared war against the United States.

638
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:34,770
We will have no choice but to retaliate
with a full nuclear response.

639
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:36,940
Do we agree?

640
01:09:41,870 --> 01:09:43,100
Dispatch the Seventh Fleet.

641
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:49,740
- This is yours?
- No, it's ours.

642
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:58,660
Honestly Charles, I don't know how you survived.

643
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:00,630
Living in such hardship.

644
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:03,400
Well it was a hardship softened by me.

645
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:09,00
Come on, time for the tour.

646
01:10:52,190 --> 01:10:54,920
<i>President Kennedy has
signed a formal proclamation.</i>

647
01:10:55,110 --> 01:10:58,640
<i>Setting up a blockade of all missiles,
bound for Cuba.</i>

648
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:05,660
<i>The Soviet Union reacted by terming it
as step along the road to unleashing a thermonuclear war.</i>

649
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:18,200
- You're sure?
- I'm sure.

650
01:11:19,190 --> 01:11:19,880
All right.

651
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:28,930
No, no I can't I'm sorry.

652
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,270
I can't shoot anybody point blank,

653
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:31,210
let alone my friend.

654
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:33,040
Oh come on, you know I can deflect it.

655
01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:34,480
You're always telling me I should push myself.

656
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:37,800
If you know you can deflect it, then
you're not challenging yourself.

657
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:41,980
What ever happened to the man
who was trying to raise a submarine?

658
01:11:43,010 --> 01:11:43,730
What, I can't.

659
01:11:44,870 --> 01:11:47,240
Something that big, I need the situation, the anger.

660
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:48,780
No, the anger's not enough.

661
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:51,210
It's gotten the job done all this time.

662
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:52,950
It's nearly gotten you killed all this time.

663
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:55,220
Hey, come here.

664
01:11:56,330 --> 01:11:58,270
Let's try something a little more challenging.

665
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:02,450
My stepfather took the possibility
of nuclear war quite seriously.

666
01:12:02,690 --> 01:12:03,590
This way.

667
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:05,760
That's why he had this bunker built down here.

668
01:12:06,00 --> 01:12:08,230
I thought we could use it as a practice range of sort.

669
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:09,830
You don't think I'm going to blow though the walls?

670
01:12:10,130 --> 01:12:12,530
No, he had this place built to
withstand a nuclear bomb.

671
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:14,140
I think it can handle you, Alex.

672
01:12:14,390 --> 01:12:16,420
You know when I do this,
bad things tend to happen.

673
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:20,720
That's because you can't control it.
It controls you.

674
01:12:21,260 --> 01:12:23,840
That's why we're here, Alex.
It's part of your training.

675
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:29,880
What you're doing is incredible.

676
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:32,720
You're hitting a pitch with sound waves that's at
the same resonant frequency of the glass.

677
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:33,780
That's why it shatters.

678
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:36,280
This it's like any other muscle in the body.

679
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:37,290
You can control it.

680
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:41,510
"In each of us, two natures are at war."

681
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:43,340
Robert Louis Stevenson,
"Jekyll and Hyde".

682
01:12:43,630 --> 01:12:44,350
Top marks.

683
01:12:44,830 --> 01:12:46,620
Still it wasn't really about good
and evil tho, was it, Hank?

684
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:49,710
It was about man's animal nature,
and his struggle to control it.

685
01:12:49,910 --> 01:12:50,840
To conform.

686
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:53,050
It is that struggle which is holding you back.

687
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:55,850
Jekyll is afraid of what he could be capable of.

688
01:12:56,270 --> 01:12:57,220
You are too.

689
01:12:57,810 --> 01:13:00,010
If you're serious about me doing this,
you might want to get back.

690
01:13:00,430 --> 01:13:04,280
- Of course, should I shut the door?
- Yeah.

691
01:13:06,830 --> 01:13:07,670
Whenever you're ready.

692
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:16,160
Oh my god.

693
01:13:19,790 --> 01:13:21,700
I will teach you to control this, Alex.

694
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:26,310
You're sure that this will work.

695
01:13:27,00 --> 01:13:29,020
Anything is possible. I based the design...

696
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:31,250
Hank, stop talking.
Come on.

697
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:33,060
Now remember, scream as hard as you can.

698
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:34,910
You need the sound waves to be supersonic.

699
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:36,790
Catch them at the right angle,
and they should carry you.

700
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:40,530
"They should carry me."
That's reassuring.

701
01:13:41,390 --> 01:13:42,210
Good luck.

702
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:44,160
And don't forget to scream.

703
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:56,800
If you want to beat me this time,
you have to set the beast free.

704
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:01,950
On your marks, get set...GO!

705
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:17,990
Oh, congratulations my friend.

706
01:14:18,650 --> 01:14:20,140
Robert Louis Stevenson
would have been proud.

707
01:14:22,290 --> 01:14:23,180
Impressive, Hank.

708
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:25,520
Feet like those, all you need is a red nose.

709
01:14:25,890 --> 01:14:26,780
Right, Bozo?

710
01:14:27,610 --> 01:14:29,00
- I'm done here.
- Thank you, Alex

711
01:14:30,650 --> 01:14:31,540
Come on, Hank.

712
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:45,010
If you're using half the concentration to look normal

713
01:14:45,370 --> 01:14:47,900
then you're only half paying attention to
whatever else you do.

714
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:50,870
Just pointing out something that could save your life.

715
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:57,040
You want society to accept you

716
01:14:57,980 --> 01:14:59,690
but you can't even accept yourself.

717
01:15:06,170 --> 01:15:07,030
Sexy.

718
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:09,050
This is just the prototype.

719
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:11,350
The real one will look considerably better,
it'll be a whole suit.

720
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:16,420
See these sensors measure your energy output,
this panel focuses it and the excess is absorbed.

721
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:18,730
All right try hitting the one in the middle,
just the one in the middle, mind.

722
01:15:19,630 --> 01:15:20,320
Good luck.

723
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:32,990
You gotta see this. Your genes are
extraordinary, you know that?

724
01:15:33,110 --> 01:15:34,870
Your cells age at half the rate of a normal human.

725
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:36,980
When you're forty you will still
have the leucocytes of a teenager.

726
01:15:37,650 --> 01:15:40,810
You have the most incredible cellular
structure I've ever seen.

727
01:15:46,090 --> 01:15:47,740
You truly believe I'll fly this time?

728
01:15:47,990 --> 01:15:49,220
Unreservedly.

729
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:50,790
- I trust you.
- I'm touched.

730
01:15:51,010 --> 01:15:52,320
- I don't trust him.
- Say nothing.

731
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:54,630
I'm going to die!

732
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:57,330
All right, look we're not going to make you do anything
that your not so...

733
01:15:57,330 --> 01:15:58,520
Here, let me help him.

734
01:16:00,380 --> 01:16:01,380
Erik!

735
01:16:12,450 --> 01:16:13,410
Whaoooo!

736
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,180
Wahhh hooo!

737
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:22,750
What?

738
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:24,630
You know you were thinking the same.

739
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:28,990
Wonderful work Hank, thank you very much.
All right Alex, I want you to hit the X.

740
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:31,420
And try not to hit me, there's a good chap.

741
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:34,740
- You're serious?
- I'm very serious.

742
01:16:35,140 --> 01:16:37,010
I have complete and utter faith in you.

743
01:16:49,350 --> 01:16:52,920
- Am I still a Bozo?
- Yes, Hank. You're still a Bozo.

744
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:55,310
But nice job.

745
01:16:58,260 --> 01:16:59,160
See that?

746
01:16:59,950 --> 01:17:01,340
Try turning it to face us.

747
01:17:20,210 --> 01:17:25,370
You know, I believe the true focus lies
somewhere between rage and serenity.

748
01:17:27,00 --> 01:17:29,080
Would you mind, if I...?

749
01:18:01,780 --> 01:18:03,030
What did you just do to me?

750
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:07,760
I accessed the brightest corner
of your memory system.

751
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:11,930
It's a very beautiful memory Erik, thank you.

752
01:18:13,00 --> 01:18:14,790
I didn't know I still had that.

753
01:18:16,00 --> 01:18:17,970
There's so much more to you than you know.

754
01:18:18,630 --> 01:18:23,500
Not just pain and anger.
There's good too, I felt it.

755
01:18:24,470 --> 01:18:26,460
And when you can access all that

756
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:29,320
you'll possess a power no one can match.

757
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:31,810
Not even me.

758
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,670
So, come on. Try again.

759
01:19:14,990 --> 01:19:15,690
- Hey!
-Well done.

760
01:19:16,230 --> 01:19:17,970
The President is about to make his address.

761
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:23,970
<i>It shall be the policy of this nation
to regard any nuclear missile,</i>

762
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:27,280
<i>...crossing the embargo line, that surrounds Cuba</i>

763
01:19:27,570 --> 01:19:31,170
<i>as an attack by the Soviet Union
on the United States</i>

764
01:19:31,650 --> 01:19:35,530
<i>requiring a full retaliatory response
upon the Soviet Union.</i>

765
01:19:35,530 --> 01:19:37,530
- That?s' where we're going to find Shaw.
- How do you know?

766
01:19:37,780 --> 01:19:41,170
Two super powers facing off, and
he wants to start World War III.

767
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:43,420
He won't leave anything to chance.

768
01:19:43,830 --> 01:19:47,390
So much for diplomacy.
I suggest you all get a good night sleep.

769
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:50,070
<i>...ultimately leads to war.</i>

770
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:54,300
<i>Tensions mount as the Soviet Missile
ship nears Cuba.</i>

771
01:19:54,850 --> 01:19:59,00
<i>All diplomatic efforts to avert
Nuclear war have thus far failed.</i>

772
01:19:59,510 --> 01:20:03,580
<i>As the American people ready themselves,
for the likelihood of an atomic attack</i>

773
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:06,210
<i>there are widespread reports of panic buying.</i>

774
01:20:06,970 --> 01:20:08,490
<i>Supermarkets cleared.</i>

775
01:20:08,710 --> 01:20:11,260
<i>As shelters unused since the second world war,</i>

776
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:13,580
<i>are stocked for what may lie ahead.</i>

777
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:17,920
<i>In all its history, America has never
faced a greater threat.</i>

778
01:20:18,450 --> 01:20:21,990
The world is primed for war.
And there's no one to stop me.

779
01:20:27,530 --> 01:20:28,370
Come in.

780
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,160
Hey.

781
01:20:31,450 --> 01:20:32,420
Have a surprise for you.

782
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:44,280
I isolated the right marker in your DNA sample.

783
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:46,570
The serum works like an antibiotic.

784
01:20:46,860 --> 01:20:49,310
Attacking the cells that cause our physical mutation.

785
01:20:49,940 --> 01:20:51,860
It won't affect our abilities,
just our appearance.

786
01:20:55,210 --> 01:20:56,660
Do you still want to do this?

787
01:20:57,990 --> 01:20:59,760
Should we have to hide?

788
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:02,230
You already do.

789
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:05,560
You're hiding right now,
like I have my whole life.

790
01:21:06,670 --> 01:21:09,090
I don't want to feel like a freak, all the time.

791
01:21:09,090 --> 01:21:10,770
- I just want to look...
- ...normal.

792
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:12,00
Yeah.

793
01:21:19,070 --> 01:21:20,450
Hank, don't.

794
01:21:22,270 --> 01:21:26,220
You're beautiful, Hank.
Everything you are, you're perfect.

795
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:31,830
Look at all of us. Look at
all we've achieved this week.

796
01:21:32,170 --> 01:21:33,750
All we will achieve.

797
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:39,990
We are different. But we shouldn't
be trying to fit into society.

798
01:21:41,090 --> 01:21:43,380
Society should aspire to be more like us.

799
01:21:45,010 --> 01:21:47,880
Mutant, and proud.

800
01:21:52,890 --> 01:21:56,470
It behooves me to tell you,
but even if we save the world tomorrow

801
01:21:56,660 --> 01:21:58,740
and mutants are accepted into society,

802
01:21:59,650 --> 01:22:02,250
my feet and your natural blue form

803
01:22:03,270 --> 01:22:04,950
will never be deemed beautiful.

804
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:11,710
You look beautiful now.

805
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:16,500
We need this cure.

806
01:22:42,430 --> 01:22:47,190
Cuba, Russia, America... makes no difference.

807
01:22:48,110 --> 01:22:50,630
Shaw's declared war on mankind,
on all of us.

808
01:22:51,110 --> 01:22:56,830
- He has to be stopped.
- I'm not going to stop Shaw, I'm going to kill him.

809
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:01,670
Do you have it in you to allow that?

810
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:10,150
You've known all along
why I was here, Charles.

811
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:11,820
But things have changed.

812
01:23:12,830 --> 01:23:14,800
What started as a covert mission,

813
01:23:15,030 --> 01:23:17,910
...tomorrow mankind will know that mutants exist.

814
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:20,040
Shaw, us... they won't differentiate.

815
01:23:20,630 --> 01:23:23,950
They'll fear us, and that
fear will turn to hatred.

816
01:23:24,390 --> 01:23:27,440
Not if we stop a war.
Not if we can prevent Shaw.

817
01:23:27,660 --> 01:23:29,390
Not if we risk our lives doing so.

818
01:23:29,660 --> 01:23:30,670
Would they do the same for us?

819
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:32,370
We have it in us to be the better men.

820
01:23:32,610 --> 01:23:34,090
We already are.

821
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:36,010
We're the next stage of human evolution.

822
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:37,660
- You said it yourself.
- Not do.

823
01:23:38,230 --> 01:23:40,030
Are you really so naive

824
01:23:40,030 --> 01:23:42,590
as to think they won't battle their own extinction?

825
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:46,300
- Or is it arrogance?
- I'm sorry?

826
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:49,270
After tomorrow they're going to turn on us

827
01:23:49,420 --> 01:23:52,520
and you're blind to it, because you
believe they're all like Moira.

828
01:23:52,810 --> 01:23:54,550
And you believe they're all like Shaw.

829
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:59,700
Listen to me, very carefully my friend.

830
01:24:00,930 --> 01:24:03,850
Killing Shaw will not bring you peace.

831
01:24:05,470 --> 01:24:07,330
Peace was never an option.

832
01:24:52,090 --> 01:24:53,090
No.

833
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:56,560
No.

834
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:25,090
Well...

835
01:25:27,410 --> 01:25:28,670
This is a surprise.

836
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:30,300
The nice kind?

837
01:25:32,290 --> 01:25:34,580
Get out, Raven. I wanna go to bed.

838
01:25:35,770 --> 01:25:37,060
Maybe in a few years.

839
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:42,910
How about now?

840
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:49,760
I prefer the real Raven.

841
01:25:53,510 --> 01:25:55,930
I said the real Raven.

842
01:26:05,550 --> 01:26:06,900
Perfection.

843
01:26:11,070 --> 01:26:14,260
- Could you pass me my robe?
- You don't have to hide.

844
01:26:19,060 --> 01:26:22,310
Have you ever looked at a tiger
and thought you ought to cover it up?

845
01:26:24,730 --> 01:26:26,310
No, but...

846
01:26:26,580 --> 01:26:28,210
You're an exquisite creature, Raven.

847
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:32,240
All your life the world has tried to tame you.

848
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:34,620
It's time for you to be free.

849
01:26:54,410 --> 01:26:56,330
You know sometimes I wonder
what my life would have been like

850
01:26:56,330 --> 01:26:58,230
if you hadn't found me here that night.

851
01:26:58,790 --> 01:27:00,930
Say what? E..gah...ah.

852
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:03,600
For gods sake, Raven!

853
01:27:04,170 --> 01:27:06,430
Where are you clothes?
Pu...put some, put some clothes on.

854
01:27:06,590 --> 01:27:08,300
That's not what you said when you first saw me.

855
01:27:09,00 --> 01:27:11,460
But I guess pets are always cuter
when they're little, right?

856
01:27:12,540 --> 01:27:14,010
Raven, I don't know what's got into you lately.

857
01:27:14,710 --> 01:27:15,810
I thought you'd be in a good mood.

858
01:27:16,660 --> 01:27:21,320
Hank tells me he's found the
answer to your cosmetic problem.

859
01:27:23,540 --> 01:27:25,850
You going to tell me what's the matter
or will I have to read your mind?

860
01:27:26,070 --> 01:27:27,630
You promised me you would never do that.

861
01:27:27,930 --> 01:27:32,160
Until recently, I never had to use my power
to know what you were thinking, Raven.

862
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:35,830
You know Charles, I used to think
it was gonna be you and me against the world.

863
01:27:36,130 --> 01:27:39,530
But no matter how bad the world gets,
you don't want to be against it, do you?

864
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:40,610
You want to be a part of it.

865
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:03,060
What the hell happened here?

866
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:12,580
Hank has been busy.

867
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:14,420
Do we really have to wear these?

868
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:17,830
As none of us has mutated to endure extreme G force,

869
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:20,880
or being riddled by bullets, I suggest we suit up.

870
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:45,810
Where's Hank?

871
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:49,020
I'm here.

872
01:28:58,490 --> 01:28:59,330
Hank?

873
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:09,280
It didn't attack the cells.
It enhanced them.

874
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:12,760
It didn't work.

875
01:29:13,420 --> 01:29:14,910
Yes it did, Hank.

876
01:29:15,250 --> 01:29:18,890
Don't you see?
This is who you were meant to be.

877
01:29:19,970 --> 01:29:21,460
This is you.

878
01:29:23,210 --> 01:29:24,510
No more hiding.

879
01:29:25,350 --> 01:29:26,360
Never looked better, man.

880
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:28,160
Hank!

881
01:29:29,410 --> 01:29:31,590
Don't mock me.

882
01:29:31,930 --> 01:29:33,450
Hank, put him down immediately, please.

883
01:29:33,590 --> 01:29:34,910
Hank...HANK!

884
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:39,060
I wasn't.

885
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:41,310
Even I got to admit, you look pretty bad ass.

886
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:44,620
I think I got a new name for you: Beast.

887
01:29:46,870 --> 01:29:51,050
- You sure you can fly this thing?
- Of course I can, I designed it.

888
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,010
Status of the cargo ship?

889
01:30:04,630 --> 01:30:07,630
Bearing 1-8-0 at 12 knots.

890
01:30:09,770 --> 01:30:11,930
Three minutes to the embargo line, sir.

891
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:15,010
God help them if they cross it.

892
01:30:17,310 --> 01:30:18,780
God help us all.

893
01:30:19,230 --> 01:30:22,370
- Sound general quarters.
- General quarters, general quarters.

894
01:30:22,630 --> 01:30:25,00
- All hands man battle stations!
- Yes sir.

895
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:27,00
Set Condition Zebra.

896
01:30:27,660 --> 01:30:29,750
General quarters, battle stations.

897
01:30:58,730 --> 01:31:03,290
Gun boss, target cargo ship, bearing 1-8-0.

898
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:32,030
Target ready to be fired upon, sir.

899
01:31:32,090 --> 01:31:34,750
- Stand by to fire.
- Standing by, sir.

900
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:48,580
Looks pretty messy out there.

901
01:32:02,650 --> 01:32:05,300
The crew of the Aral Sea are all dead.
Shaw's been there.

902
01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:07,00
He's still here, somewhere.

903
01:32:07,00 --> 01:32:08,490
He's set the ship on course for the embargo line.

904
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:10,930
That ship crosses the line, our
boys are going to blow it up.

905
01:32:11,330 --> 01:32:12,680
And the war begins.

906
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:15,310
Unless they're not on board.

907
01:32:17,730 --> 01:32:19,800
<i>USS Independence,
this is Alexander Nevski.</i>

908
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:22,340
We have lost control of our cargo ship.

909
01:32:22,340 --> 01:32:25,020
She's been instructed to stop.
Do not fire.

910
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:26,780
Repeat, do not fire.

911
01:32:26,790 --> 01:32:28,530
They've signaled their
cargo ship to turn around, sir.

912
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:33,710
It's a ruse, pay no attention.
Stand by to fire.

913
01:32:33,890 --> 01:32:35,990
- Standing by to fire, sir.
- On my count.

914
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:38,230
Five...four...

915
01:33:00,510 --> 01:33:02,630
Hold on! Hold on!

916
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:11,890
No!

917
01:33:16,410 --> 01:33:19,910
- What was that?
- The Russians, they have fired on their own ship.

918
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:22,380
A little warning next time, professor.

919
01:33:22,470 --> 01:33:23,240
Sorry about that.

920
01:33:23,450 --> 01:33:24,960
- You all right?
- Yeah.

921
01:33:25,710 --> 01:33:27,400
Son of a...

922
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:29,630
Give me CINCLANT (Commander in Chief, Atlantic Command) on the horn, I want a new set of orders.

923
01:33:46,290 --> 01:33:47,970
They say the comrade lost his mind.

924
01:33:48,310 --> 01:33:49,600
The Americans are applauding.

925
01:33:51,870 --> 01:33:52,720
They're here.

926
01:33:52,980 --> 01:33:54,710
That telepath is powerful.

927
01:33:57,250 --> 01:33:58,730
We're moving to a back-up plan.

928
01:34:01,990 --> 01:34:04,170
- That was inspired, Charles.
- Thank you very much.

929
01:34:04,370 --> 01:34:05,550
But I still can't locate Shaw.

930
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:07,680
He's down there, we need to find him now.

931
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:08,740
Hank?

932
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:12,900
- Is there anything unusual on the radar or scanners?
- No, nothing.

933
01:34:13,580 --> 01:34:17,020
Well then he must be under water.
And obviously we don't have Sonar.

934
01:34:18,620 --> 01:34:19,400
Yes we do.

935
01:34:20,420 --> 01:34:21,290
Yes we do.

936
01:34:25,770 --> 01:34:26,940
They were ready for war.

937
01:34:27,180 --> 01:34:29,640
We just need to strike another match
to light the fuse.

938
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:32,530
And we still have the most powerful weapon of all.

939
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:34,190
Me.

940
01:34:34,620 --> 01:34:39,740
Turn the nuclear reactor to 100% output
and make sure I'm not disturbed.

941
01:34:42,740 --> 01:34:44,760
Hank, level the bloody plane!

942
01:34:49,980 --> 01:34:51,980
Whoa, you back right off.

943
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:54,740
Beast, open the bomb bay doors.

944
01:35:02,660 --> 01:35:06,800
Remember, this is a muscle.
You control it.

945
01:35:07,070 --> 01:35:10,950
You'll be in here the entire time.
We'll see you soon.

946
01:35:11,270 --> 01:35:17,180
- On my mark. 3, 2, 1 GO!
- WHOA!!!

947
01:35:32,490 --> 01:35:35,200
Alert the fleet, they may want to take their cans off.

948
01:35:47,350 --> 01:35:49,030
Banshee's got a location on Shaw.

949
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:52,550
You ready for this?

950
01:35:53,260 --> 01:35:54,380
Let's find out.

951
01:36:55,750 --> 01:36:59,890
<i>**Remember, the point between rage and serenity.**</i>

952
01:38:20,230 --> 01:38:21,770
Erik, take my hand!

953
01:38:22,590 --> 01:38:25,1000
Oh, hold on guys, it's going to get bumpy.

954
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:42,580
Erik, take my hand!

955
01:39:14,860 --> 01:39:16,130
Down.

956
01:39:30,930 --> 01:39:33,720
- Moira, Moira, are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

957
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:39,1000
I read the teleporter's mind.

958
01:39:40,230 --> 01:39:42,050
Shaw's drawing all of the power out of his sub.

959
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:44,200
He's turning himself into some kind of nuclear bomb.

960
01:39:44,380 --> 01:39:46,350
We've got no time, the Geiger
counter's going out of control.

961
01:39:46,540 --> 01:39:47,520
All right Moira, this is what we're going to do.

962
01:39:47,770 --> 01:39:49,860
Get on the radio and tell them to
clear both fleets out immediately.

963
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:50,820
I'm going in.

964
01:39:51,060 --> 01:39:52,900
Beast, Havok, back him up.

965
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:54,690
Erik, I can guide you through once you're in.

966
01:39:54,910 --> 01:39:57,160
But I need you to shut down
whatever it is that's blocking me.

967
01:39:57,430 --> 01:39:59,210
Then we just hope to God it's
not to late for me to stop him.

968
01:39:59,210 --> 01:40:00,380
- Got it.
- Good luck!

969
01:40:01,130 --> 01:40:02,950
- Raven, stop!
- I'm going to help them.

970
01:40:03,170 --> 01:40:03,910
We don't have time for this.

971
01:40:04,180 --> 01:40:06,360
Anything comes in that entrance,
you're taking care of it, yes?

972
01:40:07,250 --> 01:40:07,940
Fine.

973
01:40:23,530 --> 01:40:24,520
Beast!

974
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:29,930
If we go, you go.

975
01:40:33,020 --> 01:40:35,200
We believe Shaw is trying to
detonate some kind of bomb.

976
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:42,160
Erik, make to the middle of the vessel.

977
01:40:42,620 --> 01:40:44,210
That's the point my mind can't penetrate.

978
01:40:44,210 --> 01:40:46,340
We have to assume that that's where Shaw is.

979
01:40:55,070 --> 01:40:56,570
Gang way, gang way.

980
01:41:03,630 --> 01:41:06,430
That's the nuclear reactor.
Disable it.

981
01:41:18,090 --> 01:41:19,780
Stop, don't move.

982
01:41:27,350 --> 01:41:28,390
Get down!

983
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:52,950
<i>**Erik you're there, you've reached the void.**</i>

984
01:41:53,050 --> 01:41:54,830
He's not here Charles,
Shaw is not here.

985
01:41:54,910 --> 01:41:57,020
- He's left the sub.
- What? He's got to be there.

986
01:41:57,240 --> 01:41:59,460
He has to be, there's no where
else he can be, keep looking.

987
01:41:59,490 --> 01:42:01,960
And I'm telling you he's not,
there's no one here, god damn it!

988
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:09,150
Erik, what a pleasant surprise.

989
01:42:09,150 --> 01:42:10,830
Erik?
Erik!

990
01:42:13,110 --> 01:42:14,430
So good to see you again.

991
01:42:30,710 --> 01:42:32,260
May I ask you something?

992
01:42:33,810 --> 01:42:35,270
Why are you on their side?

993
01:42:35,750 --> 01:42:36,540
- He's gone.
- What?

994
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:39,580
He's gone into the void. I can't
communicate with him there.

995
01:42:39,860 --> 01:42:42,400
Why fight for a doomed race
who will hunt us down,

996
01:42:42,410 --> 01:42:45,040
...as soon as they realize
their reign is coming to an end?

997
01:43:12,620 --> 01:43:13,910
Yeah!

998
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:29,120
I'm sorry for what happened in the camps.

999
01:43:31,150 --> 01:43:32,540
I truly am.

1000
01:43:40,700 --> 01:43:41,650
He's back.

1001
01:43:42,020 --> 01:43:45,040
<i>**Erik, whatever you're doing keep
doing it, it's starting to work.**</i>

1002
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:49,200
But everything I did,
I did for you.

1003
01:43:49,300 --> 01:43:53,400
To unlock your power. To make
you embrace it.

1004
01:43:56,440 --> 01:43:57,620
<i>**It's working.**</i>

1005
01:43:57,620 --> 01:43:59,920
I'm starting to see him, but I
can't yet touch his mind.

1006
01:44:13,630 --> 01:44:16,110
You've come a long way from bending gates.

1007
01:44:16,620 --> 01:44:17,860
I'm so proud of you.

1008
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:28,350
And you're just starting to scratch the surface.

1009
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:32,720
Think how much further we could go, together.

1010
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:53,960
Stop, Azazel!

1011
01:45:08,330 --> 01:45:11,070
I don't want to hurt you, Erik.
I never did.

1012
01:45:11,630 --> 01:45:12,770
I want to help you.

1013
01:45:12,990 --> 01:45:16,210
This is our time.
Our age.

1014
01:45:17,110 --> 01:45:20,290
We are the future of the human race.

1015
01:45:21,340 --> 01:45:25,530
You and me, son.
This world could be ours.

1016
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:30,730
Everything you did made me stronger.

1017
01:45:32,440 --> 01:45:34,340
Made me the weapon I am today.

1018
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:37,680
That's the truth.

1019
01:45:39,260 --> 01:45:40,790
I've known it all along.

1020
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:48,480
You are my creator.

1021
01:45:49,120 --> 01:45:50,410
NOW, Charles!

1022
01:45:52,190 --> 01:45:52,890
Are you okay?

1023
01:45:53,120 --> 01:45:55,750
Moira be quiet, I can only
control this man for so long.

1024
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:09,920
Sorry, Charles...

1025
01:46:09,930 --> 01:46:12,350
<i>**Erik please, be the better man.
You have it in...**</i>

1026
01:46:12,350 --> 01:46:13,400
...But I don?t trust you.

1027
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:14,840
<i>** Erik, there will be no telling what...**</i>

1028
01:46:16,450 --> 01:46:17,410
No.

1029
01:46:18,310 --> 01:46:20,160
- Charles?
- Don't do this, Erik!

1030
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:31,350
If you're in there, I'd like you to know
that I agree with every word you said.

1031
01:46:33,910 --> 01:46:35,100
We are the future.

1032
01:46:38,020 --> 01:46:39,320
But...

1033
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:44,040
...unfortunately, you killed my mother.

1034
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:54,320
This is what we're going to do...

1035
01:46:54,670 --> 01:46:56,550
No, please Erik, no.

1036
01:46:56,880 --> 01:47:00,350
...I'm going to count to three
and I'm going to move the coin.

1037
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:03,480
One...

1038
01:47:05,170 --> 01:47:06,710
Please, Erik.

1039
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:15,670
Two...

1040
01:47:22,300 --> 01:47:23,370
Three.

1041
01:47:25,150 --> 01:47:27,010
Aaaaaaaah!

1042
01:47:51,400 --> 01:47:54,120
The Russians share our concerns

1043
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:56,930
and will join a strike on all the mutants.

1044
01:47:57,200 --> 01:47:59,160
We can end this threat for good.

1045
01:47:59,380 --> 01:48:01,180
We'll never have another opportunity like this.

1046
01:48:01,240 --> 01:48:02,820
We have an agent on that beach.

1047
01:48:03,110 --> 01:48:06,110
- One agent?
- She's a good agent.

1048
01:48:06,350 --> 01:48:07,740
She's collateral damage.

1049
01:48:13,410 --> 01:48:15,480
Today our fighting stops.

1050
01:48:39,150 --> 01:48:41,900
Take off your blinders, brothers and sisters.

1051
01:48:42,250 --> 01:48:43,910
The real enemy is out there.

1052
01:48:45,630 --> 01:48:47,750
I feel their guns moving in the water.

1053
01:48:48,050 --> 01:48:50,150
Their metal targeting us.

1054
01:48:50,470 --> 01:48:54,130
Americans, Soviets, humans.

1055
01:48:55,250 --> 01:48:57,250
United in their fear of the unknown.

1056
01:48:58,620 --> 01:49:01,750
A Neanderthal is running scared,
my fellow mutants.

1057
01:49:04,430 --> 01:49:05,650
Go ahead, Charles.

1058
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:09,260
Tell me I'm wrong.

1059
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:31,360
Fleet commander this is X-ray Bravo-7-zero.

1060
01:49:31,570 --> 01:49:32,760
Respond, over.

1061
01:49:33,940 --> 01:49:36,420
The beach is secure, call off the attack.

1062
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:38,830
The beach is targeted and ready to
be fired upon, sir.

1063
01:49:39,010 --> 01:49:40,850
- Stand by.
- Standing by, sir.

1064
01:49:41,350 --> 01:49:43,770
New Orders. Fire on the beach.

1065
01:49:45,090 --> 01:49:46,090
Hello?

1066
01:49:48,140 --> 01:49:49,140
Hello!?

1067
01:49:56,900 --> 01:49:59,470
Fire.
Fire.

1068
01:50:45,860 --> 01:50:47,770
Erik, you said yourself, we're the better men.

1069
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:49,920
This is the time to prove it.

1070
01:50:53,820 --> 01:50:55,810
There are thousands of men on those ships.

1071
01:50:55,810 --> 01:50:57,540
Good, honest , innocent men.

1072
01:50:58,100 --> 01:50:59,780
They're just following orders.

1073
01:51:01,880 --> 01:51:04,240
I've been at the mercy of men
just following orders.

1074
01:51:08,600 --> 01:51:09,910
Never again.

1075
01:51:14,350 --> 01:51:15,660
Erik, release them.

1076
01:51:22,290 --> 01:51:23,810
Noooo!

1077
01:51:29,500 --> 01:51:31,640
I don't want to hurt you,
don't make me.

1078
01:51:32,690 --> 01:51:33,930
Stay back!

1079
01:51:36,530 --> 01:51:37,680
Charles, enough.

1080
01:51:42,450 --> 01:51:43,540
Erik, stop!

1081
01:51:53,550 --> 01:51:55,990
Gentlemen, it's been an honor serving with you.

1082
01:51:55,990 --> 01:51:58,590
Comrades, thank you for your service.

1083
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:44,890
I'm so sorry.

1084
01:52:45,130 --> 01:52:46,550
I said back off!

1085
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:50,980
You, you did this!

1086
01:52:54,980 --> 01:52:56,970
Please...

1087
01:52:59,400 --> 01:53:03,020
She didn't do this, Erik.
You did.

1088
01:53:10,650 --> 01:53:14,170
Us turning on each other,
it's what they want.

1089
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:16,380
I tried to warn you, Charles.

1090
01:53:18,730 --> 01:53:22,720
I want you by my side.
We're brothers, you and I.

1091
01:53:23,450 --> 01:53:26,270
All of us, together. Protecting each other.

1092
01:53:28,340 --> 01:53:30,100
We want the same thing.

1093
01:53:31,430 --> 01:53:32,790
Oh, my friend.

1094
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:36,610
I'm sorry, but we do not.

1095
01:53:52,210 --> 01:53:57,800
- Charles, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, Charles.
- It's all right, it's all right.

1096
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:03,740
His society won't accept us.

1097
01:54:05,020 --> 01:54:06,570
We form our own.

1098
01:54:06,670 --> 01:54:08,660
The humans have played their hand.

1099
01:54:10,840 --> 01:54:13,090
Now we get ready to play ours.

1100
01:54:15,780 --> 01:54:17,090
Who's with me?

1101
01:54:28,230 --> 01:54:29,620
No more hiding.

1102
01:54:54,900 --> 01:54:59,260
You, you should go with him.
It's what you want.

1103
01:54:59,980 --> 01:55:02,090
You promised me you would never read my mind.

1104
01:55:02,620 --> 01:55:03,530
I know.

1105
01:55:04,120 --> 01:55:06,630
I promised you a great many things,
I'm afraid.

1106
01:55:07,380 --> 01:55:08,360
I'm sorry.

1107
01:55:13,540 --> 01:55:14,880
Take care of him.

1108
01:55:29,710 --> 01:55:32,230
And Beast, never forget.

1109
01:55:33,130 --> 01:55:36,040
Mutant and proud.

1110
01:55:44,180 --> 01:55:45,500
Help me out, help him.

1111
01:55:46,540 --> 01:55:47,990
I'm going to get you to a hospital.

1112
01:55:47,990 --> 01:55:51,200
- Wait, don't, Charles, don't move, okay.

1113
01:55:51,200 --> 01:55:56,510
All right, actually I ca.....I...I...

1114
01:55:58,620 --> 01:55:59,930
I can't feel my legs

1115
01:56:01,950 --> 01:56:03,510
I can't feel my legs.

1116
01:56:05,490 --> 01:56:07,090
I can't feel my legs.

1117
01:56:18,450 --> 01:56:21,920
In this week of Thanksgiving,
there is much for which we can be grateful

1118
01:56:22,120 --> 01:56:25,290
as you look back to where we stood,
only four weeks ago.

1119
01:56:25,570 --> 01:56:28,560
The unity of this hemisphere,
the support of our allies

1120
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:31,140
and the calm determination of the American people.

1121
01:56:31,610 --> 01:56:34,190
These qualities may be tested many more times

1122
01:56:34,410 --> 01:56:35,610
in this decade.

1123
01:56:38,670 --> 01:56:42,900
So how many students do you think you'll have here?
Once you get the academy up and running.

1124
01:56:43,380 --> 01:56:47,090
As many as I can manage. Possibly more.

1125
01:56:49,990 --> 01:56:54,390
You know, one day the government is going
to realize how lucky they were,

1126
01:56:54,580 --> 01:56:56,210
..to have Professor X on their side.

1127
01:56:57,770 --> 01:57:00,030
I suppose I am a real professor, aren't I.

1128
01:57:00,030 --> 01:57:01,610
Next thing I'll be going bald.

1129
01:57:03,350 --> 01:57:05,460
We're still on the government?s side, Moira.

1130
01:57:06,010 --> 01:57:08,570
Still G-men, just without the G.

1131
01:57:08,940 --> 01:57:11,670
No, you're your own team now.

1132
01:57:12,450 --> 01:57:13,530
It's better.

1133
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:17,190
You're "X-Men".

1134
01:57:19,340 --> 01:57:20,760
Yes, I like the sound of that.

1135
01:57:21,270 --> 01:57:26,990
Moira, for us anonymity will be the first line of defense.

1136
01:57:26,990 --> 01:57:28,260
I know.

1137
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:33,410
They can threaten me all they want, Charles.

1138
01:57:34,220 --> 01:57:36,390
I'll never tell them where you are.

1139
01:57:36,970 --> 01:57:37,970
Ever.

1140
01:57:38,860 --> 01:57:40,460
I know you won't.

1141
01:57:42,280 --> 01:57:43,290
My love.

1142
01:57:50,610 --> 01:57:52,820
I remember the attack on HQ.

1143
01:57:53,380 --> 01:57:55,060
Leaving to go somewhere else.

1144
01:57:55,690 --> 01:57:58,740
And then this morning, I woke up at home.

1145
01:57:59,550 --> 01:58:00,550
That's it.

1146
01:58:01,720 --> 01:58:03,830
All that time wiped clean from your mind.

1147
01:58:04,180 --> 01:58:05,270
Just gone.

1148
01:58:05,630 --> 01:58:07,580
He can do that.
You don't remember anything?

1149
01:58:08,130 --> 01:58:15,580
Sometimes I get fragments.
Like trees, sunlight.

1150
01:58:17,650 --> 01:58:20,380
- A kiss.
- Aw, Jesus.

1151
01:58:20,900 --> 01:58:24,250
Gentlemen, this is why the CIA
is no place for a woman.

1152
01:58:29,070 --> 01:58:30,150
What the hell was that?

1153
01:58:46,190 --> 01:58:48,330
I know we've had our differences.

1154
01:58:50,860 --> 01:58:54,610
- Where's your telepath friend?
- Gone.

1155
01:58:55,610 --> 01:58:58,620
Left a bit of a gap in my life.
If I'm to be honest.

1156
01:58:58,620 --> 01:59:00,490
I was rather hoping you would fill it.

1157
01:59:05,650 --> 01:59:06,670
Join us.

1158
01:59:13,820 --> 01:59:15,170
Erik, I believe.

1159
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:20,050
I prefer...

1160
01:59:21,970 --> 01:59:22,830
...Magneto.
