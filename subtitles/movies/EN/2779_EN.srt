1
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,823
Tickets, please.

2
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,623
Thank you. Tickets.

3
00:04:25,706 --> 00:04:28,167
Is it far to Tucumcari?

4
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:30,336
We should pass there
in about three or four minutes.

5
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,712
Thanks.

6
00:04:31,796 --> 00:04:35,133
Excuse me, but you've
made a mistake, Reverend.

7
00:04:35,216 --> 00:04:37,677
I couldn't help hearing
you're going to Tucumcari.

8
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,930
I peddle goods around here, and I better
tell you you're on the wrong train.

9
00:04:45,226 --> 00:04:48,021
I think the nearest stop
to Tucumcari is Amarillo.

10
00:04:48,062 --> 00:04:51,357
By getting off at Sante Fe
and returning by way of Amarillo...

11
00:04:51,441 --> 00:04:55,194
you should be able to get
right where you're going.

12
00:04:57,614 --> 00:05:01,743
You see, the train
doesn't stop at Tucumcari.

13
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,422
This train'll stop at Tucumcari.

14
00:05:40,156 --> 00:05:42,993
Take it easy, everybody!

15
00:05:43,034 --> 00:05:45,328
Why'd you stop?
Something gone wrong?

16
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:47,580
Somebody pulled the emergency cord.

17
00:05:57,966 --> 00:06:01,595
Hey, mister, you just can't pull
the emergency cord and jump off.

18
00:06:01,678 --> 00:06:04,723
Why'd you stop that train?
lf you want to get off, you--

19
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:09,269
Well, the railroad company'd be mighty
pleased to make any arrangements...

20
00:06:09,352 --> 00:06:12,481
for any passenger if you want
to get off here, sir.

21
00:06:12,564 --> 00:06:15,233
I did get off. Thanks.

22
00:06:17,861 --> 00:06:21,031
All right, let's go!
Go ahead!

23
00:06:54,773 --> 00:06:58,527
Guy passed by here in person
and added on those two zeros.

24
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:02,239
He was spittin' mad when he saw what
they was offerin'. He wasn't flattered.

25
00:07:02,281 --> 00:07:05,492
He said, "A measly thousand bucks
for me is much too little.

26
00:07:05,534 --> 00:07:08,370
I'm worth a lot more than that."

27
00:07:08,454 --> 00:07:11,457
He said that, and then he added
the zeros on the thousand.

28
00:07:13,292 --> 00:07:16,837
There isn't anyone got the guts
to face that killer, eh?

29
00:07:24,386 --> 00:07:26,305
At least...

30
00:07:26,388 --> 00:07:29,183
it's been that way till now.

31
00:08:09,473 --> 00:08:10,766
Where is he?

32
00:08:26,282 --> 00:08:28,200
Where is he?

33
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:38,502
I have no idea
where he'd be today.

34
00:09:01,234 --> 00:09:03,194
- Hold still.
- But Guy--

35
00:09:03,236 --> 00:09:06,155
- Hold still, I said.
- You hurt me with those hands of yours.

36
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:08,991
- Then do as I tell ya.
- Stop it!

37
00:09:09,033 --> 00:09:11,911
Now see, you've made me drop the soap.

38
00:09:13,162 --> 00:09:15,915
- Wait, I'll get it for ya.
- You're killing me.

39
00:09:18,918 --> 00:09:20,920
Oh, look. What's that?

40
00:10:03,254 --> 00:10:05,799
Pardon me, ma'am.

41
00:11:36,515 --> 00:11:38,308
I'll kill you for this.

42
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,740
There you are.
A thousand dollars.

43
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,419
What do you know about Cavanagh?

44
00:12:05,502 --> 00:12:08,505
About a week ago
he was seen at White Rocks.

45
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:10,758
Thanks.

46
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:13,135
If it's of any interest to ya...

47
00:12:13,177 --> 00:12:15,763
somebody else dropped in
to see me about him.

48
00:12:16,764 --> 00:12:18,057
Who?

49
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,893
I'd never seen him before.

50
00:12:20,976 --> 00:12:23,562
His name is Monco.

51
00:13:47,814 --> 00:13:49,732
Light?

52
00:13:51,943 --> 00:13:54,362
You know Baby Cavanagh?

53
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:00,159
Now tell me,
you know where I can find him?

54
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:10,211
There, at that table.

55
00:14:10,253 --> 00:14:12,213
He's got his back to ya.

56
00:14:15,884 --> 00:14:17,844
Thanks.

57
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,078
Two cards.

58
00:16:04,952 --> 00:16:07,120
Didn't hear what the bet was.

59
00:16:10,332 --> 00:16:11,792
Your life.

60
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:43,907
Alive or dead--
it's your choice.

61
00:16:46,827 --> 00:16:49,330
Let Red go.

62
00:17:26,325 --> 00:17:29,203
Two thousand dollars.
It's a lot of money.

63
00:17:29,245 --> 00:17:31,539
Takes me three years to earn it.

64
00:17:31,622 --> 00:17:35,835
Tell me, isn't a sheriff
supposed to be courageous, loyal...

65
00:17:35,876 --> 00:17:37,837
and above all, honest?

66
00:17:38,838 --> 00:17:41,090
Yeah, that he is.

67
00:17:53,644 --> 00:17:55,938
I think you people
need a new sheriff.

68
00:20:56,787 --> 00:20:58,831
Hughie.

69
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,911
How are you, Nino?

70
00:21:36,952 --> 00:21:38,871
Better when I see you.

71
00:21:52,051 --> 00:21:54,011
Go on. Go ahead.

72
00:22:16,033 --> 00:22:17,451
Open it.

73
00:22:36,387 --> 00:22:39,599
- What's up? Who is it?
- Rodriguez, senor.

74
00:23:11,673 --> 00:23:14,300
You. Come along.

75
00:23:29,566 --> 00:23:31,484
I'm letting you live, hero.

76
00:23:31,568 --> 00:23:34,779
That's so you can tell everybody
you've seen what takes place here.

77
00:24:30,544 --> 00:24:32,462
For the lousy money.

78
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:43,140
You took money
to put me behind bars.

79
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:48,103
You should've killed me
when you could.

80
00:24:48,937 --> 00:24:50,897
It would be better for you.

81
00:24:52,232 --> 00:24:54,234
And for them.

82
00:24:57,487 --> 00:24:59,656
How old's the boy?

83
00:25:03,243 --> 00:25:05,495
How old is the boy, I asked?

84
00:25:06,413 --> 00:25:08,123
He's 18 months now.

85
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:12,419
Just the time that I was in jail.

86
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,424
You used the reward that you got...

87
00:25:17,466 --> 00:25:19,885
to start raising a family.

88
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:23,805
And that's why I feel
your family is partly mine.

89
00:25:26,517 --> 00:25:28,936
I'll take my part now.

90
00:25:28,977 --> 00:25:30,938
Outside.

91
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:38,362
They're both innocent. Please let them
go! I was the one. You know that.

92
00:26:06,724 --> 00:26:10,227
I know.
I'm sure you hate me just enough.

93
00:26:33,542 --> 00:26:36,087
This time you'll have a chance
to shoot me, but not in the back.

94
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,050
Let go.

95
00:26:47,515 --> 00:26:49,767
When you hear the music finish, begin.

96
00:26:51,435 --> 00:26:53,396
Or do you think you can?

97
00:26:56,899 --> 00:26:58,985
Let's start.

98
00:28:55,101 --> 00:28:57,062
Now.

99
00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:38,645
- Check those figures again.
- Yes, sir.

100
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:43,984
Good day, sir. Good afternoon.

101
00:29:44,067 --> 00:29:46,695
Mortimer.

102
00:29:46,778 --> 00:29:49,865
- Douglas Mortimer.
- Mortimer. Virginia, isn't it?

103
00:29:49,907 --> 00:29:52,618
- Carolina.
- That's right, Carolina.

104
00:29:52,701 --> 00:29:54,953
Can I help in some way?

105
00:29:55,037 --> 00:29:58,957
- I'm looking for a first-class bank.
- Oh, but exactly.

106
00:29:59,041 --> 00:30:00,542
Yeah.

107
00:30:00,584 --> 00:30:03,962
The largest and most secure bank
in the territory.

108
00:30:04,046 --> 00:30:06,840
Well, Mr. Mortimer,
I want to assure you our bank here...

109
00:30:06,924 --> 00:30:09,593
has everything--
all the safeguards you're looking for.

110
00:30:09,676 --> 00:30:12,930
I don't doubt that, but I have
a large sum to deposit.

111
00:30:13,013 --> 00:30:15,140
Now, suppose I'm a bandit.

112
00:30:17,935 --> 00:30:19,895
A bandit?

113
00:30:19,978 --> 00:30:22,981
A very dangerous bandit
with a gang of killers.

114
00:30:23,065 --> 00:30:27,736
What would be the most
impossible bank for me to rob?

115
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:31,490
In your case, the one bank
I would suggest is the Bank of EI Paso.

116
00:30:31,532 --> 00:30:33,701
Not even lndio would dare
to attack that one.

117
00:30:33,784 --> 00:30:36,328
It's not a bank.
It's a fortress there.

118
00:30:41,417 --> 00:30:43,836
What time's the next train
for EI Paso?

119
00:30:43,836 --> 00:30:46,297
11:30. I'll telegraph
to my colleague...

120
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,674
in the Bank of EI Paso
that you're going to arrive.

121
00:30:48,757 --> 00:30:50,801
Thanks.

122
00:31:15,868 --> 00:31:18,579
Hey, mister. Captain.
General. Welcome.

123
00:31:18,662 --> 00:31:21,957
Do you need a stable or a room?
Do you want to take a bath?

124
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:24,835
My name is Fernando.
The stable is right here.

125
00:31:24,877 --> 00:31:26,671
And that is your hotel.

126
00:31:27,755 --> 00:31:30,341
Why this hotel
and not some other?

127
00:31:30,424 --> 00:31:33,052
You probably wouldn't like
that other place as much, senor.

128
00:31:33,135 --> 00:31:36,389
You'd have to spend half the night
shootin' cockroaches.

129
00:31:36,472 --> 00:31:38,849
At this hotel, the rooms
will cost you so much less.

130
00:31:38,933 --> 00:31:40,893
And there's a landlady
at this one, senor.

131
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,855
- Married?
- Yes, but she doesn't care.

132
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:07,128
That's the bank. As soon as I get
some money, I'll put it in.

133
00:32:07,211 --> 00:32:09,547
Well, you're gonna have
to earn it first.

134
00:32:11,424 --> 00:32:13,885
I have 50 cents here for you
if you'll let me know...

135
00:32:13,968 --> 00:32:18,473
when anybody you've never seen before
here in EI Paso comes to town.

136
00:32:18,556 --> 00:32:21,726
At the hotel, senor.
A stranger just came outta there.

137
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,860
Where's he staying?

138
00:32:39,911 --> 00:32:41,829
The hotel.

139
00:32:45,542 --> 00:32:48,169
Let me know if you see
any more strangers.

140
00:32:48,253 --> 00:32:50,505
Sure, senor.

141
00:33:05,729 --> 00:33:09,024
- Help you, sir?
- I want the room right above.

142
00:33:09,107 --> 00:33:12,402
I'm sorry, it's occupied.
It's too bad.

143
00:33:12,485 --> 00:33:15,322
The hotel's filled to capacity.
I'm sorry.

144
00:33:15,405 --> 00:33:18,450
The room you want is our best.
It's always occupied.

145
00:33:18,533 --> 00:33:19,701
By who?

146
00:33:20,785 --> 00:33:22,495
Check the register.

147
00:33:22,579 --> 00:33:24,122
Mary!

148
00:33:25,832 --> 00:33:28,043
It's Senor Martinez.

149
00:33:36,676 --> 00:33:39,888
- It's free now.
- That room is taken!

150
00:33:41,264 --> 00:33:43,183
I'll see to it.

151
00:33:48,396 --> 00:33:51,608
He's nothing but a wild,
vicious animal!

152
00:33:51,691 --> 00:33:53,610
He's tall, isn't he?

153
00:33:57,739 --> 00:33:59,658
You're just dirty!

154
00:34:11,962 --> 00:34:14,715
Proprietor, quick! My bill!

155
00:34:14,798 --> 00:34:16,717
I want my bill!

156
00:34:18,927 --> 00:34:22,014
- Before he comes down, give me my bill.
- There's no need to check out.

157
00:34:22,097 --> 00:34:25,309
Everything's gonna be all right.
I'll give you another room immediately.

158
00:34:25,392 --> 00:34:28,604
It's the best in the whole hotel.
We'll let him have the bridal suite.

159
00:34:28,687 --> 00:34:31,064
No, Mary, the bill.
I'd like to stay, only I can't.

160
00:34:31,148 --> 00:34:33,859
- Don't go, Mr. Martinez.
- I have an appointment elsewhere.

161
00:34:38,197 --> 00:34:40,282
Yes, senor, what do you want?

162
00:34:46,246 --> 00:34:48,165
I don't wear 'em.

163
00:34:48,248 --> 00:34:50,417
I'm honored that you thought of me.
Thank you.

164
00:35:30,124 --> 00:35:32,793
Watch this.

165
00:35:56,609 --> 00:35:58,527
Hello, my friends.

166
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,614
Hello, lndio.

167
00:36:01,697 --> 00:36:04,659
You see, I didn't waste
a minute coming here.

168
00:36:04,742 --> 00:36:07,620
Indio calls and Groggy
comes running right away.

169
00:36:07,703 --> 00:36:09,163
And Sancho?

170
00:36:09,246 --> 00:36:13,084
If you're waiting for Sancho, I'll go
and come back in about four years.

171
00:36:13,167 --> 00:36:16,545
He's in prison for four years.

172
00:36:23,177 --> 00:36:26,722
Bad for him.
Not so bad for the rest of us.

173
00:36:26,806 --> 00:36:29,767
A man who gets caught
doesn't deserve respect, huh?

174
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:34,480
What's it all about, huh?

175
00:36:34,522 --> 00:36:36,065
Now just listen.

176
00:36:40,445 --> 00:36:42,071
A bank at EI Paso.

177
00:36:43,948 --> 00:36:45,324
Let's see.

178
00:36:45,366 --> 00:36:50,413
We'll say this is the inside
of the bank. Nino is the safe.

179
00:36:50,496 --> 00:36:53,499
Which weighs three tons
and can't be opened with dynamite.

180
00:36:55,126 --> 00:36:57,045
There's the part with two cashiers.

181
00:36:58,379 --> 00:37:01,007
This is the manager's desk.

182
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:03,843
Right in back is a fancy cabinet
containing bottles...

183
00:37:03,926 --> 00:37:06,554
for offering drinks
to the rich depositors.

184
00:37:08,473 --> 00:37:12,560
There's the main door, and opposite
they built a double wall.

185
00:37:12,602 --> 00:37:14,562
What happens, Groggy?

186
00:37:14,646 --> 00:37:18,650
Let's say you've already killed
the two cashiers and the manager.

187
00:37:18,733 --> 00:37:22,654
For the next few minutes,
you're the boss of the bank.

188
00:37:22,737 --> 00:37:24,656
Now what?

189
00:37:25,698 --> 00:37:28,034
The time's been wasted.

190
00:37:29,577 --> 00:37:33,289
Right, a waste of time.
Especially, Groggy, to blast open...

191
00:37:33,373 --> 00:37:37,085
that damn iron safe, we'd have
to be using so much dynamite...

192
00:37:37,168 --> 00:37:40,088
that the whole bank
would just disappear.

193
00:37:40,171 --> 00:37:43,174
And you'd all go up with it.

194
00:37:43,258 --> 00:37:47,971
Besides, the presence of a safe alone
doesn't always signify...

195
00:37:48,054 --> 00:37:49,889
that there is money inside.

196
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,518
To help you understand what I mean...

197
00:37:55,812 --> 00:38:00,275
I would like to relate
a nice little parable.

198
00:38:02,902 --> 00:38:05,655
Once upon a time
there was a carpenter.

199
00:38:07,949 --> 00:38:10,160
You don't think a carpenter
can make money, eh?

200
00:38:11,203 --> 00:38:13,663
No? You're wrong.

201
00:38:14,748 --> 00:38:19,544
This one did well because
he was a builder of safes.

202
00:38:20,754 --> 00:38:22,923
There was a banker once...

203
00:38:22,964 --> 00:38:25,634
who decided he must have
his iron safe disguised...

204
00:38:25,717 --> 00:38:29,221
to look like a wood cabinet.

205
00:38:32,432 --> 00:38:34,351
To get it made...

206
00:38:34,434 --> 00:38:39,022
the banker goes to our carpenter
for the job, and one day...

207
00:38:40,107 --> 00:38:42,275
as destiny has it...

208
00:38:42,317 --> 00:38:44,861
the carpenter's in EI Paso.

209
00:38:44,945 --> 00:38:48,156
He happens to walk into the bank there,
and what does he find?

210
00:38:49,157 --> 00:38:50,325
The cabinet.

211
00:38:51,451 --> 00:38:54,496
Since he'd worked on the cabinet,
he spotted it right away.

212
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:58,166
From that day on,
he couldn't work anymore.

213
00:38:58,208 --> 00:39:01,253
Pity, because...

214
00:39:01,336 --> 00:39:04,172
there was something he had to do.

215
00:39:04,214 --> 00:39:07,009
There was this crazy idea.

216
00:39:07,092 --> 00:39:09,052
And it stayed--

217
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,893
to put his hands on the money inside.

218
00:39:15,976 --> 00:39:17,895
Get in there and grab all the money.

219
00:39:19,646 --> 00:39:23,525
Sure, you think that carpenter
was lucky the way things work out--

220
00:39:23,609 --> 00:39:26,028
that he was lucky
to go in just that bank.

221
00:39:26,111 --> 00:39:28,030
It wasn't true.

222
00:39:30,074 --> 00:39:32,242
His good fortune stopped that day.

223
00:39:32,326 --> 00:39:34,703
Because later...

224
00:39:34,787 --> 00:39:36,705
as a prisoner...

225
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:41,377
he ran into me.

226
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:49,802
The carpenter told me the story,
and I tell you.

227
00:39:56,267 --> 00:39:58,561
The money isn't in the safe.
It's right in this!

228
00:40:02,189 --> 00:40:04,733
Almost a million dollars in it.

229
00:40:07,528 --> 00:40:10,114
Your colleague in Tucumcari told me
that this bank...

230
00:40:10,197 --> 00:40:13,325
has the largest deposits
in the whole state.

231
00:40:13,409 --> 00:40:15,536
Yes, that's correct,
Mr. Mortimer.

232
00:40:15,619 --> 00:40:19,832
Here at the bank at EI Paso we have half
a million dollars in reserve on hand.

233
00:40:22,835 --> 00:40:26,714
I see. You sure this bank
is secure enough to hold that much?

234
00:40:26,756 --> 00:40:29,592
From the moment your money's
on deposit here...

235
00:40:29,675 --> 00:40:31,594
you can sleep without any worries.

236
00:40:34,764 --> 00:40:37,099
Besides...

237
00:40:37,183 --> 00:40:39,894
when the bank is closed,
an armed guard always remains here...

238
00:40:39,977 --> 00:40:42,563
and a patrol
is on guard outside.

239
00:40:42,647 --> 00:40:46,651
Even the Bank of San Francisco
isn't that well protected.

240
00:40:46,734 --> 00:40:50,404
Exactly. The truth is...

241
00:40:51,656 --> 00:40:53,741
to try robbing us
would be so futile...

242
00:40:53,824 --> 00:40:57,203
that only a complete fool
would attempt it.

243
00:40:57,286 --> 00:40:59,372
Yeah.

244
00:40:59,455 --> 00:41:01,499
Or a complete madman.

245
00:41:12,218 --> 00:41:14,387
Get out of the way!
Get out of here!

246
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:02,310
More news, amigo.

247
00:42:04,562 --> 00:42:07,315
Another stranger in town?

248
00:42:07,357 --> 00:42:09,984
Yes. And I know something else.

249
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:19,285
There was another stranger
I didn't tell you about.

250
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:22,330
Listen to me,
you sawed-off little runt!

251
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:24,916
I want to know how many men
there are all together.

252
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,335
Well, there were two.
Now there's two more.

253
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:29,838
Where?

254
00:42:29,879 --> 00:42:32,257
In the saloon.

255
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:43,472
Whiskey.

256
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,725
Listen, mister, why do you choose
my place to commit suicide?

257
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:50,187
I know that man.
It's a miracle you're alive.

258
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:53,858
Why should a man walk around with
a pistol and let himself be insulted?

259
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,901
It's mighty strange.

260
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,945
If the hunchback didn't shoot you...

261
00:44:57,987 --> 00:45:01,490
he had a very important reason,
that's all.

262
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,161
I was thinking that myself.

263
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,765
1, 2...

264
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:12,103
3, now 4, now 5...

265
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:23,656
11, 12, 13...

266
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:27,243
14, 15, 16...

267
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:31,706
17, 18, 19...

268
00:46:31,748 --> 00:46:35,960
20, 21, 22...

269
00:46:36,044 --> 00:46:39,088
23, 24...

270
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,966
25, 26...

271
00:46:42,008 --> 00:46:47,097
27, 28, 29...

272
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:50,016
30, 31...

273
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:53,436
32 and 33.

274
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,461
All right, now.

275
00:48:42,004 --> 00:48:44,673
I don't know him!

276
00:48:44,757 --> 00:48:46,717
Come on, now, you know everybody.

277
00:48:46,759 --> 00:48:50,554
I don't know anybody anymore!
I'm dead! Understand?

278
00:48:50,637 --> 00:48:53,098
Well, there was a time
when I knew everybody.

279
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:55,976
That was a long time ago
when all this was prairie.

280
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:58,479
In these days everybody's in a hurry.
That's right...

281
00:48:58,562 --> 00:49:01,148
with your damned
good-for-nothing trains!

282
00:49:04,526 --> 00:49:05,986
Disgusting!

283
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:08,447
One day, someone from the railroad
comes here to see me.

284
00:49:08,447 --> 00:49:12,159
He says, "Prophet, the railway's
gonna go right past your house."

285
00:49:12,243 --> 00:49:15,162
"Is that so?" I said.

286
00:49:15,246 --> 00:49:17,581
"Yep, that right," he says.

287
00:49:17,665 --> 00:49:19,917
"All those trains
gonna go right past here.

288
00:49:19,959 --> 00:49:22,294
The best thing for you, Prophet,
is sell your land to the company...

289
00:49:22,336 --> 00:49:24,130
or else we'll buy Baker's.

290
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:26,966
He lives next to your place,
and I'll put the tracks here...

291
00:49:27,007 --> 00:49:29,093
and that'll make you go crazy.

292
00:49:29,176 --> 00:49:31,345
Will you sell out
to our company, Prophet?"

293
00:49:31,429 --> 00:49:33,889
"Oh, is that so?" says l.

294
00:49:35,766 --> 00:49:38,185
He was very anxious
for me to sell out.

295
00:49:38,227 --> 00:49:40,521
You know what I told him
about the railroad?

296
00:49:40,604 --> 00:49:43,482
You know what I told him
he could do with his railroad?

297
00:50:02,501 --> 00:50:05,171
You know what my decision
about selling was?

298
00:50:05,254 --> 00:50:07,173
Well, you said no.

299
00:50:07,256 --> 00:50:10,676
You're right about that.
No to him and his damn trains!

300
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,678
I wouldn't! No!

301
00:50:12,762 --> 00:50:15,681
Look, listen to me, old man.

302
00:50:15,765 --> 00:50:17,683
You're supposed to be a prophet.

303
00:50:17,767 --> 00:50:20,603
I didn't come here to listen to you
rattle on about trains.

304
00:50:20,686 --> 00:50:24,065
I want to find out about this man.
It's obvious you don't know anything.

305
00:50:24,107 --> 00:50:26,901
No need to be insulting.
If that's all you came here to do...

306
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:29,946
you can clear out of my house fast
before I lose my temper.

307
00:50:29,987 --> 00:50:31,948
Understand?

308
00:50:35,702 --> 00:50:37,912
Hey! Where you goin'?

309
00:50:40,915 --> 00:50:43,710
I guess I better leave before
you go and lose your temper.

310
00:50:44,794 --> 00:50:47,130
What's the matter with you?
Why are you so dang stupid?

311
00:50:47,171 --> 00:50:49,090
Hurry up,
give me that pistol there.

312
00:50:49,173 --> 00:50:51,634
Yeah, right there behind ya.

313
00:50:51,676 --> 00:50:53,636
Hurry!

314
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:57,098
Yes, that's the one.
Now, hand it over.

315
00:50:57,140 --> 00:51:00,810
That's it. Give me that gun.
The man you asked about.

316
00:51:00,894 --> 00:51:03,855
There's only one question:
How does he carry his gun?

317
00:51:03,938 --> 00:51:06,149
He wears it here,
across his belly?

318
00:51:06,232 --> 00:51:09,694
Well, why didn't you tell me that
in the first place, my boy.

319
00:51:09,777 --> 00:51:12,238
Of course I know the man
you're trying to find out about.

320
00:51:12,322 --> 00:51:14,240
Of course I know him.

321
00:51:14,324 --> 00:51:17,160
He's Colonel Douglas Mortimer.

322
00:51:17,243 --> 00:51:20,121
Mortimer-- a brave man, a soldier.

323
00:51:20,955 --> 00:51:23,416
He was known as the best shot
in the Carolinas.

324
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,168
A great soldier.

325
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:29,089
Now he's reduced to being
a bounty killer, same as you.

326
00:51:29,172 --> 00:51:30,965
Because of trains!

327
00:51:31,049 --> 00:51:34,302
Because of the damn trains!
Damn 'em!

328
00:53:00,764 --> 00:53:04,685
Take it to the station.
The gentleman's leavin'.

329
00:53:09,314 --> 00:53:11,066
Hold it.

330
00:53:13,068 --> 00:53:14,528
Take it back.

331
00:53:17,781 --> 00:53:19,908
Take it to the station.

332
00:53:21,994 --> 00:53:24,872
- Go inside.
- The station!

333
00:54:33,858 --> 00:54:36,068
Just like the games we know.

334
00:55:31,708 --> 00:55:33,960
- He's picking it up.
- A trick, maybe.

335
00:57:19,775 --> 00:57:24,154
How can somebody in my business
go around with a contraption like this?

336
00:57:25,239 --> 00:57:27,199
That contraption...

337
00:57:28,492 --> 00:57:30,619
almost sent you to your grave.

338
00:57:32,663 --> 00:57:35,874
You're forgetting one thing, Colonel--
I was shooting at your hat.

339
00:57:35,916 --> 00:57:38,168
Well, I was only shooting at yours.

340
00:57:39,253 --> 00:57:41,505
But I recall firing first.

341
00:57:43,507 --> 00:57:45,300
Boy...

342
00:57:45,384 --> 00:57:48,595
I've reached almost 50 years
of age with my system.

343
00:57:48,679 --> 00:57:50,973
Not many men last long
in these parts.

344
00:57:51,056 --> 00:57:53,350
How long do you expect to last?

345
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:56,687
Much longer than that.

346
00:57:57,771 --> 00:58:01,608
When I get my hands on lndio
and that $10,000...

347
00:58:01,692 --> 00:58:05,029
I'm gonna buy myself a little place,
possibly retire.

348
00:58:06,655 --> 00:58:09,575
Well, I don't believe we ought
to start another fight.

349
00:58:09,616 --> 00:58:11,660
But you forget one small detail.

350
00:58:11,744 --> 00:58:13,287
What's that?

351
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:15,623
I wanna get my hands on lndio too.

352
00:58:15,706 --> 00:58:18,167
Sure, after me.

353
00:58:19,793 --> 00:58:22,087
Or before you.

354
00:58:22,171 --> 00:58:24,089
Or at the same time.

355
00:58:27,218 --> 00:58:28,886
Is that a proposition?

356
00:58:30,262 --> 00:58:31,847
An equal partnership.

357
00:58:32,932 --> 00:58:34,809
Why? Why should l?

358
00:58:34,892 --> 00:58:36,811
I can think of three reasons.

359
00:58:36,894 --> 00:58:39,021
First is there's 14 of them.

360
00:58:39,063 --> 00:58:40,981
Yeah, that's a lot.

361
00:58:41,065 --> 00:58:42,650
A lot for me.

362
00:58:42,733 --> 00:58:45,236
Yeah. No small number
even for two of us.

363
00:58:45,319 --> 00:58:46,862
Second reason?

364
00:58:48,155 --> 00:58:50,241
Second reason--

365
00:58:52,743 --> 00:58:55,413
The second reason is
you could make it 15 to one.

366
00:58:55,454 --> 00:58:57,957
Don't forget I wanna play
in this game too.

367
00:58:57,999 --> 00:59:02,420
As you're aware, when two hunters
go after the same prey...

368
00:59:02,461 --> 00:59:05,923
they usually end up shooting each other
in the back, and we don't want that.

369
00:59:10,261 --> 00:59:12,430
Then the colonel dies, hmm?

370
00:59:14,807 --> 00:59:16,726
All right, I'll be generous.

371
00:59:18,394 --> 00:59:21,022
You can have the reward
for lndio...

372
00:59:21,105 --> 00:59:23,316
and I'll take the reward
for the rest of the band.

373
00:59:26,652 --> 00:59:28,696
All wrong.

374
00:59:28,779 --> 00:59:33,284
Indio's worth $10,000 dollars, but
the rest adds up to much more than that.

375
00:59:33,367 --> 00:59:36,913
Blackie's worth four,
Wild's worth three, Nino two.

376
00:59:36,996 --> 00:59:38,623
Nino's one.

377
00:59:41,334 --> 00:59:43,711
Well, Frisco's worth two.

378
00:59:43,795 --> 00:59:46,255
That's ten thousand.

379
00:59:46,339 --> 00:59:48,257
Yeah, but...

380
00:59:48,299 --> 00:59:51,511
there's a few more that'll
add up to more than that, I'm sure.

381
00:59:51,594 --> 00:59:54,889
- How do you know that?
- I have my information.

382
00:59:54,972 --> 00:59:56,891
When all's said and done...

383
00:59:56,975 --> 00:59:59,978
I think I might just take you up
on your proposition.

384
01:00:03,189 --> 01:00:05,525
Let's drink to this partnership.

385
01:00:09,237 --> 01:00:12,532
To the partnership,
with no tricks, of course.

386
01:00:13,616 --> 01:00:15,368
No tricks.

387
01:00:19,372 --> 01:00:20,748
Now, then...

388
01:00:20,832 --> 01:00:25,253
you realize we're gonna have to figure
out some way to get them in the middle.

389
01:00:28,214 --> 01:00:32,135
One from the outside, one from
the inside. There's no other way.

390
01:00:32,177 --> 01:00:35,638
One of us will have to
join lndio's band.

391
01:00:37,807 --> 01:00:40,351
Why are you looking at me
when you say "one of us"?

392
01:00:40,393 --> 01:00:42,062
Because they don't know you.

393
01:00:42,145 --> 01:00:45,023
Wild sees me and his hump
will catch on fire.

394
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:49,194
Tell me...

395
01:00:49,277 --> 01:00:52,447
how do you propose that I
join up with lndio?

396
01:00:52,489 --> 01:00:55,492
Maybe bring him
a bunch of roses?

397
01:00:55,533 --> 01:00:59,955
You could do that, but I'd suggest
you take him Sancho Perez.

398
01:01:00,038 --> 01:01:02,332
Who's Sancho Perez?

399
01:01:02,415 --> 01:01:05,335
A friend of lndio's.
Right now he's cooling off.

400
01:01:05,377 --> 01:01:08,046
He's cooling off
in Alamogourdo jail.

401
01:01:08,129 --> 01:01:10,674
How do you know all this?

402
01:01:11,883 --> 01:01:14,177
I've got my information too.

403
01:01:16,221 --> 01:01:20,267
Naturally, you'll have to arrange
for his, uh, release.

404
01:01:23,019 --> 01:01:24,479
Naturally.

405
01:01:26,314 --> 01:01:28,275
Tell me...

406
01:01:28,358 --> 01:01:30,819
were you ever young?

407
01:01:34,448 --> 01:01:36,616
And just as reckless as you.

408
01:01:40,037 --> 01:01:42,998
Then one day something happened.

409
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,791
Made life very precious to me.

410
01:01:44,875 --> 01:01:46,460
What's that?

411
01:01:52,424 --> 01:01:54,843
Or is the question indiscreet?

412
01:01:57,888 --> 01:02:00,015
The question isn't indiscreet.

413
01:02:01,308 --> 01:02:03,310
But the answer could be.

414
01:05:17,672 --> 01:05:21,801
They told me you were put away. You'd be
resting for four long years in prison.

415
01:05:24,512 --> 01:05:28,433
No, lndio, for four weeks.
No more than four weeks.

416
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:41,905
Who is that with you?

417
01:05:41,988 --> 01:05:45,116
He got me out.
The man's a friend of mine.

418
01:05:52,666 --> 01:05:55,627
Why did he help you?
Did you ask him that?

419
01:05:57,254 --> 01:06:00,632
Yeah. Amigo, why did you
help me out?

420
01:06:02,592 --> 01:06:07,722
Well, there's such a big reward
being offered on all you gentlemen...

421
01:06:07,806 --> 01:06:10,976
that I thought I might just tag along
on your next robbery.

422
01:06:12,227 --> 01:06:14,187
I might just turn you
into the law.

423
01:06:57,022 --> 01:06:58,649
Amigo...

424
01:07:00,275 --> 01:07:03,487
that's the one answer
that would prove you're all right.

425
01:07:05,697 --> 01:07:09,118
And you arrived just in time too.
The job is already set.

426
01:07:10,202 --> 01:07:11,745
It's tomorrow.

427
01:07:12,871 --> 01:07:14,957
The place is...

428
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:17,459
the bank in EI Paso.

429
01:07:19,795 --> 01:07:23,007
Not far from EI Paso
there's a little town, Santa Cruz.

430
01:07:23,048 --> 01:07:26,552
Tomorrow, Blackie, Chico,
Paco...

431
01:07:26,635 --> 01:07:29,805
and you, amigo...

432
01:07:29,888 --> 01:07:32,433
will rob the bank in Santa Cruz.

433
01:07:32,516 --> 01:07:35,686
Shoot, kill, get every gun
in the area after you...

434
01:07:35,769 --> 01:07:37,730
especially those from EI Paso.

435
01:07:37,771 --> 01:07:41,150
Any others around,
we'll take care of them.

436
01:07:42,985 --> 01:07:45,946
And then after the job,
we'll all meet again at Las Palmeras.

437
01:07:50,451 --> 01:07:52,661
Where are you going?

438
01:07:58,709 --> 01:08:01,504
Well, if there's gonna be
any shooting...

439
01:08:02,588 --> 01:08:04,507
I gotta get my rest.

440
01:08:21,649 --> 01:08:26,279
Hey, amigo, you know when you told
that story yesterday, I fell for it.

441
01:08:26,362 --> 01:08:28,698
Big joke, wasn't it, amigo?

442
01:08:37,999 --> 01:08:39,834
Who said I was jokin'?

443
01:08:42,128 --> 01:08:44,088
I don't get that.
If it's true--

444
01:08:44,130 --> 01:08:46,549
Too bad you have to die.

445
01:08:50,762 --> 01:08:52,221
What is it?

446
01:09:48,069 --> 01:09:50,989
By now they should be
at Santa Cruz.

447
01:10:33,365 --> 01:10:34,866
Listen, shorty...

448
01:10:38,453 --> 01:10:42,249
Indio and his band have just
robbed the bank here in town.

449
01:10:42,332 --> 01:10:45,752
Now why don't you just sit down
and send out the alarm to EI Paso...

450
01:10:45,836 --> 01:10:48,714
and the rest of the towns around here
and warn 'em, right?

451
01:10:48,797 --> 01:10:52,426
But, mister, I didn't hear any shots
at the bank, and I sure would have.

452
01:10:52,509 --> 01:10:54,469
You might hear one.

453
01:10:54,511 --> 01:10:56,179
The alarm.

454
01:11:39,681 --> 01:11:41,725
Easy now.

455
01:11:41,767 --> 01:11:44,478
They've robbed the bank
at Santa Cruz!

456
01:11:46,105 --> 01:11:47,815
Follow me!

457
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,875
Groggy, the telegraph wires.

458
01:15:22,614 --> 01:15:24,783
- Good day, gentlemen.
- Good day, sir.

459
01:15:27,786 --> 01:15:30,122
- Sir.
- Good afternoon.

460
01:17:20,191 --> 01:17:21,901
The other side.

461
01:18:05,903 --> 01:18:07,780
Eleven...

462
01:18:07,864 --> 01:18:09,198
twelve...

463
01:18:12,201 --> 01:18:13,995
Fourteen...

464
01:20:55,365 --> 01:20:57,034
Let's go!

465
01:22:20,284 --> 01:22:23,621
What are you doin' here?
You're not runnin' away, are you?

466
01:22:23,663 --> 01:22:25,414
No, I'm not running away.

467
01:22:25,456 --> 01:22:29,126
I'm going after them and I'm going
alone. Our partnership is dissolved.

468
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:31,045
Boy, let's wait
and talk it over.

469
01:22:31,087 --> 01:22:35,258
All we've done is talk.
I've been reasonable with no results.

470
01:22:35,341 --> 01:22:38,594
Now take it easy. We only knew
the Santa Cruz part of this plan.

471
01:22:38,678 --> 01:22:41,806
You were the one who had
their strategy all worked out.

472
01:22:41,889 --> 01:22:44,517
- Now I'm gonna meet lndio.
- I see. I better go along.

473
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:47,520
I'm going alone-- Me.

474
01:22:47,562 --> 01:22:51,024
I have an appointment with lndio
and I'm not gonna let anyone interfere.

475
01:22:51,065 --> 01:22:54,068
- You certain about that?
- That's right.

476
01:22:54,110 --> 01:22:56,612
In that case I'm sorry.

477
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:05,163
That's not bad. Indio sent
four men to Santa Cruz.

478
01:23:05,246 --> 01:23:08,458
And one man returns--
a new man without a scratch.

479
01:23:08,541 --> 01:23:10,710
Mm-mm. Indio's no idiot.

480
01:23:10,710 --> 01:23:14,214
When you ride up to him and show him
that little nick, he might believe you.

481
01:23:15,298 --> 01:23:17,383
And don't forget,
that as of today...

482
01:23:17,467 --> 01:23:20,094
the whole gang's worth
$40,000 more.

483
01:23:20,178 --> 01:23:23,181
That's the reward offered by the bank
to get the money back.

484
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:27,060
- Is the partnership operating again?
- Just how do you figure?

485
01:23:27,143 --> 01:23:32,065
Try to convince lndio to go north,
and then go along the Rio Bravo.

486
01:23:32,107 --> 01:23:35,276
It's a good spot for an ambush
and we can get him between two fires.

487
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:39,155
You on the outside,
me on the inside, right?

488
01:23:40,532 --> 01:23:41,908
North?

489
01:23:46,121 --> 01:23:47,622
North.

490
01:24:06,766 --> 01:24:08,476
Hughie.

491
01:24:16,318 --> 01:24:20,822
Wait a minute. We need time to open it
and this isn't the right place.

492
01:24:50,352 --> 01:24:51,979
And the others?

493
01:24:52,062 --> 01:24:53,522
Dead?

494
01:24:54,731 --> 01:24:59,194
After Santa Cruz, we headed for EI Paso
and they hit us from all sides.

495
01:25:00,696 --> 01:25:04,032
And you just saved your own skin,
isn't that right, you yellow--

496
01:25:23,552 --> 01:25:26,889
You did your part of it.
Let's go.

497
01:25:26,930 --> 01:25:28,557
Which way we headed?

498
01:25:29,641 --> 01:25:31,018
North.

499
01:25:31,101 --> 01:25:34,313
North? Along Rio Bravo canyon?

500
01:25:34,354 --> 01:25:35,939
Why not?

501
01:25:37,316 --> 01:25:39,818
Seems like a good place
for an ambush to me.

502
01:25:41,904 --> 01:25:43,822
You know a better way to go?

503
01:25:43,906 --> 01:25:45,866
Yeah, south.

504
01:25:47,910 --> 01:25:49,536
Ride to the border?

505
01:25:49,620 --> 01:25:53,666
They'll never expect you to cross the
border now that the alarm's been sent.

506
01:26:00,130 --> 01:26:02,341
Think we'll head east.

507
01:26:02,424 --> 01:26:05,719
There's a place I know about,
Agua Caliente.

508
01:26:06,804 --> 01:26:09,807
Here we are.
That's Agua Caliente.

509
01:26:10,891 --> 01:26:13,727
Yes, I have many friends here.

510
01:26:13,811 --> 01:26:15,729
It looks just like a morgue.

511
01:26:16,897 --> 01:26:18,941
But look out.

512
01:26:19,024 --> 01:26:21,152
It could be one so easily.

513
01:26:22,403 --> 01:26:25,823
- They don't like strangers.
- No, they don't like anybody.

514
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:31,620
Wild, you never saw
our friend here shoot, right?

515
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:37,460
Did any of you?

516
01:26:40,463 --> 01:26:43,132
We don't know how you'd be
in emergencies.

517
01:26:44,216 --> 01:26:46,761
I was thinking,
this is the right place.

518
01:26:46,844 --> 01:26:49,138
I got a way
you can show the men.

519
01:26:51,515 --> 01:26:53,059
How's that?

520
01:26:54,518 --> 01:26:56,312
Go into town alone, amigo.

521
01:29:42,938 --> 01:29:44,064
Bravo.

522
01:30:34,698 --> 01:30:37,451
Do you mind tellin' me
how you got here?

523
01:30:37,535 --> 01:30:40,079
I just reasoned it out.

524
01:30:40,162 --> 01:30:42,373
I figured you'd tell lndio...

525
01:30:42,456 --> 01:30:45,876
to do just exactly the opposite
of what we agreed...

526
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:48,838
and he's suspicious enough
to figure out somethin' else.

527
01:30:50,089 --> 01:30:53,634
Since EI Paso was out of the question,
well, here I am.

528
01:30:55,970 --> 01:30:57,847
Rum-- a double.

529
01:30:58,931 --> 01:31:00,850
Tequila for all of us.

530
01:31:17,616 --> 01:31:20,328
If it isn't the smoker.

531
01:31:31,505 --> 01:31:33,799
Remember me, amigo?

532
01:31:35,968 --> 01:31:39,138
Of course you do. EI Paso.

533
01:31:42,225 --> 01:31:44,685
It's a small world.

534
01:31:44,769 --> 01:31:47,480
Yes, and very, very bad.

535
01:31:48,606 --> 01:31:51,776
Now, come on.
You light another match.

536
01:31:53,528 --> 01:31:57,865
I generally smoke just after I eat.
Come back in ten minutes.

537
01:31:57,907 --> 01:32:01,828
Ten minutes you'll be smoking
in hell. Get up!

538
01:32:01,911 --> 01:32:03,246
Stay calm.

539
01:32:05,540 --> 01:32:07,500
On your feet.

540
01:32:15,174 --> 01:32:16,843
Cucillo.

541
01:32:18,011 --> 01:32:19,554
Count to three.

542
01:32:29,439 --> 01:32:31,316
One...

543
01:32:33,151 --> 01:32:34,819
two...

544
01:32:36,446 --> 01:32:38,072
three!

545
01:32:41,785 --> 01:32:43,495
Stop it!

546
01:33:05,767 --> 01:33:07,435
Who are you?

547
01:33:09,062 --> 01:33:10,981
I'm the one who can open
the safe for you.

548
01:33:15,777 --> 01:33:17,195
What safe, senor?

549
01:33:17,237 --> 01:33:20,699
The one from EI Paso.
You got there ahead of me.

550
01:33:20,782 --> 01:33:22,701
- However--
- However?

551
01:33:24,619 --> 01:33:28,373
Open that safe and you're gonna
destroy half the bank notes.

552
01:33:28,415 --> 01:33:30,959
I can open it
without blowing it up.

553
01:33:39,384 --> 01:33:40,844
What'll it cost?

554
01:33:40,886 --> 01:33:42,429
Five thousand.

555
01:33:46,058 --> 01:33:47,976
Two's all I'll pay you.

556
01:33:49,144 --> 01:33:50,812
Five.

557
01:34:27,975 --> 01:34:29,935
Keep your hands off it!

558
01:34:29,977 --> 01:34:33,439
It's easy to steal.
The trouble is in keeping the loot.

559
01:34:33,522 --> 01:34:35,816
Take it out.

560
01:34:35,858 --> 01:34:38,193
Now every man in New Mexico
is after us.

561
01:34:38,277 --> 01:34:41,905
If they catch one of us with money
we'll all end up the same way.

562
01:34:41,989 --> 01:34:45,909
We're going to wait here for an
entire month if I think it's necessary.

563
01:34:45,951 --> 01:34:48,912
Then everybody will get his share.

564
01:34:48,996 --> 01:34:51,332
And you will wait a month
to get your money.

565
01:34:52,708 --> 01:34:54,293
Naturally.

566
01:34:54,376 --> 01:34:56,754
I'll be in the tavern.

567
01:34:56,837 --> 01:35:00,924
The air around here stinks anyway,
just like the food.

568
01:35:01,008 --> 01:35:02,968
But the month will go fast.

569
01:35:43,259 --> 01:35:44,677
Right here.

570
01:35:45,720 --> 01:35:47,346
Let's go.

571
01:38:11,658 --> 01:38:13,869
I was worried about you.

572
01:38:13,952 --> 01:38:17,789
All alone with, uh,
so many problems to solve.

573
01:38:34,431 --> 01:38:36,558
It's all right here.

574
01:38:41,897 --> 01:38:43,523
Go ahead.

575
01:39:51,884 --> 01:39:54,470
You shouldn't have shot
the apples off that tree.

576
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:07,858
Put it on.

577
01:41:47,167 --> 01:41:50,170
What's he doing now,
this sheriff of EI Paso?

578
01:41:50,211 --> 01:41:53,506
Right now? Lookin' for the cash
that was in the bank.

579
01:41:54,674 --> 01:41:56,468
Right.

580
01:41:56,509 --> 01:42:01,306
And suppose he finds the bodies
of these men just outside EI Paso...

581
01:42:01,389 --> 01:42:03,683
with lots of money on them?

582
01:42:05,226 --> 01:42:07,187
What will the sheriff think?

583
01:42:07,270 --> 01:42:09,064
Well, he--

584
01:42:09,147 --> 01:42:10,857
That's right.

585
01:43:29,436 --> 01:43:30,979
Slim.

586
01:43:34,233 --> 01:43:35,817
What is it, Nino?

587
01:43:37,694 --> 01:43:39,446
A change of plans.

588
01:43:39,488 --> 01:43:41,740
Indio wants you to--

589
01:44:23,157 --> 01:44:25,075
It's not loaded.

590
01:44:48,849 --> 01:44:51,519
I think you should
get out fast now.

591
01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:54,814
Here's your guns without bullets.

592
01:44:54,897 --> 01:44:57,775
Listen. Don't you let lndio
find you both around.

593
01:45:46,491 --> 01:45:49,994
I know you don't like questions,
but why are you doing this?

594
01:45:52,997 --> 01:45:56,000
How long have you known
that Monco's a bounty killer?

595
01:45:57,919 --> 01:46:00,129
I found out tonight. Why?

596
01:46:03,341 --> 01:46:06,386
I knew he was one from
the first moment he arrived.

597
01:46:12,100 --> 01:46:15,019
The other one's also
a bounty killer.

598
01:46:16,646 --> 01:46:18,690
So I have an idea.

599
01:46:18,773 --> 01:46:20,942
They'll be useful to us.

600
01:46:22,277 --> 01:46:23,903
We'll try it.

601
01:46:24,988 --> 01:46:28,449
Those men are a lot better
than mine with a gun.

602
01:46:28,533 --> 01:46:32,829
So we'll let all of them
get mixed up in a gun battle.

603
01:46:32,912 --> 01:46:35,832
But that won't
really matter to me.

604
01:46:38,418 --> 01:46:39,961
Or you.

605
01:46:42,088 --> 01:46:45,133
Because we'll be far away, right?

606
01:46:50,638 --> 01:46:53,308
And we'll have all the money.

607
01:46:55,852 --> 01:46:57,646
Go on.

608
01:46:57,729 --> 01:46:59,981
Go on and wake Cucillo.

609
01:47:49,406 --> 01:47:50,782
Who did it?

610
01:47:50,824 --> 01:47:53,368
Why don't you look
at the knife?

611
01:48:01,668 --> 01:48:03,670
It's mine.

612
01:48:03,712 --> 01:48:06,715
Then it shouldn't be there,
should it?

613
01:48:16,308 --> 01:48:19,478
But I didn't kill him.
I didn't do it.

614
01:48:21,980 --> 01:48:24,608
It's difficult to prove that.

615
01:48:27,402 --> 01:48:28,862
I am innocent.

616
01:48:28,946 --> 01:48:31,448
One of your horses is outside.

617
01:48:32,533 --> 01:48:35,035
Let's see if you can get to it.

618
01:49:22,750 --> 01:49:24,251
He just killed Slim.

619
01:49:26,212 --> 01:49:30,466
And he-- he helped those
two bounty killers get away.

620
01:49:34,261 --> 01:49:35,846
I want them back...

621
01:49:37,473 --> 01:49:39,183
right now.

622
01:49:52,113 --> 01:49:54,407
What are you doing here?

623
01:49:54,448 --> 01:49:56,951
Go and get them back!

624
01:50:01,205 --> 01:50:06,043
Those two bounty killers are sitting on
our backs and must be killed right away.

625
01:50:11,090 --> 01:50:13,050
We can't let 'em go free.

626
01:50:27,940 --> 01:50:29,525
It's done now.

627
01:50:31,527 --> 01:50:33,821
Prepare to get out of here.

628
01:51:16,781 --> 01:51:18,032
Here.

629
01:51:19,826 --> 01:51:21,453
Hold it.

630
01:51:26,124 --> 01:51:28,960
Not a bad idea.

631
01:51:29,044 --> 01:51:31,546
But I'm one thing
you forgot about.

632
01:51:31,630 --> 01:51:33,298
Open it up now.

633
01:51:55,111 --> 01:51:57,364
All right, come on now,
open it.

634
01:52:55,839 --> 01:52:58,008
Leave lndio to me.

635
01:53:00,928 --> 01:53:02,429
All right.

636
01:53:34,795 --> 01:53:36,922
Where in hell is it?

637
01:54:05,201 --> 01:54:08,662
I'll kill 'em, but I'll rip
out their guts first.

638
01:54:08,746 --> 01:54:10,665
I have a plan.

639
01:54:17,129 --> 01:54:19,131
What?

640
01:54:19,215 --> 01:54:21,342
Let's just wait.

641
01:54:21,425 --> 01:54:23,552
They'll be back here.

642
01:54:25,596 --> 01:54:28,849
And this way,
there'll be two of us.

643
01:54:28,933 --> 01:54:32,103
Can they come back here?
Your men could've killed them.

644
01:54:32,186 --> 01:54:34,105
Who? They?

645
01:54:37,525 --> 01:54:41,112
Are you sure of that?
That they haven't?

646
01:54:44,699 --> 01:54:46,909
I thought something different.

647
01:54:46,993 --> 01:54:51,831
You made the boys ride on out to
make sure they're both killed, and fast.

648
01:54:51,914 --> 01:54:55,126
I'm not as dumb
as the rest of them.

649
01:54:56,252 --> 01:54:58,171
There was no help for it.

650
01:56:31,765 --> 01:56:33,266
Go on.

651
01:58:21,250 --> 01:58:22,668
That watch--

652
01:58:24,170 --> 01:58:26,964
It's been a long time
that I wanted to ask.

653
01:58:28,424 --> 01:58:31,177
I can see that it means
a lot to you.

654
01:58:31,260 --> 01:58:32,803
Why?

655
02:00:09,484 --> 02:00:11,069
Listen to me!

656
02:00:12,904 --> 02:00:15,073
This is Colonel Mortimer!

657
02:00:17,659 --> 02:00:19,327
Douglas Mortimer!

658
02:00:21,579 --> 02:00:23,998
Does the name
mean anything to you?

659
02:01:56,550 --> 02:01:59,803
When the chimes end,
pick up your gun.

660
02:01:59,887 --> 02:02:02,222
Try and shoot me, Colonel.

661
02:02:04,892 --> 02:02:06,894
Just try.

662
02:04:02,009 --> 02:04:04,387
Very careless of you, old man.

663
02:04:30,580 --> 02:04:32,248
Try this.

664
02:04:39,380 --> 02:04:41,299
Now we start.

665
02:06:31,952 --> 02:06:33,287
Bravo.

666
02:07:14,828 --> 02:07:17,456
There seems to be
a family resemblance.

667
02:07:23,837 --> 02:07:25,381
Here.

668
02:07:30,094 --> 02:07:33,055
Naturally, between
brother and sister.

669
02:07:33,097 --> 02:07:34,723
My gun.

670
02:07:39,812 --> 02:07:41,063
My boy...

671
02:07:42,148 --> 02:07:44,525
you've become rich.

672
02:07:44,567 --> 02:07:47,236
You mean we've become rich,
old man.

673
02:07:47,319 --> 02:07:50,364
No, it's all for you.
I think you deserve it.

674
02:07:51,490 --> 02:07:53,784
What about our partnership?

675
02:07:56,245 --> 02:07:57,913
Maybe next time.

676
02:08:40,581 --> 02:08:44,836
Ten thousand, twelve thousand...

677
02:08:44,919 --> 02:08:46,337
fifteen...

678
02:08:47,338 --> 02:08:49,048
sixteen...

679
02:08:49,132 --> 02:08:50,383
seventeen...

680
02:08:52,176 --> 02:08:54,345
twenty-two--

681
02:09:01,853 --> 02:09:03,855
Twenty-seven.

682
02:09:05,523 --> 02:09:06,983
Any trouble, boy?

683
02:09:09,569 --> 02:09:11,154
No, old man.

684
02:09:12,530 --> 02:09:15,617
Thought I was having trouble
with my adding.

685
02:09:15,700 --> 02:09:17,076
It's all right now.
