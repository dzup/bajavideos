1
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,152
Yes, you are such a big boy.

2
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,959
You are sweet.
Yes ...

3
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,316
We can only get money for the two.

4
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,830
There is not enough.
Just let them stand.

5
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,356
Come on.

6
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,869
Oh ... Oh.

7
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,073
Do you know where mom is gone, what?
Do You Know?

8
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,356
Come over here.

9
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,950
Have you missed us?
We have been in school.

10
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,596
He should be called something.
I run a finger down the page -

11
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,234
- Then you say stop.
Do not peek.

12
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,476
- Are you going to say stop?
- Stop ... What does it say?

13
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,076
Ulla.

14
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,274
He can't be named that.
No, you wouldn't be named that, would you?

15
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,556
Jette Stick.

16
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,512
Heide.
Mette Helming.

17
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,395
- But he is a boy.
- We will try again.

18
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,237
- Say now stop, damn.
- Okay, stop.

19
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,709
It's a good name.

20
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,914
Try looking here.

21
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,878
- It is very good.
- We take that.

22
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,276
In The fathers -

23
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,438
- And the Holy Spirits ... spirit

24
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,677
- You say that?
- Yes, keep your mouth shut now.

25
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,759
We do it right.
Like in a church.

26
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,069
Where is ...

27
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,879
Where is my vermouth?

28
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:38,474
You have taken it, no?
You also took my cigarettes, right?

29
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,077
Nick, give me my vermouth.

30
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,840
You have been drinking it yourself.

31
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,109
- What?
- You drank it.

32
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,231
See, she has pissed on the floor again.

33
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,516
She is so creepy.

34
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,430
Nick?

35
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:18,111
- Do you think he is sick?
- No, he should just sleep.

36
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,954
Want some food?
I've made something for you.

37
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,196
Do you sleep?

38
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,116
Wake up ... Wake up.

39
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,477
Wake up now.
Wake up now, damned.

40
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,478
Wake up now.
Wake up now!

41
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,750
No!

42
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,157
No. ...!

43
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,590
No!

44
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,951
Hi, Nick.

45
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,948
Nick, it's Sophie.

46
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,391
I made some coffee.

47
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,431
Nick...

48
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,518
What the hell is happening?

49
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,840
- What is it?
- Come in.

50
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,158
He had something spiky hair.

51
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,511
He was so sweet.
I want a lot of children.

52
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,235
You can't even
look after him you have.

53
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,956
- Relax. I can as well.
- Do you ever see him?

54
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,708
Relax. You don't nedd to be
so pissed all the time.

55
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,320
- Do you need a haircut?
- Don't.

56
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,474
Shall I get you to relax?

57
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,958
Will you lie down?
You may lie here.

58
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,358
- You may sleep here.
- Otherwise, thank you.

59
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,475
- You never bother to sleep here.
- See you.

60
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,476
- Hello.
- Hide and seek!

61
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,755
- Hello ...
- Who is it?

62
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,315
Hello?

63
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,634
- No, not you again. What are you doing?
- You make a noise.

64
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,355
You've stayed at this hostel
for five months, right?

65
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,111
- And then what?
- Here we are talking nicely to each other.

66
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,393
- I ask you something very simple.
- Don't ask me anything.

67
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,556
Goodbye. Huttelihut.

68
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,996
I have asked you to turn down,
so I can sleep.

69
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,715
- No?
- Yes.

70
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,596
Turn off the radio, and don't
stomp around like you own the place.

71
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,115
It's Sophie.

72
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,879
- What have you done with your hand?
- Out.

73
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,475
Leave me in peace.
Do you understand?

74
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,712
Hey... Hey, Nick.

75
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,593
Come here.

76
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,077
- Ivan?
- Can't you help me up?

77
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,398
Damn, man.

78
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,716
What happened?

79
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,994
I just looked at their car.
And got to touch a little about it.

80
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,796
And then they freaked out completely.
Fuck, it hurts, man.

81
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:06,117
Shall I come and look
at your car again, what?

82
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,110
Are you idiot or what? You can get
some more, if you will, man!

83
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,791
Listen here ...
Want more beatings?

84
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,151
- No thanks.
- So shut up.

85
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,798
What's happened to you, man?

86
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,788
Are you being such a,
you go and beat on, or what?

87
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,752
- Do you go and collect bottles?
- It's my bag.

88
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,915
What the hell are you doing, man?
Come here, we beat them!

89
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,878
Ivan, they are run.

90
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,352
What the hell are you doing? We beat them.
Come on Nick, we beat them.

91
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,158
I beat them!
Stop them!

92
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,876
I arrived at a hospital out in Hvidovre.
They did not understand a damn thing, man.

93
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,914
- They just gave me pills.
- Why should you have pills?

94
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,477
It was something,
I haven't seen my father for ten years.

95
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,468
He is still in Serbia.
I've been waiting for him.

96
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,956
So I tell them:
"Do not talk about my father."

97
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,438
Then pass it all, man.
And then they threw me out.

98
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,194
- What about your mother?
- My mother?

99
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,158
My mother died of drinking.

100
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,118
We buried her
three weeks ago.

101
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,918
Ohh ...

102
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,398
Was your brother there?

103
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,194
Yes, of course.

104
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,437
I thought you were sitting in jail.

105
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,997
- Were you released, or ...?
- Of course I was released.

106
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,158
- Okay.
- I came out three months ago.

107
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,316
Have you seen my sister?

108
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,829
No.

109
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,310
Why were you in jail?
What happened?

110
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,637
- I can't remember.
- You will not remember it.

111
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:09,630
My sister threw you out, and the whole week
after you went berserk. You beat one.

112
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,310
- Eat, I'm going. 
- Relax, Nick.


113
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,951
Want to hear something weird?

114
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,709
I couldn't taste anything
in a whole week.

115
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,833
No matter what.
I drank a lot.

116
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:39,836
Then there was this guy.
A completely random. I knocked him down.

117
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,508
Hard.

118
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,598
Do you still have the A?

119
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,950
Ana.

120
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,790
She will not see me anymore.
My own sister.

121
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,310
- Why not?
- It's a little strange ...

122
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,478
Sometimes I get such ...

123
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,872
What do you mean that it is strange?

124
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,516
She was sleeping at home with my mother.

125
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:20,636
So I'd put myself beside
of her. Like when we were kids, right?

126
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:25,630
And then I came to do ...
You know, kind of ...


127
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,271
- Fuck it.
- Did you paw her?

128
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,232
No ...

129
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,356
It was not meant, right?

130
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,791
- It's sick, Ivan.
- I know.

131
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,233
I think about it all the time.

132
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,319
- Have you ever had sex with a girl?
- I have fucked many.

133
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,396
Not really. I get sad,
when you talk about it.

134
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,512
I'm sorry.

135
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,395
I try to think of something else.
So don't start it.

136
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,515
I try to think of cars. I'm looking at
cars to think about anything else.

137
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,951
To some big, wet tits -

138
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,879
- And a butt that rubs my belly.

139
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,789
- And sperm over her head.
- Okay, fine.

140
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,913
I get mad. I am also thinking
at things, that are not normal.

141
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,192
Ivan, calm. I understand.

142
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,948
- Now, you don't begin to cry, right?
- Well I do not.

143
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:49,189
- In hell, man.
- I've missed you crazy, Nick.

144
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,949
You were like a brother to me.

145
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,317
- How long has it been? Two years?
- I have no idea.

146
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,637
- I think it's two years ago.
- Is it?

147
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,513
Come here, Nick. I've missed you.

148
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,554
You should sit in my kitchen
with my sister, and eating crackers.

149
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,753
- Can you remember?
- Yes, lovely ...

150
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,916
I know what we need.

151
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,875
- Good evening. Welcome.
- Thanks.

152
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,039
My friend Ivan must have
a suck'n fuck.

153
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,271
Sorry. Sorry ...

154
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,235
I bought a sweater for you. Hello.

155
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,635
Take it on.

156
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,438
I have also followed a girl.

157
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,396
I wouldn't do something to her, Nick.

158
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,479
Ivan. What then?

159
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,990
I just followed behind her.

160
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:41,753
So she went into a staircase, and I
slipped in before the door closed.

161
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,315
I would just walk past her.

162
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,195
Past her hair.
Just smell her, you know.

163
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:58,428
Just when I shall pass by her,
she turns around and looks at me.

164
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,428
Then she begins just
to scream and scream -

165
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,915
- And I can't handle it.

166
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,192
So she got one on the head man.

167
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,154
And then I run down the stairs. Away.

168
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,193
I wouldn't do something to her, Nick.

169
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,197
I just wanted ...

170
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,476
... sense her.

171
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,317
- What then?
- He's staring at my lady's ass.

172
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,195
- You drool over her.
- If you don't have to look ...

173
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,712
- What then?
- So she shouldn't be that way.

174
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:38,948
- Do yourself, your fucking cheese!
- She's bursting with bum ...

175
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,957
Do you play smart?

176
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,270
No, stop!

177
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,678
- Now we go.
- What are you doing?

178
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,110
Idiots!

179
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,317
What the hell is happening, man?

180
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,876
- What happens?
- It's not me. It is with Sophie.

181
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,117
For according to child psychologist
the municipality -

182
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,029
- It is important that children have contact
with their biological mother.

183
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,072
Bent!
Take, however, your shoes on, dammit.

184
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:27,831
You may well have shoes on, you just
not to stomp around.

185
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,315
- Hey, what's going on here?
- Hey, Nick.

186
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,957
This is my son.
It's Nick.

187
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,676
- Say what you called.
- I have no desire to say something.

188
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,270
Well, his name is Tobias.

189
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,830
How did you get hold of him?

190
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,434
Mom, I'm hungry.

191
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,189
We go a little bit. You get some food,
once you've played a little more.

192
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:52,712
- Comes Dad soon?
- No, he comes only a little later.

193
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,433
I'm leaving. See you.

194
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,671
Hi.

195
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,753
- Who is it?
- It's me.

196
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,232
- What?
- Can you help us in two minutes?

197
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:18,433
- With what?
- Can he be with you for two minutes?

198
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,191
There has been a misunderstanding.
The police are here.

199
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,158
- And?
- I come. It's just two minutes.

200
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,228
Sit overthere.

201
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,877
Here is a little messy
but you may submit to.

202
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,473
Did she just picked you up?

203
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:05,309
No, he's not.

204
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,910
Just take it easy.
It stops soon.

205
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,955
I do not know.
He is in kindergarten, I assume.

206
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,550
Do you want to go home to your father?

207
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,117
I can go by myself.

208
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,233
Hello. This is Tobias.
I think it's him, I'm looking for.

209
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,908
Come, we go in to me, darling.

210
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,191
You know what ...?

211
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:04,076
Don't!
Ouch... damned!

212
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,396
Release him. Now!

213
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,673
Do you hear? Release him!

214
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,950
You called to -

215
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:37,315
- 23 52 01 44.

216
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,909
Leave a message.

217
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,999
Hi, this is your big brother.
I would like to get hold of you.

218
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,912
Hi, Nick.

219
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,674
Are you stoned?

220
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,073
Haven't you slept yet?

221
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,509
Do you sleep here?

222
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,636
Yes.

223
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:57,670
- Explain to me again what we are doing here.
- You must see her, Nick.

224
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,633
Who's car is that?

225
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,075
- If you follow a girl again ...
- Calm down. Wait and see.

226
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,356
It's Ana.

227
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,556
It's her birthday.

228
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:34,350
Ana took such a pregnancy test -

229
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,033
- Which was positive.

230
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,749
I said, I thought,
we should have it.

231
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,869
But it was evident
the wrong thing to say -

232
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:56,631
- Because she went from me.
She got an abortion. That was it.

233
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,798
Fuck, it's a long time ago.

234
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,358
Would you like to have children?

235
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,870
With her I wanted it all, man.

236
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,431
I also think that you would be
good to take car of a small child.

237
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,956
Go ahead. Thank you.

238
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,430
Then she was bathing
and began beating her.

239
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:59,599
- Then she ran out.
- It's too crazy.

240
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,236
She did not come out again, so ...

241
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,353
She was still a little fat one.

242
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:11,314
- So you were perhaps glad to escape?
- Yes.

243
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,229
Do you think I'm cute?

244
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,830
Just say if there is something
I shall do.

245
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,431
- Want to touch my breasts?
- Yes. Should I just ...?

246
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,677
Yes. I can help you.

247
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,149
Shall I help you?

248
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,313
Have you never tried it before, Ivan?

249
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,836
It's okay.

250
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,798
It's pretty cute.

251
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,599
You may well move further down.

252
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,232
- Can you feel that I'm wet?
- Yes.

253
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,313
I go out in ten minutes.

254
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:32,510
Hello. I want
my brother's address.

255
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,790
I have a phone number.

256
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,994
Who are you?

257
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,351
I'm looking for my brother.
He lives there.

258
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,678
There are no home. He hasn't
been home the last few weeks.

259
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,149
Just that nothing has happened.

260
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,312
He was so sweet, your brother.
And so to him the sweet little Martin.

261
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:57,235
- Is there something wrong?
- No, no, I ...

262
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,437
I've never seen how he lives.

263
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:11,237
I've removed the ads. So nobody
can not see, that he is not home.

264
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,390
If you see him, say,
that he shall call me.

265
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:20,070
- If he shows up, right?
- Okay.

266
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,151
Thank you.

267
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,354
Hey!

268
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,755
Ivan!

269
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,518
Hi, Nick.

270
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:45,350
- What are you doing?
- Nick?

271
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:49,155
You must be out here.

272
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:53,592
It is not so good in there.

273
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,036
What the hell are you talking about?

274
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,548
Stop ... No, stop, Nick!

275
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,116
What happens?

276
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:13,275
- Ivan!
- It was just because ...

277
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:17,871
Suddenly she began to scream.
I wanted her to stop.

278
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,636
Ivan!

279
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,516
Stop it.
I can't take it anymore.

280
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,392
- Hello, darling.
- Hi, Dad.

281
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,759
What do you draw?

282
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,236
Me and mom.
And then I'm Zorro costume.

283
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:36,549
- Are you ready to go home?
- Just about two seconds.

284
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,955
Really.

285
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,476
Hello, darling.

286
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:50,549
- Had we forgotten lunch again?
- Yes.

287
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,711
Sorry.

288
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:58,829
- Do we just buy some food then?
- Jes.

289
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,159
Dad, I want toast.

290
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:09,832
Okay, toast.
But also something healthy, right?

291
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:13,191
- Should you drive the car?
- Yes.

292
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,034
Then there's flour and browning.

293
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,869
- Is there anything else you need?
- No thanks.

294
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:29,870
- I come over with it again.
- It does not matter. Keep the shit.

295
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:39,675
- Is this homework, you're up to?
- No, I draw.

296
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:44,749
- I go to kindergarten, I said.
- Oh yes.

297
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,714
Can you see him in two seconds?
I need the toilet.

298
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:52,151
Thanks for the information.

299
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:56,074
It's really beautiful.

300
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:01,115
Some more colors.
Then it would be really pretty.

301
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,754
What about green?

302
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:07,396
Yes, and what about a man
inside it there?

303
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,512
Now you just watch.

304
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,596
It don't looks like a space rocket.

305
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:24,038
- It took a while.
- Yes, okay. Want some food?

306
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,038
No thanks. I'm going.

307
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,950
- Thanks for the help, Vørle.
- Okay.

308
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:50,029
They write that you get him late,
and he seems tired and aggressive.

309
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:54,518
He sleeps badly at the moment.
He thinks much of her mother.

310
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,349
Martin's mother was in a car accident
two years ago.

311
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:02,030
Both you and Martin's mother
were junkies?

312
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:07,633
- Have you started taking drugs again?
- No, not at all.

313
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:13,312
- You don't seem to feel good.
- Well ... Okay.

314
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,511
- I think it's flu ...
- I don't think you understand the seriousness.

315
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,349
We have started a process -

316
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:27,155
- which can end
a placement of your boy.

317
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:31,797
It will be assessed if you are
able to take care of him.

318
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,074
Okay.

319
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:41,630
- Shall we say it, in the first place?
- Yes.

320
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,434
And regarding cash assistance ...

321
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:49,191
Just forget it.
We'll find out.

322
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:52,710
You can get three days' advance.

323
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,355
Just one more thing.

324
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:13,748
I don't care about anything else
than my boy, okay?

325
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:22,238
- Dad, I'm hungry.
- Okay.

326
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:33,157
Sit straight and look a little television, right?
Dad goes to the toilet.

327
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:36,591
I want something to eat now, Dad.

328
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:42,792
So I make just one sandwich.

329
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:50,114
It's okay.
Just go to the toilet.

330
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,910
Okay. So sit down here.
Take of the jacket.

331
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:03,030
So.
I get a minute, okay?

332
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,559
Yes.

333
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:30,837
Come here.
Into Dad's bed and sleep, right?

334
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:37,958
Little darling ...

335
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:41,994
You can'ot lie on the floor, can you?

336
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,959
Come on, Martin.


337
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,480
- What is it?
- Come.

338
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:10,110
Yes, yes.
What is it?

339
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:15,559
- Look ... Zorro.
- Yes!

340
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,274
So...

341
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,115
Fuck!

342
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:40,110
Hello.

343
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:46,512
Who?
Yes, it is my mother.

344
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,711
How is she?

345
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,636
Well ...

346
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,955
Well.

347
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:04,271
What time did she die?

348
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:11,675
Yes, try.

349
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:15,873
I don't know how to get hold of him
but you can try.

350
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:21,479
Yes. Yes, fine.

351
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,114
You're welcome.

352
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:37,071
- Honey, now you'll have to go into.
- What should you do?

353
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,510
Dad is busy. Go now.

354
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:43,156
- You get me, right?
- Of course I get you.

355
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:46,875
I always come and pick you up.
Now go.

356
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,276
Martin, please remember this.

357
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,188
Take it.

358
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:15,676
Yes.

359
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,792
Martin, your father has come.

360
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,070
Hi, Dad.

361
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,558
I find Martin's clothes.

362
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,917
- It is a drawing to grandma's chest.
- Come.

363
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,196
You must see it.

364
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,469
Come on, Martin.

365
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:05,956
Martin, your clothes are here.

366
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,437
I can by myself.

367
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,916
Dad.

368
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,989
Dad, do you sleep?

369
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:51,751
I think I must in kindergarten now.

370
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:55,430
Of course, darling.

371
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:00,950
What time is it?
Oh no.

372
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,918
I come now.

373
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:11,111
We'll probably a little late, Martin.

374
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:15,472
- Do you have breakfast?
- Yes.

375
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:21,195
I do not know Martin ...

376
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:24,915
It doesn't matter. But I would like
have lunch with me.

377
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:31,195
You get one by tomorrow. Then you
eat a little of Hjalte's again today.

378
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:34,676
- No.
- Jes.

379
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,956
- Yes, Martin.
- No!

380
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,714
No, I will not eat his food!

381
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:43,196
- That you have to!
- No! I do not want more!

382
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,356
Martin, so ...

383
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:48,711
Come on. Come here.
So, relax.

384
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:53,198
- Give now go! Do not!
- Come here.

385
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:56,676
- Let be.
- Calm down. Easy.

386
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,874
Come on.
Come here.

387
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:08,995
I know.
I know.

388
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:14,833
I know.
I know, sweetheart.

389
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,316
I will think of something, right?

390
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:22,798
- Hello.
- It's home help.

391
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,629
It is not today,
I need home help.

392
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:31,469
Lizzy Holm?
So it is today.

393
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:36,872
Hello. I'm about to make some food.
Want some food?

394
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,196
No thanks.

395
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:44,349
Are not you hungry?
Don't you want a piece of bread?

396
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:50,400
What are you doing?


397
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:53,797
- You are insured.
- You can not take my stuff.

398
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:59,516
Don't take my wedding rings!

399
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:04,917
- Where is your money?
- I have no money. I have none.

400
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:08,157
- Where is your money?
- I have no money.

401
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:11,830
Tell me where the money is.
Otherwise I break your legs -

402
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:14,429
- And let you lie.

403
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:30,394
Put it there.
Just stop it.

404
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:42,111
Good.

405
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:45,878
- Hey, Nick.
- Hello.

406
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:52,310
It's my older brother, Nick.

407
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:55,114
You may as well say hello.

408
01:00:56,680 --> 01:01:01,834
- Hello. My name is Martin.
- Hi, Martin.

409
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:06,118
I did not expect to see you.

410
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:09,517
I didn't expect to come.

411
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:14,510
But someone comes a with some
papers. Can we meet afterwards?

412
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,676
Okay.

413
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:50,435
- What do you have?
- We share a cola.

414
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:55,794
- I agree. What do you have?
- Okay ... What do you want?

415
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,834
- A cola.
- A cola and a lemon water.

416
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:04,431
Lemon Water? A cola
a lemon water and a Tuborg Gold.

417
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:08,030
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.

418
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,954
Chicken and fries.

419
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,592
- It's good to see you again.
- Yes.

420
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:22,593
- Where do you live now?
- Northwest.

421
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:25,914
I don't have your phone number.

422
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:28,918
I have no phone, so ...

423
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:36,548
Mom had an allotment-house -

424
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:40,309
- And it has become much more valuable.

425
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:44,791
- 200.00 to 300.000.
- 200.00 to 300.000?

426
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,833
Yes. The money goes to us.

427
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:52,794
It's 289.000.

428
01:02:55,960 --> 01:03:00,192
- Thanks.
- You must have my number.

429
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:06,516
Just type it here.

430
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:20,078
- Here.
- Thanks.

431
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:31,191
Martin, you can just run around and play,
while waiting for food.

432
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:35,876
Take on your jacket.

433
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:51,511
You can just keep them.
The money from the mother.

434
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:54,869
I shouldn't have them.

435
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:59,471
- Why not?
- I want nothing from the mother.

436
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:06,153
- Beer is also less expensive.
- I've mastered it, Nick.

437
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:10,911
- Fine. I am not interfering.
- I have mastered it.

438
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:17,398
I do not think of you.
I think of the boy.

439
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,998
Not?

440
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:54,118
Where'd he go?

441
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:56,510
He went.

442
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:03,312
Come, we go.

443
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:08,594
Now we spend some money.
For there will be many more soon.

444
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:11,872
- Can you see all the shelves?
- Yes.

445
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:15,356
Go ahead.
What do we take?

446
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:18,791
- Fish fillet.
- Salad. A little healthy.

447
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,551
- And the fish fillet.
- More fish fillet. Juice. And mackerel.

448
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:28,356
And Risifrutti.
And curry herring.

449
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:32,758
Should you have bully beat, huh?
Should you have bully beat?

450
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:44,317
Just leave it here.
Then I take it from there.

451
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:50,038
- That was it. You just have to acknowledge.
- So I pull it from my account, right?

452
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:54,028
Can't you even
come over to me? Slacker!

453
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,629
We've tried a roller coaster,
The Flying Trunk and the Dragon.

454
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:49,035
What do we lack?

455
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:51,758
Daemon.

456
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:56,869
Demon, yes. And I need to shoot some
Bears for you, we agree on that?

457
01:06:57,040 --> 01:07:00,032
- Yes.
- Want a Coke more?

458
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:02,395
Yes, I will.

459
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:05,353
- Do you have a pen?
- Yes.

460
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:10,190
- I need a beer and a cola.
- Wait a minute.

461
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,948
Try looking here.

462
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:19,238
Who am I now?

463
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,639
Pjerrot?

464
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:26,308
Pjerrot!

465
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:34,395
- No, you are Zorro!
- I am as Zorro.

466
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:37,512
Want it?
And another.

467
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,954
So.

468
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,030
- Cheers.
- Cheers in the ship.

469
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:49,913
"Cheers to fucking shed" it says.

470
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,193
Right?

471
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,790
Try looking here.


472
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:07,078
If you save this Z...

473
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:11,999
... and I save it here Z
then we can always find each other.

474
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:15,589
Yes.

475
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:33,438
Dad ...

476
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:37,030
Dad, I can't sleep ...

477
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:42,429
Dad?

478
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:15,795
Just stay seated.
Be seated.

479
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,709
- You come from the Albanian?
- Yes.

480
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:25,193
- Is it for me?
- Yes.

481
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,872
Good.

482
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:53,278
He doesn't come in here today.
He is in a bad mood.

483
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:57,473
Now I make money with out the car.
And if they are all there -

484
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,433
- Then you get what you paid for.

485
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:04,269
If they are not there,
then we take 50,000 for the hassle.

486
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:07,517
And you will be allowed to walk out the door.

487
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:11,076
- And we should not be seen anymore.
- Will you count them here?

488
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:15,990
Relax. I know
the money is there.

489
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:21,991
There is no one
who try to cheat you.

490
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:27,638
People are just nervous if
a lot of money are flowing.

491
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,478
It looks silly.

492
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:32,353
And you only sell in town, right?

493
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:38,750
- You have a little boy?
- Yes.

494
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:41,952
Why are you doing this?

495
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:47,149
- In order to earn some money.
- For your boy?

496
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:51,273
And you will be taken.
What happens then?

497
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:55,155
I don't get taken.

498
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:34,511
Elias and Kalle,
I may not run on the stairs.

499
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:37,280
Hi, Martin.

500
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:39,914
- Is it your father?
- Yes.

501
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:46,275
- Mona. I am the new trainee.
- Hey, Mona.

502
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:53,393
Nice to meet you. I am standing here
with the attendance for our colony.

503
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:57,309
- Must Martin?
- At the colony?

504
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:00,557
We have sent some letters out.

505
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:04,878
- Can we have sent them to his mother?
- Martin has no mother.

506
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:11,314
So I usually get the letters.
But I have not seen them.

507
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:15,433
- She was run over by a roadhog.
- I'm sorry.


508
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:18,837
We are doing very well alone,
ain't we Martin?

509
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:24,912
- Are you going to the colony?
- Yes, if I may.

510
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:28,874
Of course you may.
Will you?

511
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:31,719
Sure, I will then!

512
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:35,833
- Yes, he must. That he would like.
- It's fine.

513
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:39,995
See you.

514
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:43,033
Hi, hi.
Hi, Martin.

515
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:50,518
- Who is it?
- Wait a minute.

516
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:54,552
- Hello.
- We need to play hide and seek!

517
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:59,556
Hello.

518
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:01,472
Who is it?

519
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,953
Hello?

520
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:14,591
I don't know.

521
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:20,313
Hey.

522
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:23,956
Take care of yourself. Be good.
Give me a hug.

523
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:32,479
So go now.

524
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:38,478
Are you excited, Martin?
I am too.

525
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:43,435
Well, you can look after me.
There is a space beside Malthe.

526
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:47,792
I'll call you every night
and say goodnight. Hi, hi, Martin.

527
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,553
See you.

528
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:37,959
- Dope.
- What do you have?

529
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:42,517
- Very good dope.
- Shut up, what do you have?

530
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:47,396
- White Thai.
- I don't know it. Is it good?

531
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,068
Okay. 200.

532
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:58,113
Come on, damn it, man.

533
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:09,277
The same as yesterday.

534
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:56,074
Damn.
Stop.

535
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:59,078
I have 400.
I have 400 for you.

536
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,995
Is it something of the good?

537
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:15,679
You're new here, ain't you?
Take it easy, man.

538
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:20,590
If it's OK, I come
again. Ghanaians are too insane.

539
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:24,315
- Okay. See you.
- Yes. Clear out.

540
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:34,469
- Do you have some dope?
- How much?

541
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:56,793
You must not stand by Central Station.
Thhy sell only pills.

542
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,197
You are going further down the street.
If you want to sell.

543
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:03,198
You really have the goods, man.

544
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:05,550
Where are you from?

545
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:12,990
Every where.

546
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:16,829
- Are you nervous?
- For what?

547
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:22,068
They don't intercept the
phone. So stupid they are not.

548
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:25,352
You get that burning
sensation in the neck -

549
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:29,109
- When you walk in the street.
It is the one you should listen to.

550
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:32,517
It is as if someone is
following one.

551
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:36,838
But you can't feel
if you are a fucking nervous all the time.

552
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:44,388
It's good dope, you have.
Where does it come from?

553
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:47,797
You ask too much.
I'm going now.

554
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,958
- Wait a minute.
- I am going.

555
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:55,836
- Do you follow after, you'll be beaten.
- Relax, man.

556
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:59,669
I'm old school teacher, man.
I'm no cop.

557
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:02,838
You are completely out of control.

558
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:07,397
You need to get someone to sell for you.
You're bad to do it.

559
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:50,792
- He helps to cook.
- Okay.

560
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:55,516
Martin, your father is on the phone.
He comes now.

561
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:59,872
- Hello, darling.
- I found some amber.

562
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:05,200
- It is white, but it is amber.
- Okay.

563
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:09,188
- I must eat now, Dad.
- Yes ...

564
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:12,756
- You hang up first.
- No, you do.

565
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:17,112
- Okay, we do it simultaneously.
- Okay. I count to three.

566
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:23,748
One, two, three ...

567
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,950
Carsten.

568
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:42,755
- Jimmy says you can sell.
- Yes, yes

569
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:46,669
- And you're not doing shit?
- No, I don't make bullshit.

570
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:50,589
If you have good dope,
I can sell a few grams a day.

571
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:53,075
You take your own losses.

572
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:56,431
- If you fuck with me ...
- I don't.

573
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:01,033
- There are ten packages here.
- Okay.

574
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,595
Is it full of money when we meet,
we find out something.

575
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:10,191
- At two o'clock. Not just over.
- I arrive on time.

576
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:14,038
- Go now.
- Hi, Carsten.

577
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:19,832
He has been on the junk
since he was 14 years.

578
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:22,156
He knows the game.

579
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:27,150
He knows how to sell,
and where he will stay.

580
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,271
He is quick.

581
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:33,996
He makes the money for you and your son
so I can travel around the world.

582
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:37,590
Is it that way you want it?

583
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:44,676
So say thanks to Old Yellow
instead of being pissed.

584
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:49,198
Yes, yes. Thanks, Yellow.

585
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:51,669
Thank you. What happens man?

586
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:55,791
See you.

587
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:01,555
- Kindergarten, it is Mona.
- Hey, is Martin there?

588
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:05,116
He runs straight and play football

589
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:08,915
- So you must talk to me.
It doesn't matter?

590
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:14,274
Hello. Now remember
that ye shall teach Martin to bike, right?

591
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:19,679
- What should we teach him?
- To ride a bicycle.

592
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:24,271
We can do that.
But first let's talk a little.

593
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:25,953
Yes.

594
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:40,709
We eat in a minute.

595
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:44,833
Tomorrow I will teach you to bike.

596
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:47,838
I will not.

597
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:50,315
I'm, sure, I fall.

598
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:55,275
Of course, you will. I'm
free tomorrow and teach you that.

599
01:24:57,040 --> 01:25:01,033
Mona also appear.
So she can help you.

600
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:03,515
Is she your girlfriend?

601
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,514
Mona?

602
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:10,558
No. ...
Would it be okay if she was?

603
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,558
I don't know.

604
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:17,196
You know what?
You will be in school next summer.

605
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:22,349
No, I will not.
I will only go to kindergarten.

606
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:25,996
- Why would you not go to school?
- I  just will not.

607
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:30,478
You must go to school at a time.
Come here.

608
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:36,357
Listen, it's not dangerous.

609
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:39,233
And I go with you the first day.

610
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:47,908
I'd rather learn to cycle. I am
not going to school, if you not are with me.

611
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:50,759
Good. Go now.

612
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:02,915
- I dreamed about mom yesterday.
- What did she say?

613
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:05,873
Not so much.

614
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:13,914
Do you know, where she told me,
that we should have you?

615
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:19,478
- In the zoo.
- In the monkeycage.

616
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:22,035
In the monkeycage, yes.

617
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:28,399
I feel
she looks down on us.

618
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:32,828
Smiling.

619
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:35,713
I can also feel it.

620
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:44,154
I love you, honey.

621
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:50,793
I love you.

622
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:56,078
Money first.
Need I say it?

623
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:01,914
For 500.

624
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:11,196
- Hello.
- Hey, you old baggy.

625
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:14,915
what's going on?
It's crazy down there.

626
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:17,634
- Should we have a beer?
- Yes.

627
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:21,196
- We can talk about one hour.
- Yes, yes.

628
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:23,675
And Yellow? Thank you.

629
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:37,434
- Hello.
- Run, everything you can in hell!

630
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:40,712
Carsten is a sticking pig, man.

631
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:43,593
Throw away everything you have and run!

632
01:28:56,720 --> 01:29:01,236
Hello. My name is Ulrik Hansen
I am your counsel for the defend.

633
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:06,559
I'm busy,
so we'll have to keep it short.

634
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:10,469
You don't have
pronounced up to the police yet.

635
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:15,879
What happened?

636
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:22,033
You should have strangled her?

637
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:24,753
With that one?

638
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:36,678
Is there anyone
I need to contact for you?

639
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:43,709
You see me again soon, Nikolaj -

640
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:48,357
- And then we get one to
look at that hand.

641
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:30,830
We are coming
to talk with you about Martin.

642
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:37,952
You have been allowed to call him.

643
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:44,429
He is okay
at the circumstances.

644
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:47,632
I know it can be difficult
to talk with him -

645
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:52,197
- But it's the best for Martin,
if he knows where his father is.

646
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:54,630
He shall know
you're okay.

647
01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:00,156
Want to talk to him?

648
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,836
Yes.

649
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:11,356
Hello.

650
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:23,991
Martin? It's Dad.

651
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:27,954
- Hello, darling.
- Hello.

652
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:30,435
How are you?

653
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:33,670
- I don't know.
- Where are you?

654
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:38,072
Out in the country.
Dad, when can I see you again?

655
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:40,196
I don't know.

656
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:44,797
It'll probably take some time.

657
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:51,829
- Are they cute, where you are?
- They have rabbits.

658
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:55,112
Rabbits? Is it true?

659
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:57,390
I miss you.

660
01:31:57,560 --> 01:32:00,472
I miss you too, honey.

661
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:05,400
But it will be okay.

662
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:11,150
Martin?

663
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:15,154
Are you there?

664
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:20,749
Don't cry, honey.

665
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:23,195
I can't help it.

666
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:30,390
- Is there anyone who can comfort you?
- Yes, but they eat.

667
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:37,393
- Just go and eat, right?
- Shall I just go in?

668
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:40,398
Of course.

669
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:45,437
I'm thinking at you, my big boy.

670
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:48,151
Hi.

671
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:53,349
- Do you hang up now?
- No.

672
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:57,559
- You hang up.
- No, you do.

673
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:00,911
Okay. I count to three.

674
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:04,317
So we put on together, yes?

675
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:11,636
One, two, three ...

676
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:14,195
Hi.

677
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:19,671
Hey!

678
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:24,038
Little brother?

679
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,995
Nick?

680
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:48,113
- You look like shit.
- You too.

681
01:34:58,640 --> 01:35:02,633
- How long have you been here?
- Three weeks.

682
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:07,269
Where's Martin?

683
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:10,711
I do not know, where he is.

684
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:18,677
- I've been thinking of you.
- I've been thinking of you too.

685
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:23,112
I would like to
talking properly with you.

686
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:27,029
Or seen more to you.

687
01:35:29,120 --> 01:35:31,714
I tried to call.

688
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:37,909
I don't think
it was our fault then.

689
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:40,475
You were a good big brother.

690
01:35:42,680 --> 01:35:45,353
You did what you could.

691
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:50,149
And I did what I could.

692
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,389
What happens?
Are you okay?

693
01:35:56,880 --> 01:36:00,111
- I get off here, Nick.
- What?

694
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:03,118
- It's time.
- What?

695
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:04,992
What did you say?

696
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:07,435
Little brother?

697
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:14,075
- Take care of yourself.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute, man.

698
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:17,192
What happens to Martin?

699
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:20,073
Little brother!
I will talk to him!

700
01:36:21,880 --> 01:36:24,189
Little brother!

701
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:27,955
Fuck!

702
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:31,357
Let me outta here!
I want out!

703
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:33,516
Hello!

704
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:40,235
Little brother!

705
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:27,268
- Is Nikolaj Torp here?
- Yes, just go inside.

706
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:33,793
Nikolaj, how are you?
I bring you a bit of juice.

707
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:44,436
How are you?

708
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:49,952
I can still feel my hand.

709
01:37:51,320 --> 01:37:54,676
It all looks a bit strange.

710
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:59,114
I do not know, what you are doing.

711
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:04,633
The doctor can testify that your hand was
useless at the crime time.

712
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:08,276
And there are clear signs
of two hands.

713
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:13,034
I do not know who you conceal -

714
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:17,597
- But you should not take the blame
for a crime you didn't commit.

715
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:25,675
Is there anything you need?

716
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:28,593
Yes, I would like to see my brother.

717
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:33,870
I saw him at a exercise
A few days ago.

718
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:37,072
Is he also inmate?

719
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:39,919
I didn't know.

720
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:43,277
Wait a minute.

721
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:49,114
I'm going right out and call.

722
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:15,078
What is it?

723
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:23,119
Your brother is dead.

724
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:30,352
They found him yesterday morning
in the bathroom.

725
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:33,279
It was suicide.

726
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:51,951
You must
tell me the story.

727
01:40:00,720 --> 01:40:02,358
Okay.

728
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:49,517
Hi, Nick.

729
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:52,471
Hi, Ana.

730
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:00,273
What happened to your hand?

731
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:06,991
They have removed your tattoo.

732
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:18,076
- You got a baby.
- Yes.

733
01:41:19,720 --> 01:41:22,314
Alexander.

734
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:29,034
- Cool.
- He can only cry and sleep.

735
01:41:36,120 --> 01:41:39,829
It can be hard with a little one,
crying all the time.

736
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:46,679
Have you seen Ivan?

737
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:52,871
If you see him, say,
that he shall stay away.

738
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:57,068
What happened?

739
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:02,999
Just say it to him.
I'll have to go now.

740
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:08,792
It was good to see you.
Take care.

741
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:08,549
- Hi, Martin.
- Hey, Nick.

742
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:12,874
How are you?

743
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:14,837
I don't know.

744
01:43:16,720 --> 01:43:20,235
No. I know damn either.

745
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:26,997
What happened to your hand?

746
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:30,511
It is cut off.

747
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:34,876
- But I'll make it, don't you think?
- Jo.

748
01:43:37,240 --> 01:43:39,993
Should we follow up?

749
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:42,430
Yes we can.

750
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:01,838
- Hi.
- Hi.

751
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:04,873
- Hi, Martin.
- Sit down here.

752
01:44:05,080 --> 01:44:08,356
I would like to sit with him.

753
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:13,279
I am Martin's uncle.
Can he sit with me?

754
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:17,993
Come on.

755
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:30,596
Let's sit here.

756
01:44:40,120 --> 01:44:42,839
- Here we sat lately.
- What?

757
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:46,919
- Here I sat last time with my dad.
- That's right, yes.

758
01:44:56,240 --> 01:44:59,676
Then I tell
why your name is Martin.

759
01:45:20,040 --> 01:45:23,112
He also has one.

760
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:26,554
What?

761
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:30,309
Dad also has one,
so we can find each other.

762
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:11,916
- You say that?
- Yes, keep your mouth shut now.

763
01:46:12,120 --> 01:46:15,237
We do it right.
Like in a church.

764
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:20,230
Are you ready?

765
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:28,439
In The fathers -

766
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:30,756
- And the Holy Spirits ...

767
01:46:32,920 --> 01:46:35,434
... spirit.

768
01:46:35,640 --> 01:46:39,553
Are you currently christened ...

769
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:45,030
... Martin.

770
01:46:46,640 --> 01:46:48,437
Yes.

771
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:52,596
The Holy Spirit -

772
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:56,759
- Now's your name ... Martin.

773
