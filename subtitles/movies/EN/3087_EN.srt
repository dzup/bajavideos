POLITICAL CONSTITUTION

2
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,150
OF THE UNITED STATES OF MEXICO

3
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:50,150
HEROD'S LAW

4
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:55,070
My God, they lynched a Mayor
just when the President...

5
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,430
is talking about modernity
and social peace.

6
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,070
Don't fuck this up, López.

7
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:05,910
Don't worry, Mr. Governor. We've taken
the necessary steps to deal with it.

8
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,390
I'm talking about
the Presidency of Mexico, no less.

9
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,230
If I'm not careful, that asshole
Ruiz Cortinez will beat me to it.

10
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,310
I want to get through this clean.

11
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:20,110
If I don't get at least a ministry,
I'm out of the game.

12
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:23,110
Don't worry, General.

13
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:28,070
I assure you that
you are valuable to the party.

14
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,270
Look, López.

15
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,430
If you want to be governor,
everything must be resolved.

16
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,070
If people mention our state,
they must speak well of it.

17
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,950
You know better than anyone
who elects who around here.

18
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:45,510
If you want my job, don't give me any
problems like this San Pedro business.

19
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:51,790
Lynching a mayor when President Alemán
speaks of modernity and justice.

20
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,430
Don't fuck this up, Ramírez.

21
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:57,790
Don't worry, Licenciado.
We'll find someone soon.

22
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,510
This has to be resolved today.

23
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,550
I need to arrange things
with the governor.

24
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:08,470
He said I've been chosen,
so get looking.

25
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,350
Find me someone not too bright.

26
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,750
He will hold the post
for three or four months.

27
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,990
What do you think of him?

28
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:20,350
- Who's he?
- The least bad, but he's straight.

29
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,150
- He threatened to quit the party.
- No, no.

30
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:24,710
And this?

31
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,990
That's ''Sticky Fingers''.

32
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,550
I doubt he'd accept a shitty job
like Mayor of San Pedro.

33
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,870
And this one who looks
like Tintán. Vargas?

34
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:38,030
He's been in the party for
years. He joined when I did.

35
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,110
He's a good man. He'll
probably accept.

36
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,990
What do you mean
''a good man''?

37
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,150
I mean he's stupid.

38
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,750
Fine. Go and get him.

39
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,350
''Institutional Revolutionary Party
-Juan Vargas''

40
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:21,270
''Cleaning Department
Supervisor''

41
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,750
Good morning.

42
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,430
Ramírez?

43
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,470
Ramírez!

44
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:42,150
Fucking Vargas, you have to
call me Licenciado now. Okay?

45
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,590
It's been a long time.
Is that car yours?

46
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:49,150
Yes. Licenciado López sent me.
He wants a word with you.

47
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:54,230
The governor's secretary?
What about?

48
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:58,310
You're in a fine mess. Hurry up.
He's waiting for us.

49
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,190
Go in.

50
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,270
Wait for me here.

51
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,550
And behave, asshole.

52
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,870
Yes, tell him I'll call him.

53
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,510
Afternoon, Vargas.

54
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,510
-It's an honor, Licenciado.
-Sit down.

55
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:01,150
I'll be straight with you, Vargas.

56
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:05,710
As you know, modernity
has at last come to our country.

57
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,710
We must embody the ideals
of the revolution...

58
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:12,670
make President Alemán's
words reality...

59
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,550
help the country advance...

60
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:19,310
stamp out corruption, especially the mess
caused by those who don't agree.

61
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:24,830
Certain government
workers don't understand this.

62
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,670
They have taken advantage of their posts
to engage in private business..

63
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,750
and grow rich at the
nation's cost.

64
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:34,270
This country needs true patriots,
people like you.

65
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,190
Thanks, Licenciado.

66
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,710
I'm going to need your help.

67
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:44,030
Just tell me who
I have to kill.

68
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:48,070
No, no, Vargas. Times have changed.

69
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:51,550
You heard what happened
in San Pedro de los Saguaros?

70
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:56,230
The people rioted.
There was some kind of problem there...

71
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,070
and now there is nobody in charge.

72
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:04,510
We have to appoint a temporary mayor
who will keep order until the elections.

73
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,110
Right.

74
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:13,190
And how can I help, Licenciado?

75
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,870
You came up short, Ramírez.
Don't be a fool, Vargas.

76
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:22,150
The party has taken note of
you and I'm informing you...

77
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:27,710
that you are to be temporary Mayor
of San Pedro de los Saguaros.

78
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,830
M-Mayor? Me?

79
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,310
So you see how the revolution
is just with people like you.

80
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:37,430
I trust you totally, Vargas.

81
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,230
Totally.

82
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:44,550
This is a real opportunity. Maybe even
the start of a great political career.

83
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,630
That's right, isn't it?

84
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:51,710
Go to San Pedro and fulfill President
Alemán and Governor Sanchez's promises:

85
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,390
''Modernity and social justice.''

86
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:57,990
But listen
I don't want any problems.

87
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,470
If they mention San Pedro de los
Saguaros in the capital...

88
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,070
they'd better say nice things.

89
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,110
No messing things up.
Understood?

90
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:10,110
Don't worry, Licenciado.
How can I thank you?

91
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,150
Thank the party.

92
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:15,910
Remember:
''We owe everything to the party''.

93
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,630
There's more.

94
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,350
Here, take this.

95
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:24,190
Governor Sanchez himself
gave it to me...

96
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:29,310
so it's sure to bring you luck.
There.

97
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,110
Thank you, Licenciado.

98
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:35,110
Now all you have
to do is go to work.

99
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,190
Yes, sir.

100
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:41,110
Ramírez, brother,
thank you, thank you.

101
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,110
Licenciado!

102
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,190
Thank you, Licenciado.
Excuse me, Licenciado.

103
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:03,350
Here you go, Ramírez.
President Alemán gave me this as a gift.

104
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,230
Now it's yours
for finding me that fool.

105
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:23,830
Nothing more and nothing less
than mayor, honey.

106
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:29,270
Finally, after so many years
in that party...

107
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,190
something good happens to us.

108
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,390
Are you happy, sweetheart?

109
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,190
And this is just the start.
You'll see.

110
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:43,590
If I do well,
next stop is State Deputy...

111
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,670
then Congressman, my golden dream.

112
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:52,270
Just imagine, your name
on a plaque in the National Congress.

113
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:56,910
Better still, imagine:

114
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,430
Senator and Mrs. Vargas.

115
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,150
That doesn't sound bad.

116
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:06,110
Not bad at all, Mrs. Senator.
Not bad at all.

117
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:20,950
Excuse me. How far is it to
San Pedro de los Saguaros?

118
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,190
Good afternoon.

119
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,190
Excuse me.
Do you speak Spanish?

120
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,190
I think we're lost.

121
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:13,190
How far is it to
San Pedro de los Saguaros?

122
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:18,790
It's right here.
You must be the new mayor.

123
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,830
I've been waiting for you
since yesterday.

124
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,470
I'm Carlos Pek, your secretary.

125
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,790
Juan Vargas, at your service.

126
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:34,550
President Alemán and
Governor Sanchez...

127
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,550
have sent me to bring
modernity and social justice.

128
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,150
We've arrived.

129
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,230
Welcome, Madam.

130
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,270
Here?

131
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:03,310
''TOWN HALL''

132
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:14,910
You should go
and see your office,Juan.

133
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:18,590
What for? This is enough for me.

134
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,110
A fucking little backwater.

135
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,150
We're better off
in the garbage dump.

136
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:26,230
Don't say that.
You were nobody at the dump.

137
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,230
Here you are the chief.

138
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,910
The mayor.

139
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:37,870
Didn't you hear how they even
called you Licenciado?

140
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:41,230
- He did call me Licenciado, didn't he?
- Yes.

141
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,790
Do you honestly think
we are better off here?

142
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:48,990
Of course. Don't you see?

143
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,550
Here we're important people.

144
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:57,230
It's just the start,
but we have to be very, very...

145
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,270
smart.

146
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,670
Good morning.

147
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,790
Pek? Pek?

148
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:18,190
Word is out that there's a new mayor.
Everyone wants their affairs dealt with.

149
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:22,030
Please tell them I'll
see them later.

150
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:49,230
Alright, let's get to work.

151
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:56,830
- What's this, Pek?
- Unresolved matters, Licenciado.

152
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:01,070
There are many more, but these
are the most urgent.

153
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,110
These are agrarian problems.
This is--

154
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,830
Do you know what, Pek?

155
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:11,910
I think we should talk a stroll
so that I can get to know the place.

156
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,350
Don't you think so?

157
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:19,870
The village is very small--
less than 1 00 inhabitants.

158
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:26,550
Most of us Indians
who've lived here all our lives.

159
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,110
Good morning.

160
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,630
Don't be offended, Licenciado.

161
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,030
They are good people...

162
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:39,750
but most of them
don't even speak Spanish.

163
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,270
Really?

164
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,150
Don't they learn it at school?

165
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,310
Licenciado.

166
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,230
Look.

167
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:53,030
- That was the school.
- What happened?

168
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:56,510
They built it in the days
ofTata Cardenas.

169
00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:01,310
When the government changed,
they stopped paying the teacher...

170
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,830
and one day he left.

171
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,150
The same old story Licenciado.

172
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:09,790
What about the doors,
windows and everything?

173
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,190
That was one of
your colleagues.

174
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,310
What did he do?

175
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,510
One day, the bastard sold them...

176
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,870
along with the blackboard
benches and anything of value.

177
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,150
I don't believe it.

178
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,390
He didn't sell the walls because
nobody wanted to buy them.

179
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:28,230
He'd have sold the whole
village given the chance.

180
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:36,110
This has happened
with every mayor we've had Licenciado.

181
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,190
Listen Pek. What happened to
my predecessor?

182
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,390
Why did he quit?

183
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,670
Licenciado...

184
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:47,830
Didn't they tell you?

185
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:51,270
They cut off his head
with a machete!

186
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,670
What?

187
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:58,710
They cut it off, and that's not the end
of the story of the Mayors of San Pedro.

188
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:02,870
Another one was hanged,
another almost burned alive.

189
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,550
Three mayors killed in 5 years.

190
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:09,150
Why would they send me?

191
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,230
I don't know...

192
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:14,390
but they must have done
something, no?

193
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:19,030
Who knows?
But...just in case.

194
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,670
Good morning.

195
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,350
What's this, Pek?

196
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,110
Manslaughter.

197
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,910
Licenciado Vargas,
This is Doctor Morales.

198
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,110
Pleased to meet you, Doctor.

199
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:52,150
Six bullets.
This, like all the evils in San Pedro...

200
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:56,310
is due to that brothel.
I suppose you know it.

201
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,510
No, no.

202
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,470
With him, that's eight dead men...

203
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:03,590
not counting the diseases
half the village is infected with.

204
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,110
Something must be done
about that place!

205
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:10,870
Don't worry, Doctor. I'll take
the necessary steps to close...

206
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,390
It's your duty!

207
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,190
I've only arrived. I promise...

208
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:20,870
It's very easy. Do your job
and everything will be fine.

209
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:24,830
If not I promise you'll regret
ever coming to San Pedro.

210
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,910
Who's this man, Pek?

211
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:40,110
Doctor Morales is someone to
watch out for, Licenciado.

212
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:44,550
He's been the PAN candidate
for mayor four times...

213
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,550
and always complains about fraud.

214
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,070
Can you believe it?

215
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:54,110
From now on,
he's going to be your worst nightmare.

216
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,630
So it seems.

217
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,910
You can't imagine it.

218
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:04,990
- What shall we do, Pek?
- He had no relatives.

219
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,790
I suppose it's up to us.

220
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,310
We don't open until eight.

221
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,350
-I want to speak with your boss.
-She's sleeping.

222
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:00,190
Tell her it's the new mayor.

223
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,150
Wait here.

224
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,630
She says come in.

225
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:32,630
Miss, ah, how much
are you charging?

226
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,150
What can I do for you?

227
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:47,390
Good morning. Sorry to wake
you up at this hour, Doña...

228
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,670
-Lupe.
-Juan Vargas, at your service.

229
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,510
Sit down, Licenciado.
Get lost, you.

230
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,990
- A drink?
- Not in working hours.

231
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:02,950
Well, a little shot never
did any harm.

232
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:06,990
So you're the new mayor.

233
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,470
At your service, Madam.

234
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,190
And the thing is...

235
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,190
How can I say?

236
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:20,550
...that certain people are not
happy about your business.

237
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:26,550
Ah, Licenciado, you're just
like all the others...

238
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:31,030
...coming here for your
bribe, right?

239
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:39,550
No, madam, nothing of the kind.
It's just that people--

240
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:44,870
People or Dr. Morales? That old
son of a bitch won't leave me alone.

241
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:48,150
He turns the Indians
and everyone against me.

242
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,590
It's not just the Doctor.

243
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:53,870
There's a corpse outside--
someone who was shot here yesterday.

244
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:58,550
A corpse? No, Licenciado.
Someone's pulling your leg.

245
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:01,590
- Nothing like happened here.
- The thing is...

246
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:05,350
No, Licenciado, everything is in order.

247
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:10,270
Don Alfredo Garcia who was mayor
before you, gave me all the permits.

248
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,910
Are you going to take
this or not?

249
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:17,750
No, madam. There are things
which one can't do.

250
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:22,350
Why the hell not?
You're all the same, Licenciado.

251
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:26,070
You're not getting on your high horse
and telling me you're different.

252
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:28,230
No, Doña Lupe,
how can you say that?

253
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,470
I must shut this place down
for the good of the village.

254
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,590
Look, you fucking idiot.

255
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,910
Let's stop this right now.

256
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:45,870
If you have anything else to say, tell it
to the Priest. He calls the shots here.

257
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,670
-The Priest?
-Yes, the Priest, you heard me.

258
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:52,110
-Get out!
-Excuse me for bothering you.

259
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,110
-Scram.
-Excuse me.

260
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,470
-Shit.
-Good-bye.

261
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:58,870
And you, idiots. Get inside.
What are you doing there?

262
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:04,110
Excuse me, madam.

263
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:09,150
Doña Lupe,
what about the corpse?

264
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,430
Stick it up your ass!

265
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,190
Let's see, pal.

266
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:56,790
You said it yourself, Padre.

267
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:00,190
The flesh is weak and there
is much temptation.

268
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:03,030
Yes, but you get carried away.

269
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:07,670
-Oh, but Padre, you know.
-What does your husband say?

270
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,310
Nothing. He doesn't pay
me any attention.

271
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:17,030
Ego te absolvum. For penitence say
three Our Fathers and three Hail Marys.

272
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:20,710
Oh, and give me a peso
for every one of your sins.

273
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:39,550
-Oh, good morning.
-Good morning.

274
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,630
Chencha.

275
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,790
May I help you?

276
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,230
Good morning, Padre.

277
00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:00,030
I'm Juan Vargas, at your service.
The new mayor.

278
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,670
I know all that.

279
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:05,790
I was going to come and see you,
but I've had a lot of work.

280
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,150
What can I do for you?

281
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,830
Well, I've got a lot of problems,
Padre.

282
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:13,510
-Spiritual ones?
-I wish they were.

283
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:16,670
I've got a corpse outside.

284
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,470
I just saw Doña Lupe,
and she said I should talk to you.

285
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,790
Not in here.

286
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,390
Outside, better.

287
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:34,150
Hey, my son, how much
does a Packard like this go for?

288
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:37,070
I really, don't know, Padre.

289
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:39,230
What shall we do about
the corpse?

290
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,430
He's starting to stink.

291
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:45,790
That's the authorities' problem.
I just do the blessing.

292
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:52,630
What about the brothel, Padre?
I spoke to Doña Lupe and she...

293
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,270
...said you'd given her permission.

294
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:58,110
Ah, Doña Lupe. Did you two
work something out?

295
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,230
What?

296
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,510
Did you come to
an agreement?

297
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,310
Padre, I'm not like that.

298
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,190
-Ah, come on.
-I swear it, Padre.

299
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:10,950
Don't swear! Do you think
this shepherd doesn't know his flock?

300
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:14,830
Well, she did make me an offer...

301
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:17,590
but that's not why I came
to San Pedro de los Saguaros.

302
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,510
You should've taken
the money.

303
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,230
San Pedro lacks many things...

304
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:26,390
and Doña Lupe performs
an important social function.

305
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,830
That's five pesos
for the blessings.

306
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,510
Thanks Padre.

307
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,150
Being mayor is exhausting, Pek.

308
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,590
I never imagined it would
be so difficult.

309
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:00,990
It's been a bad day,
Licenciado...

310
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:06,710
But don't give up. It's a matter
of solving the problems bit by bit.

311
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:11,070
You know what? Just before I
came here...

312
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:14,350
I heard a speech by the President
that gave me some ideas.

313
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:18,310
I think they'll work for us,
what do you think?

314
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:22,030
First, we'd have to fix the school.

315
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:26,990
Then pave the streets,
install drainage. People just shit--

316
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,750
If you'll allow me a few words,
Licenciado...

317
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:32,630
Wait. Don't make me lose my train
of thought when the ideas are flowing.

318
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:38,670
Something grand so that people
will remember us...

319
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:44,990
a dam or a highway linking San Pedro
de los Saguaros to the capital.

320
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,390
What do you think?

321
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:52,990
They're great ideas,
but there's a problem.

322
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:54,590
What?

323
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,070
Seven pesos.

324
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:05,510
It's all that's left of
the budget.

325
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:10,470
The last mayor, he spent it.

326
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:15,030
And since then, they haven't
given us anything.

327
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:18,750
I thought maybe
they'd sent something with you.

328
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,710
I'm not hungry.

329
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:32,710
You're not go to solve
anything like this,Juan.

330
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,550
We have to think of something.

331
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,390
You can't go back
to the garbage dump.

332
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,710
Without money,
I can't do anything.

333
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:49,550
Go and see Licenciado López
first thing tomorrow.

334
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:53,310
Tell him what your problems are
and ask him for a larger budget.

335
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:56,350
But he told me he didn't
want any problems.

336
00:28:56,430 --> 00:29:01,070
But he didn't tell you
where he was sending us either.

337
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:05,390
Go see him. Play the martyr.

338
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,670
Take him a present.
That always works.

339
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:12,710
I know just what to give him.

340
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:15,630
In conclusion, President Miguel
Alemán declared before...

341
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,710
...the workers and peasant's sectors
that this devaluation...

342
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:21,750
...was painful but necessary,
and insisted that...

343
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,710
...by facing our problems decisively...

344
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:26,630
we can guarantee a bright future
for everyone.

345
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:29,790
No doubt there are people who
know how to do things well.

346
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:34,630
How can I tell
Licenciado López I can't do the job?

347
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,870
I'm putting my head on the line.

348
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:41,350
I'd rather be in your shoes.

349
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:46,910
Eat and sleep, sleep and eat.
That's life.

350
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:57,750
Fuck it!

351
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:33,710
-What?
-What happened to your car?

352
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:38,790
-The piece of shit broke down.
-Let's see if I can help you.

353
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,350
Get in.

354
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:49,790
Start it up.

355
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,630
Stop.

356
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,750
I think the engine's fucked.

357
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,670
Don't tell me.

358
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:08,270
It can be fixed,
but it won't be cheap.

359
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:11,190
Go ahead. I'll pay whatever.

360
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:22,070
Again, carefully.

361
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:29,030
-Hey, he who knows, knows.
-What do you say?

362
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:30,710
How much do I owe you?

363
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:35,110
Hey, for a Mexican friend,
just 1 00 dollars.

364
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,550
1 00 dollars?

365
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:41,630
Shit! But I don't have
that much money.

366
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:44,390
-Look, this is all I have.
-And the pig?

367
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:47,710
-No, it belongs to my boss.
-Well give me that.

368
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:51,590
But you'll leave me broke.
Look, this is what we'll do.

369
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:57,150
Go to San Juan de los Camotes
and wait for me there...

370
00:31:57,270 --> 00:32:02,110
I'm the mayor, see? Emilio Gabriel
Fernandez Figueroa at your service.

371
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,910
I'll pay you there, okay?

372
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:11,310
-What?
-I said it's okay, my friend.

373
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:14,670
Don't worry. We Mexicans are
people of our word.

374
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,670
I'll pay you on time.

375
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:20,750
- Thanks a lot.
- Have a good trip.

376
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:31,470
Fucking Gringo,
same as the rest.

377
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:35,110
They want to take us for a ride.

378
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:38,350
But they don't know that
we Mexicans are better fuckers.

379
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:44,270
-What's this, Vargas?
-A present from San Pedro de los Saguaros.

380
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:46,430
Get that swine out of here!

381
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:58,790
-So, what's new?
-Well, Licenciado...

382
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:01,270
I don't know where to begin.

383
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:07,310
I'd like to see if it's possible
for you to give me a bigger budget.

384
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,910
No, Varguitas, no, no.

385
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,750
The elections are coming up
and all our funds...

386
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:16,470
...must go to the party
so that there are no surprises.

387
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:21,150
Ask me for anything, anything at all.
But not that. Not now.

388
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:24,030
Well, since you're giving me
the chance.

389
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:26,110
How about moving me to another town?

390
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:31,630
Fucking hell, you really
turned out to be a wise guy.

391
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,910
No way. It's Herod's Law here.

392
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,750
Either you fuck them
or you get fucked.

393
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:41,190
But there's no money left.
This makes it very difficult.

394
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,790
We need so many things.

395
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:46,310
Imagine if everyone asked me for money
like you.

396
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,070
When it runs out, it runs out.

397
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:54,270
But Licenciado, I planned
to do as you told me...

398
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:57,790
...that modernity
and social justice stuff, but--

399
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:02,630
But, the truth is, it's difficult.

400
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,430
I'll give you some advice.
Sit down.

401
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:15,310
Here you are.

402
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:19,350
Federal and State Laws.

403
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:22,950
Do I have to read it all?

404
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:26,150
No, no, Vargas.
This will earn you your money.

405
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:30,190
If you know how to use it,
you can get money out of anyone.

406
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:33,310
You've got fines, taxes, license fees.

407
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:36,950
Use the law to your benefit and
you're made.

408
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:41,470
Remember, in this country,
honesty gets you nowhere.

409
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,910
But you get me into deeper trouble.

410
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:47,990
They don't respect authority
in San Pedro.

411
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:49,750
Authority?

412
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:54,750
Come here. I'll show
you authority. Stand here.

413
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,510
Hit me here.

414
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,630
No, no, Licenciado.

415
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:03,870
Go on, man, don't be afraid.
Hit me here.

416
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,710
Come here, Vargas.

417
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,230
Do you understand?

418
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:22,670
I'm your boss. Your superior.
Get it?

419
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,550
Anyone who breaks the law is
messing with authority.

420
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:28,990
They'll be punished.
I'm the authority.

421
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,150
Got it?

422
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:36,670
But-- but the people
in San Pedro are wild.

423
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:40,670
Did you know they cut the
last mayor's head off?

424
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,270
They cut his head off?

425
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,750
That's easily solved.

426
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:53,750
Take it.

427
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:57,150
Go on. Take it.

428
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:00,270
If they threaten you with a machete,
show them the pistol...

429
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:03,030
...and see if they still
give you a hard time.

430
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:06,190
Keep it, man, keep it.
Put it away.

431
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:10,990
You'll kill someone like that. And
remember when you read it in this book:

432
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:15,630
Executive power, legislative power,
judicial power. That's you.

433
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:21,710
The maximum authority of
San Pedro of the what?

434
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:25,830
- De los Saguaros.
- San Pedro de los Aguados, you got it.

435
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,590
Go on, and keep the gun.

436
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,790
Thank you, Licenciado.

437
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:37,070
Take this little book and this gun
and enforce authority.

438
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,630
Thank you very much.

439
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,790
-Excuse me.
-Go ahead.

440
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,110
Gloria!

441
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,710
Sweetheart, I'm back.

442
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,670
-How did it go, my love?
-Very well.

443
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:20,150
-Are we going to move to another village?
-No.

444
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:25,470
-Then they raised your budget?
-No, sweetheart. But look.

445
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:30,910
-What's that for?
-Licenciado López gave it to me.

446
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:34,550
You're going to bring
us problems.

447
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:37,750
No, my love. On the contrary.
This is the solution to our problems.

448
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:41,590
I know how. I must
study and learn to use the gun.

449
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:45,590
Fine, but put it down.
It's making me nervous.

450
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,750
My pistol makes you nervous?

451
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:57,790
There are crimes against
public order, moral offenses...

452
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:04,710
...prostitution, endocinity
and white slavery.

453
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:14,030
Sweetheart, do you know what
en-do-ci-ni-ty means?

454
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:17,790
No, I don't.
Let me sleep.

455
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:31,230
Where the hell are you going?
Always trying to sneak away!

456
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:34,190
If I hadn't seen you what were
you thinking of?

457
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:38,910
I take my eyes off you and you
fuck up!

458
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:45,750
Who were you sneaking off
to see?

459
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:48,030
Get inside, asshole!

460
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:56,190
Ungrateful little tarts!
Nobody else would feed the pigs.

461
00:38:56,310 --> 00:39:00,390
- Take it or I'll give it to them.
- Good morning, Doña Lupe.

462
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,030
What do you want,
you bastard?

463
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:07,470
With all due respect,
I have an order to close this house.

464
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:10,390
According to the penal code,
you're in violation of several laws.

465
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:15,030
Selling alcohol without a license,
involvement in manslaughter...

466
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:19,990
plagiarism, kidnapping,
procurement, rape...

467
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:26,390
corruption of minors,
threats, white slavery...

468
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:29,230
plus beating your employees
like that.

469
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:34,070
Look, this is my property,
alright Licenciadito?

470
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:38,470
In my house I'll beat up anyone
I fucking like. Got a problem with that?

471
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:41,830
Look, Doña Lupe. Here you can
read the laws where it's...

472
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:44,870
I don't give a shit about
your fucking laws!

473
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:49,550
Please, Doña Lupe. Have some respect.
I represent the Nation's Authority.

474
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:55,030
-You don't get it, asshole.
-Doña Lupe. Please, Doña Lupe.

475
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:59,350
I want us to communicate
like decent people.

476
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:03,190
Who do you think
you're going to scare?

477
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:05,830
You need balls to use that gun, asshole!

478
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:15,070
Coward! Come back, you son
of a fucking bitch!

479
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:17,110
Come back!

480
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:19,510
Son of a bitch!

481
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,630
What's up, Licenciado?

482
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:25,990
If they ask for me,
tell them I've gone.

483
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:29,590
No, that I don't work
here anymore.

484
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:42,670
Are you sure it was in the leg?

485
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:45,710
I think so, sweetheart.
Let's go.

486
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:50,670
Well, so what? That's what your boss
told you to do, right?

487
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,710
Yes. Something like that.

488
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:57,670
You're the authority, honey.
They have to respect you.

489
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:00,550
It's just that this lady...

490
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:07,390
Get back to work.

491
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:26,270
-Is your idiot boss in?
-Doña Lupe.

492
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,230
Come in, come in.

493
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:36,870
Good morning, Doña Lupe.
Come in.

494
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:41,710
How have you been?

495
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:47,510
- Pek please leave us.
- You too, get out.

496
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:49,430
Please madam.

497
00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:01,910
You're looking very well.
I wanted to apologize.

498
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:05,070
Cut the crap, Vargas.
Let's get to the point.

499
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:07,790
How much do you
want to leave me alone?

500
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:11,830
No, Doña Lupe,
the law must be obeyed.

501
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:15,830
Then just look the other way.
What does it matter?

502
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:21,430
Your business is very crooked,
Doña Lupe.

503
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:25,110
But you only know that because
are reading that huge book.

504
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:27,750
Here's more money.

505
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:34,750
You promise nobody will know,
Doña Lupe? You promise?

506
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:37,430
Nobody will find out.

507
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:41,030
So now we understand
each other.

508
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:46,550
You're a tougher cookie
than I expected.

509
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:50,190
Let me help you, Doña Lupe.

510
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:53,030
Get off, I can manage.

511
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:57,230
And to show you I don't bear a grudge,
come to the brothel.

512
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:58,990
I'll invite you
to one of my girls.

513
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:03,590
Thank you, Doña Lupe.
See you there.

514
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:08,670
Nosy little tarts!
Look at you!

515
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:38,670
Hello.

516
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:42,630
''Entry forbidden to Women,
Minors, Soldiers in Uniform...

517
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:44,710
...Animals and Indians''.

518
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:52,830
Fifty? No way. But how?
I don't make that much.

519
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:57,830
Well, how much
can you manage?

520
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,190
Well...

521
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:03,950
Maybe twenty,
once in a while.

522
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:08,790
Good. We'll discuss your
taxes later, eh?

523
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:23,790
Thank you.

524
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:33,230
Oh, that sign by the door.
It's hard to understand, confusing.

525
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:36,390
Take it down.

526
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:50,070
Just look at that.

527
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:08,950
Pek, fine this asshole.

528
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:11,230
What for, Licenciado?

529
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:15,670
Let me think.

530
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:25,270
Lock him up and we'll decide later.

531
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:30,310
Don't let him out until
he pays a fine of five pesos. No, six.

532
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:38,670
Juan, come to bed.

533
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:43,670
What's that?

534
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:49,630
Where did you get
all this money?

535
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:51,710
Oh, it's not mine. You won't
believe this.

536
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:55,710
It's money from contributions,
taxes, fines.

537
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:02,590
They're calling it something else
in town. Especially Dr. Morales.

538
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:06,390
He's going around saying
you're the worst one yet.

539
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:09,470
You be careful, dear.

540
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:12,430
That old bastard could ruin
everything.

541
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:16,390
I have to convince him that I'm
doing this for the good of the community.

542
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:19,270
I know.

543
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:24,070
Why don't we organize a dinner and invite
all the important people of San Pedro?

544
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:28,150
We've the money now.
That's what all politicians do, right?

545
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:33,670
Okay.

546
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:38,110
I love you, my dear.

547
00:46:57,470 --> 00:46:59,230
Good evening, friend.

548
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:13,590
I looked for you everywhere.
Where's my money?

549
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:15,190
How are you doing,
Sam, buddy?

550
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:19,590
My name isn't Sam. It's Robert.
Robert Smith. Nice to meet you.

551
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,590
What's this,Juan?

552
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:25,590
Gloria, this my friend, Robert.
He almost saved my life.

553
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:29,630
Hey, I want my money. You owe me,
remember?

554
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:33,590
I want you to pay me now. It's late
and I don't want to be on the road.

555
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:37,390
No, no way.
You stay with us here.

556
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:39,790
Gloria make us something to eat...

557
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:42,670
or they'll say that
we Mexicans are bad hosts.

558
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:46,310
Alright, I'll stay.
And the money?

559
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:51,550
Look friend. The country is
experiencing economic problems.

560
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:54,390
We'll talk about money tomorrow.
Go and get your things.

561
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:56,470
Okay.

562
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:01,430
Where's he going to sleep?

563
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:03,990
Look, I've got a good proposal for you.

564
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:07,950
Help me and I swear
I'll pay you everything. Plus interest.

565
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:10,110
What is it?

566
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:15,830
You play engineer and help me
modernize this village.

567
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:18,710
These people have all got money
stashed under their mattress.

568
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:22,030
Sure, but I want my money up front.

569
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:23,790
Look, I'm not talking about $1 00.

570
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:26,590
You could be making
a grand or more.

571
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:31,030
Maybe. But I want 50%
of what you get.

572
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:32,470
Fucked.

573
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:37,670
-I'll give you 20%.
-Fifty or nothing.

574
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:41,270
Okay.

575
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:46,230
As you know, we Mexicans
are men of our word.

576
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:50,390
Here, distrustful paleface.
Here's your paper.

577
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,350
Did you write down all
about the interest?

578
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:53,670
Yes. It's all there.

579
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:57,230
Okay, friend.

580
00:48:57,710 --> 00:48:59,670
To our partnership.

581
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:05,910
-What?
-Partners. Cheers.

582
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:08,430
Cheers, partner.

583
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:14,550
-Tell me, Mr. Gringo.
-Yes?

584
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:17,710
Is it true that your countrymen
are still very angry...

585
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:20,310
about the expropriation of
the oil business?

586
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:26,510
Well, a bit. But they know that
in time we'll get it all back.

587
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,430
And more. Much more.

588
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:47,030
What did he say?

589
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:50,350
He says that in the US they
think we're a dictatorship.

590
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:53,390
-And I agree with him.
-The perfect dictatorship!

591
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:57,350
No, no. Forgive me, but that's
why we had a revolution.

592
00:49:57,430 --> 00:50:00,230
In Mexico the vote is respected.

593
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:03,710
It's not our fault
that people always vote for my party.

594
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:09,950
If there was real democracy in Mexico,
the President would be a priest.

595
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:13,830
Don't exaggerate, Doctor or
Padre Pérez would end up as governor.

596
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:15,230
Good idea, my son.

597
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:20,990
And you, you were involved.
What do you think, Pek?

598
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:25,750
Well, the revolution brought
many changes.

599
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:29,670
But we didn't fight it
to suit a few politicians.

600
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:35,350
The worst thing is that the poorest
are still just as poor.

601
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:38,070
Yes, Pek. You're quite right.

602
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:43,190
Fortunately, we made the revolution
the basis for our institutions...

603
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:46,790
and the country's future has
never been brighter.

604
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:51,470
Please, Licenciado, what future
are you talking about?

605
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:54,830
The government is in the hands
of a bunch of crooks.

606
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:59,830
Your boss is the worst of all,
that puppy of the revolution!

607
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:05,550
You, yourself are a fine example of
the class of scalawags that govern us.

608
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:10,430
What have you done besides
extorting anyone you can?

609
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:14,470
Tell us, what have
you done for the good of San Pedro?

610
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:16,310
Doctor, let me serve
you another drink.

611
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:19,030
No, honey. Sit down.

612
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:27,670
Ladies, gentlemen,
this is why I have invited you here.

613
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:33,990
As you know, I went to the
capital a few days ago...

614
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:36,590
...to discuss the serious
problems of the village...

615
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:40,030
...with the Secretary
of the Governor.

616
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:45,510
I want to inform you that...

617
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:50,830
that modernity will at last
come to San Pedro de los Saguaros.

618
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:54,590
We'll make the promises of our President
Don Miguel Alemán come true.

619
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:02,830
And how are you
going to do this?

620
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:07,590
I have specific instructions
to start immediately...

621
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:13,670
by bringing electricity to San Pedro.

622
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:18,470
And here, straight from the US,
is the engineer Robert Smith.

623
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:25,950
And that's nothing.

624
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:27,710
Once these works are done...

625
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:32,550
President Alemán himself
will inaugurate them. Cheers!

626
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:38,990
How thrilling!
Why didn't you tell me before?

627
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:41,350
Sit down, honey. Cheers!

628
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:43,230
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

629
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:50,510
-Hey, dear.
-What?

630
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:52,830
Didn't you get a
bit carried away?

631
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:54,150
About what?

632
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:58,190
What you said about electricity
and the president.

633
00:52:58,270 --> 00:53:02,710
No, honey. It's all true.
I spoke to the governor's secretary.

634
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:13,470
Tell them to pull harder, Mr. Pek.

635
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:27,350
As you see, Doctor.
My party always delivers.

636
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:30,950
You should have closed
the brothel first.

637
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:33,950
All in good time. First things first.

638
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:39,270
And the first thing my friend
is progress, the future of our nation!

639
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:46,230
-There's your great work.
-Fucking Gringo idiot!

640
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:49,110
Sorry, Mr. Mayor.
It was these Indians.

641
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:51,870
This never happens
with American workers.

642
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:53,110
Go on! Help them!

643
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:54,750
Pull! Again! Pull!

644
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:28,670
Good morning, Doña Lupe.

645
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:33,350
Know what day it is today?

646
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:36,390
And where is Esmeralda?

647
00:54:37,910 --> 00:54:42,550
That fucking shameless dwarf.

648
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:45,670
How does he manage to be so brazen?

649
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:51,910
So, you don't have enough
money to pay taxes.

650
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:55,310
But what about this? Pay me.

651
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:01,390
-To you too, idiot!
-Let's go.

652
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:06,390
What? Listen who the hell
is going to pay me?

653
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:09,310
Show some respect, Doña Lupe.
One thing is one thing...

654
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:12,790
...but this is something else.
I'm here for your taxes.

655
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:15,870
How can I pay you, asshole?

656
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:18,870
Since you came to this village
I've lost all my clients.

657
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:21,390
Do what you want.
I have nothing to pay you with.

658
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:26,710
Well, look, Doña Lupe.
Maybe we can work something out.

659
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:29,310
I'm feeling very romantic.

660
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:34,430
-Alright, let's go.
-No, Doña Lupe.

661
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:39,950
What a son of a fucking bitch!

662
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:43,030
You've got no idea how
everyone has changed.

663
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:47,110
The only thing anyone talks
about is the President's visit.

664
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:49,430
What are they saying?

665
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:52,070
They're very excited
about the electricity.

666
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:55,910
Everyone speaks well of you, honey.

667
00:56:56,030 --> 00:56:59,910
They say you're the first mayor
who is going to make good his promises.

668
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:02,830
I'm excited too.

669
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:07,070
Juan, I'm preparing you a surprise...

670
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:09,590
...so that you make
a good impression on the President.

671
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:10,590
What is it?

672
00:57:10,670 --> 00:57:16,230
No, it's a surprise.
I'll show you when it's finished.

673
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:24,470
Oh,Juan if you keep on like this,
you won't just be a Congressman.

674
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:27,790
You'll be much more.

675
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:34,510
And I've also got
a present for you.

676
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:39,670
Couldn't you give it
to me tomorrow, honey?

677
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:44,510
I've had a very tiring day.

678
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:54,070
Hold on, hold on.

679
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:16,230
Look, Padre, not only is he corrupt.
He's lazy too.

680
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:18,710
I'm sure the whole
thing is a farce.

681
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:21,110
Pardon, Doctor? What are
you talking about?

682
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:23,870
I heard you're in business with
Doña Lupe.

683
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:29,630
You should know we're prepared
to take the necessary steps to sack you.

684
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:32,230
Excuse me, Doctor,
but the law authorizes me...

685
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:35,670
The law? The law you apply is a farce...

686
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:38,430
an excuse to steal money
from the people.

687
00:58:38,510 --> 00:58:41,470
Tell him.
Tell him what we found out.

688
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:45,110
I don't want to get involved
in your business...

689
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:49,110
but the Indians have complained
to Doctor Morales about you.

690
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:53,230
Excuse me Padre, but I simply
apply what it says here.

691
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:56,230
Do you think I go around
making up laws?

692
00:58:56,350 --> 00:58:59,510
Well, I've warned you.

693
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:03,790
Either things change
or you'll hear from me.

694
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,590
Nothing satisfies this guy.

695
00:59:09,710 --> 00:59:13,830
That is the way of the opposition's--
critical of everything.

696
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:16,630
I'm going to give you some advice.

697
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:22,310
Be careful and don't go waving
that pistol around.

698
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:23,790
Put it away!

699
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:26,950
I swear that he is
taking it the wrong way.

700
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:29,590
Don't swear in vain.

701
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:33,790
I can help you with Dr. Morales,
but you're going to have to help me.

702
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:36,150
Whatever you say, Padre.
I'd be very grateful.

703
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:41,150
I want to buy myself
a car, you know?

704
00:59:42,270 --> 00:59:47,470
-A car?
-Don't worry. I have savings.

705
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:51,310
I just want something modest...

706
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:56,150
an old Ford or a Packard like yours.

707
00:59:56,270 --> 00:59:58,470
It's a good car, right?

708
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:06,390
Here, Padre.

709
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:11,110
But son, this won't even
buy me a tire.

710
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:16,670
Well, here.

711
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:23,030
Those who repent
go to Heaven.

712
01:00:24,350 --> 01:00:27,230
Help me buy my car...

713
01:00:27,350 --> 01:00:31,310
...and you won't
have any problems.

714
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:34,150
God bless you, my son.

715
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:35,670
Good luck, Padre.

716
01:00:39,830 --> 01:00:41,590
Fucking priest!

717
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:46,990
-Good morning, Doña Lupe.
-What's good about it?

718
01:00:48,070 --> 01:00:51,270
Get my money ready while
I have a quickie with Perla.

719
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:54,230
This bullshit is over
you son of a bitch!

720
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:55,630
What's up, Doña Lupe?

721
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:58,350
You just won't understand, asshole.
Pancho! Pancho!

722
01:00:58,470 --> 01:00:59,590
Oh, shit.

723
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:03,030
This is the asshole
I told you about.

724
01:01:03,150 --> 01:01:05,990
-Hi, buddy.
-Show him who's in charge now.

725
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:11,990
Throw him to the pigs!

726
01:01:13,150 --> 01:01:15,910
-Doña Lupe, Doña Lupe!
-To the pigs with him!

727
01:01:19,790 --> 01:01:21,870
-What's happening, Doña Lupe?
-Squeal like a pig!

728
01:01:22,590 --> 01:01:24,390
I'm the representative
of the law.

729
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:26,670
My ass! Squeal like a pig!

730
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:40,510
Give him a good kicking!

731
01:02:05,310 --> 01:02:07,870
My love!
What happened to you?

732
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:10,270
I fell down back there.

733
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:14,630
-What?
-You smell like a pig.

734
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:17,590
Fuck you! What's that?

735
01:02:18,310 --> 01:02:20,550
Isn't it beautiful?
Bobby brought it.

736
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:26,390
Hey, wait. Today's Thursday and
you said I'd get an advance.

737
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:28,550
Don't bother me now, Gringo.

738
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:32,870
Leave him alone, Bobby.
Can't you see how he is? PoorJuan.

739
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:34,990
Well, to cheer you up...

740
01:02:35,110 --> 01:02:39,390
I'll show you the surprise
I'm making for the President.

741
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:41,030
Surprise!

742
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:48,990
Do you like it?

743
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:53,310
-It is very nice.
-Bobby helped me.

744
01:02:54,830 --> 01:02:56,870
I'm so pleased you like it, dear.

745
01:02:57,910 --> 01:03:00,910
Now I'll show you how
we dance in America.

746
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:53,790
I'm telling you these bitches
are fucking with me.

747
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:57,830
Don't go soft on them or
they'll do whatever they want.

748
01:03:57,910 --> 01:04:01,910
Stay in control is all I'm asking
you to do. You've seen--

749
01:04:10,870 --> 01:04:17,270
Vargas, you're not planning to
kill me too, are you? No, no.

750
01:04:17,350 --> 01:04:24,110
Please. Look, I'll give you
everything I've got. Look.

751
01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:25,990
I've got more money in the house.

752
01:04:26,110 --> 01:04:29,390
Put the gun down. You're too much
of an asshole with that gun.

753
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:30,470
Don't kill me!

754
01:04:30,590 --> 01:04:34,830
Shhh. I've got news
for you, Doña Lupe.

755
01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:37,870
Good news and bad news.

756
01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:41,750
The good news is that those
who repent go to Heaven.

757
01:04:42,910 --> 01:04:44,870
And the bad news?

758
01:04:45,910 --> 01:04:49,150
It's your turn to
face Herod's Law.

759
01:04:55,910 --> 01:04:59,230
There, you old witch!

760
01:04:59,350 --> 01:05:02,990
That's for disrespecting me...

761
01:05:03,110 --> 01:05:06,470
...and that's for not respecting
the nation's institutions...

762
01:05:06,590 --> 01:05:10,830
...and that's for your foul mouth.

763
01:05:46,870 --> 01:05:49,870
Juan,Juan, wake up!

764
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:02,750
What? What's the matter, honey?

765
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:05,990
I've been trying to awake you all day,
but I couldn't.

766
01:06:06,110 --> 01:06:07,190
Where were you last night?

767
01:06:07,310 --> 01:06:13,590
Well, I couldn't sleep and
I had some business to take care of.

768
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:16,390
Don't play dumb,Juan.
I know everything.

769
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:18,350
What do you know?

770
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:22,430
That you spend all day at the brothel
with Doña Lupe's whores...

771
01:06:22,550 --> 01:06:25,750
...and one day,
you'll catch a disease off them.

772
01:06:25,870 --> 01:06:27,270
Oh, my love! No way!

773
01:07:05,830 --> 01:07:10,150
Honorable Congress
of the Union...

774
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:15,150
fellow Congressmen,
citizens and patriots.

775
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:18,870
Thank you for this distinction
from my party.

776
01:07:22,390 --> 01:07:23,870
My party?

777
01:07:27,470 --> 01:07:28,870
My party!

778
01:07:38,870 --> 01:07:41,990
Gloria, Gloria. Have you
seen my ''PRI'' badge?

779
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:46,030
Maybe one of your
girlfriends has it.

780
01:07:54,030 --> 01:07:56,310
-Is a son of a bitch.
-No, no. Is an...

781
01:08:23,830 --> 01:08:25,830
My party, my party.

782
01:09:04,830 --> 01:09:05,790
My badge!

783
01:09:18,830 --> 01:09:21,750
What's this, Pek?

784
01:09:21,830 --> 01:09:25,030
Some locals brought them. I
was looking for you to tell you.

785
01:09:25,150 --> 01:09:27,950
But, but they're dead, Pek!
Where did they find them?

786
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:31,750
-In the deep creek.
-And what else? Tell me!

787
01:09:31,830 --> 01:09:35,830
They were found this morning by some
peasants who were taking their animals out.

788
01:09:35,950 --> 01:09:38,110
I think it was robbery Licenciado.

789
01:09:38,230 --> 01:09:40,110
They had nothing
of value on them.

790
01:09:40,870 --> 01:09:42,750
-That's very strange, Pek.
-Yes.

791
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:46,790
Go and take a statement
from the peasants.

792
01:09:46,910 --> 01:09:49,830
-See if they know anything else.
-Yes, Licenciado.

793
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:59,430
Fucking Doña Lupe!
Even in death you won't leave me alone.

794
01:10:56,350 --> 01:10:58,390
Rest in peace.

795
01:11:04,950 --> 01:11:06,510
Thank you for coming, Padre.

796
01:11:10,110 --> 01:11:12,390
Is this all the salvation
of a soul is worth to you?

797
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:17,310
But Doña Lupe left us nothing.
Even her shoes got stolen.

798
01:11:19,670 --> 01:11:21,230
Good-bye, Licenciado.

799
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:28,310
Don't worry, Padre.
I'll take care of it.

800
01:11:28,430 --> 01:11:32,190
Good-bye, daughters.
God bless you.

801
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:38,750
Girls, you know how sorry I am.

802
01:11:39,590 --> 01:11:42,550
Doña Lupe was like... like...

803
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:45,470
a sister to me.

804
01:11:45,590 --> 01:11:48,550
Always so happy, so kind.

805
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:53,470
But death comes when
we least expect it.

806
01:11:53,590 --> 01:11:56,550
Thanks for coming, Licenciado.

807
01:11:59,270 --> 01:12:01,750
And you know you can count
on me for anything.

808
01:12:03,550 --> 01:12:08,510
Hey, listen. When do we
reopen the business, girls?

809
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:26,510
See, Doña Lupe? Nobody knows
who they're working for.

810
01:12:31,150 --> 01:12:32,110
Afternoon.

811
01:12:36,550 --> 01:12:41,750
What's up, Licenciado? Heard anything
about the murder of Doña Lupe?

812
01:12:41,830 --> 01:12:46,190
We're on the case.
There are several suspects.

813
01:12:46,270 --> 01:12:49,470
Everything points to a crime of passion.

814
01:12:49,590 --> 01:12:52,110
Passion?
What about the robbery?

815
01:12:52,230 --> 01:12:56,470
That was a red herring.
But I didn't come to discuss that.

816
01:12:56,590 --> 01:12:57,830
I want you to do me a favor.

817
01:12:57,950 --> 01:13:00,990
But I've already paid
you for the month.

818
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:03,550
No, no. Nothing to do with that.

819
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:05,190
I'm here to make a business proposal.

820
01:13:06,910 --> 01:13:09,510
I've got to find a place
for Doña Lupe's girls...

821
01:13:09,590 --> 01:13:11,150
...and I thought we could
get together on this.

822
01:13:11,270 --> 01:13:15,590
No, Licenciado.
My business isn't prostitution.

823
01:13:15,710 --> 01:13:18,110
I guarantee you, we'll get loaded.
What do you say?

824
01:13:18,190 --> 01:13:19,990
No, Licenciado.

825
01:13:22,790 --> 01:13:24,230
Fine.

826
01:13:24,350 --> 01:13:25,750
Cheers.

827
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:34,430
Look! There's my boss.

828
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:36,390
He'll make it as governor, no?

829
01:13:36,510 --> 01:13:39,230
Well, it won't be easy for him.

830
01:13:39,310 --> 01:13:41,470
Terrazas is related to President Alemán.

831
01:13:41,590 --> 01:13:44,310
He's got the party base
behind him-- even the unions.

832
01:13:44,390 --> 01:13:47,310
My chief won't allow it.
He's a good bastard.

833
01:13:47,390 --> 01:13:51,550
If he wins,
I'll be in the big league. Cheers!

834
01:13:57,590 --> 01:14:01,030
Pek, Lady Luck is smiling on us.

835
01:14:01,110 --> 01:14:04,830
Someone did us a big favor
getting rid of Doña Lupe.

836
01:14:04,910 --> 01:14:10,550
And our boss is set to be governor now.
Nothing can stop us.

837
01:14:12,510 --> 01:14:16,470
Good afternoon, Doctor.
You must be pleased.

838
01:14:17,550 --> 01:14:21,510
You were the only person who
wanted Doña Lupe gone...

839
01:14:22,550 --> 01:14:25,990
...and now it's going to be real
hard for her to come back.

840
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:30,390
Are you insinuating I had
something to do with this crime?

841
01:14:30,510 --> 01:14:34,070
You were the only one who
had anything against her, right?

842
01:14:34,190 --> 01:14:37,710
That's a lie! You are a
shameless opportunist!

843
01:14:37,830 --> 01:14:39,430
Don't get excited, Doctor.

844
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:46,190
I'm sure you killed her.

845
01:14:47,190 --> 01:14:51,270
But you'll be sorry, Licenciado.

846
01:14:51,350 --> 01:14:52,950
That's it!

847
01:15:00,990 --> 01:15:04,230
Listen, Licenciado.
This isn't a good idea.

848
01:15:04,350 --> 01:15:06,270
Hardly anyone here can read.

849
01:15:06,390 --> 01:15:08,470
It doesn't matter, Pek.
It's got to work for something.

850
01:15:13,590 --> 01:15:17,510
-Doña Lupe. Fifty pesos.
-What?

851
01:15:17,630 --> 01:15:20,270
-He's asking what it says.
-Didn't I tell you?

852
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:22,510
Come.

853
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:30,430
Only you could suggest that
the Doctor was guilty!

854
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:33,790
The old bastard. They're going
to fire me thanks to him...

855
01:15:33,870 --> 01:15:36,430
...just when López is about
to be made governor.

856
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:40,310
Juan, we must do something.
Let him calm down.

857
01:15:42,030 --> 01:15:45,550
Then early tomorrow,
go and apologize.

858
01:15:45,670 --> 01:15:48,470
Humiliate yourself if you must
but calm him down.

859
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:52,110
Who knows what the bastard's
capable of?

860
01:15:52,950 --> 01:15:57,510
Make something up.
Tell him you've found a suspect.

861
01:16:32,550 --> 01:16:34,510
Hey, girl, is your boss in?

862
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:39,150
-Hello, Rosita.
-Hello.

863
01:16:39,270 --> 01:16:42,430
I'm sorry to be here so early
without warning...

864
01:16:42,550 --> 01:16:44,430
but I must speak with your husband.

865
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:49,510
Chencha! Go and fetch some firewood!
Stop hanging around!

866
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:56,350
Come in, Licenciado.
Come in, this is your house.

867
01:16:56,550 --> 01:16:57,510
Thank you.

868
01:16:59,550 --> 01:17:02,390
Please excuse my appearance, Licenciado.

869
01:17:02,510 --> 01:17:05,390
-Rosita, is your husband here?
-No. He isn't.

870
01:17:05,510 --> 01:17:07,390
Do you know where he went?

871
01:17:07,510 --> 01:17:12,470
He was very angry.
He couldn't sleep all night.

872
01:17:13,510 --> 01:17:16,470
He woke up very early
and went to the capital.

873
01:17:18,190 --> 01:17:21,590
He went to complain about you
to your bosses.

874
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:23,790
Rosita, this was all a mistake.

875
01:17:23,870 --> 01:17:26,150
I came to tell him
we've found a suspect and...

876
01:17:26,270 --> 01:17:28,350
- No! Really?
- I have to go Rosita.

877
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:35,110
No, no, Licenciado. Stay here.
I'll take your mind off it.

878
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:47,510
That's fine. You can go.

879
01:17:52,510 --> 01:17:54,230
Now, what's up?

880
01:17:54,990 --> 01:17:57,350
You must help me, Padre.

881
01:17:57,470 --> 01:18:00,430
I'm about to find myself out of a job
and you carless!

882
01:18:00,510 --> 01:18:02,910
-Why?
-Fucking Dr. Morales. We had a chat.

883
01:18:03,030 --> 01:18:05,630
Now he's gone to see
my bosses to tell them who knows what.

884
01:18:05,710 --> 01:18:08,830
We must stop
him or we're fucked!

885
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:11,470
Forgive him, Lord.

886
01:18:11,550 --> 01:18:13,950
Help me, Padre.
What are we going to do?

887
01:18:18,510 --> 01:18:20,470
J... K...

888
01:18:21,510 --> 01:18:23,390
L... M, M, M, M.

889
01:18:23,510 --> 01:18:28,470
M. Martinez...
Morales... Doctor.

890
01:18:29,510 --> 01:18:32,470
All the stuff about his wife,
but everyone knows that.

891
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:40,030
Ah, here it is. This will fix him,
but it's going to cost you.

892
01:18:40,110 --> 01:18:41,870
What is it, Padre?

893
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:52,630
You remember the girl
who works for them, right?

894
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:58,230
''Not once, but many times,
at nightfall Dr. Morales...

895
01:18:58,310 --> 01:19:03,590
violently entered my room
to abuse me sexually.''

896
01:19:03,670 --> 01:19:06,710
Write down her details and sign it.
The Gringo too. As witnesses.

897
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:10,230
Listen, Licenciado.
Isn't this a bit exaggerated?

898
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:12,470
It wasn't exactly what the girl said.

899
01:19:13,790 --> 01:19:14,870
Isn't it true, Chencha?

900
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:20,550
We cannot allow a degenerate
like him to go free.

901
01:19:20,670 --> 01:19:22,990
We must act decisively.

902
01:19:23,110 --> 01:19:27,430
Now I'm sure this Doctor is also involved
in the murder of Doña Lupe.

903
01:19:27,550 --> 01:19:28,790
My husband's right, Pek.

904
01:19:28,910 --> 01:19:33,350
We can't leave this poor child
with that old swine.

905
01:19:33,430 --> 01:19:38,750
I think Chencha should stay with us,Juan.
She can help me at home.

906
01:19:38,870 --> 01:19:44,470
No, no. I know who'll take care
of her better than anyone.

907
01:19:55,710 --> 01:20:00,430
I'm very sorry, Doctor, Licenciado López
won't be able to see you today.

908
01:20:00,550 --> 01:20:04,430
But I've been waiting all day.
I must speak to him.

909
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:06,550
I have something
very important to tell him.

910
01:20:06,630 --> 01:20:11,510
I'll tell him. But if you like come back
tomorrow and maybe he'll have time.

911
01:20:18,710 --> 01:20:20,350
Fucking PAN members!

912
01:20:24,670 --> 01:20:27,550
-What does that asshole want?
-The same as usual.

913
01:20:27,630 --> 01:20:29,630
He says Vargas of San Pedro
is embezzling...

914
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:34,150
and he's made a fortune
in that fucking village we sent him to.

915
01:20:36,710 --> 01:20:41,630
Why don't you go home?
I'll stay on guard here, Licenciado.

916
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:45,150
No, no. I'm not moving from here.

917
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:48,670
I don't know why, Ramírez,
but I think today's the day.

918
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:52,230
But, Licenciado, you haven't eaten
or slept for three days.

919
01:20:52,310 --> 01:20:54,070
I think--

920
01:21:03,870 --> 01:21:04,950
Yes?

921
01:21:06,390 --> 01:21:08,790
At your orders, General.

922
01:21:13,150 --> 01:21:16,190
Are you sure? But, General...

923
01:21:19,390 --> 01:21:24,310
Yes, yes. No, don't worry.
I'm a party man.

924
01:21:24,390 --> 01:21:26,350
I know the rules.

925
01:21:28,390 --> 01:21:30,350
Thank you for calling.

926
01:21:32,390 --> 01:21:34,790
Fucking shitty party!

927
01:21:36,390 --> 01:21:37,630
What's the matter, Licenciado?

928
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:41,150
Terrazas got the nomination
in the capital!

929
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:44,270
We're fucked!

930
01:21:44,390 --> 01:21:48,310
Do you think Dr. Morales would live
in a shitty place like this...

931
01:21:48,430 --> 01:21:51,310
if he wasn't in trouble?

932
01:21:51,430 --> 01:21:55,310
No. Do you really believe that stuff
about the girls?

933
01:21:55,430 --> 01:21:57,390
Six girls have denounced him.

934
01:21:58,430 --> 01:22:02,270
But he seemed so decent and educated.
I never thought--

935
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:04,990
That's the sort of hypocrites
these PAN members are!

936
01:22:05,110 --> 01:22:08,270
Forgive the intrusion, Licenciado...

937
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:10,470
...but we've caught a suspect.

938
01:22:18,910 --> 01:22:21,350
Confess, Filemón!

939
01:22:26,990 --> 01:22:30,270
I swear on my mother,
I didn't do anything, boss!

940
01:22:30,390 --> 01:22:33,550
Somebody put those shoes on me.
I swear!

941
01:22:33,670 --> 01:22:35,350
Don't write that, Pek.

942
01:22:37,390 --> 01:22:41,310
I think you need something
to help you remember.

943
01:22:41,390 --> 01:22:45,350
Go inside and see if you
can find a bottle, Pek.

944
01:22:52,430 --> 01:22:55,390
Confess and I'll pay you well,
Filemón.

945
01:22:58,430 --> 01:23:00,270
Confess, you bastard!

946
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:03,310
Yes, yes, yes! I did it!

947
01:23:04,350 --> 01:23:06,270
What happened, Licenciado?

948
01:23:06,350 --> 01:23:08,550
-Nothing, nothing.
-What's going on,Juan?

949
01:23:08,670 --> 01:23:13,310
Nothing, honey. Go back to bed.
Take this down: he confessed.

950
01:23:18,390 --> 01:23:22,350
On Thursday morning,
around seven o'clock...

951
01:23:25,390 --> 01:23:27,270
...Dr. Morales sent for him...

952
01:23:28,910 --> 01:23:32,470
...and offered him twenty pesos...

953
01:23:34,030 --> 01:23:37,350
...and a bottle to do a little job.

954
01:23:41,830 --> 01:23:47,510
Bastards! They want to send me
as Ambassador to Bolivia.

955
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:49,670
Me! The party's founder!

956
01:23:49,790 --> 01:23:53,630
That's how those little Licenciados
pay me back!

957
01:23:55,390 --> 01:24:00,310
They want to cut me out,
cut themselves in and not share the pie!

958
01:24:00,430 --> 01:24:04,230
But what do we do?
We're not just going to fold our arms.

959
01:24:04,350 --> 01:24:08,270
Of course not!
We'll form a new party, López.

960
01:24:08,350 --> 01:24:15,270
The Party of the Real Revolution.
You'll see how those assholes react.

961
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:19,550
I swear, in six years' time
I'll have their ass!

962
01:24:19,670 --> 01:24:21,870
I'll be President!

963
01:24:21,990 --> 01:24:26,350
Good, but that's a long time to wait.
What do we do now?

964
01:24:27,390 --> 01:24:29,630
Give them a scare, López.

965
01:24:29,750 --> 01:24:32,670
Deal with it the way we used to
in my day.

966
01:24:35,030 --> 01:24:40,270
Stop looking so sad, Filemón.
I know what's bothering you.

967
01:24:40,390 --> 01:24:42,350
Look what I brought.

968
01:24:44,390 --> 01:24:46,350
Oh, I didn't realize. Here.

969
01:24:54,390 --> 01:24:58,830
Boss, I swear by Holy God,
I didn't do anything.

970
01:24:58,950 --> 01:25:01,830
You know better than I do
where those shoes came from.

971
01:25:03,350 --> 01:25:06,750
I found your PRI badge there,
between the bodies.

972
01:25:06,830 --> 01:25:11,310
See? Let me go and I won't tell a soul.
I swear, boss.

973
01:25:12,350 --> 01:25:14,950
Look, I've got a pal in jail.

974
01:25:15,070 --> 01:25:18,910
I'll tell him you're my friend and
he'll make sure you're well looked after.

975
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:20,310
What do you say?

976
01:25:21,350 --> 01:25:22,310
Go ahead.

977
01:25:26,350 --> 01:25:29,350
Fucking Filemón,
you're really a good sort.

978
01:25:31,390 --> 01:25:34,350
I need a piss.
How about you?

979
01:25:44,390 --> 01:25:46,350
Okay, Filemón.

980
01:25:59,390 --> 01:26:02,310
I'm not going to
help you with that.

981
01:26:03,350 --> 01:26:04,790
There.

982
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:09,310
You're a good guy.

983
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:25,310
Fucking Filemón.
Look what you made me do.

984
01:26:46,110 --> 01:26:49,150
I'm telling you again, Sharkey.
Don't let me down.

985
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:54,510
When Terrazas gets out of the car,
you go up to him, Negro, and blast him!

986
01:26:54,630 --> 01:26:57,270
If they catch you,
say it was an accident.

987
01:26:57,390 --> 01:27:00,910
When I become governor you'll be
out of jail and stinking rich.

988
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:08,470
Sharkey...

989
01:27:13,830 --> 01:27:17,230
do you understand?
My future is in your hands.

990
01:27:17,350 --> 01:27:19,310
Let's get to work.

991
01:27:31,110 --> 01:27:32,870
Have you given it some
thought, Licenciado?

992
01:27:32,990 --> 01:27:37,310
With all due respect,
it's very risky...

993
01:27:38,350 --> 01:27:41,390
killing a candidate
in broad daylight.

994
01:27:41,510 --> 01:27:44,630
There's no other way, Ramírez.
The dice are rolling!

995
01:27:49,350 --> 01:27:53,350
Not that one, fucker.
Play the same one.

996
01:27:55,390 --> 01:27:57,350
Fucking Filemón!

997
01:28:05,310 --> 01:28:07,310
Look, Perlita.

998
01:28:08,350 --> 01:28:13,230
It's like when you have
an asshole client and...

999
01:28:13,350 --> 01:28:18,310
...he asks you for a screwball.
Would you do it?

1000
01:28:21,350 --> 01:28:23,310
Do you know what
a screwball is?

1001
01:28:28,350 --> 01:28:31,790
Sometimes you have to do
things you don't like.

1002
01:28:31,910 --> 01:28:34,670
That's Herod's fucking Law.

1003
01:28:36,350 --> 01:28:40,910
And the girls?
Girls? Girls!

1004
01:28:53,390 --> 01:28:55,350
How is Chenchita doing?

1005
01:28:58,390 --> 01:29:00,270
Did you think about it, girls?

1006
01:29:00,390 --> 01:29:03,830
Five percent of what you
earn is yours to keep!

1007
01:29:03,910 --> 01:29:05,270
Great business!

1008
01:29:06,310 --> 01:29:08,270
We're not sure, Licenciado.

1009
01:29:09,310 --> 01:29:15,230
Looks, my dears, you can't run
this business by yourselves.

1010
01:29:15,310 --> 01:29:20,310
I'll be your man,
once my boss is governor.

1011
01:29:23,350 --> 01:29:27,310
Fucking Filemón!
I already miss you, you bastard.

1012
01:29:53,350 --> 01:29:55,430
Play it again, Negro!

1013
01:29:56,390 --> 01:29:57,830
Negro!

1014
01:29:59,390 --> 01:30:00,350
Girls!

1015
01:30:03,390 --> 01:30:04,350
Girls!

1016
01:30:11,390 --> 01:30:12,270
Girls!

1017
01:30:26,390 --> 01:30:29,310
Licenciado, you're a day early.

1018
01:30:29,390 --> 01:30:31,310
How did it go?

1019
01:30:31,390 --> 01:30:34,310
Fine, Pek.
What about the Doctor?

1020
01:30:34,390 --> 01:30:38,630
He hasn't come back yet, but
there are more accusations against him.

1021
01:30:38,750 --> 01:30:39,830
Do you want to read them?

1022
01:30:39,950 --> 01:30:42,390
Another day.
I'm not in the mood right now.

1023
01:31:15,390 --> 01:31:17,030
Motherfuckers!

1024
01:31:21,390 --> 01:31:24,350
No, no, my love.
This isn't what it seems.

1025
01:31:31,390 --> 01:31:33,910
Don't speak English to me, you bastard!

1026
01:31:34,030 --> 01:31:37,350
This is the end
of the external debt, Gringo!

1027
01:31:43,430 --> 01:31:45,630
Go, Bobby!
Run before he comes round.

1028
01:32:15,030 --> 01:32:18,030
I want to explain to you, my love.

1029
01:32:19,030 --> 01:32:22,030
It's not what you think.

1030
01:32:24,070 --> 01:32:27,030
The Gringo forced me
because of what you owed him.

1031
01:32:28,070 --> 01:32:30,030
It was horrible, my love.

1032
01:32:31,070 --> 01:32:32,950
He insisted that I pay him.

1033
01:32:33,070 --> 01:32:38,710
I said we had no money and
he got really violent with me.

1034
01:32:38,790 --> 01:32:42,950
He tore my dress off.
It was horrible, my love.

1035
01:32:43,070 --> 01:32:46,630
Poor little thing. I understand, baby.

1036
01:32:48,190 --> 01:32:52,070
These fucking Gringos
are sons of bitches...

1037
01:32:52,190 --> 01:32:54,990
but you... you are...

1038
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:56,990
you are a fucking bitch!

1039
01:32:57,070 --> 01:32:59,070
Slut!

1040
01:33:00,070 --> 01:33:01,070
Whore!

1041
01:33:03,950 --> 01:33:05,270
Stop it!

1042
01:33:05,350 --> 01:33:10,110
Come here, you bitch!
Now you'll see!

1043
01:33:10,230 --> 01:33:11,110
Juan.

1044
01:33:13,230 --> 01:33:14,510
Juan!

1045
01:33:15,030 --> 01:33:18,470
I'm checking to see if that
fucking Gringo robbed me.

1046
01:33:18,590 --> 01:33:21,910
Please forgive me,Juan.

1047
01:33:22,030 --> 01:33:25,150
You went with the hookers
in the brothel...

1048
01:33:25,230 --> 01:33:27,750
and I never said a word.

1049
01:33:27,830 --> 01:33:30,230
You can't keep me
tied up here like a dog.

1050
01:33:30,350 --> 01:33:34,550
Don't mention those treacherous sluts,
and don't mention dogs.

1051
01:33:34,670 --> 01:33:36,710
They're faithful.

1052
01:33:37,910 --> 01:33:41,030
Licenciado, Licenciado.

1053
01:33:41,070 --> 01:33:43,950
Things are getting out of hand.

1054
01:33:44,070 --> 01:33:47,590
Calm down, Pek. What's up?

1055
01:33:47,710 --> 01:33:52,030
Dr. Morales is back
and the locals want to lynch him.

1056
01:33:58,830 --> 01:33:59,790
Licenciado.

1057
01:34:00,630 --> 01:34:02,030
Yes, my old friend.

1058
01:34:02,150 --> 01:34:06,470
Juan!Juan!Juan!

1059
01:34:13,390 --> 01:34:16,110
Speak to them, Pek.
Tell them to go home.

1060
01:34:16,230 --> 01:34:18,350
I'll take care of it.

1061
01:34:34,430 --> 01:34:36,310
Open the door, Doctor!

1062
01:34:38,950 --> 01:34:43,870
- Licenciado Vargas, have they gone?
- Yes, they've gone. Step aside.

1063
01:34:46,190 --> 01:34:48,590
Doctor, for your own sake,
I advise you to leave town.

1064
01:34:50,190 --> 01:34:51,870
But why?

1065
01:34:51,950 --> 01:34:56,150
It's been discovered that you were
the intellectual assassin of Doña Lupe.

1066
01:34:56,230 --> 01:34:58,950
We have proof
and a signed confession.

1067
01:34:59,070 --> 01:35:03,030
But it's a lie!
Who would dare to accuse me?

1068
01:35:03,150 --> 01:35:08,350
You're also accused of
corrupting minors and of rape.

1069
01:35:08,430 --> 01:35:10,590
Your servant told us everything.

1070
01:35:10,670 --> 01:35:12,870
But, my little girl.
It can't be.

1071
01:35:12,990 --> 01:35:14,430
Chencha?

1072
01:35:14,510 --> 01:35:17,030
Doctor, you'd get at least
40 years for this.

1073
01:35:17,150 --> 01:35:18,750
But to show you how generous I am...

1074
01:35:18,870 --> 01:35:23,590
I'll give you till dawn to leave town,
or I'll wash my hands.

1075
01:35:50,190 --> 01:35:51,470
Let's continue.

1076
01:35:55,190 --> 01:35:59,590
In every trial the criminal order will--
That's useless too.

1077
01:36:03,150 --> 01:36:08,110
Write this down, Pek:
Article number whatever.

1078
01:36:10,630 --> 01:36:16,870
Given that recent events have severely
affected the revenue of the municipality...

1079
01:36:16,990 --> 01:36:22,910
it is decreed that as of today, the 9th
of October 1 949, without exception...

1080
01:36:22,990 --> 01:36:25,270
all the inhabitants of
San Pedro de los Saguaros...

1081
01:36:25,350 --> 01:36:28,590
must pay an extra tax
on their lands...

1082
01:36:28,710 --> 01:36:34,350
...cows, pigs, donkeys, hens, turkeys
and all other animals...

1083
01:36:34,470 --> 01:36:37,070
...known or yet to be discovered.

1084
01:36:37,190 --> 01:36:41,230
My God, Licenciado,
everyone's already very poor.

1085
01:36:41,350 --> 01:36:43,310
It isn't right to be so hard on them.

1086
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:46,750
Don't exaggerate, Pek.
It's for the community's good.

1087
01:36:46,830 --> 01:36:50,670
Once I'm governor and you mayor
of a village, do whatever you want.

1088
01:36:50,790 --> 01:36:53,630
Don't distract me
or I'll lose my inspiration.

1089
01:36:53,710 --> 01:36:58,110
Let's continue.
As of today, the term of office...

1090
01:36:58,190 --> 01:37:03,870
...for local mayors shall be
extended from six to twelve...

1091
01:37:03,950 --> 01:37:06,750
...no, to twenty years...

1092
01:37:08,150 --> 01:37:11,030
...with four possibilities
of reelection.

1093
01:37:11,990 --> 01:37:13,470
You never know.

1094
01:37:17,670 --> 01:37:19,110
Two hens.

1095
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:33,110
What did he say? What?

1096
01:37:34,150 --> 01:37:40,110
He has nothing left.
He can pay you after the harvest.

1097
01:37:41,190 --> 01:37:43,750
No. Tell him I'm sorry, Pek...

1098
01:37:43,870 --> 01:37:48,110
but we won't detain the progress
of the majority for a minority.

1099
01:37:48,190 --> 01:37:49,590
Lock him up. Next.

1100
01:37:54,190 --> 01:37:59,630
Look, Licenciado Vargas,
fire me if you want...

1101
01:37:59,750 --> 01:38:03,030
...but I can't be an accomplice
to all this bullshit.

1102
01:38:03,110 --> 01:38:06,910
You're the worst mayor
we've ever had.

1103
01:38:14,150 --> 01:38:19,750
What was that, Pek? Don't show me
disrespect in front of people.

1104
01:38:19,830 --> 01:38:23,710
- Sorry, Licenciado.
- Fuck you and your apologies!

1105
01:38:23,830 --> 01:38:28,310
We're going to have this out inside!
And you wait here.

1106
01:38:28,430 --> 01:38:31,110
Fucking fucked up village!

1107
01:38:38,150 --> 01:38:41,310
And to think I was going
to make you mayor, asshole.

1108
01:38:41,430 --> 01:38:43,070
Open up.

1109
01:38:53,190 --> 01:38:58,150
In you go,
you subversive old bastard!

1110
01:39:02,110 --> 01:39:04,070
Fucking moaning Indians!

1111
01:39:07,110 --> 01:39:10,590
You're just holding back
social progress, idiots!

1112
01:39:15,110 --> 01:39:17,030
It's your own fault.

1113
01:39:17,150 --> 01:39:20,030
I just wasn't making enough,
Licenciado.

1114
01:39:20,150 --> 01:39:23,030
I offered you a deal
and you turned it down.

1115
01:39:23,150 --> 01:39:26,030
Get the money
and you can reopen.

1116
01:39:26,150 --> 01:39:29,030
See what happens when you
only think about politics?

1117
01:39:29,150 --> 01:39:31,270
You didn't take care
of your business.

1118
01:39:32,150 --> 01:39:36,110
Looks like the bullets
are flying again.

1119
01:39:39,150 --> 01:39:44,070
Fuck it! Why didn't you tell me
my boss didn't get nominated?

1120
01:39:44,150 --> 01:39:46,790
He might still manage it
if the candidate dies.

1121
01:39:46,910 --> 01:39:50,670
I bet it was López
who ordered him killed.

1122
01:39:50,750 --> 01:39:55,070
You're mad, you bastard!
Those things don't happen in my party.

1123
01:39:55,150 --> 01:39:59,630
Who knows? Anything's
possible in politics, Licenciado.

1124
01:39:59,750 --> 01:40:02,070
Be careful.

1125
01:40:02,190 --> 01:40:04,070
See you.

1126
01:40:04,190 --> 01:40:06,150
Good luck, brother.

1127
01:40:11,190 --> 01:40:16,350
''At the scene of the murder attempt,
the police assist Terrazas...

1128
01:40:16,470 --> 01:40:19,150
who is taken to the emergency clinic.''

1129
01:40:20,190 --> 01:40:23,430
My boss? No way!

1130
01:40:24,190 --> 01:40:26,150
Remember the words
of our Lord.

1131
01:40:27,190 --> 01:40:30,190
You should forgive
your wife.

1132
01:40:31,190 --> 01:40:34,590
Forgiveness is the only thing
that brings the soul peace.

1133
01:40:34,710 --> 01:40:37,750
Shut up! What do you
know about women?

1134
01:40:37,870 --> 01:40:39,630
They're all the same bitches!

1135
01:40:39,750 --> 01:40:45,190
Leave her chained up if you want,
but forgive her.

1136
01:40:55,110 --> 01:40:58,110
Have you heard three more
families left town?

1137
01:40:58,230 --> 01:41:00,150
Yes, yes.
Don't worry about it.

1138
01:41:00,230 --> 01:41:03,150
How can I not worry?
You're acting like a monster.

1139
01:41:04,190 --> 01:41:06,750
Not really, Padre. Don't be a fool...

1140
01:41:06,870 --> 01:41:09,350
You've never had it so good.

1141
01:41:09,470 --> 01:41:15,870
But keep worrying,
because if anything happens to me...

1142
01:41:15,990 --> 01:41:18,310
you're in deep trouble.

1143
01:41:18,430 --> 01:41:23,790
Anyway, I repented
so I can go to Heaven.

1144
01:41:23,910 --> 01:41:26,070
See you, Padre.

1145
01:41:34,550 --> 01:41:36,110
Juan...

1146
01:41:39,190 --> 01:41:42,190
...you can't keep
me like this forever.

1147
01:41:45,230 --> 01:41:47,190
You're right, honey.

1148
01:42:04,150 --> 01:42:06,150
Fix me some dinner.

1149
01:42:22,190 --> 01:42:26,150
Look, look. All this
could have been yours.

1150
01:42:45,190 --> 01:42:47,190
Now what's the matter?

1151
01:42:50,230 --> 01:42:52,190
You want to poison me,
don't you?

1152
01:42:55,230 --> 01:42:58,110
No, no. You're going insane,
you bastard!

1153
01:42:58,230 --> 01:43:02,110
Shut up! Show me
some respect, bitch!

1154
01:43:15,150 --> 01:43:18,150
Be very careful not to
do anything stupid!

1155
01:43:33,550 --> 01:43:35,150
Oh, fuck it!

1156
01:43:36,190 --> 01:43:39,150
Stop! Stop, I tell you!

1157
01:43:42,190 --> 01:43:44,110
I didn't do anything.

1158
01:43:44,190 --> 01:43:46,270
What's the matter
with you Vargas, eh?

1159
01:43:46,350 --> 01:43:48,150
Oh, Sharkey, my friend.

1160
01:43:51,190 --> 01:43:55,150
Licenciado López wants a word.
Hurry up. Come on, move it!

1161
01:43:57,550 --> 01:43:58,950
- Move it!
- The animals.

1162
01:43:59,030 --> 01:44:05,030
Yes, Licenciado López. I think
Mr. Vargas is sick in the head.

1163
01:44:05,150 --> 01:44:08,110
He treats all the
locals very badly.

1164
01:44:09,150 --> 01:44:11,630
Here he is, boss. He tried
to run as soon as he saw me.

1165
01:44:11,710 --> 01:44:16,190
Licenciado! To what do I owe
this honor? What a pleasure!

1166
01:44:16,310 --> 01:44:18,750
What the hell happened here, Vargas?

1167
01:44:18,870 --> 01:44:22,670
This man has been telling me
about all the crap you've been up to.

1168
01:44:22,790 --> 01:44:25,990
What have you told him, Pek?
About the Doctor? Doña Lupe?

1169
01:44:26,110 --> 01:44:29,990
Don't play dumb, Vargas!
Look how you got this place.

1170
01:44:32,070 --> 01:44:34,190
This Doctor came to see me
in the capital...

1171
01:44:34,270 --> 01:44:37,230
and said you were
up to all sorts of business...

1172
01:44:37,310 --> 01:44:40,870
in the name of the mayor's office.

1173
01:44:42,870 --> 01:44:43,870
Tell me the truth, asshole!

1174
01:44:44,950 --> 01:44:47,830
Licenciado, it's time to go.

1175
01:44:47,910 --> 01:44:52,270
Easy, Sharkey. Calm down.
We have time.

1176
01:44:52,350 --> 01:44:55,870
I want to hear
what little Vargas has to say. Well?

1177
01:44:55,990 --> 01:44:59,230
In fact, Licenciado...
where do I begin?

1178
01:45:01,190 --> 01:45:06,310
I came to San Pedro
determined to fulfill...

1179
01:45:06,430 --> 01:45:10,910
...the pledges and orders
of our President...

1180
01:45:11,030 --> 01:45:12,510
modernity and social justice.

1181
01:45:12,630 --> 01:45:16,710
But I felt really bad,
I was completely fucked up.

1182
01:45:16,830 --> 01:45:20,710
Nobody speaks Spanish,
so Mr. Pek here had to translate for me.

1183
01:45:20,790 --> 01:45:23,510
There was this priest and a woman
involved in various businesses...

1184
01:45:23,630 --> 01:45:25,110
...which didn't pay taxes.

1185
01:45:37,710 --> 01:45:42,390
So I realized the laws didn't
do the job...

1186
01:45:42,510 --> 01:45:44,750
and I changed them.

1187
01:45:46,910 --> 01:45:52,470
I can't believe it, Vargas.
You really changed the Constitution?

1188
01:46:03,150 --> 01:46:06,070
You're such a smart one.

1189
01:46:06,190 --> 01:46:09,030
''If the will of the people demands it...

1190
01:46:09,150 --> 01:46:15,110
the term of office may last
up to twenty years...

1191
01:46:15,470 --> 01:46:19,030
with up to four possibilities
of reelection.''

1192
01:46:19,150 --> 01:46:24,790
Fuck. Not even Porfirio Diaz
could have pulled this one off.

1193
01:46:26,910 --> 01:46:30,950
And I thought you couldn't make
any money out of this fucking village.

1194
01:46:31,070 --> 01:46:32,550
So, how much is there left?

1195
01:46:38,190 --> 01:46:40,070
All of it!

1196
01:46:40,190 --> 01:46:42,350
That's almost all, Licenciado.

1197
01:46:42,430 --> 01:46:46,390
From what you said you made
a hundred times more than this.

1198
01:46:46,510 --> 01:46:49,150
Don't fuck with me, idiot!
Where is it?

1199
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:51,430
It's not here, Licenciado.

1200
01:46:51,550 --> 01:46:55,150
Oh, the money's in the bank
of San Pedro, right, asshole?

1201
01:46:55,270 --> 01:46:59,150
-Where the hell is it?
-It's inside... in the house.

1202
01:47:00,190 --> 01:47:03,670
Go and get it. Sharkey.
Keep an eye on him.

1203
01:47:06,150 --> 01:47:09,270
Gloria! Gloria!

1204
01:47:17,150 --> 01:47:18,110
Gloria!

1205
01:47:39,150 --> 01:47:44,750
''I went to the States with Bobby.
We'll meet in...

1206
01:47:48,670 --> 01:47:50,150
in Hell.''

1207
01:47:50,270 --> 01:47:52,670
That fucking whore!

1208
01:47:52,790 --> 01:47:54,150
What's the matter, Vargas?

1209
01:47:59,190 --> 01:48:01,150
Don't you think she's a whore?

1210
01:48:33,150 --> 01:48:35,230
Well, Pek. Found anything?

1211
01:48:35,350 --> 01:48:37,470
-No, Licenciado.
-Keep looking, asshole!

1212
01:48:37,590 --> 01:48:39,350
I just don't know
where he hid it.

1213
01:48:45,150 --> 01:48:48,430
Well, Vargas?
What have you got for me?

1214
01:48:48,550 --> 01:48:49,630
They took it all.

1215
01:48:49,750 --> 01:48:52,510
What?
Do you take me for an asshole?

1216
01:48:52,590 --> 01:48:54,550
It's true, Licenciado.

1217
01:48:56,030 --> 01:48:58,710
They took it all,
left me without a cent. Look.

1218
01:49:03,390 --> 01:49:04,550
What's the matter?

1219
01:49:04,670 --> 01:49:07,070
I had a fortune...

1220
01:49:07,190 --> 01:49:11,310
and a fucking Gringo and
my hooker wife left me without a cent.

1221
01:49:13,030 --> 01:49:13,990
Look you--

1222
01:49:19,190 --> 01:49:22,390
Careful, Vargas, careful!

1223
01:49:24,270 --> 01:49:26,430
We're being followed
and they'll be here soon.

1224
01:49:29,910 --> 01:49:30,910
Sharkey!

1225
01:49:31,990 --> 01:49:33,470
There isn't any Sharkey now.

1226
01:49:33,590 --> 01:49:35,470
Careful, Vargas,
better put that away.

1227
01:49:44,590 --> 01:49:47,870
Fucking Vargas,
you fucking clown.

1228
01:49:47,950 --> 01:49:51,710
Sorry, Licenciado.
but it is you or me.

1229
01:49:51,830 --> 01:49:54,190
I was doing fine till you
started harassing me...

1230
01:49:54,310 --> 01:49:58,150
saying you were the law,
the only authority, Herod's Law.

1231
01:50:03,710 --> 01:50:06,270
By your holy wife.

1232
01:50:06,390 --> 01:50:10,310
Go ahead and make fun of me,
bastard. Laugh.

1233
01:50:32,070 --> 01:50:34,150
Herod's Law.

1234
01:50:55,710 --> 01:50:57,550
It's all bullshit.

1235
01:50:58,590 --> 01:51:00,510
Women...

1236
01:51:00,590 --> 01:51:03,710
...all whores.

1237
01:51:03,790 --> 01:51:07,950
Cows all mad.

1238
01:51:08,070 --> 01:51:14,510
Gringos all sons of bitches
who want everything.

1239
01:51:15,550 --> 01:51:19,470
You and your good advice,
look at your advice now.

1240
01:51:19,550 --> 01:51:23,470
This country has no solution.
No solution, Licenciado.

1241
01:51:23,550 --> 01:51:28,510
Or does it? Does it?
Answer me, idiot! Answer!

1242
01:51:31,550 --> 01:51:35,510
Fucking moaning Indians,
you'll see now!

1243
01:51:37,070 --> 01:51:38,550
Out of the way!

1244
01:51:40,030 --> 01:51:45,110
What's going on?
Fucking Indians!

1245
01:51:48,030 --> 01:51:49,550
Delinquents!

1246
01:51:50,590 --> 01:51:53,470
This village is mine!

1247
01:51:53,590 --> 01:51:57,310
Transgressors of the law
and institutions!

1248
01:51:58,830 --> 01:52:00,470
Everything I do is for your sake.

1249
01:52:00,590 --> 01:52:04,510
You're poor because you want
to be poor, assholes!

1250
01:52:08,950 --> 01:52:10,390
Friends!

1251
01:52:17,430 --> 01:52:19,830
Juan Vargas.

1252
01:52:19,910 --> 01:52:20,830
Fellow citizens...

1253
01:52:24,190 --> 01:52:26,470
it wasn't me.

1254
01:52:31,590 --> 01:52:32,670
Juan Vargas.

1255
01:52:35,230 --> 01:52:36,950
It wasn't me.

1256
01:52:47,150 --> 01:52:51,150
I'm sorry! Forgive me, friends!

1257
01:52:51,270 --> 01:52:54,390
I did it all for your own good!

1258
01:52:57,590 --> 01:53:02,470
No! I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything.

1259
01:53:06,910 --> 01:53:12,230
You down there, help!

1260
01:53:16,550 --> 01:53:17,510
Where's López?

1261
01:53:17,630 --> 01:53:23,510
I didn't kill him!
Help! Help!

1262
01:53:42,190 --> 01:53:45,710
Excuse me, how far is it to
San Pedro de los Saguaros?

1263
01:54:26,550 --> 01:54:30,310
Good afternoon.
Do you speak Spanish?

1264
01:54:30,390 --> 01:54:32,670
-Yes.
-I think we're lost.

1265
01:54:32,790 --> 01:54:35,590
Do you know how far it is to
San Pedro de los Saguaros?

1266
01:54:35,670 --> 01:54:40,750
This is it.
You must be the new mayor.

1267
01:54:40,870 --> 01:54:42,550
I've been waiting for you
since yesterday.

1268
01:54:43,230 --> 01:54:46,510
I'm Carlos Pek, your secretary.

1269
01:54:47,550 --> 01:54:50,110
Pleased to meet you...
Jesus Canales.

1270
01:54:50,230 --> 01:54:56,110
President Alemán and Governor Terrazas
have sent me...

1271
01:54:56,190 --> 01:55:02,110
to bring modernity and social justice.
We're here.

1272
01:55:07,430 --> 01:55:08,750
Welcome, Madam.

1273
01:55:12,510 --> 01:55:14,470
Here?

1274
01:55:15,350 --> 01:55:18,310
Hey, Pek, a question.

1275
01:55:18,390 --> 01:55:21,430
What happened to the last mayor?

1276
01:55:21,510 --> 01:55:24,310
I mean, you know,
they say so many things.

1277
01:55:24,390 --> 01:55:27,510
Oh, Licenciado,
I wouldn't know where to begin.

1278
01:55:29,550 --> 01:55:33,710
And so ends the fourth report
of President Miguel Alemán...

1279
01:55:33,790 --> 01:55:36,670
...reaffirming that the unity and
solidarity of the people of Mexico...

1280
01:55:36,790 --> 01:55:40,430
will triumph over any challenge...

1281
01:55:40,550 --> 01:55:41,190
that peace and social justice
are guaranteed, that the--

1282
01:55:45,550 --> 01:55:48,470
Hey, we've got problems
with Chino's truck again.

1283
01:55:48,550 --> 01:55:51,630
Call me Licenciado, asshole.

1284
01:55:51,750 --> 01:55:53,510
I'll finish and I'll be right there.

1285
01:55:58,550 --> 01:56:01,550
Honorable Congress
of the Union:

1286
01:56:03,070 --> 01:56:06,990
It is an honor for me to be
here at this seat of democracy...

1287
01:56:07,070 --> 01:56:09,950
...representing my home state.

1288
01:56:10,030 --> 01:56:14,430
Today, more than ever,
we Congressmen must fulfill...

1289
01:56:14,510 --> 01:56:18,430
...the expectations of
our nation.

1290
01:56:18,510 --> 01:56:22,430
We must be alert and
fight without quarter...

1291
01:56:22,510 --> 01:56:24,430
...against the revolution's
enemies.

1292
01:56:24,510 --> 01:56:28,430
Yes!Just as I did, when
I thwarted the conspiracy...

1293
01:56:28,510 --> 01:56:33,110
of Licenciado López, the ambitious
Secretary of the Governor...

1294
01:56:33,190 --> 01:56:37,430
along with a handful of evil people
to murder that great man...

1295
01:56:37,550 --> 01:56:40,430
...the recently elected
Governor Terrazas.

1296
01:56:40,550 --> 01:56:41,510
Friends...

1297
01:56:43,310 --> 01:56:48,630
...I am not ashamed to admit
that I have come to this Congress...

1298
01:56:48,750 --> 01:56:53,030
with bloodstained hands.
I don't deny it.

1299
01:56:53,150 --> 01:56:56,510
To ask for pardon would
be hypocritical.

1300
01:56:57,550 --> 01:57:02,390
But this is not the blood of a stranger
or of a brother.

1301
01:57:03,150 --> 01:57:05,390
It is the blood of an enemy...

1302
01:57:05,510 --> 01:57:09,390
an enemy of those who defend
the ideals of the revolution!

1303
01:57:10,310 --> 01:57:12,390
We have overcome
another obstacle...

1304
01:57:12,510 --> 01:57:15,390
but many more remain
because our party's challenge...

1305
01:57:15,510 --> 01:57:18,630
for the good of the Nation...

1306
01:57:18,750 --> 01:57:23,470
is to remain in power forever and ever!

1307
01:57:26,270 --> 01:57:28,470
Thank you my fellow countrymen.

1308
01:57:33,470 --> 01:57:38,470
