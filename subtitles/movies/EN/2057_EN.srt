00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:05,662
In 1978, during the miIitary
dictatorship in Argentina,

2
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:08,672
eight reels of the originaI negatives
from lnvasión, shot in 1969,

3
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:11,402
were stolen from Alex Laboratories
in Buenos Aires.

4
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:14,308
After twenty one years of bIockade,
the effort and kindness

5
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:17,075
of Pierre-André Boutang and
other friends, in France and Argentina,

6
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:22,120
aIlowed composing a new complete
negative print of the fiIm.

7
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:25,691
The sources for this print were
four originaI negative reels,

8
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:27,884
and eight internegative reels,

9
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:33,762
obtained from the combination
of two oId 35 mm positive prints.

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,631
This is a first restoration, achieved
in 1999 thanks to the technicians

11
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,432
at L.T.C. Laboratory,

12
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:45,101
to those at Desmarquest Studios
for the treatment of the sound mix,

13
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:49,477
to Ricardo Aronovich,
originaI director of photography,

14
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:52,983
and to Hubert Niogret,
who was in charge of the production.

15
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,451
To them alI, our gratitude.
The authors.

16
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:06,658
(Southern Frontier

17
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:22,904
I`Il let them know at the café
where to deIiver the shipment.

18
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:50,979
invasion

19
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,364
It Iooks Iike we`lI win
the championship on Sunday.

20
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:47,370
It`lI depend on the referees,
as usuaI.

21
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:50,101
Come on.
Our forwards wiIl crush them.

22
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:55,704
This is the team to pick.
Bramante knows his stuff.

23
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:57,941
Right. Here`s a picture of him.

24
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,018
What a sight for sore eyes!

25
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:04,416
I wonder why my Iumbago
is so fond of me.

26
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:09,217
Don Porfirio, you oId-timer,
what`s your prediction for Sunday?

27
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,453
I don`t know. Whatever you want.

28
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,589
Here`s your maté. Some sugar?

29
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,634
It Iooks Iike you need it.

30
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:21,138
Don`t bother, Don Jesús.
I`m used to bitterness by now.

31
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:25,036
Come on, you`ve got no faith.

32
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:27,169
Thank God in soccer we`re number one.

33
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:32,081
WelI, that`s something.
I hope you`re right.

34
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,080
That goes without saying!

35
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:53,100
You`Il have to excuse me,
I`m in a bit of a hurry.

36
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,804
WencesIao N.,
you`Il have to excuse me.

37
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,167
I`m in a bit of a hurry.

38
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:05,867
...alI these years getting ready.
Now they`re on the move.

39
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,476
-Today`s the day.
-Good.

40
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:11,708
One gets sick of waiting.
I`Il be right over.

41
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,418
Anything wrong?

42
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:41,075
Don`t take my absences
so seriously, <i>señora</i>.

43
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:47,042
I`Il telI you a secret.
I like to pIay the game of mysteries.

44
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,983
Yes. l already know it`s a game.

45
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:56,989
You`Il see, l won`t be long.

46
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,123
HeIlo.

47
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:10,016
Don`t worry, Don Porfirio,
I`Il be there.

48
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:28,766
If my wife caIls,
I`m out giving a shot.

49
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,105
An advance group wilI be
sent out into the city.

50
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:52,376
They`lI receive orders
in this café by the docks.

51
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:53,746
Want me to stop them?

52
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:58,048
Not there.
Don`t show up at the café.

53
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:01,182
Go straight to the freight yard.

54
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:08,730
There, the advance group meets
the waiting truck.

55
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:11,894
But you`Il be there before them.

56
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,261
Not aIone, understand?

57
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:19,905
Take Irala and SiIva.
Vildrac wilI be along too.

58
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,848
I`ve phoned him at the drugstore.

59
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:40,591
Destroy the truck. That`s alI.
No chase, no fight, nothing.

60
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,257
Don`t worry about a thing.

61
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,799
Lebendiger...

62
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,634
Herrera, is aIl this cIear?

63
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,976
Wait at the freight yard.
Don`t go to the café.

64
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:05,413
Weren`t we toId to go
to the northern freight car yard?

65
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:06,581
Yes.

66
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,386
Then what are we doing here?

67
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,428
I wonder if they are
as tough as they say.

68
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:14,857
Why worry? We`lI send them running!

69
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:22,301
Pretty sIeepy, Dr Silva.
Why don`t you get some rest?

70
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,102
Nothing wiIl happen here.

71
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,838
Anyway, Irala is a tiger.
He`Il take care of me.

72
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:31,310
Right, Irala?

73
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:40,120
Okay, okay. l`lI take a little nap.

74
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,190
May l give you some advice?

75
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,231
Advice is cheap.

76
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:55,869
If you`ve got nothing to do,
do it somewhere else.

77
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:02,409
What is it, lraIa?
Your toothache again?

78
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:33,576
Hey, watch out. Be careful of drafts.

79
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:39,479
Two shots, and quick!

80
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:42,613
Move over.

81
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,760
You must know
where the freight yards are.

82
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,194
-Maybe.
-WiIl you telI me then?

83
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,989
It`s a little compIicated.

84
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:31,896
They are on the Northern Border.

85
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:36,468
FolIow the oId cattIe traiI
to the second crossing.

86
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:40,034
Then turn left, and left again.

87
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,410
Then a right
as far as the brick walI.

88
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:50,349
-Then it gets more compIicated.
-ln that case, better come and show us.

89
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:57,217
Irala!

90
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:14,608
Get in.
You`Il be comfortabIe next to me.

91
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,980
That`s a good pIan.
Bring them and let them see.

92
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:29,458
-lf you do it, they`lI be convinced.
-Why, are you afraid? Poor things.

93
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:32,223
Our orders are
not to move yet, lrene.

94
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:34,689
It was you who brought the order.

95
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:36,250
Good afternoon. I`m a tourist.
Tourist, foreigner.

96
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,527
Very interested in this,
in my country.

97
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:44,735
-l was told one can visit here.
-CertainIy, miss.

98
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,068
Are you afraid, Mr Wenceslao?

99
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:02,942
I think you`re right.
Anyone would be afraid.

100
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:05,948
The simpIest fear:
Fear they`lI hit hard.

101
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:10,950
That kind of fear
makes you forget everything.

102
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:15,051
Even forget that they are out there

103
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:20,358
and that they`Il come

104
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:23,229
knocking,

105
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,709
if no one

106
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:48,360
stands up to them.

107
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:43,040
Where have you taken us, my friend?

108
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:46,683
I didn`t know there was a detour.

109
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:50,916
-l`lI ask the way in that store.
-Go with him.

110
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:11,232
-Knock harder.
-You`re right.

111
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:15,957
Northern Frontier

112
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:26,270
-Where have you been? And the others?
-The truck arrived?

113
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,843
Don Porfirio had
some cattlemen stalI it.

114
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:32,778
Good thing.

115
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,923
Irala disappeared.
I was hoping he`d be with you.

116
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:52,359
The poor guy has good intentions.

117
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:55,532
But when the time comes...

118
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:22,990
I saw Irene on the street
this morning.

119
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,098
-And?
-Nothing. That`s alI.

120
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:56,725
-What kept you so Iong?
-Some cows were bIocking the road.

121
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:58,893
-lt`s getting late.
-We`re ready.

122
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:00,834
Take the car and we`lI folIow you.

123
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:26,963
I need this scooter.
You need 5000 pesos.

124
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,531
Just renting. Get off.

125
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,880
Don`t worry, he`Il bring it back.

126
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:03,389
What are those guys up to?

127
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:25,382
Be patient. lt`Il ring again.

128
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:36,651
Herrera!
So you had to get into some shooting!

129
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,421
Yes, yes. I`Il take care of it.

130
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:44,765
So what? Trucks aren`t
the onIy thing they`lI bring.

131
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:49,807
Vildrac has Iocated the truck
with the Ioad.

132
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:52,039
It`s out at <i>Villa Los Laureles</i>.

133
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:58,206
It must be destroyed, no matter what.
No Iater than tonight.

134
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:00,214
You shouId know why. Right?

135
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,649
That`s it. I need time, Herrera.

136
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:11,958
WencesIao N.,
another sIeepless night for us.

137
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,566
I`ve been waiting. Why didn`t you go?
And the others?

138
00:32:56,708 --> 00:33:00,269
Nobody showed up. Nobody.
I toId you, didn`t l?

139
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:03,403
Now who`Il beIieve us?
Nobody was there, lrene.

140
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:04,913
That`s enough.

141
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:08,382
I`Il check up. You go back...

142
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:41,976
-Who was that guy?
-l don`t know.

143
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,747
He was asking for directions.

144
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,414
I`m taking the bus.

145
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,820
You didn`t show up Iast night.

146
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:58,764
I was busy. A job.
I thought that now...

147
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:00,700
A friend of mine got sick.

148
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:03,506
And since I thought
you weren`t coming...

149
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:08,408
Yesterday you were out aIl afternoon.

150
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:11,310
I went for a walk.
I hate just waiting.

151
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,051
I`Il be back early.

152
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:20,615
-WiIl I see you later?
-WeIl, no, l can`t.

153
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:22,686
-Tonight there`s a...
-Fine.

154
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:25,189
Here`s my bus.

155
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:05,459
Someone said we`d better Ieave now,
before it starts raining.

156
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:09,504
What can we do?
They have their men aIl over.

157
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:19,510
Had to lie to my wife again, damn it.

158
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,449
I lie to women when they scare me.

159
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:32,919
Watch out. I think I hear a guitar.

160
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:37,526
Now Silva won`t spare us that
``Milonga de FIores`` of his.

161
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:48,439
-What a surprise!
-We thought you weren`t coming.

162
00:35:56,954 --> 00:36:00,185
Don`t be suspicious.
Tonight l`lI be faithful to you.

163
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:23,203
Friendship is so much more lucid
a passion than love.

164
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:25,178
Here l am.

165
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:19,670
<i>For the others the fever</i>

166
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:26,139
<i>And the sweat of the agony</i>

167
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:32,475
<i>And for me, four bullets</i>

168
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:36,709
<i>When daylight comes</i>

169
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:42,053
<i>Manuel Flores is going to die</i>

170
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:46,328
<i>That's something for sure</i>

171
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:51,097
<i>Dying is a habit</i>

172
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:55,137
<i>That most people have</i>

173
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:59,708
<i>Tomorrow the bullet's coming</i>

174
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,208
<i>And with the bullet, oblivion</i>

175
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:09,976
<i>So said Merlin the sage</i>

176
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:15,120
<i>To die is to have been born</i>

177
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:19,292
<i>And yet it pains me</i>

178
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:23,896
<i>To bid farewell to life</i>

179
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:28,394
<i>This thing one gets so used to</i>

180
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:33,170
<i>So sweet, and so familiar</i>

181
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:37,203
<i>At dawn l see my hand</i>

182
00:38:40,217 --> 00:38:43,709
<i>l see my veins in my hand</i>

183
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:47,249
<i>l look at them oddly</i>

184
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,723
<i>As if they were someone else's</i>

185
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,233
<i>How many things on their way</i>

186
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:01,729
<i>These eyes of mine have seen!</i>

187
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:05,371
<i>Who knows what they will see</i>

188
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:10,238
<i>After Christ has judged me</i>

189
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:37,065

191
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:48,509

00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:56,250
<i>When daylight comes</i>

193
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:20,913
Before you get compIeteIy drunk,
doctor, go and scout the vilIa.

194
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:31,655
Thanks.
Now let someone reaIly pIay it.

195
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,917
The truck is out
at <i>Villa Los Laureles</i>.

196
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:01,821
It has to be destroyed
before daybreak, understand?

197
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:05,662
The other trucks are important too.

198
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:09,994
But this one`s carrying the radio
equipment the invaders need.

199
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:13,469
By destroying it,
their attack wiIl be deIayed.

200
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:15,572
That`lI buy Don Porfirio some time.

201
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:20,099
Besides, it`s best we realized
that things have changed.

202
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:22,675
This truck is the start
of their takeover.

203
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:33,117
Feeling alone, aren`t you?
May l join you with my siIence?

204
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:35,019
I suppose so.

205
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:46,062
WelI, now that we`re talking,

206
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:50,230
I don`t mind teIling you l know
about IoneIiness too. More than...

207
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,107
Okay. Let`s go.

208
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:11,823
Always in demand, Lebendiger.

209
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:14,658
Take a break today. Come with us.

210
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:20,426
I understand your sorrow,
but don`t worry.

211
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:22,595
Something telIs me we`Il meet again.

212
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:24,506
I know, MarceIo.

213
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:40,088
I forgot my raincoat.

214
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:49,330
Hey! Watch out!
Are you blind or what?

215
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,235
What`s up, Moon?

216
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:21,459
Park your car by the gate.
Keep everything quiet.

217
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:01,499
I shouId have worn a sweater.
It`s no good for me to catch coId.

218
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:01,394
And the others?

219
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,168
Just one man guarding the truck.
The others must be inside.

220
00:45:19,283 --> 00:45:22,377
It`s easy. One of us has
to break into the house.

221
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,915
While they take care of him,
we grab the truck.

222
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:28,286
-Who`s going inside?
-The whole fence is electrified.

223
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:31,087
-l`ve got tools in the car.
-Good, let`s go.

224
00:46:05,562 --> 00:46:08,554
Herrera, to get into the house,
I was thinking...

225
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:11,331
The one who`s best cut out for this

226
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,668
is me.

227
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:18,200
If anyone has to die,
I`Il be the one.

228
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:27,474
You guys have courage and skilI.
AlI l have is my death.

229
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:32,716
Okay, Irala.

230
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:35,484
Done.

231
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:37,655
The wire`s cut.

232
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:40,120
We needed a volunteer.

233
00:46:40,697 --> 00:46:43,325
Irala says he`Il do it. l agree.

234
00:46:45,702 --> 00:46:48,170
How much time to get the truck going?

235
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,863
Eight minutes at most.

236
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:53,439
Cachorro, go with him.
You`Il be covered.

237
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:55,772
Silva and I wilI take the truck.

238
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:59,343
Before letting them hear you,
wait eight minutes.

239
00:47:00,784 --> 00:47:02,149
Take mine too.

240
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:05,241
Over here!

241
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:15,652
The back way!

242
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:25,918
-Now where to?
-To the cliffs.

243
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:33,760
No.

244
00:55:27,624 --> 00:55:30,991
Lebendiger, make sure my wife
beIieves that this was an accident.

245
00:55:31,127 --> 00:55:33,755
It`s nothing, JuIio.
We`ve seen a Iot worse.

246
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:47,872
You drive, Cachorro. l don`t know why
my eyes are so tired.

247
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:54,610
This way.

248
00:55:59,089 --> 00:56:00,522
Put them over there.

249
00:56:05,595 --> 00:56:08,928
Give them room. Give them air.
Back away!

250
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:19,138
There`s a car.
Get them to a hospital.

251
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:29,945
Don`t worry, <i>señora</i>.
We`lI take care of them.

252
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:04,042
WilI you ever understand?
Things have to be done carefuIly.

253
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:07,156
You just had to cross over the bridge
and that was aIl.

254
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:11,192
We`ve Iost our warehouse contact,
thanks to your impatience.

255
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:15,528
I can`t beIieve it! This is no game.
You don`t have to prove a thing.

Better give up, Herrera.

Why resist? PeopIe are waiting

Why are you heIping me?

I may be old-fashioned,
but I can recognize a gentleman.

300
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:20,168
The other gentIeman passed away.

301
01:07:24,807 --> 01:07:27,742
They took him away.
Everyone`s gone.

302
01:07:29,578 --> 01:07:31,011
Why did they Ieave?

303
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:34,812
Because he toId them
where the weapons are.

304
01:07:35,117 --> 01:07:40,521
They kiIled him
with an eIectric shock in the ear.

Come this way. Come.

01:12:31,647 --> 01:12:33,046
Poor Silva.

313
01:12:34,683 --> 01:12:38,050
He`s dead and doesn`t know
he revealed nothing to them.

314
01:12:40,055 --> 01:12:43,786
In my situation I have to lie
to my friends. l Iied to you as welI.

315
01:12:45,294 --> 01:12:47,285
The weapons aren`t on the isIand.

316
01:12:55,971 --> 01:12:58,838
Why did you waste time
running after that fool?

317
01:12:59,475 --> 01:13:03,309
-Yes, but the pIanes...
-And you thought they had no planes?

318
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:09,544
Moon, Lebendiger and Cachorro
are on the isIand.

319
01:13:09,685 --> 01:13:11,744
We must Iet them know they`re coming.

320
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:14,454
North-Northeastern Frontier

321
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:18,686
``One of us, said MorIock,
is the murderer.

322
01:13:19,828 --> 01:13:24,197
``l knew it the moment I noticed
the pipe was not in its place.

323
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:27,567
``Besides, the watchdog hadn`t barked.

324
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:30,766
``Burton turned paIe.

325
01:13:31,306 --> 01:13:33,240
``Doctor DoyIe took out a handkerchief

326
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:36,310
``and meticulously wiped his glasses.

327
01:13:37,479 --> 01:13:41,643
``MorIock went on toying
with the teaspoon.

328
01:13:43,051 --> 01:13:47,181
``Once he had spoken,
he seemed to lose interest.

329
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:50,088
``FinaIly, he spoke.``

330
01:13:53,829 --> 01:13:56,195
It Iooks Iike we won`t find out
the ending now.

331
01:14:40,008 --> 01:14:42,306
Hey, Miguel,
how`s the stamp colIection?

332
01:14:42,544 --> 01:14:45,069
Ask me later for the ones
Erika sent from IceIand.

333
01:15:29,224 --> 01:15:32,455
Anyone here?
Ever see them bringing guns?

334
01:15:32,594 --> 01:15:35,062
-Guns? Never.
-Liar!

335
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:36,391
Nobody lives here.

336
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:45,233
Don`t waste our time. We know
there are people who meet here.

337
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:46,705
Nobody lives here.

338
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:52,673
There`s another house over there.

339
01:16:04,493 --> 01:16:07,929
SIeep now. I have a busy day.
I`Il be back.

340
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:41,011
This angeI face was trying
to act like a man.

341
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:43,457
That pretty face won`t last Iong.

342
01:17:57,472 --> 01:17:58,871
There`s one behind...

343
01:19:10,312 --> 01:19:13,281
Drop your guns!
Come out one at a time!

344
01:19:46,314 --> 01:19:47,338
Cachorro!

345
01:20:24,419 --> 01:20:28,856
She`lI be here with the expIosives
any minute now.

346
01:20:50,212 --> 01:20:51,474
She`s being folIowed.

347
01:22:52,033 --> 01:22:53,591
They hit you this time.

348
01:22:55,337 --> 01:22:56,964
What do you mean by ``this time``?

349
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:00,169
Nothing. I wasn`t thinking.

350
01:23:03,111 --> 01:23:05,204
JuIián, I`m not asking
what you`re up to.

351
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:09,208
But I know that it`s something
more important than me.

352
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:17,019
Where did you come from, Irene?

353
01:23:31,606 --> 01:23:32,937
I`Il get it.

354
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:47,750
I have to go to a wake.

355
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:44,808
Poor Vildrac.

356
01:24:46,181 --> 01:24:49,150
He aIways believed
nothing could happen to him.

357
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:53,712
Don Porfirio, l came aIong the coast.

358
01:24:53,855 --> 01:24:55,982
And saw some ships, right?

359
01:24:58,059 --> 01:24:59,959
You shouId have seen what happened!

360
01:25:00,095 --> 01:25:03,428
Those bastards came
and we had to burn them out.

361
01:25:03,698 --> 01:25:04,960
Everything is up in flames!

362
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:23,076
-Not many people showed up.
-You Iook paIe, Marcelo.

363
01:25:26,287 --> 01:25:27,914
His widow asked about you.

364
01:25:32,694 --> 01:25:33,820
Laura.

365
01:25:59,521 --> 01:26:02,820
You two go to the Union HoteI
on the Northwestern border.

366
01:26:03,091 --> 01:26:05,582
Ask for Don Cesáreo, the owner.

367
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:08,827
He`s put everything away.
Send everything here.

368
01:26:08,963 --> 01:26:10,191
I can go.

369
01:26:10,331 --> 01:26:12,925
No, you need a good rest.

370
01:26:16,337 --> 01:26:19,670
Go home and don`t show yourseIves
too much around town.

371
01:26:30,852 --> 01:26:34,288
I`Il stay at Irene`s.
Don`t forget Don Porfirio`s advice.

372
01:33:00,808 --> 01:33:02,366
What`s the matter, lrene?

373
01:33:04,445 --> 01:33:05,912
Aren`t you happy now?

374
01:33:07,114 --> 01:33:08,547
Right now l am.

375
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:16,212
Someday, my lady,
you`Il be happy alI the time.

376
01:33:16,357 --> 01:33:17,619
Are you sure?

377
01:33:20,094 --> 01:33:21,356
I have to be.

378
01:33:24,265 --> 01:33:26,130
I must beIieve
everything wiIl work out.

379
01:33:26,267 --> 01:33:29,202
-What wiIl work out?
-Nothing, nothing in particular.

380
01:33:32,373 --> 01:33:34,864
Someday we`lI be able to Iive
like everyone else.

381
01:33:35,209 --> 01:33:38,804
-You don`t even teIl me where you go.
-We agreed not to talk about that.

382
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:41,607
We used to telI
each other everything.

383
01:33:44,652 --> 01:33:46,313
Something must have changed us.

384
01:33:52,259 --> 01:33:55,717
But what`s wrong, Irene?
Everything`s going welI.

385
01:34:01,602 --> 01:34:04,503
Why are you crying?

386
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:09,642
I know l have to cry.
Today or tomorrow, it`s alI the same.

387
01:34:55,489 --> 01:35:02,156
Northwestern Frontier

388
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:28,853
Good afternoon.

389
01:35:30,224 --> 01:35:32,522
You`ve had this place for years,
haven`t you?

390
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:34,651
Three years, four months.

391
01:35:34,829 --> 01:35:37,855
I don`t have to ask you
if you`ve got any Burgundy?

392
01:35:37,998 --> 01:35:40,865
I don`t have to answer no!
But I have absinthe.

393
01:35:41,001 --> 01:35:43,936
WelI, let`s find that absinthe.

394
01:36:24,044 --> 01:36:25,170
Gee!

395
01:36:25,813 --> 01:36:28,805
How did Don Porfirio manage
to gather aIl these?

396
01:36:29,917 --> 01:36:32,317
So many guns, and alI for nothing!

397
01:36:32,486 --> 01:36:35,944
Don`t worry,
the oId man isn`t so easily beaten.

398
01:36:54,074 --> 01:36:58,408
AlI Ioaded, Fernando. You know
where to deIiver these vegetables.

399
01:37:13,093 --> 01:37:14,754
They`re waiting here too.

400
01:37:16,096 --> 01:37:17,688
There they are, Moon.

401
01:37:20,801 --> 01:37:22,666
There are about ten, aren`t there?

402
01:37:23,337 --> 01:37:24,668
Over fifty.

403
01:38:06,580 --> 01:38:10,277
We`ve always envied
your success with women.

404
01:38:11,352 --> 01:38:12,751
It puzzIes me too.

405
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:15,651
But undoubtedly there`s something
about me that attracts them.

406
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:21,021
-l`ve resigned myself to it.
-Better to have than not to.

407
01:38:21,161 --> 01:38:23,152
That`s for sure!

408
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:07,639
PIease, excuse me.

409
01:40:07,768 --> 01:40:11,260
This house suits you.
It has your look.

410
01:40:59,019 --> 01:41:01,146
I must admit
I was expecting something else.

411
01:41:01,288 --> 01:41:05,122
Something more pIeasant,
but stiIl a mere repetition.

412
01:41:05,759 --> 01:41:09,126
Instead, now l can verify something
that`s always bothered me.

413
01:41:09,997 --> 01:41:13,558
To know whether l have courage.
It seems l have.

414
01:41:20,741 --> 01:41:22,538
Don`t be offended by what l said.

415
01:41:23,210 --> 01:41:27,044
I see you`re a woman
completely unIike the rest.

416
01:41:32,252 --> 01:41:34,880
My reIations with women
have aIways been strange.

417
01:41:36,123 --> 01:41:38,557
I`ve spent my whole Iife
loving and deceiving.

418
01:41:40,961 --> 01:41:43,555
It`s only right
that a woman brought me here.

419
01:41:45,833 --> 01:41:49,428
Let the girI go.
She shouldn`t see unpIeasant things.

420
01:43:15,122 --> 01:43:16,749
Didn`t you see the revolver?

421
01:43:18,959 --> 01:43:20,085
No.

422
01:43:22,930 --> 01:43:24,227
I was blind.

423
01:43:59,700 --> 01:44:02,032
JuIián!

424
01:45:49,843 --> 01:45:53,904
Irala and ViIdrac died
so you couId destroy the truck.

425
01:45:55,115 --> 01:45:56,639
And it has been in vain.

426
01:45:58,652 --> 01:46:01,849
The invaders have instalIed
a transmitter in the stadium.

427
01:46:02,489 --> 01:46:04,423
From there they`Il order the attack.

428
01:46:05,959 --> 01:46:07,824
It`s heavily guarded.

429
01:46:07,961 --> 01:46:11,556
But a man Iike you couId destroy it
aIl by himself.

430
01:46:13,734 --> 01:46:15,634
That would give me a few more days.

431
01:46:16,937 --> 01:46:18,427
And l need them.

432
01:46:21,441 --> 01:46:23,773
We`re the onIy ones Ieft,
Don Porfirio.

433
01:46:24,177 --> 01:46:25,610
Why go on fighting?

434
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:31,008
-lt`s always worth going on.
-AIl right, but without me.

435
01:46:33,086 --> 01:46:35,179
The transmitter is somewhere
in the stadium.

436
01:46:35,789 --> 01:46:39,555
Don Porfirio, l`ve always
carried out your orders.

437
01:46:39,893 --> 01:46:41,656
But this city`s beyond hope.

438
01:46:42,863 --> 01:46:45,457
Why die for peopIe
who won`t defend themselves?

439
01:46:46,767 --> 01:46:48,291
Count me out.

440
01:46:52,239 --> 01:46:54,173
The city is more than its peopIe.

441
01:46:59,513 --> 01:47:01,777
PIease, don`t make me disobey you.

442
01:47:02,149 --> 01:47:06,085
The transmitter is there somewhere.
Maybe in the stands.

443
01:47:12,192 --> 01:47:13,955
I`m not going, Don Porfirio.

444
01:52:15,028 --> 01:52:19,692
Herrera wouIdn`t go to the stadium.
He must be home now.

445
01:52:19,833 --> 01:52:22,631
-When we phoned, nobody answered.
-He`lI be arriving any minute now.

446
01:52:31,911 --> 01:52:35,711
How long have I worked for you?
And you never Iet me telI him.

447
01:52:36,282 --> 01:52:38,147
A man like him
wouIdn`t have accepted it.

448
01:52:38,284 --> 01:52:41,583
Why? Why didn`t you Iet me telI him
I aIso beIonged to the group?

449
01:52:42,255 --> 01:52:45,418
Why torment yourseIves
with each other`s dangers?

450
01:52:46,359 --> 01:52:48,554
Now you two can talk.

451
01:52:48,695 --> 01:52:51,027
I don`t know.
He`s probably at the stadium.

452
01:52:53,700 --> 01:52:58,228
He said he wouIdn`t go.
Go home and wait for him.

453
01:53:04,244 --> 01:53:09,113
He needs to be brave. l`lI go home,
and he is not going to come.

454
01:53:12,418 --> 01:53:14,352
CaIl as soon as he arrives.

455
01:53:28,735 --> 01:53:30,168
AlI right, Iet`s go.

456
01:53:51,257 --> 01:53:54,749
What?
You want to play the martyr?

457
01:56:45,565 --> 01:56:47,726
What`s that? Who?

458
01:56:48,668 --> 01:56:50,329
Why are you calIing me?

459
01:56:52,572 --> 01:56:53,766
What?

460
01:56:54,741 --> 01:56:56,106
Where?

461
01:56:57,110 --> 01:56:58,839
Yes, l thought so.

462
01:57:00,513 --> 01:57:05,473
I know that too. HeIlo? HeIlo?

463
01:57:08,955 --> 01:57:10,855
It seems they`ve hung up.

464
01:57:23,002 --> 01:57:26,403
Don`t worry if I don`t come back.
There`s milk in the kitchen.

465
01:57:49,762 --> 01:57:51,753
I`m getting too old for this.

466
01:59:12,745 --> 01:59:16,078
Of course,

467
01:59:56,989 --> 01:59:59,116

468

02:00:12,505 --> 02:00:16,532

02:00:17,977 --> 02:00:20,411
Now it`s your turn, you Southerners.
