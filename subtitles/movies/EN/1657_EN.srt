1
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:51,977
Can we go now?

2
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:53,986
Our suspect is in the
hotel, but don't worry,

3
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:58,684
your client is in no danger.
My best man's on the job.

4
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:04,556
Gibert to Alain.

5
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:09,861
Suspect located. Distance
roughly... 15 meters.

6
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:12,166
- Get over here.
- I'm here, boss.

7
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:13,866
Concentrate, Alain!

8
00:01:13,906 --> 00:01:16,272
See the wildcat at 11 o'clock?

9
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:19,068
It's a maritime expression.

10
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:22,275
In Marseille 10 years,
and still not seen the sea?

11
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:24,476
I have. When we patrol the port.

12
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:26,280
OK, I see.

13
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,583
12 o'clock is straight ahead,

14
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:32,079
so 11 o'clock's that
way, a bit to the left.

15
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:34,659
I get it.

16
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:36,961
Are you sure that's a suspect?

17
00:01:37,029 --> 00:01:38,656
Looks like a chambermaid.

18
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:41,256
A terrorist doesn't go round yelling

19
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,461
with explosives strapped to his waist.

20
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:43,867
That's right.

21
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:45,461
They wear disguise.

22
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:50,770
What better than a chambermaid

23
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,277
- pushing her cart along?
- Of course.

24
00:01:52,311 --> 00:01:53,676
Especially in a hotel.

25
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:57,581
The song encourages him to
commit his dastardly act.

26
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,881
Sounds like Spanish.

27
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:02,581
A revolutionary anthem!

28
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:09,155
Watch out!

29
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,858
On my signal, neutralize the Basque!

30
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,265
10/5.

31
00:02:16,802 --> 00:02:18,269
12 o'clock!

32
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:22,067
Good job! Betrayed by his own song!

33
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:24,076
To the cars!

34
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,971
I'll question him later.

35
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:30,073
What's happening?

36
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:33,176
Sir, I've just neutralized
the Hispanic terrorist

37
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:35,483
with a cart full of

38
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:37,682
what look like toxic products.

39
00:02:37,723 --> 00:02:38,985
I'm sending them to the lab.

40
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:40,287
Perfect, Gibert!

41
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:43,261
Get the client out of
his room or he'll be late.

42
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,160
It's as good as done, sir.

43
00:02:46,832 --> 00:02:48,163
Emilien? Coast's clear

44
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,963
to deliver the package.

45
00:02:50,202 --> 00:02:51,965
Emilien! Answer me!

46
00:02:52,004 --> 00:02:53,471
I'm almost outside his door, chief!

47
00:02:54,206 --> 00:02:55,867
Honestly, jumping me on the job!

48
00:02:55,908 --> 00:02:58,172
I can't help it.

49
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:01,976
You turn me on when you're in action.

50
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:03,879
Reminds me of Sean Connery.

51
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:04,974
Don't take liberties,

52
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:07,679
just because you're stronger than me.

53
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,585
Next time, you can tie me down.

54
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:12,182
Quiet! The whole hotel's bugged.

55
00:03:12,224 --> 00:03:14,055
Yes, Inspector!

56
00:03:14,126 --> 00:03:16,754
I'll handle the
package. You find Gibert.

57
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,861
I love you, Emilien.

58
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:24,767
I love you, too, but not now!

59
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:26,465
Tonight, at home!

60
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:33,669
Mr. Cisse!

61
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,273
You're due on the pitch in 20 minutes.

62
00:03:36,315 --> 00:03:41,685
The charity is 9 For Africa. We're
building an orphanage. That's my goal.

63
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:45,789
Sorry, but I'm with the
police. I'm here to...

64
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:48,157
- What's your name?
- Emilien.

65
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,461
No, it's not for a... It's for the...

66
00:03:52,531 --> 00:03:55,659
This is no time to exchange cards.

67
00:03:55,701 --> 00:03:58,067
OK, where's this Gerbil-jibly...

68
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:00,572
That'll twist foreign tongues.

69
00:04:00,606 --> 00:04:02,073
The name's Djibril Cisse.

70
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:03,473
Don't get smart with me,

71
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:06,672
or you'll be straight in the pen.

72
00:04:07,613 --> 00:04:09,877
Emilien, look. Nothing like him.

73
00:04:09,915 --> 00:04:11,075
The nose, teeth...

74
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:13,779
It's him, sir. I promise you.

75
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:15,480
Not too fast! I smell
a rat and I should know.

76
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:19,685
2 years at customs. No
illegals get past me.

77
00:04:19,725 --> 00:04:22,660
I bust the Korean
people smugglers in '92.

78
00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:24,753
- He's not Korean.
- Can you be sure?

79
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,559
I checked his ID.

80
00:04:26,632 --> 00:04:29,157
- Look, slant eyes.
- He's just tired.

81
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:31,761
Let's go.

82
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:32,862
The Prefect will lose patience.

83
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:34,668
To the cars!

84
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:42,970
I don't know why, but
you're not popular here.

85
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,687
Don't worry, he prefers
fishing to football.

86
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:52,986
Mumbling again, Emilien?

87
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:55,152
I was just saying you're a keen angler.

88
00:04:55,227 --> 00:04:56,956
That's a real sport.

89
00:04:57,029 --> 00:04:58,155
Do you fly fish?

90
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,562
I never do anything on the fly.

91
00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:03,864
Quite right!

92
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:07,964
There's no room for
amateurism in fishing.

93
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:11,170
Take float fishing, for
example, for stillwater tench.

94
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,973
You can lie in wait for
hours like a vulture,

95
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:15,173
watching the float, then...

96
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,080
What is it now?

97
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:25,181
- Nothing broken?
- No, I'm fine.

98
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:27,454
Can't you ring your bell?

99
00:05:27,526 --> 00:05:30,962
They said Mr. Cisse was asleep.
We didn't want to wake him.

100
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,466
He's in my car. We're transferring him.

101
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,967
Djibril Cisse?

102
00:05:36,001 --> 00:05:37,969
Transferred to Marseille?

103
00:05:38,003 --> 00:05:40,870
Shit, it's Cisse!

104
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,270
Do something or we'll miss the match.

105
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:44,571
Don't worry,

106
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,578
I know a guy who can help.

107
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,178
The police have taxis?

108
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:54,482
He's with the air force.

109
00:05:56,922 --> 00:05:58,287
Marseille Express, at your service.

110
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:01,851
Mr. Cisse has 8 minutes
to get to the game.

111
00:06:01,927 --> 00:06:03,258
Good to have you aboard.

112
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,456
You're playing for Marseille?

113
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,761
A charity game. We'll miss kick-off.

114
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,064
If it's for a good cause...

115
00:06:31,323 --> 00:06:33,689
I'll get changed to save time.

116
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,455
You can try.

117
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,665
Guess who's transferred to Marseille.

118
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:45,864
This is the wrong way.
The city's gridlocked.

119
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,463
No kidding! Djibril Cisse himself!

120
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:00,483
Number 9 for Olympique de Marseille.

121
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:03,283
That's what I call a road.

122
00:07:05,624 --> 00:07:07,251
Like velvet.

123
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:09,556
Can't even hear the engine.

124
00:07:09,628 --> 00:07:11,858
At this speed, only wind.

125
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:15,762
News has just come in

126
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:17,166
that Marseille has broken the
bank to buy a wonder player,

127
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,967
none other than Djibril Cisse.

128
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,477
There's a taxi coming your way.

129
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:27,274
ETA less than one minute.

130
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:28,974
Got ya!

131
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:30,982
It must be Daniel.

132
00:07:31,016 --> 00:07:33,280
It ain't gonna be the pope.

133
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,479
The Parisian?

134
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,578
Jeez, that's mean.

135
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,589
He has to learn sometime.

136
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,456
- Hey, Blondie!
- Yes, sir?

137
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:44,053
Can you check the radar over there?

138
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:45,562
Switch it to ultra-sensitive, will you?

139
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,064
Sir, yes, sir!

140
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,669
Watch out, bullet train
approaching. Stand back!

141
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:02,775
Thanks, kid. We got
a much better reading.

142
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:09,586
- It really goes.
- I customized it.

143
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:11,886
Picked up parts from Concorde.

144
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:13,687
Brake! We're nearly there.

145
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:19,164
We just received
confirmation. 60 million!

146
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,167
The transfer of the year!
There's traffic everywhere.

147
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,971
I know a shortcut.

148
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,478
I hate it when you say that.

149
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:39,876
The wildest rumors surround

150
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,683
the transfer of Djibril Cisse
to Olympique de Marseille.

151
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:47,158
To find out more, over to
Armand Pecci at the Velodrome.

152
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:49,854
Absolutely, we're here live in Marseille

153
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:53,660
for the fund-raiser for
a sick children's charity.

154
00:08:53,732 --> 00:08:57,759
The player has asked
for an astronomical sum.

155
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:01,569
Figures of up to 200 million
euros have been mentioned.

156
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:04,474
He'll reveal all to
us later live on TF1,

157
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,478
but for now he's not even arrived.

158
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:09,879
Djibril Cisse or not,
we kick off in 2 minutes.

159
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:15,982
Take a right.

160
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:18,581
That's two "rights" already?

161
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:19,488
You sure you been here before?

162
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:22,255
Papal security.

163
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,262
We spent 6 days here looking for Gibert.

164
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:28,266
That's reassuring. How
about we trust my instinct?

165
00:09:30,302 --> 00:09:31,769
OK, let's go!

166
00:09:40,512 --> 00:09:42,480
- 7' 32".
- Thanks.

167
00:09:42,514 --> 00:09:44,277
Thank you.

168
00:10:03,802 --> 00:10:05,963
This is better than on TV.

169
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,563
You're kind of in the
way. Back to the stands,

170
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:10,473
or it's a yellow card.

171
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,272
Yes, ref.

172
00:10:50,315 --> 00:10:52,579
- What are you doing?
- That's a free kick.

173
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:03,754
- That wasn't a fair play!
- Leave him alone!

174
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:57,180
Let's warm up good! Lift
your knees. I want no strains.

175
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:11,962
- Like the shirt?
- It's too big.

176
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,964
You know your Mom.

177
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,467
After the first wash,

178
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:17,764
The autograph'll wash off.

179
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:20,567
I'll ask her to wash round it.

180
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:21,470
Listen to me.

181
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:25,273
Stay on the pitch more than
3 minutes. No red cards.

182
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,777
Are you OK?

183
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:31,076
The golden rule is you
don't go near the ball.

184
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:31,775
Yes.

185
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:34,285
If it comes to you, just kick it.

186
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:35,081
Which way?

187
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,486
Just kick. They can chase it.

188
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,684
Can't I play a bit, though?

189
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:42,250
When the match is over, with me.

190
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:45,956
Go on, son!

191
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:48,162
Don't run too fast.

192
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:59,170
Sure he won't catch cold?

193
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:02,476
I gave him a thermal undershirt
and vitamin C earlier.

194
00:13:02,514 --> 00:13:04,778
Like that, not much can go wrong.

195
00:13:04,816 --> 00:13:07,284
Get him playing ice hockey.

196
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:08,980
Too dangerous!

197
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,886
His Mom wanted him to do karate.

198
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:14,450
I had a word with the
club. They turned him down.

199
00:13:14,526 --> 00:13:17,552
He's gonna have to learn
to take a hit some time.

200
00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:19,654
Yeah, it'll be too soon.

201
00:13:19,731 --> 00:13:20,663
Try swimming.

202
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:23,964
He has a bad chest. It's hereditary.

203
00:13:24,002 --> 00:13:26,266
You never broke anything as a kid?

204
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,466
- My arm. 3 times.
- You see?

205
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:32,068
It didn't make me any smarter
or get me into cop school.

206
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,578
You shoulda tried breaking a leg.

207
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:40,685
Well played, son, that's right!

208
00:13:43,021 --> 00:13:45,581
What'll happen to our kids?

209
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:46,682
Whaddya mean?

210
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:49,057
Mine a cabbie and yours a cop?

211
00:13:49,127 --> 00:13:51,755
Why not? They'd be doing well.

212
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,661
We help people. Pretty neat, huh?

213
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:55,757
Don't complain, there's worse.

214
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,860
Mine a cabbie and yours a cop!

215
00:13:57,903 --> 00:13:59,666
Don't even mention it.

216
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,977
This is Emilien.

217
00:14:08,313 --> 00:14:10,679
- Emilien?
- An emergency?

218
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:13,480
Gibert said that? I'm off duty today.

219
00:14:13,518 --> 00:14:14,485
Emilien...

220
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:15,679
You okay, Maxime?

221
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:18,087
- You're kidding me!
- I think you oughta...

222
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,681
OK, I'll be right there.

223
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:22,250
Gibert's called everybody in.

224
00:14:22,327 --> 00:14:24,261
Petra's on an ultra-secret mission.

225
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:26,456
And my Mom's gone to Lourdes.

226
00:14:26,531 --> 00:14:27,156
Lourdes?

227
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,564
She goes since I was born.

228
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,261
That was some miracle!

229
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:33,066
- You'll take care of the kids?
- No problem.

230
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:35,164
Don't fill his face with cakes.

231
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,768
Would I? Crust of bed,
glass of water and to bed!

232
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,472
Joke! I'll look after him like my own.

233
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:42,673
That scares me.

234
00:14:42,714 --> 00:14:44,978
I look after your son every Wednesday.

235
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:48,475
Has he ever come home with pimples?

236
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,181
So, get moving.

237
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,689
Thank you.

238
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,854
4' 30". You beat your record.

239
00:14:54,926 --> 00:14:56,757
I didn't touch him!

240
00:14:56,828 --> 00:15:00,457
Stinky ref! Hands out
cards like confetti.

241
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,461
Get Max. We'll go eat waffles.

242
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,561
C'mon, Max, let's go eat.

243
00:15:11,109 --> 00:15:13,577
Arrest that ball immediately!

244
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,074
I got it, chief!

245
00:15:15,113 --> 00:15:17,081
Bring it over here.

246
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,078
Won't bother me again.

247
00:15:24,122 --> 00:15:25,987
Here, kids, enjoy your game.

248
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:31,553
This is no time for dribbles,

249
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,064
stepovers and other football clownery.

250
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,657
I had Paris on the phone.

251
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:38,670
They're sending a very special delivery.

252
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:41,468
The most important transfer of the year.

253
00:15:41,506 --> 00:15:42,564
- Drogba?
- Thuram?

254
00:15:42,607 --> 00:15:43,869
I know! Makelele!

255
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:45,274
- Beckenbauer?
- Maradona?

256
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:48,473
What a bunch of idiots!

257
00:15:48,513 --> 00:15:50,481
I'm not talking tennis,
I'm talking crime.

258
00:15:50,515 --> 00:15:51,482
Bernard Tapie!

259
00:15:51,516 --> 00:15:54,076
Much more famous than him.

260
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,781
On my files, he's public enemy No. 1

261
00:15:56,822 --> 00:16:03,455
It's none other than
Jeeycee Kassa-see...

262
00:16:03,528 --> 00:16:04,153
- Jeeycee Kassa-see...
- No, chief.

263
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,958
Attention!

264
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,760
That was yesterday's transfer.

265
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:09,460
Where's today's?

266
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:11,469
Turn the page. Save paper, remember?

267
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:12,663
Yes, indeed.

268
00:16:12,704 --> 00:16:13,762
It's my wife.

269
00:16:13,805 --> 00:16:16,467
She saw a program on the Amazon forest.

270
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:20,069
Know how many hectares
are cut down every year?

271
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:24,878
How many?

272
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,286
It sends shivers down your spine.

273
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,287
How many?

274
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:34,759
Like billions of matchboxes,
chopped down and up in flames.

275
00:16:34,826 --> 00:16:37,761
So, at the first chance,
I say, show me your papers!

276
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:40,263
I mean, save paper!

277
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,266
What about public enemy No. 1?

278
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,564
A Belgian whose name is
enough to make you feel sick.

279
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:49,472
53 armed robberies, 122
accomplice-to-murder raps.

280
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,966
Biggest mobster since AI Capone.

281
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:57,573
He's being transferred to Congo to
stand trial for dozens of crimes.

282
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,174
Stopover in Marseille.

283
00:16:59,217 --> 00:17:01,879
We take delivery, keep him warm

284
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,683
till 5 a.m. tomorrow

285
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:06,486
and put him in the Congolese jet.

286
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,255
He's not gonna see any sights.

287
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:13,054
I want ultra-tight surveillance.

288
00:17:13,131 --> 00:17:15,861
An officer every square centimeter.

289
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:18,870
So many cops, so close,
he can't even see the sea.

290
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:21,464
- Do I make myself hear?
- Yes, chief!

291
00:17:21,506 --> 00:17:24,066
What time's he get in?

292
00:17:24,509 --> 00:17:26,977
Good question. 15:00 hours.

293
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,877
It's already 5 past.

294
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:30,882
5 past 12?

295
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,485
To the cars!

296
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:37,079
What's up? Isn't that what you ordered?

297
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:38,180
Eat then.

298
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:41,954
Dad said not to eat cream
'cos I get it all over.

299
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:43,255
Well, he's wrong.

300
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:46,161
Show him what a good eater you are.

301
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:54,863
Shit! Your Dad! The cops!

302
00:17:54,906 --> 00:17:58,467
What are you doing? Get out of the way!

303
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:01,570
The lady's got a flat.

304
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:04,480
I gotta help in this heat.

305
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:06,484
He's right. She'll
dehydrate. She needs help.

306
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:08,486
- I can do first aid!
- I used to be a florist.

307
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,988
Stop! Stay where you are!

308
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,759
Some parents deserve to be sent to jail.

309
00:18:19,831 --> 00:18:22,857
How long does it take to change a tire?

310
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:25,461
Here, we take the time
to do things right.

311
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:27,764
Thank you.

312
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:30,673
About time, too. Drive!

313
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,282
Tasty, at least?

314
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:54,957
General!

315
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,262
Gibert! That explains it.

316
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:59,759
We took a shortcut,
but the lady had a flat.

317
00:18:59,804 --> 00:19:01,271
1 hour to change a tire?

318
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,570
In the police, a week at best.

319
00:19:03,608 --> 00:19:06,771
The first thing they
learn now is to shoot.

320
00:19:06,811 --> 00:19:10,577
But cops deal with more
flat tires than shootouts.

321
00:19:10,615 --> 00:19:12,674
Is it the same in the army?

322
00:19:12,717 --> 00:19:15,185
- We have caterpillars.
- They're very good.

323
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,881
Specially off road.

324
00:19:46,117 --> 00:19:49,280
That reminds me of a vacation in Africa.

325
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:53,485
We slept in cages to
keep the wild beasts away.

326
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,459
This is the worst kind of beast.

327
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:59,463
If he escapes, there'll
be blood on the streets.

328
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,964
Don't worry, General,
we're used to his sort.

329
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:03,160
2 hours to tame him.

330
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:06,967
Tomorrow, he'll be
juggling balls on his nose.

331
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:08,563
Load him up!

332
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:14,670
Good job!

333
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,773
Your career hangs on this.

334
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:21,877
It's in the bag. Let's
synchronize watches.

335
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,478
- 16:20.
- 5 past 12. Perfect.

336
00:20:23,521 --> 00:20:26,490
Touch base every 2 hours. Go!

337
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:32,462
Hello.

338
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:34,157
General! Already?

339
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:38,260
It's taken you a mere
30 seconds to mess up.

340
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:40,669
- Sorry?
- Check your mirror.

341
00:20:41,606 --> 00:20:46,270
The label! I can see much
better now. Thank you, General.

342
00:20:46,611 --> 00:20:49,876
I meant your side-view mirror.

343
00:20:49,914 --> 00:20:52,280
Look to your right.

344
00:20:53,618 --> 00:20:57,179
Shit! Reverse engines!

345
00:21:06,631 --> 00:21:10,067
He has the point.

346
00:21:11,302 --> 00:21:12,462
You're sure about the address?

347
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:14,062
100%.

348
00:21:14,105 --> 00:21:18,667
You stay in the car. I'll
be much happier on my own.

349
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,871
If, and I emphasize the "if",

350
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:22,971
I'm gone 30 minutes, come get me.

351
00:21:23,014 --> 00:21:24,777
Yeah, right!

352
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:26,982
What?

353
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:31,478
Call me before you unleash
him. To be on the safe side.

354
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:32,785
No worries.

355
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:43,459
Gee, he missed it!

356
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:22,967
Let me see how well you can handle this.

357
00:22:26,811 --> 00:22:28,073
HI, Daniel!

358
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:30,581
This was on the road.

359
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:33,175
Is it yours? I knew
it had hit the asphalt.

360
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:34,276
Thanks.

361
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:36,685
- Hiya, kids!
- Jeez, they grow up quick.

362
00:22:36,721 --> 00:22:38,985
It's little Maxime!

363
00:22:39,023 --> 00:22:41,253
Lucky, he's not like his Dad.

364
00:22:41,826 --> 00:22:42,451
OK, let's go.

365
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,654
Emilien's out on a mission.

366
00:22:44,729 --> 00:22:46,959
They can play on the computer.

367
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:50,258
Where are your Dad's video games?

368
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:53,571
Those'll keep you busy.

369
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:56,073
I have to make a call. Be good.

370
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:01,479
Can we both play?

371
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:04,778
No, they gave Dad the worst computer.

372
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:06,579
Hardly even sends email.

373
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:09,280
- And Gibert's?
- It's hot stuff!

374
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,881
What the hell is all this garbage?

375
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:15,449
Need an MA for the new models!

376
00:23:17,328 --> 00:23:19,558
- What?
- We wanted to play.

377
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,462
It's taken. Try another office.

378
00:23:21,499 --> 00:23:22,557
That one's

379
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,967
a CORE2 total latest generation.

380
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:32,868
- You know how to work this?
- Child's play!

381
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:35,975
- Hi, Marley.
- How are you!

382
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:38,073
Got anything for a sore throat?

383
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:40,584
The season's over. I ain't got much.

384
00:23:40,618 --> 00:23:42,483
Take a look.

385
00:23:45,623 --> 00:23:47,454
Yeah, right.

386
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:52,160
- You join me?
- Why not!

387
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,765
- It'll wake me up. Here.
- No, thanks.

388
00:24:01,806 --> 00:24:05,173
Not on duty. I'll smoke it tonight.

389
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:09,271
Here, it's the opposite.
We never smoke at home.

390
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:13,284
- It's Gibert!
- Check out the car!

391
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,151
Alain?

392
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,163
Put the beast in the main office.

393
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:28,256
- Out of the cage?
- Of course not!

394
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:30,859
May I remind you, he's
extremely dangerous?

395
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:33,564
I know, but the cage is extremely big.

396
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:35,573
Stop discussing the discussion.

397
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,268
Action!

398
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:41,979
All units...

399
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:44,573
Big bad wolf's back. Over.

400
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:46,277
That's Gibert! Lose it.

401
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:05,469
Marley!

402
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:07,664
- Come here.
- Yes, sir?

403
00:25:08,806 --> 00:25:11,172
- Have you been smoking?
- No, I swear...

404
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:11,868
Don't lie to me.

405
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,277
I have a very sensitive nose.

406
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:18,476
I trained with mountain rescue dogs.

407
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:20,279
I can sniff snow like no man.

408
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:21,182
It's great.

409
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:24,188
I could detect grass
over a mile away. Wicked!

410
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:25,689
I guess so.

411
00:25:25,723 --> 00:25:30,251
I'll let it ride. Last chance, OK?

412
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:36,062
Type your password.

413
00:25:39,203 --> 00:25:41,068
Select a photo.

414
00:25:43,107 --> 00:25:46,474
Click on the one you don't want.

415
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:50,080
Then click on the one you want.

416
00:25:52,116 --> 00:25:54,584
Thanks, boys. I don't know

417
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:56,678
what I'd have done without you.

418
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,985
You deserve a reward.

419
00:26:00,224 --> 00:26:02,249
A bill for each of you.

420
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,960
Put it away. Our secret.

421
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:10,157
What are you doing, boys?

422
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:13,967
I don't want you on my computer.

423
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:17,970
And what are you doing?

424
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,569
You're the new IT trainer?

425
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:26,174
- Right.
- Sorry, I'd forgotten.

426
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:29,482
It's not a luxury having
a teacher for this.

427
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,548
I'm pretty electronically minded,
but I've met my match here.

428
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:36,252
Short and sweet.

429
00:26:36,327 --> 00:26:39,558
I've had a long day. Feels
like my head'll explode.

430
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:41,564
Sorry, but you're smoking.

431
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,464
I stopped 3 weeks ago.

432
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:46,868
I have pretty good willpower, but
this time I resorted to a patch.

433
00:26:46,904 --> 00:26:48,166
- Yes, indeed!
- Great.

434
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,872
I meant, your head's smoking.

435
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:56,476
- So it is.
- May I?

436
00:26:57,215 --> 00:26:59,274
Where'd that come from?

437
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:01,877
Morocco, definitely.

438
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,479
Put it out. It's a no-smoking office.

439
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:05,682
Sorry.

440
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:09,457
Can we start? I have a busy schedule.

441
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:12,155
Where did you get to
in your last lesson?

442
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,857
Adjusting the chair.

443
00:27:14,999 --> 00:27:16,660
Take the mouse.

444
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:19,465
One eye on the screen,
one on the keyboard.

445
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:23,167
One eye on the screen,
one on the keyboard...

446
00:27:33,117 --> 00:27:34,778
This won't be easy.

447
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,584
That's for
6-year-olds?

448
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:40,750
Dad! It's totally harmless.

449
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,759
We haven't played it for ages.

450
00:27:44,228 --> 00:27:47,664
It's awful. You have no idea.

451
00:27:47,698 --> 00:27:50,166
No, I never have any ideas.

452
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:53,170
We got a huge job. A major client!

453
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:55,263
- What kind?
- Wanted all over Europe.

454
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:58,571
They sent him here? He'll
learn to play boules.

455
00:27:58,609 --> 00:28:00,770
No time. He's flying out
to Congo at 5 tomorrow.

456
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:01,870
If he's not escaped.

457
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:05,576
This isn't a police
station, it's a summer camp.

458
00:28:05,616 --> 00:28:07,880
- Relax.
- If that's not what it was, then it's great.

459
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,887
Gibert wants us all in to work overtime.

460
00:28:13,524 --> 00:28:16,049
I can't get hold of Petra.

461
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:18,459
Always some damn top secret mission.

462
00:28:18,529 --> 00:28:20,463
So, I'm stuck with the kid...

463
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:23,865
And could your friend
Daniel look after him?

464
00:28:23,901 --> 00:28:26,870
Just a couple of hours

465
00:28:26,904 --> 00:28:28,462
until I get off duty.

466
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:30,667
- 2 sugars in your coffee?
- Thank you.

467
00:28:31,008 --> 00:28:33,977
When do I do any work?
I've had the kids all day.

468
00:28:34,011 --> 00:28:35,478
Can't Lily help out?

469
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:37,174
She's in Paris on a decorating course.

470
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,773
Decorating?

471
00:28:38,816 --> 00:28:42,274
She's decided to redecorate the garage.

472
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:45,482
- Yikes!
- You said it.

473
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:47,753
She wants the taxi to sleep outside.

474
00:28:47,825 --> 00:28:49,554
Ouch!

475
00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:51,251
You're a dead man!

476
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:56,460
It could be a good thing.
Lily puts flowers everywhere.

477
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:58,969
Pollen blocks up the carburetors.

478
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:01,563
I spend all weekend cleaning
them with cotton buds.

479
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:04,666
You have to learn to compromise.

480
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:06,267
You compromise with Petra?

481
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,778
No kidding.

482
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:11,281
- For example?
- My clothes.

483
00:29:11,315 --> 00:29:13,579
When I was single, I never tidied up.

484
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:16,883
Anything lying around, Petra
threw it out the window.

485
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,481
- Your shorts, too?
- Everything!

486
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:22,459
So, you learned to be tidier?

487
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:27,260
I bought a fishing rod.
Saved me 3 flights of stairs.

488
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:31,869
When can you pick Max up?

489
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:33,564
In 2 hours.

490
00:29:33,604 --> 00:29:35,469
OK, you have 2 hours.

491
00:29:35,506 --> 00:29:38,475
- You're a pal.
- Yeah, I know.

492
00:29:41,612 --> 00:29:44,581
As it's just us guys tonight,

493
00:29:44,615 --> 00:29:47,982
how about a TV dinner in the garage?

494
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:49,486
Deal!

495
00:29:51,822 --> 00:29:54,450
You can keep them busy for 2 hours?

496
00:29:54,525 --> 00:29:55,958
I have an idea.

497
00:29:56,827 --> 00:29:59,660
- Granddad!
- My little soldiers!

498
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,755
Great to see you!

499
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:03,266
Wasn't it Sunday?

500
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:06,270
We were going to see a movie

501
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,771
and they insisted we stop by.

502
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:09,966
Granddad, I missed you!

503
00:30:10,007 --> 00:30:11,474
I wanna stay with Leo.

504
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:13,670
My little lambs. I'm here now.

505
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:17,477
Granddad's here, don't worry.

506
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:18,675
They're so sensitive.

507
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:21,776
Yeah, their mothers are away.

508
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:23,980
They act hard but they're softies.

509
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:29,857
Couldn't you let them stay a few hours?

510
00:30:31,128 --> 00:30:33,562
2 hours, no more! They have homework.

511
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:35,963
2 hours. Not a second more!

512
00:30:43,307 --> 00:30:45,172
He's been gone an hour. Let's go!

513
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:47,268
Give him 5 more minutes, OK?

514
00:30:47,311 --> 00:30:51,475
Turn it, that's right.
Now, lower it. Faster...

515
00:30:51,515 --> 00:30:52,777
Faster?

516
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:55,980
Turn it... That's right. Not bad.

517
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,988
You gotta get the rhythm.

518
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:58,784
We're done, chief.

519
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:01,257
Very clever!

520
00:31:01,325 --> 00:31:03,156
- You lost me the game.
- Yes.

521
00:31:03,227 --> 00:31:05,457
Not bad for a first try.

522
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:07,258
What's my score?

523
00:31:11,802 --> 00:31:13,770
- Excuse me.
- Go ahead.

524
00:31:13,804 --> 00:31:13,963
Hello?

525
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:15,870
It's Sukk. We coming in?

526
00:31:15,906 --> 00:31:19,672
No, there's no need. I'm
done. I'll be right there.

527
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,972
OK, cool.

528
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:22,877
- What did he say?
- Shut up.

529
00:31:22,913 --> 00:31:25,074
Sorry, I have to go.

530
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:25,980
You do?

531
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:27,780
I have a client waiting.

532
00:31:27,818 --> 00:31:30,480
See you next month, same time?

533
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:31,886
With pleasure.

534
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,260
What have you done? Are you nuts?

535
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:47,862
You said the main office.

536
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:50,169
I didn't argue. An order's an order.

537
00:31:50,207 --> 00:31:52,573
Very true. You've done well, Alain.

538
00:31:58,916 --> 00:32:01,680
Lose the cover. We're not
here to mollycoddle him.

539
00:32:09,927 --> 00:32:11,952
It's pretty scary.

540
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,060
- Is he really so nasty?
- Even worse.

541
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,567
He'd kill a sheep with his ears.

542
00:32:17,601 --> 00:32:19,569
Don't be afraid, young Emilien.

543
00:32:19,603 --> 00:32:22,663
I did 5 years in the jungle,

544
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:24,470
living on spiders and hippos for UNESCO.

545
00:32:24,508 --> 00:32:26,669
A Belgian doesn't scare me.

546
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:31,978
We'll start with some routine questions.

547
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:34,075
Pass me the documents.

548
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,779
Come on!

549
00:32:39,523 --> 00:32:41,457
Full name?

550
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:44,854
Well? How did it go?

551
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:46,760
It's a madhouse in there.

552
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:49,156
It's freaky.

553
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,667
C'mon, drive!

554
00:32:56,707 --> 00:32:58,470
So, he wants to play tough.

555
00:32:58,509 --> 00:32:59,476
The
Bouches-du-Rhone.

556
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,569
- Bouches-du-Rhone? -
The special treatment.

557
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:04,772
Answer the captain!

558
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:07,277
Calm, everybody.

559
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:15,452
Think you're smarter than me? Very well.

560
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:18,461
In my drawer, my bush rifle.

561
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:22,160
I brought this back from Guyana.

562
00:33:22,199 --> 00:33:23,757
A gift from the chief.

563
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:26,861
One dart will put an elephant
to sleep in 5 seconds.

564
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:28,872
Watch out, it's loaded.

565
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:31,966
Keep him in your sights.
If he moves again, fire!

566
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:33,067
No warning shot?

567
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:37,877
There's only one dart. How
can you fire a warning shot?

568
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:39,280
My mistake!

569
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,282
Back to the name. Full name?

570
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:45,488
What's that?

571
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:50,153
He's getting on my nerves! That's
not a pretty sight, believe me.

572
00:33:50,227 --> 00:33:52,661
It's hard to talk with a ball-gag in.

573
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:55,961
Excuses! If he wanted to, he could.

574
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:59,463
Look, chief. He's
trying to say something.

575
00:33:59,503 --> 00:34:01,266
Just what we're waiting for.

576
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:03,965
Say we take out the gag, just to see?

577
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:07,068
No! Give him a mile, he'll take an inch.

578
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:08,976
That's what the slate's for, then.

579
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:11,277
- The slate?
- Look!

580
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:13,476
With a bit of chalk. It's
for him to communicate.

581
00:34:13,517 --> 00:34:15,485
He can write his answers.

582
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:17,987
Go ahead. Write! Full name!

583
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:20,547
He can't talk, but I think he hears us.

584
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:24,451
Give him the chalk.

585
00:34:24,528 --> 00:34:26,655
Watch he doesn't eat your leg.

586
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:30,262
Gently does it.

587
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:38,969
Very good.

588
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:47,174
Get out of the way quickly!

589
00:34:56,126 --> 00:34:57,753
What did he write?

590
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:03,262
- Pipi.
- Pipi?

591
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,268
That his first or last name?

592
00:35:05,302 --> 00:35:07,270
He needs the toilet.

593
00:35:09,206 --> 00:35:13,666
Definitely not.

594
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:15,576
The old toilet ploy.

595
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:18,480
And he takes off out the window.

596
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,575
I've seen it 100 times. He
thinks we'll fall for that?

597
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,178
You must be kidding me. They
must've planned for this.

598
00:35:24,121 --> 00:35:25,782
Look, there!

599
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,558
Look where?

600
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:32,561
You know how it works?

601
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,655
Sure! It's child's play.

602
00:35:34,698 --> 00:35:36,563
There's a drainage pipe.

603
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:41,663
And a clearage pipe. Simple.

604
00:35:41,705 --> 00:35:42,467
They showed us a training
film about new equipment.

605
00:35:42,506 --> 00:35:44,474
Forget it.

606
00:35:44,808 --> 00:35:46,969
Hook it up. Keep him in your sights!

607
00:35:52,516 --> 00:35:55,485
Get some of that! It's wicked.

608
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,060
A bit strong. I see giant worms.

609
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,867
That connects to the water.

610
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:16,869
And that goes in the toilet.

611
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,677
Easy!

612
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:24,681
- It's all ready.
- You've scared me!

613
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:25,773
Give me that!

614
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:27,579
Sorry, I wasn't concentrating.

615
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:29,779
So, concentrate a bit harder.

616
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,584
Cops don't go playing with guns.

617
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:36,150
This isn't a funfair,
shooting for teddy bears.

618
00:36:36,226 --> 00:36:38,456
This thing's for real bears.

619
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,963
Rule No. 1, when you're inside,

620
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:43,762
finger on the trigger guard,

621
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:46,065
gun held parallel, to avoid accidents.

622
00:36:47,504 --> 00:36:50,166
My foot!

623
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:57,069
- Quick!
- Grab that chair!

624
00:36:57,114 --> 00:36:59,878
- He's so heavy!
- Put him there! Like carrying 3 people.

625
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,481
Look at the state of him!

626
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:04,077
Did he smoke the carpet?

627
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:06,681
He took a hit of stuff for bears.

628
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:07,850
For bears?

629
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:09,950
- You give him that?
- I gave him nothing.

630
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:15,055
You morons! It's a
dart, full of sedative.

631
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:17,260
It'd put a bear to sleep. Wake
him or he'll hibernate 6 months.

632
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:19,667
That'd make 6 quiet months.

633
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:22,165
Who signs your leave?

634
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:23,867
Shit! Chief! Wake up!

635
00:37:23,907 --> 00:37:25,568
Time to get up!

636
00:37:25,609 --> 00:37:27,668
Red alert!

637
00:37:31,715 --> 00:37:33,580
Where were we?

638
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:35,776
We'd got to "full name".

639
00:37:35,819 --> 00:37:38,287
All right, don't get as dumb as Gibert!

640
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:39,880
Sorry.

641
00:37:39,923 --> 00:37:42,653
Spend all day with him,
it starts to rub off.

642
00:37:42,726 --> 00:37:46,457
Did you enjoy your
pee, my Belgian friend?

643
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,657
You did your Maneken-Piss?

644
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,461
Good one!

645
00:37:55,005 --> 00:37:56,472
OK, enough.

646
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:59,271
He needed it. Look at his legs.

647
00:37:59,309 --> 00:38:01,174
That shouldn't happen.

648
00:38:02,112 --> 00:38:03,977
It should drain away.

649
00:38:04,014 --> 00:38:05,481
Looks like it's rising.

650
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:07,882
Impossible. The water should run off.

651
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:09,886
Maybe you got the pipes
mixed up. I know I often do,

652
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,979
but I took extra care.

653
00:38:12,022 --> 00:38:15,253
Drainage and clearage.

654
00:38:15,325 --> 00:38:17,156
It's not that then.

655
00:38:17,327 --> 00:38:19,454
We have a problem.

656
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:24,863
I think I'd better check.

657
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:31,766
I mixed them up again!

658
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,868
What an idiot!

659
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:38,672
I don't believe it! Is
the water going down?

660
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:39,580
Sure, look.

661
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:42,585
He had geysers for eyes.
Now, it's a trickle.

662
00:38:42,619 --> 00:38:44,484
Let's get him out before he drowns.

663
00:38:44,521 --> 00:38:48,457
No way, he's dangerous.
Don't fool with him.

664
00:38:48,525 --> 00:38:51,460
If the Belgian drowns
right here, who's the fool?

665
00:38:51,528 --> 00:38:53,155
It'd be like we killed him.

666
00:38:54,698 --> 00:38:57,258
There must be a fast-release system.

667
00:38:57,301 --> 00:39:00,464
Look for a switch or a lever.

668
00:39:00,704 --> 00:39:02,467
A chain?

669
00:39:02,706 --> 00:39:05,971
A handle! Quick, grab yours.

670
00:39:06,009 --> 00:39:08,671
Ready? 1, 2, 3...

671
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,578
He looks in a bad way.

672
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:19,680
Let's take his hood off.

673
00:39:19,723 --> 00:39:20,451
No, you do it.

674
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,458
- Why me?
- Move it!

675
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:36,166
- It's a tight fit.
- Take it easy.

676
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,077
That's funny.

677
00:39:43,113 --> 00:39:44,171
He's not how I imagined.

678
00:39:44,214 --> 00:39:44,771
Oh, yeah?

679
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:49,775
I thought he'd have a face,
y'know, with huge teeth and jaws...

680
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,481
- A real yeti?
- More or less.

681
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:54,457
The meanest killers look totally normal.

682
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:56,459
Wake him up.

683
00:39:58,729 --> 00:39:59,457
What the heck?

684
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:00,861
Precautions.

685
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:11,868
Sir?

686
00:40:12,609 --> 00:40:15,271
Wake up!

687
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:22,581
- There, he's better!
- That's great.

688
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:24,678
I'm pleased.

689
00:40:27,724 --> 00:40:28,452
Where am I?

690
00:40:28,525 --> 00:40:30,959
Marseille central police station.

691
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:36,462
And you guys are cops?

692
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:40,470
Soon we'll be lieutenants.

693
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:42,972
You'll be lieutenants soon?

694
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,471
- Bouches-du-Rhone?
- Flyswatter, first.

695
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:51,879
Stop hitting me!

696
00:40:51,915 --> 00:40:53,678
- Stop!
- Listen...

697
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:56,880
There's been a terrible mistake

698
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,480
that is the fault of
the police in my country.

699
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,260
Albert Vandenbosh, wanted by Interpol,

700
00:41:12,302 --> 00:41:14,770
convicted in 17 countries. Remember?

701
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:15,965
Of course. That's the problem.

702
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:18,474
I'm not Vandenbosh,

703
00:41:18,508 --> 00:41:22,171
but Eugene Triboulet, embassy attaché.

704
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:26,478
He's trying to con us.

705
00:41:26,516 --> 00:41:28,984
1987. The Paris-Bruges train heist.

706
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:31,487
I've committed no crime. I'm an attaché.

707
00:41:31,521 --> 00:41:34,957
You're a hell of a case!
Don't try to fool us.

708
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:38,051
Let's knock out a report for the chief.

709
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:39,561
He'll enjoy reading it.

710
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,063
I'll get on it.

711
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:42,656
Take this down.

712
00:41:42,699 --> 00:41:44,462
Albert Vandenbosh...

713
00:41:44,501 --> 00:41:45,968
Eugene Triboulet!

714
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:48,767
I met Vandenbosh. Look at his photo.

715
00:41:48,805 --> 00:41:51,171
I don't look anything like
him. He's a thug! Yeah, right.

716
00:41:52,509 --> 00:41:54,067
Emilien?

717
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:55,976
Take a look.

718
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,985
Who's that?

719
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,680
Albert Vandenbosh.

720
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,880
See? I told you.

721
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:07,550
I know it's not your fault. Release me

722
00:42:07,624 --> 00:42:09,649
and I won't sue.

723
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:12,555
How'd you know Vandenbosh?

724
00:42:12,629 --> 00:42:14,654
I don't actually know him.

725
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:16,666
I saw him at Bruges police station.

726
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,258
What were you doing?

727
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:19,564
Making a complaint.

728
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:21,468
I'd been carjacked.

729
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:21,869
What?

730
00:42:21,905 --> 00:42:24,066
They carjacked my Toyota.

731
00:42:24,107 --> 00:42:26,769
Dragged me out and drove away.

732
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:29,472
In Marseille, it's called a Parisian.

733
00:42:29,513 --> 00:42:31,481
We call it carjacking!

734
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:32,277
- Carjacking...
- Carjacking...

735
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:33,476
OK, what happened next?

736
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:37,078
I was in the chief's
office. Charming man...

737
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:40,453
When I had to go to the toilet.

738
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:42,549
You're always peeing!

739
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,660
Yes, since my prostate operation.

740
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,958
- Sorry.
- Then what?

741
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:50,462
In the stalls, I ran into Vandenbosh,

742
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,468
shucking that horrible suit.

743
00:42:52,502 --> 00:42:54,766
3 thugs jumped on me

744
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:56,966
and forced me inside there.

745
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:58,668
I put up a fight,

746
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:01,075
but they soon gagged me

747
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:02,169
and from then on

748
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:04,476
I was powerless to resist.

749
00:43:04,514 --> 00:43:06,573
You're very good.

750
00:43:06,616 --> 00:43:09,779
But unfortunately for
you, you've met your match.

751
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,481
- Emilien?
- What now?

752
00:43:11,521 --> 00:43:13,079
Check this out.

753
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:22,158
Belgian Embassy Fenimore
Eugene Tribloulet.

754
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:24,759
Cultural attaché, Belgian
Embassy. Since 1996.

755
00:43:24,801 --> 00:43:28,567
Since May 17, 1996, to be precise.

756
00:43:28,605 --> 00:43:31,267
My appointment even got a
mention on the RTBF news.

757
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:33,776
- Is there a phone number?
- There.

758
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:35,277
Call them up.

759
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:36,574
Action!

760
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,287
Belgian Embassy, how can I help?

761
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:46,482
Mr. Triboulet, please?

762
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:49,048
Sorry, he's been away for 3 days.

763
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:52,459
You don't know where he's gone?

764
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:54,258
To be honest, no.

765
00:43:54,297 --> 00:43:58,757
He hasn't called in at all and the
whole Embassy's worried about him.

766
00:43:58,802 --> 00:43:59,962
He's disappeared?

767
00:44:00,003 --> 00:44:02,665
It seems so. He was in Bruges in Tuesday

768
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:05,675
and got his car carjacked.

769
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:08,576
Since then, no news of him.

770
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:11,979
- Are you a relation?
- No.

771
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:14,577
That's awful.

772
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:17,485
Thanks, I'll call back.

773
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,450
What a balls-up!

774
00:44:23,326 --> 00:44:25,055
Talk, damn you!

775
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:27,759
Take it easy!

776
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:29,663
I have my eye on them.

777
00:44:29,699 --> 00:44:32,668
Don't burn the place down.

778
00:44:32,702 --> 00:44:35,865
Nobody got any clothes for our prisoner?

779
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:39,273
Check the closet. The
boss always keeps spares.

780
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:43,971
No kidding. He can
change 10 times a day.

781
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:47,475
Daniel! Good timing.

782
00:44:47,517 --> 00:44:48,484
Is there a problem?

783
00:44:48,518 --> 00:44:51,487
I'd like it if you
could sign the armistice.

784
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:58,158
Die!

785
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,865
Get lost!

786
00:45:04,901 --> 00:45:06,459
Check this out.

787
00:45:08,905 --> 00:45:10,065
Great!

788
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:13,565
I'd rather die in glory
than surrender in shame.

789
00:45:15,812 --> 00:45:17,575
What's that?

790
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:23,077
Peace! War's over!

791
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:30,058
Okay, General?

792
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:32,459
I'm fine.

793
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:37,460
I may have lost a battle,
but I haven't lost the war.

794
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:41,460
Can the rematch wait?
They have homework to do.

795
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:44,565
Yes, of course. On Sunday, perhaps.

796
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:46,075
That's right. The Lord's Day!

797
00:45:46,109 --> 00:45:47,474
He'll be delighted.

798
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:51,971
And we'll have apple pie.

799
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:53,482
I'll take care of it.

800
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:55,485
You two, in the car!

801
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:00,656
2 quiet hours? You
destroyed his living room!

802
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:03,158
He started it. We wanted to play drafts.

803
00:46:03,226 --> 00:46:05,456
He said only swishes play drafts.

804
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:07,963
Swishes? He said that?

805
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,759
You know what swishes do?

806
00:46:09,799 --> 00:46:12,267
Sure. It's when you squish flies.

807
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:15,669
Dad says they never
stop swishing at work.

808
00:46:19,609 --> 00:46:23,477
The flies have been bulking
up. They're bigger than bees.

809
00:46:25,715 --> 00:46:27,774
He's well-built, your chief.

810
00:46:27,817 --> 00:46:30,980
He's bulky, all right. But it suits you.

811
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:33,581
Not quite my style, but it'll do.

812
00:46:33,623 --> 00:46:35,454
Better than that diving suit!

813
00:46:35,525 --> 00:46:37,254
For sure.

814
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:45,466
Look at the size of that one!

815
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:50,170
- What are you on?
- Sorry!

816
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:53,870
There was a fly right
there. It was gigantic!

817
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:58,477
Giant flies and worms, I
know. Take some herb tea.

818
00:46:58,515 --> 00:47:00,073
I swear! Where'd it go?

819
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:03,081
You're compulsive squishers!

820
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,484
You got us wrong.

821
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:08,150
It's because our chief
loves fly-fishing, you see?

822
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:12,855
It's his birthday soon, so
we're collecting for him.

823
00:47:12,929 --> 00:47:15,261
It's a surprise.

824
00:47:16,499 --> 00:47:18,160
Sorry, excuse me.

825
00:47:18,201 --> 00:47:20,260
Can we give you a ride?

826
00:47:20,303 --> 00:47:23,170
No, I'll take a cab.

827
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:25,870
Goodbye.

828
00:47:26,309 --> 00:47:27,970
Our apologies, huh?

829
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:34,684
- Denial, are you here?
- Is Emilien done?

830
00:47:34,718 --> 00:47:36,583
Another hour.

831
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:39,885
Tell him I'll get the
pizzas and meet him at mine.

832
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:41,254
Okay, I'll tell him.

833
00:47:41,324 --> 00:47:42,757
- Bye.
- Thanks.

834
00:47:51,701 --> 00:47:54,465
Fine timing! I need
a means of transport.

835
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:56,165
Where can I transport you?

836
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:57,867
4, Mediterranean Square.

837
00:47:57,907 --> 00:47:58,669
Nice address.

838
00:47:58,708 --> 00:48:00,767
- Can I ask a favor?
- Your wishes...

839
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:03,176
I know you go at your own pace here

840
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:05,477
because the sun makes you sleepy,

841
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:07,676
but the sun's gone down,

842
00:48:07,717 --> 00:48:09,480
so I don't want to see the sights.

843
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:11,487
Would you kindly floor it
to make the transport brief?

844
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:13,955
Get it? Transport, port?

845
00:48:14,024 --> 00:48:16,458
Marseille port?

846
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:17,458
Not bad, huh?

847
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:20,155
Belt up, smartass!

848
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,754
I beg your pardon.

849
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,660
- Gross!
- That stinks!

850
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:28,967
I apologize.

851
00:48:29,005 --> 00:48:30,870
You got it all over me!

852
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:35,778
Have fun in Marseille!

853
00:48:35,812 --> 00:48:37,177
Goodbye, ma'am.

854
00:48:46,022 --> 00:48:49,253
Delta 1. The sardine's in the tin.

855
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:50,850
Over to you, Delta 3.

856
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:52,451
10/4. Cast the bait.

857
00:48:55,799 --> 00:48:57,164
Here goes!

858
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,464
It beats that greasy outfit
that stank of sardines.

859
00:48:59,502 --> 00:49:01,970
- You got the gear?
- Everything.

860
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:03,165
And the specialist?

861
00:49:03,206 --> 00:49:07,165
It wasn't easy finding
good help here. Actually...

862
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:10,077
Serge! I didn't ask how great you were,

863
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:11,978
but if you found a specialist.

864
00:49:12,015 --> 00:49:12,777
The best!

865
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:15,182
Let me be the judge of that.

866
00:49:15,218 --> 00:49:17,982
Sure. I said you'd want
to see for yourself.

867
00:49:19,322 --> 00:49:20,949
That's him now!

868
00:49:33,903 --> 00:49:35,564
Kiss or shake hands?

869
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:37,470
I prefer a kiss.

870
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:41,773
In Belgium, it's 3 times.

871
00:49:43,913 --> 00:49:45,778
I'm honored to work for you.

872
00:49:45,815 --> 00:49:47,976
- You know my work?
- "Work" is too ugly.

873
00:49:48,017 --> 00:49:50,679
I prefer the word "deeds".

874
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,085
She's good!

875
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:53,487
When do we begin?

876
00:49:53,523 --> 00:49:56,458
Not so fast. I like flattery,

877
00:49:56,526 --> 00:49:59,757
but I have a little test for you.

878
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:03,464
I'll close my eyes and you must try,

879
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:07,664
if you can, to take
something without me noticing.

880
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:09,968
You have one minute!

881
00:50:11,207 --> 00:50:13,175
I reset it.

882
00:50:13,209 --> 00:50:14,767
It was a minute slow.

883
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:18,679
- She's really good.
- Is she in-house?

884
00:50:21,718 --> 00:50:25,779
We've been through all the
regions. He's not interested.

885
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:27,847
There's only one solution.

886
00:50:27,924 --> 00:50:30,449
- Here's the doc.
- Where's the bear?

887
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:35,765
His nose is dry.

888
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:39,257
He's not a bear. He got a
dose of bear tranquilizer.

889
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:42,465
I thought I'd never seen one like him.

890
00:50:43,606 --> 00:50:45,471
I have an antidote.

891
00:50:45,508 --> 00:50:48,966
It's for elephants,
but it works on bears.

892
00:50:49,012 --> 00:50:50,479
Are you sure about this?

893
00:50:50,513 --> 00:50:51,980
It's a question of aiming

894
00:50:52,015 --> 00:50:56,475
just above the trunk between the eyes.

895
00:50:58,521 --> 00:51:00,955
I'm right here, chief.

896
00:51:01,024 --> 00:51:02,048
What's wrong with him?

897
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:03,752
It's normal.

898
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:06,455
He needs to stay in his basket.

899
00:51:08,097 --> 00:51:11,863
I must have dozed off. What time is it?

900
00:51:11,901 --> 00:51:12,868
5 past 12.

901
00:51:12,902 --> 00:51:15,871
That explains it. I could eat a horse.

902
00:51:15,905 --> 00:51:17,065
You want pizza?

903
00:51:17,106 --> 00:51:18,971
- I wouldn't say no.
- Coming up.

904
00:51:19,008 --> 00:51:22,671
I had an absurd dream
and you were in it.

905
00:51:22,712 --> 00:51:27,775
You let the Belgian bamboozle
you and he walked free.

906
00:51:27,817 --> 00:51:31,685
I have some weird dreams sometimes.

907
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:33,689
This can't be...

908
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:35,955
Emilien?

909
00:51:55,812 --> 00:51:59,475
You won't believe what happened.

910
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:01,882
- You got fired?
- You know?

911
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:03,886
You get fired once a month.

912
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,478
This time it's serious.

913
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:07,149
Remember public enemy No. 1?

914
00:52:07,223 --> 00:52:08,850
The guy transferred via Marseille?

915
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:10,256
- And?
- I let him walk free.

916
00:52:10,326 --> 00:52:11,452
- This can't be true. I
- No.

917
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:13,962
I mean, he escaped. I'm such an idiot!

918
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:15,464
A real numbskull!

919
00:52:15,498 --> 00:52:18,058
It's not just my skull. All over.

920
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:20,262
I just keep messing up.

921
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:22,965
I could write a dictionary of stupidity.

922
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:24,268
Don't exaggerate.

923
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:27,572
You bag some biggies. The
Santa gang? China Girl?

924
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:29,475
That was just luck!

925
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:31,671
I'm useless.

926
00:52:31,714 --> 00:52:34,683
Gibert was right to take my
badge. I don't deserve it.

927
00:52:34,717 --> 00:52:36,480
Same goes for most cops.

928
00:52:36,519 --> 00:52:38,987
I became a cop for my Dad's sake.

929
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:41,149
It was his dying wish.

930
00:52:41,224 --> 00:52:45,661
It's tough, but at least you tried.

931
00:52:45,728 --> 00:52:47,161
Yeah, you're right.

932
00:52:47,897 --> 00:52:51,663
It's time to move on. Do
something I want to do.

933
00:52:51,701 --> 00:52:54,465
That's a positive attitude.

934
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,972
What do you want to do?

935
00:52:57,006 --> 00:53:00,271
That's the problem. I like my job.

936
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:02,175
It's the best in the world.

937
00:53:02,211 --> 00:53:05,476
I see. You really are in the shit.

938
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:08,081
If only I could find the Belgian.

939
00:53:08,117 --> 00:53:09,982
I'd get my badge back.

940
00:53:10,019 --> 00:53:11,680
- What Belgian?
- The perp. He's Belgian.

941
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:14,451
Big mouth? Fisherman?

942
00:53:16,125 --> 00:53:18,059
Exactly.

943
00:53:18,127 --> 00:53:18,957
Have you seen him?

944
00:53:19,028 --> 00:53:21,258
I picked him up outside the station.

945
00:53:21,297 --> 00:53:23,857
That's him. He said he'd take a cab.

946
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,458
Pretty spectacular escape.

947
00:53:25,501 --> 00:53:27,264
Was the police band playing?

948
00:53:27,303 --> 00:53:29,271
Do you remember where he went?

949
00:53:29,305 --> 00:53:32,570
- Of course.
- You're a genius!

950
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:35,875
- Emilien?
- Why?

951
00:53:35,912 --> 00:53:37,675
What about the kids?

952
00:53:39,115 --> 00:53:42,084
Shit! The kids. You got an idea?

953
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:47,451
Is it Sunday already?

954
00:53:47,523 --> 00:53:48,455
Sure it is.

955
00:53:48,524 --> 00:53:50,549
Here are the kids, I'll get the pie.

956
00:53:50,627 --> 00:53:53,755
Fine. I'll put the oven on.

957
00:54:02,205 --> 00:54:05,470
- You're sure it's here?
- Yes. No. 4.

958
00:54:05,508 --> 00:54:07,669
We need to check they're still here.

959
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:09,268
They are.

960
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:10,973
Are you sure? It looks empty.

961
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:15,474
They're asleep like everybody
else, except us two fools.

962
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,481
Does that mean that I am not normal?

963
00:54:20,123 --> 00:54:21,954
And their car's still there.

964
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:25,756
You'd have made a good
cop. Is that a compliment?

965
00:54:25,828 --> 00:54:28,854
Sure. As a kid, you must
have played cops and robbers.

966
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:30,866
Sure, but I was always
on the other team.

967
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,663
If we have work to do
tomorrow, I'll get some sleep.

968
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:35,967
Go ahead. I'll keep an eye on them.

969
00:54:48,317 --> 00:54:50,080
Emilien?

970
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:54,451
Sorry, I dozed off.

971
00:54:54,524 --> 00:54:58,654
We have coffee, Quick Burgers,

972
00:54:58,728 --> 00:54:59,456
cheeseburgers, pies... Yogurt.

973
00:54:59,529 --> 00:55:00,553
You had that in the car?

974
00:55:00,596 --> 00:55:02,461
I bought it.

975
00:55:02,498 --> 00:55:04,966
You mean no one was watching the house?

976
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:08,562
I was supposed to sleep
while you kept watch.

977
00:55:08,604 --> 00:55:10,572
Your snoring kept me awake.

978
00:55:10,606 --> 00:55:12,665
- Maybe they took off?
- They didn't take off.

979
00:55:12,709 --> 00:55:14,870
The car's still there.

980
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:17,778
Another arrived an hour
ago with 2 guys in it.

981
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,281
Why didn't you wake me?

982
00:55:19,315 --> 00:55:22,182
You sleeping gives me a
break. Even if you snore.

983
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:24,584
They're coming out.

984
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:27,949
There's the Belgian!

985
00:55:28,024 --> 00:55:30,652
It's not him. Mine was a lot younger.

986
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:32,957
He's in disguise!

987
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:35,463
Look, his mustache is dropping off.

988
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:38,464
Why'd he get dressed up
to leave his own house?

989
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,765
Maybe because the cops are after him.

990
00:55:40,803 --> 00:55:42,464
Absolutely right.

991
00:55:42,905 --> 00:55:45,465
There's something
familiar about the girl.

992
00:55:52,815 --> 00:55:53,975
Never saw her before.

993
00:56:17,206 --> 00:56:19,470
- Where are they going?
- Guess.

994
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:33,477
Monaco! Banks all over.
Heaven for a guy like him.

995
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:34,854
A tax haven, you mean.

996
00:56:34,924 --> 00:56:39,452
Tell me about it. We'd just
love to access some vaults here.

997
00:56:39,529 --> 00:56:41,463
Shall I ask the Belgian to help?

998
00:56:41,497 --> 00:56:43,965
After all you did for him, he owes you.

999
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,467
Cut it out!

1000
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:56,078
Here we go...

1001
00:56:56,712 --> 00:56:57,974
He's chosen one.

1002
00:57:07,023 --> 00:57:08,650
Royal Bank of Belgium.

1003
00:57:08,724 --> 00:57:10,157
He must be homesick.

1004
00:57:10,226 --> 00:57:12,057
They're gonna hold it up?

1005
00:57:12,128 --> 00:57:13,857
They're not playing boules.

1006
00:57:13,896 --> 00:57:14,658
I'll call Gibert.

1007
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:17,461
Shouldn't you wait to have some proof?

1008
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,559
No sweat! We'll get the proof later.

1009
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:20,762
Chief? It's Emilien.

1010
00:57:20,803 --> 00:57:23,465
I've got the Belgian.
I've spotted him at least.

1011
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:26,066
I know I'm not a cop anymore.

1012
00:57:26,108 --> 00:57:28,770
I was taking a walk

1013
00:57:29,512 --> 00:57:31,275
and I saw him enter a bank.

1014
00:57:31,814 --> 00:57:35,682
They're not playing boules.
It's the RBB in Monaco.

1015
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:38,783
I know it's far. I'll
try to tie them up.

1016
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,647
- He's on his way.
- Great!

1017
00:57:41,724 --> 00:57:43,851
The Joker vs. Scooby-Doo.

1018
00:57:44,026 --> 00:57:46,460
Can I help you?

1019
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:48,554
I'm here to see my son, Edouard.

1020
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:50,065
You're Triboulet's father?

1021
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:52,260
- That's right.
- He'll be so pleased.

1022
00:57:52,301 --> 00:57:54,166
2nd floor, room 115.

1023
00:57:54,203 --> 00:57:55,670
Thank you.

1024
00:57:56,205 --> 00:57:58,765
This way. They're friendly here.

1025
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:02,475
Come in.

1026
00:58:04,614 --> 00:58:05,979
Dad?

1027
00:58:06,015 --> 00:58:07,983
Idiot! Dad died 4 years ago.

1028
00:58:08,017 --> 00:58:09,985
He'd be ashamed of you

1029
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:12,078
for changing names.

1030
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:13,679
Brother...

1031
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:16,057
- I thought you were in prison.
- Not this week.

1032
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:18,650
Prison's like a country home.

1033
00:58:18,728 --> 00:58:20,559
I go there to rest up.

1034
00:58:25,601 --> 00:58:28,263
Let's have a look at you.

1035
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:31,565
Still that stupid
haircut. You never change!

1036
00:58:31,607 --> 00:58:34,576
Girls like men with hair that's virile.

1037
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:35,975
A bit like me.

1038
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:38,571
You're still single?

1039
00:58:38,614 --> 00:58:40,275
Yes.

1040
00:59:02,805 --> 00:59:04,773
Delta 1 in position.

1041
00:59:04,807 --> 00:59:06,968
10/4, Delta 2.

1042
00:59:09,211 --> 00:59:11,475
The girl's going in.

1043
00:59:11,514 --> 00:59:14,176
I know I've seen her before.

1044
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:16,478
I'm going in.

1045
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:18,680
Fine, Delta 2. Got you on visual.

1046
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:22,555
It's heating up. What if
I take a discreet look?

1047
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:24,855
You don't do discreet.

1048
00:59:24,927 --> 00:59:27,259
We sit tight and wait for Scooby-Doo.

1049
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:31,258
Welcome!

1050
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:34,463
I'm opening an account
with Mr. Triboulet.

1051
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:37,668
I'll call him for you.

1052
00:59:44,213 --> 00:59:46,181
Go on, answer it.

1053
00:59:47,516 --> 00:59:50,883
- It's a client?
- Go down.

1054
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,785
I won't get in your way.

1055
00:59:52,822 --> 00:59:54,551
I'll be right down.

1056
00:59:54,623 --> 00:59:56,056
Right away.

1057
00:59:57,126 --> 01:00:00,459
Give me the keys.
I'll go instead of you.

1058
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:03,465
I only have the keys to empty boxes.

1059
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:07,560
I open accounts.

1060
01:00:07,603 --> 01:00:09,468
That's good. Me, too.

1061
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:17,570
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Countess. This way, please.

1062
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:24,177
- Open up.
- Yes, Mr. Triboulet.

1063
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:33,461
After you, Countess.

1064
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:50,274
Good job!

1065
01:00:51,313 --> 01:00:52,871
It's all yours, Countess.

1066
01:00:57,319 --> 01:00:59,685
Where'd you like to start?

1067
01:01:01,123 --> 01:01:01,851
That wall.

1068
01:01:01,924 --> 01:01:04,757
On that wall, we have No.
82. How's that suit you?

1069
01:01:05,728 --> 01:01:07,059
Perfectly.

1070
01:01:20,709 --> 01:01:22,267
Are they biting?

1071
01:01:22,311 --> 01:01:24,575
I'm tracking the alarm connections.

1072
01:01:24,613 --> 01:01:27,173
I have to deactivate them

1073
01:01:27,216 --> 01:01:29,184
or it'll go off in Security.

1074
01:01:29,218 --> 01:01:31,482
She blows me away.

1075
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:35,251
No kidding! How about
some food? I'm starving.

1076
01:01:35,324 --> 01:01:36,848
I'll go find something.

1077
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:48,061
What's Gibert up to? It's been an hour.

1078
01:01:48,104 --> 01:01:50,163
- I've spoilt you.
- That's true.

1079
01:01:50,506 --> 01:01:53,475
And an hour to open an account?

1080
01:01:53,509 --> 01:01:55,170
Or several accounts.

1081
01:01:56,512 --> 01:01:58,571
Here's the list of boxes.

1082
01:01:58,614 --> 01:02:01,481
It'll take a while. Grab a coffee.

1083
01:02:01,517 --> 01:02:02,984
A coffee?

1084
01:02:19,702 --> 01:02:23,160
The Free Belgian? Pretty classy.

1085
01:02:23,205 --> 01:02:25,264
At your Majesty's service.

1086
01:02:35,017 --> 01:02:36,484
First box open.

1087
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:38,680
Keep going, Delta 2.

1088
01:02:52,301 --> 01:02:53,268
What?

1089
01:02:53,302 --> 01:02:57,261
A guy in a suit gets into a
van at 9 a.m. Is that normal?

1090
01:02:57,306 --> 01:02:59,866
A Dutch guy getting back from a club.

1091
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:03,174
Loaded up with food,
when the van sells Fries?

1092
01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:05,180
Maybe his suck.

1093
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:06,977
Smart ass.

1094
01:03:07,016 --> 01:03:08,779
That's why I'm a cop.

1095
01:03:16,025 --> 01:03:18,550
Just five left. I need info.

1096
01:03:18,627 --> 01:03:20,458
OK, hold tight a second.

1097
01:03:26,001 --> 01:03:28,265
Number 107. Box 107.

1098
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:30,772
- 1-0-7.
- 10/4.

1099
01:03:38,814 --> 01:03:41,078
- A black notebook?
- Affirmative.

1100
01:03:45,921 --> 01:03:48,253
- You gave me a fright?
- How's it going?

1101
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:50,451
- Just five left.
- Let's move it!

1102
01:03:50,526 --> 01:03:52,050
Of course.

1103
01:03:55,598 --> 01:03:56,565
Are you done?

1104
01:03:56,599 --> 01:03:58,658
Getting there.

1105
01:03:58,701 --> 01:04:02,159
His head's smaller than yours,
boss. The wig keeps slipping.

1106
01:04:02,204 --> 01:04:04,468
Stop getting there and get him out.

1107
01:04:04,506 --> 01:04:05,564
Dumbhead!

1108
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:09,066
Stop getting there and
get your mustache on.

1109
01:04:09,111 --> 01:04:10,874
I got yelled at.

1110
01:04:10,913 --> 01:04:12,073
- Really?
- I'm true.

1111
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:14,582
Stopped for lunch?

1112
01:04:14,617 --> 01:04:16,175
Wouldn't surprise me.

1113
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:19,287
Look!

1114
01:04:20,723 --> 01:04:22,452
We're gonna lose him!

1115
01:04:22,524 --> 01:04:23,456
What?

1116
01:04:23,525 --> 01:04:26,756
He's leaving disguised as
an old man. Where are you?

1117
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:29,957
The driver's asking for directions.

1118
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:32,763
But people here run
away when they see a cop.

1119
01:04:32,801 --> 01:04:36,669
And the GPS is on the
fritz. It says "Maubeuge".

1120
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:40,475
- And now?
- Straight to the beach.

1121
01:04:40,509 --> 01:04:42,875
Watch the sea and count to 100,000.

1122
01:04:42,911 --> 01:04:44,572
- OK, fine.
- Seeya, sucker!

1123
01:04:44,613 --> 01:04:47,673
You're gonna miss
him. He's walking away.

1124
01:04:47,716 --> 01:04:49,581
- It's right there.
- Really?

1125
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,852
What's he wearing?

1126
01:05:02,998 --> 01:05:05,466
- What do we do?
- It's the wrong one.

1127
01:05:05,801 --> 01:05:07,166
I'm not him!

1128
01:05:07,202 --> 01:05:10,069
I'm not me, either. Take him in!

1129
01:05:10,105 --> 01:05:11,970
I swear I'm not!

1130
01:05:12,007 --> 01:05:14,271
- Emilien?
- Yes, chief?

1131
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:17,177
Meet me at the office.
I have your badge.

1132
01:05:17,212 --> 01:05:18,873
Thanks, chief.

1133
01:05:18,914 --> 01:05:20,279
Hear that? It's great news!

1134
01:05:20,716 --> 01:05:24,174
All thanks to you. How can I thank you?

1135
01:05:24,219 --> 01:05:25,584
This stinks.

1136
01:05:25,621 --> 01:05:28,249
No, he's sorry. He knows I'm a good cop.

1137
01:05:28,324 --> 01:05:30,258
Not that. The Belgian.

1138
01:05:30,326 --> 01:05:32,851
6 of them in 2 cars with bags.

1139
01:05:32,928 --> 01:05:34,953
And only two come out. On foot.

1140
01:05:34,997 --> 01:05:37,158
How'd you explain that one?

1141
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:40,466
Nope, that one's a toughie.

1142
01:05:40,502 --> 01:05:43,164
And the old guy's limp was different.

1143
01:05:43,205 --> 01:05:44,968
Yeah, I noticed that, too.

1144
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:48,568
He maybe fell down some
stairs. Old folks often do.

1145
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:50,475
It wasn't the same guy.

1146
01:05:51,513 --> 01:05:52,775
Really?

1147
01:05:52,815 --> 01:05:55,784
If that wasn't the Belgian, where is he?

1148
01:05:57,219 --> 01:05:59,483
Look!

1149
01:06:01,924 --> 01:06:03,448
What a balls-up!

1150
01:06:03,525 --> 01:06:06,551
I'll go a different way.
Meet you at the house.

1151
01:06:06,628 --> 01:06:09,153
No way! We're in this together.

1152
01:06:09,198 --> 01:06:12,656
Anyway, now I'm rich and single.

1153
01:06:12,701 --> 01:06:14,464
Sounds tempting.

1154
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:16,965
He won't let her go.

1155
01:06:17,005 --> 01:06:19,565
- We follow them?
- In your fries van?

1156
01:06:22,211 --> 01:06:23,576
What are you waiting for?

1157
01:06:23,612 --> 01:06:25,273
Giving them a start's more fun.

1158
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:28,681
This is no time for jokes. Let's go!

1159
01:06:43,098 --> 01:06:44,565
They're going slow!

1160
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,865
Makes a change to
admire the countryside.

1161
01:06:47,903 --> 01:06:49,666
They'll see us.

1162
01:06:49,705 --> 01:06:51,969
We're less obvious than the van.

1163
01:06:53,208 --> 01:06:54,766
Who are those guys?

1164
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:57,472
Monaco's caviar, not fries.

1165
01:06:57,513 --> 01:07:01,074
When he saw Belgian plates,
he thought he'd get a sale.

1166
01:07:01,116 --> 01:07:04,483
Cut out the jokes!
I'm in deep shit here.

1167
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,681
Why? You got your card back.

1168
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:10,556
You think so? Gibert'll find
out it's the wrong Belgian.

1169
01:07:11,727 --> 01:07:14,662
I'm Edouard Triboulet of
the Royal Bank of Belgium.

1170
01:07:14,696 --> 01:07:18,154
And I'm Hercule Poirot.
Where did we get to?

1171
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:20,168
No. 77, chief.

1172
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:22,261
That's
Seine-et-Marne.

1173
01:07:22,304 --> 01:07:25,068
A beautiful region, you'll see.

1174
01:07:25,808 --> 01:07:27,571
Worth a visit?

1175
01:07:27,609 --> 01:07:30,077
Let's try again. Full name?

1176
01:07:30,112 --> 01:07:33,479
I'm Edouard...

1177
01:07:33,515 --> 01:07:36,484
We're running out of regions, chief.

1178
01:07:36,518 --> 01:07:39,180
We can move onto my
encyclopedia in 22 volumes.

1179
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:41,246
I'm not so sure...

1180
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:45,453
I was thinking. He's Belgian,

1181
01:07:45,527 --> 01:07:48,553
so we could try another method.

1182
01:07:48,597 --> 01:07:51,464
- If you see what I mean?
- Good thinking!

1183
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:54,264
- Everybody out!
- No!

1184
01:07:54,303 --> 01:07:55,964
Please, don't leave me alone with him!

1185
01:07:56,004 --> 01:07:59,064
Please, stay!

1186
01:08:03,812 --> 01:08:05,871
So, you're Belgian?

1187
01:08:05,914 --> 01:08:07,973
Yes, from Brussels.

1188
01:08:13,021 --> 01:08:15,455
Jacques Brel? Wasn't he Belgian?

1189
01:08:15,524 --> 01:08:18,254
Yes, a great man. A hero.

1190
01:08:18,327 --> 01:08:20,158
Let's hear the hero.

1191
01:08:37,112 --> 01:08:39,171
Beautiful, isn't it?

1192
01:08:39,214 --> 01:08:42,274
- Wonderful.
- Even better like that!

1193
01:08:43,118 --> 01:08:44,881
Not that! Mercy!

1194
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:48,447
Stop!

1195
01:08:51,026 --> 01:08:53,460
Not that!

1196
01:08:53,529 --> 01:08:55,156
Full name?

1197
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:57,461
Help!

1198
01:08:57,499 --> 01:09:00,263
- Tough cookie!
- Regions are easier.

1199
01:09:04,006 --> 01:09:05,564
Shit!

1200
01:09:06,108 --> 01:09:08,474
The fryer's frazzled.

1201
01:09:12,514 --> 01:09:13,572
We're not going to the house?

1202
01:09:13,615 --> 01:09:15,776
We're worth more.

1203
01:09:15,817 --> 01:09:17,284
Call the Colombian.

1204
01:09:25,527 --> 01:09:27,051
The Belgian for you.

1205
01:09:27,095 --> 01:09:28,255
You're out?

1206
01:09:28,297 --> 01:09:31,460
I can send you down for years.

1207
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:33,468
Talk.

1208
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:35,561
Know the Royal Bank of Belgium?

1209
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:36,468
Go on!

1210
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:39,474
The notebook in your box is in my hands.

1211
01:09:40,909 --> 01:09:43,776
You drown in your fine pool?

1212
01:09:43,812 --> 01:09:46,076
- What do you want?
- Not much.

1213
01:09:46,114 --> 01:09:49,777
You have 10 minutes to get
on your yacht and go home.

1214
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:55,751
Bingo! I just bought
a shack you'll like.

1215
01:10:20,916 --> 01:10:22,281
I love it!

1216
01:10:22,317 --> 01:10:24,683
I came here once to see the Colombian

1217
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:27,086
and I fell in love with the place.

1218
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:32,751
He refused to sell.

1219
01:10:34,796 --> 01:10:36,764
C'mon, I'll show you paradise.

1220
01:10:42,104 --> 01:10:44,163
Check that out! Amazing!

1221
01:10:44,206 --> 01:10:45,673
Follow me.

1222
01:10:55,517 --> 01:10:57,985
What did I tell you? Paradise!

1223
01:11:10,499 --> 01:11:12,467
Fresh, natural produce, see?

1224
01:11:12,501 --> 01:11:15,766
Not like the flour you get in the city.

1225
01:11:16,505 --> 01:11:19,963
You turned me on in the bank,
popping open those boxes.

1226
01:11:20,008 --> 01:11:22,568
Eugene, isn't this a bit sudden?

1227
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:24,476
No time to lose, kid.

1228
01:11:24,513 --> 01:11:26,674
In our line of work, you gotta act fast.

1229
01:11:26,715 --> 01:11:30,481
Any moment, we could both
be dead. Make the most of it.

1230
01:11:30,519 --> 01:11:32,783
- You're right, Eugene...
- Call me Fenimore.

1231
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:37,053
Give me time to look my best for you.

1232
01:11:37,125 --> 01:11:39,650
Great idea!

1233
01:11:39,728 --> 01:11:42,060
We'll have a candlelit
dinner overlooking the sea.

1234
01:11:42,097 --> 01:11:43,758
That would be perfect.

1235
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:47,766
Be right back...

1236
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:49,668
Fenimore.

1237
01:11:54,009 --> 01:11:57,172
Delta 1, get me out
of here. The heat's on.

1238
01:11:57,212 --> 01:11:58,975
How soon can you be here?

1239
01:11:59,014 --> 01:12:00,174
Hold on.

1240
01:12:00,215 --> 01:12:02,080
How long will it take to repair?

1241
01:12:02,117 --> 01:12:05,280
Son, you're looking at 2-3 days.

1242
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:08,653
Delta 2, I'm sending reinforcements.

1243
01:12:12,627 --> 01:12:13,651
What are you doing?

1244
01:12:13,729 --> 01:12:15,253
Calling up reinforcements.

1245
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:20,864
We did it! The Belgian's confessed.

1246
01:12:20,902 --> 01:12:23,962
- He confessed?
- Everything.

1247
01:12:24,005 --> 01:12:25,973
We couldn't stop him.

1248
01:12:26,007 --> 01:12:27,975
We also took the opportunity
to close some other cases.

1249
01:12:28,009 --> 01:12:31,274
He's going down so
long, he'll never know.

1250
01:12:31,313 --> 01:12:32,678
That's not the right Belgian.

1251
01:12:32,714 --> 01:12:33,772
How come?

1252
01:12:33,815 --> 01:12:35,476
He was a decoy.

1253
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:36,779
The real one was still in the bank.

1254
01:12:36,818 --> 01:12:38,979
So where's the real Belgian now?

1255
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:42,456
I tailed him to the Colombian's
villa outside Cannes.

1256
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:45,755
Both of them together.
The arrest of the century!

1257
01:12:45,827 --> 01:12:48,455
Red alert!

1258
01:12:55,504 --> 01:12:56,869
You look sublime, darling.

1259
01:12:56,905 --> 01:12:59,465
And you... White suits you.

1260
01:12:59,508 --> 01:13:03,774
You think so? I like white.

1261
01:13:03,812 --> 01:13:05,973
I like white a lot,
but I prefer champagne.

1262
01:13:11,119 --> 01:13:13,087
- Gunshots?
- Just the one so far.

1263
01:13:13,121 --> 01:13:15,954
Believe me, a gunshot
never goes out alone.

1264
01:13:16,024 --> 01:13:16,854
What are you doing?

1265
01:13:16,925 --> 01:13:19,450
Setting up a forward position.

1266
01:13:19,528 --> 01:13:21,052
You play best at the back.

1267
01:13:21,096 --> 01:13:24,065
It's just to get an
idea of the topography.

1268
01:13:24,099 --> 01:13:26,761
Facilitate the special forces' entry.

1269
01:13:26,802 --> 01:13:28,565
Put that in your ear.

1270
01:13:28,603 --> 01:13:30,662
You'll know where I'm at.

1271
01:13:38,513 --> 01:13:40,481
This will end in pain.

1272
01:13:42,017 --> 01:13:43,678
To us!

1273
01:13:54,796 --> 01:13:58,755
I can't climb the wall,
but there's a post.

1274
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,060
And a branch leading straight in.

1275
01:14:02,103 --> 01:14:05,470
Amazing they didn't saw that off.

1276
01:14:05,507 --> 01:14:07,566
Shit! They did!

1277
01:14:10,612 --> 01:14:13,581
That's topography
brought to you by Emilien.

1278
01:14:13,615 --> 01:14:15,480
Let's dance.

1279
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,161
What a couple we make!

1280
01:14:34,202 --> 01:14:37,968
Fire and ice. My guile,
your professionalism.

1281
01:14:38,006 --> 01:14:40,474
Striking fear across the land.

1282
01:14:40,508 --> 01:14:44,672
I'd be your Clyde. You'd be my Bonnie.

1283
01:14:45,113 --> 01:14:46,171
Are we dancing or kissing?

1284
01:14:46,214 --> 01:14:47,875
A bit of both?

1285
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:50,476
Or I'll think you're a mole.

1286
01:14:57,125 --> 01:14:59,559
Did nobody teach you to knock?

1287
01:14:59,628 --> 01:15:03,462
Sorry, boss. Look what
fell out of the sky.

1288
01:15:03,498 --> 01:15:05,056
The little Marseille cop.

1289
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:07,967
Inspector. But you'll get me promotion.

1290
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:10,471
Hands up! You're under arrest.

1291
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:13,668
You got balls, coming
here with your pop gun,

1292
01:15:13,708 --> 01:15:17,667
to arrest public enemy No.
1 the Flanders Strangler,

1293
01:15:17,712 --> 01:15:20,579
the Benelux Terror.

1294
01:15:21,716 --> 01:15:23,581
The house is surrounded!

1295
01:15:23,618 --> 01:15:24,175
Sure it is.

1296
01:15:24,219 --> 01:15:26,983
Reinforcements! An Armada!

1297
01:15:27,022 --> 01:15:28,853
Helicopters circling overhead!

1298
01:15:28,924 --> 01:15:32,155
Any minute now!

1299
01:15:32,928 --> 01:15:36,455
- Fine, we'll wait for them...
- You must be out of your mind!

1300
01:15:36,498 --> 01:15:38,864
and prepare a reception.

1301
01:15:41,503 --> 01:15:43,767
You will pay for your impudence!

1302
01:15:43,805 --> 01:15:44,669
I want him!

1303
01:15:44,706 --> 01:15:46,765
I love tussling with a cop.

1304
01:15:46,808 --> 01:15:48,070
I was on a roll.

1305
01:15:48,109 --> 01:15:51,078
He can be my engagement
gift, my pink flamingo.

1306
01:15:51,112 --> 01:15:54,673
No gift could give me greater happiness.

1307
01:15:55,617 --> 01:15:57,482
- Listen, miss!
- I'm married!

1308
01:15:57,519 --> 01:15:59,180
I've never hit a woman.

1309
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:01,848
You should know, I did 8
years of judo. Japanese winger.

1310
01:16:06,227 --> 01:16:08,058
Great!

1311
01:16:09,597 --> 01:16:12,964
If you insist, but I fight fair.

1312
01:16:13,001 --> 01:16:15,162
Keep your eyes open, then!

1313
01:16:15,203 --> 01:16:17,068
Don't worry about me!

1314
01:16:17,105 --> 01:16:19,471
I am worried about you!

1315
01:16:21,509 --> 01:16:23,272
Do I know you?

1316
01:16:23,311 --> 01:16:24,972
Think hard!

1317
01:16:26,815 --> 01:16:29,477
I don't know what it's called, but ouch!

1318
01:16:29,517 --> 01:16:32,577
Hurry, guys, before the
topographer's topped.

1319
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:38,051
You like my fiancée?

1320
01:16:38,126 --> 01:16:39,855
Not my type.

1321
01:16:41,696 --> 01:16:44,256
Maybe if I was blonde.

1322
01:16:44,899 --> 01:16:45,558
Petra?

1323
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:46,862
I knew I knew her.

1324
01:16:46,901 --> 01:16:49,062
About time.

1325
01:16:51,506 --> 01:16:54,475
Here comes Gibert and his big band!

1326
01:16:56,111 --> 01:16:58,773
Maybe if I try the gate...

1327
01:16:58,813 --> 01:17:01,475
Ring the bell while you're at it!

1328
01:17:01,516 --> 01:17:04,076
Surprise is the key ingredient here.

1329
01:17:04,119 --> 01:17:07,953
Our ingenious catapult system
helps us hop over the wall.

1330
01:17:09,524 --> 01:17:11,651
The Swedish corkscrew.

1331
01:17:12,327 --> 01:17:14,659
Time to finish him off!

1332
01:17:14,696 --> 01:17:16,459
The death blow!

1333
01:17:16,498 --> 01:17:18,557
I have a knife. Take me hostage.

1334
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,158
Come again?

1335
01:17:20,201 --> 01:17:21,759
Turn me round and take me.

1336
01:17:21,803 --> 01:17:23,964
In front of everybody?

1337
01:17:24,005 --> 01:17:25,666
Take me hostage.

1338
01:17:25,707 --> 01:17:27,265
All right.

1339
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:30,068
He's got a knife!

1340
01:17:30,111 --> 01:17:31,169
Where'd he get that?

1341
01:17:31,212 --> 01:17:32,873
I searched him personally.

1342
01:17:32,914 --> 01:17:34,472
Nobody move or she gets it!

1343
01:17:34,516 --> 01:17:35,574
Nobody move.

1344
01:17:35,617 --> 01:17:37,881
Don't worry, I'll handle this.

1345
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:39,477
OK, cop,

1346
01:17:39,521 --> 01:17:41,751
tell me what you want
and you'll have it.

1347
01:17:43,725 --> 01:17:47,058
Sure this is a good
idea? With no warm-up?

1348
01:17:47,495 --> 01:17:49,656
I am warm. I'm sizzling.

1349
01:17:49,697 --> 01:17:54,464
You're talking to a finalist,
Saumur Trampoline Championship, 1971.

1350
01:17:54,502 --> 01:17:56,265
That was long ago!

1351
01:17:56,304 --> 01:17:58,772
It's like riding a
bike. You never forget.

1352
01:17:58,807 --> 01:18:00,468
Crank it up!

1353
01:18:13,521 --> 01:18:14,749
Betrayed by technology!

1354
01:18:14,823 --> 01:18:16,757
Check out what's wrong.

1355
01:18:16,825 --> 01:18:18,452
Right away, chief.

1356
01:18:21,796 --> 01:18:23,161
What number are you?

1357
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:24,756
How do I know!

1358
01:18:24,799 --> 01:18:28,462
I'm last in line.

1359
01:18:29,104 --> 01:18:31,265
The fuse must have blown.

1360
01:18:31,306 --> 01:18:33,968
Trying to lift fatso.

1361
01:18:34,008 --> 01:18:35,566
Got it, chief!

1362
01:19:03,605 --> 01:19:04,572
We have visitors.

1363
01:19:04,606 --> 01:19:06,665
What do we do?

1364
01:19:07,509 --> 01:19:09,067
We go to war!

1365
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:17,782
Wanna play do ya?

1366
01:19:17,819 --> 01:19:20,447
Wanna roast me? So, come and get me!

1367
01:19:30,298 --> 01:19:32,562
Glad I stayed in the cab.

1368
01:19:37,906 --> 01:19:40,466
I'm No. 1 here! Got that?

1369
01:19:40,508 --> 01:19:42,271
Not just in Belgium. The
world's public enemy No. 1!

1370
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:44,972
A few gendarmes don't scare me!

1371
01:20:06,701 --> 01:20:08,760
I'll blow you up a storm. Just watch.

1372
01:20:10,605 --> 01:20:13,665
The gendarme counter-attacks!
You're bustin' my balls!

1373
01:20:15,109 --> 01:20:16,667
And this gendarme...

1374
01:20:17,512 --> 01:20:20,072
is gonna clean up this town

1375
01:20:20,114 --> 01:20:22,173
double-quick!

1376
01:20:40,501 --> 01:20:41,866
Daniel, help!

1377
01:20:41,903 --> 01:20:43,768
Ain't that a surprise.

1378
01:20:47,008 --> 01:20:49,670
Who's the No. 1 now?

1379
01:21:01,723 --> 01:21:05,056
That's dangerous. Time
for some serious weaponry.

1380
01:21:05,727 --> 01:21:07,456
- He's crazy!
- What's he doing?

1381
01:21:07,495 --> 01:21:09,759
Look what I found!

1382
01:21:10,898 --> 01:21:12,957
I only ever saw this in photos.

1383
01:21:13,001 --> 01:21:13,865
Switch on.

1384
01:21:13,901 --> 01:21:16,062
He needs locking up!

1385
01:21:16,604 --> 01:21:20,062
I'm gonna waste those scumbags.

1386
01:21:43,298 --> 01:21:44,856
Help!

1387
01:22:08,623 --> 01:22:11,251
It's better in yellow.

1388
01:22:17,598 --> 01:22:19,065
My love!

1389
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:22,467
To think I didn't recognize
you. I nearly hit you.

1390
01:22:22,503 --> 01:22:25,768
Don't worry, I'd have fought back.

1391
01:22:30,812 --> 01:22:33,076
Get a room, will you?

1392
01:22:41,923 --> 01:22:44,858
You're driving me to distraction.

1393
01:22:44,926 --> 01:22:47,952
I know. You're not the only one.

1394
01:22:51,699 --> 01:22:54,463
Take me to your leader.

1395
01:22:54,502 --> 01:22:55,969
Excuse me.

1396
01:22:56,604 --> 01:22:58,265
Hi, nice meet to you.

1397
01:22:59,607 --> 01:23:01,871
- Can I ask your rank?
- Commander.

1398
01:23:01,909 --> 01:23:02,876
Is that all?

1399
01:23:02,910 --> 01:23:05,879
You look like General material to me.

1400
01:23:05,913 --> 01:23:08,882
Somebody upstairs doesn't like you.

1401
01:23:08,916 --> 01:23:10,577
Leave it to me.

1402
01:23:10,618 --> 01:23:14,054
I know the top brass.

1403
01:23:14,122 --> 01:23:17,057
I give them a lot of business,
so they owe me favor or two.

1404
01:23:17,125 --> 01:23:19,150
Let's talk it over in my car.

1405
01:23:19,227 --> 01:23:21,161
With pleasure.

1406
01:23:21,295 --> 01:23:22,956
Take him away!

1407
01:23:22,997 --> 01:23:26,262
You're making a mistake!
You'll pay for this!

1408
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:29,463
Let go of me!

1409
01:23:35,810 --> 01:23:38,176
You steered us through a minefield.

1410
01:23:38,212 --> 01:23:39,474
Thanks,

1411
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:42,176
but Emilien did all
the work. I just drove.

1412
01:23:42,216 --> 01:23:44,980
Actually, the meter's
still ticking over.

1413
01:23:45,019 --> 01:23:47,852
I don't get it. You
knew he planned a heist?

1414
01:23:47,922 --> 01:23:52,052
Yes, and legally we
can't go near those boxes,

1415
01:23:52,126 --> 01:23:55,061
so we let him do it for us.

1416
01:23:55,096 --> 01:23:57,656
Seeing as he's going down anyway.

1417
01:23:57,698 --> 01:23:59,165
Exactly.

1418
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:01,168
How did you know he'd escape?

1419
01:24:01,202 --> 01:24:04,660
The odds seemed pretty good.

1420
01:24:04,705 --> 01:24:06,263
Oh, yeah?

1421
01:24:07,008 --> 01:24:09,670
So I helped make the
operation a success?

1422
01:24:09,710 --> 01:24:11,974
You were just perfect.

1423
01:24:17,518 --> 01:24:19,782
Any news of Gibert?

1424
01:24:19,821 --> 01:24:23,052
We gave him a bottle of
downers and he just laughed.

1425
01:24:23,124 --> 01:24:27,254
C'mon, lads! We'll mash 'em!

1426
01:24:29,297 --> 01:24:30,958
Nice and easy, take them to pieces!

1427
01:24:30,998 --> 01:24:32,863
He's still flying, huh?

1428
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:35,061
We've tried everything.

1429
01:24:35,102 --> 01:24:38,071
He's down to run a
marathon. It won't be enough.

1430
01:24:38,105 --> 01:24:41,973
Footwork! Shoot!

1431
01:24:42,009 --> 01:24:44,273
Where'd they get these no-hopers?

1432
01:24:44,312 --> 01:24:47,179
Look at you! It's The
March of the Penguins!

1433
01:24:51,519 --> 01:24:54,147
Shoot!

1434
01:24:56,924 --> 01:25:01,054
This isn't a knitting
circle! Give the ball hell!

1435
01:25:01,095 --> 01:25:02,858
Look!

1436
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:14,771
That's not hard, is it?

1437
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:18,579
Bring it under control and...

1438
01:25:18,613 --> 01:25:22,481
Round and Round! Now, overhead kick!

1439
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:28,455
Goal in! Goal In!
