1
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,249
Looking for something?

2
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:58,256
Yes, a grave.

3
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:02,556
No one's had time to die here yet.
You can see there is no graveyard.

4
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:04,892
This was a long time ago.

5
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:07,831
Actually, not such a long time.
Nearly three years.

6
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:10,494
I buried a friend here.
A friend.

7
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:15,835
Huge trees stood here.
A cedar and a fir tree.

8
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:18,843
Remember them?

9
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:21,573
Probably chopped down
when the settlement was built.

10
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:25,883
Could it be those?

11
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:10,492
Dersu!

12
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:56,032
In the islands, the hunter

13
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:59,771
Roams all day long

14
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,178
But no luck for him

15
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:07,219
And he curses himseIf

16
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,778
What's he going to do

17
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:17,989
How is he to serve

18
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:22,727
He cannot be cheerful

19
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:27,534
So what
He'll try to aim better

20
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:32,475
So the hunter goes

21
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:35,514
To warmer waters

22
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:39,051
Where the fish were frolicking

23
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:42,679
In the beautiful weather

24
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:47,123
There on the shore

25
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,189
That year...

26
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:55,165
my assignment was
to go to the Shkotovo area...

27
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:57,236
in the Ussurii region...

28
00:03:57,337 --> 00:04:00,864
to make a topographic survey.

29
00:04:54,594 --> 00:05:00,191
Sometimes mountains and forests
look cheerful and attractive.

30
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:06,296
At other times,
they seem sullen and wild.

31
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,600
This isn't just my own feeling.

32
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:16,013
All the men in the unit
share this feeling.

33
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:22,648
With God's help,
we will spend the night here.

34
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:26,020
And tomorrow,
we'll find a more cheerful place.

35
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,025
Very well.
We'll halt here for the night.

36
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:30,027
Yes, we'll stay here for the night.

37
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:42,424
That valley reminded me...

38
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,469
of Walpurgis Night...

39
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:50,266
a place where witches
would gather for their Sabbath.

40
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:47,499
What's that?

41
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,158
A falling rock.

42
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,196
Is someone coming down?

43
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,938
It's a bear!

44
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:15,218
Please to not shoot!
Me are people!

45
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,955
Hello, Captain.

46
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:59,367
Look. A man.

47
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:03,041
You said it was a bear.

48
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,801
Won't you join us?

49
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,246
Thanks.

50
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,849
I am very hungry.

51
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,886
Nothing to eat today.

52
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,658
Who are you?

53
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:33,593
A Chinese?

54
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,697
A Korean?

55
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,702
No. Me is Goldi.

56
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,305
A hunter?

57
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:51,305
Me hunt all the time.

58
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,282
No other job.

59
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,714
Where do you live?

60
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,757
Not have home.

61
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:08,528
Build a shack and sleep,
and living like in a home.

62
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:15,633
No luck today?

63
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:21,036
Today shoot at stag.

64
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:22,842
Me not hurt him much.

65
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:25,041
Stag run away.

66
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:27,085
Me follow after it.

67
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,381
Me see people tracks.

68
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:33,754
Me go slow.
Me think:

69
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,987
''What kind of people
so far in the hills?''

70
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:39,792
Me look close.

71
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:43,665
See Captain, soldiers.

72
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:46,636
So me come here quick.

73
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:50,339
Why did you miss the stag
if you're such a good hunter?

74
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:55,078
You never miss?

75
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:58,514
We're soldiers.
We're not supposed to miss.

76
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:04,021
You great hunter, shoot all beasts...

77
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,057
we don't have anything to eat.

78
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:33,009
Hey, you!
Enough babble!

79
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:39,385
Well, well.

80
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:57,374
Here. Now you can babble.

81
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,892
My name is Arseniev.
What's yours?

82
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:16,552
Dersu Uzala.

83
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:21,457
How old are you?

84
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,110
I don't know well.

85
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,115
Me live a long, long time.

86
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,175
Do you have a family?

87
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:47,789
They all die long ago.

88
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,803
Before, I had a wife...

89
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,838
son and girl.

90
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,376
The smallpox finish all people.

91
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:11,607
Now me left alone.

92
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,333
Look, Dersu.

93
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:37,572
We are surveying this area--

94
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:40,372
the ranges, passes and rivers.

95
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:44,042
Will you be our guide?

96
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,361
Necessary me think.

97
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,097
Stop it.

98
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,100
Well, think it over.

99
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,907
Now, let's go to sleep.

100
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:29,886
The next day,
without saying a word...

101
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:33,123
Dersu took his place
at the head of our squad.

102
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,741
There is a road here.

103
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,055
- A road!
- Come here! There's a road!

104
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,995
What's there?

105
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:10,967
This road two, three days before,
one people come.

106
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,231
Then rain come.

107
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:15,603
These people Chinese.

108
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,801
Where did you get that?

109
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,970
How you not understand?
Look well!

110
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,312
He wear Chinese boots.
Water in his tracks.

111
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:32,152
You the same as children.

112
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:34,157
Eyes not see.

113
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:37,194
You live in the forest, die soon.

114
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:47,402
Chinese!

115
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,133
Let's go!
Let's go!

116
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:15,731
Soon we find shack.

117
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,734
How do you know?

118
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,663
Look!

119
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,105
Strip bark.
Make roof.

120
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:45,662
The rain-soaked ashes...

121
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,971
the bed of grass...

122
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:00,610
and a discarded piece
of Chinese fabric...

123
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:03,647
all confirmed Dersu's words.

124
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:07,412
Obviously, a Chinese spent the night
a couple of days ago.

125
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,025
Did you see that?

126
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,248
Yegor!

127
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:43,903
Captain.
Rice, salt, matches, give some.

128
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,636
What do you need it for?

129
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:50,647
Rice, salt, matches.
Wrap in birch bark, put in shack.

130
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,081
You plan to return?

131
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,085
Why return?

132
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:58,156
Other people come.

133
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,851
Find dry wood.

134
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,984
Find food. Not die.

135
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:11,533
Olentiev!

136
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:16,199
Bring matches, rice and salt.

137
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,037
At your command.

138
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:39,359
This Goldi filled me
with admiration.

139
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,134
He had amazing insight...

140
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:47,103
acquired during his long life
in the forest.

141
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:52,440
Besides, he had a beautiful soul.

142
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,340
He provided for the needs
of a person he didn't know...

143
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:01,749
and probably wouldn't ever see.

144
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:29,270
Dersu, let's wait
until the rain stops.

145
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:31,281
Time to get ready.

146
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:35,815
Listen good.
Birds are starting to sing.

147
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:39,021
Rain soon stop.

148
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,399
Sun is coming out.

149
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:53,630
Dersu, do you know what the sun is?

150
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:55,639
Everyone knows the sun.

151
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:01,079
Could be that
you've never seen the sun?

152
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:03,409
Look, there it is.

153
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,274
Captain.

154
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:37,507
Sun is the most important men.

155
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:40,551
This men die, all die.

156
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:47,558
And this is another important men.

157
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,919
This is bad men. Shout.

158
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:18,955
If one listens to you,
everything around are men.

159
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:24,122
Look. All is men.
Water alive.

160
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,129
Well, you said it.

161
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:31,559
Is fire alive too?

162
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,230
Yes, fire is still men.

163
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:40,372
Fire angry,
forest burn for many days.

164
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:45,107
Fire get angry, frightful.

165
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,310
Water get angry, frightful.

166
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:49,580
Wind get angry, frightful.

167
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:53,488
Fire, water, wind.
Three mighty men.

168
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,941
The first snow fell that day.

169
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:31,823
- Why shoot?
-Just for fun.

170
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:34,262
- Step back, Dersu.
- Waste bullets, bad.

171
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,096
What waste? We're soldiers.
We're practicing.

172
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:44,268
- Screw it!
- Seryoga drank too much.

173
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,571
Let me try. Taras!

174
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,787
What a shot!

175
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,728
Go!

176
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:26,808
What the hell?

177
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,512
It's harder than
bringing down a flying bird.

178
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:31,816
Good shooter not miss.

179
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,721
Go ahead, old man.
Try it yourself.

180
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:39,058
Why shoot and smash? Why break?
Where in forest you find bottle?

181
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,564
Are you trying to
worm your way out of it?

182
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:42,997
Just admit you won't hit it.

183
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:46,537
Me not shoot at bottle.
Me shoot at rope.

184
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:48,435
Bottle fall down,
you give me bottle.

185
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,201
Hit the rope?
Go ahead.

186
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:53,209
It's yours if you hit the rope,
and I will fill it with vodka.

187
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:55,245
Go, Marchenko!

188
00:26:58,183 --> 00:26:59,741
Go!

189
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:17,295
What a man!

190
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:19,666
He certainly put one over
on you, Olentiev!

191
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:23,032
Get ready to set out, men.

192
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:30,946
Go, go!

193
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:35,543
Once again, once again!

194
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:49,023
You won!

195
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:07,951
- Where is Dersu?
- God knows.

196
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:10,783
He suddenly decided to take
his portion of vodka and went off.

197
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:13,084
- He's sitting by the river.
- What's he doing?

198
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:16,058
Sitting by the fire and singing.
Probably drunk.

199
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:23,533
Let me tie it.

200
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:48,641
May I sit with you
for a while, Dersu?

201
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:11,459
Captain.

202
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:18,040
Over there my wife and kids die.

203
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:19,439
Smallpox.

204
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:25,877
Everyone afraid of smallpox.

205
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:31,081
Wife, kids, house,
all together burn.

206
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:45,766
Last night bad dream had.

207
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:52,607
Yurt will be soon fall down.

208
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:57,245
Wife, kids in this yurt...

209
00:31:57,348 --> 00:32:00,010
all get freezing.

210
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:02,518
No eat.

211
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:06,989
So me come here,
give them everything.

212
00:32:57,041 --> 00:33:00,067
Yesterday, an old men walked along.

213
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:02,112
This men didn't sleep the night.

214
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:08,147
- How do you know?
- No sign at camp fire that he sleep.

215
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:11,145
How do you know he's old?

216
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:13,780
Young man always walk on his toes.

217
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:17,088
Old man always walk on his heels.

218
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:31,241
Imet that old Chinese
a fewdays later.

219
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:20,650
His name is Li Tsung-ping.

220
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:23,158
He is 64.

221
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:25,729
He come from Tientsin.

222
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,131
How did he land here?

223
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:39,541
Was a woman.
His brother took her.

224
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:43,205
He went into the mountains.

225
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:45,214
For 40 years live alone.

226
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:53,247
Thank you.

227
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:04,852
It's cold already.

228
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,995
Maybe we should invite the old man
to come over to our fire.

229
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:18,509
Don't, Captain.

230
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:20,600
Don't disturb him.

231
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:34,889
Him now think very much.

232
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:41,964
He see house, he see garden...

233
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,368
all in blossom.

234
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:17,563
Captain! Captain!

235
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,073
Li Tsung-ping come say good-bye.

236
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:27,076
Him now go home.

237
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:17,183
The ultimate goal
of this expedition...

238
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:21,122
was to explore the area
around Lake Khanka.

239
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:27,488
We had to cross bigs wamps
and roadless tracts.

240
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:32,228
I sent most of the men
and horses to Chernigovka.

241
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:36,397
Dersu, Olentiev, Krushinovandl...

242
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:39,271
set out for the lake in a flatboat.

243
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:08,095
Olentiev, stay here and make camp.

244
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:12,335
Dersu and I will go on.

245
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:14,001
Unload.

246
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:54,717
Captain!

247
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:59,017
Us go back soon?
Me little scared.

248
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:03,219
Lake Khanka is not far.
We won't stay there long.

249
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:06,490
All right, Captain,
you see for yourself.

250
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:08,997
What is okay is okay.

251
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:35,784
Silence layover
the frozen reaches of the lake.

252
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:43,765
Some menace to humans
was lurking in this silence.

253
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:55,102
Captain!

254
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:58,045
Have to go back quick.

255
00:41:58,148 --> 00:42:00,173
The wind cover our tracks.

256
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:02,184
Yes, yes, let's go.

257
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:41,578
Never mind, Dersu.

258
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:45,121
Now we'll know where we came from.

259
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:52,085
From there!

260
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:57,424
Captain!
Us weren't here. Bad!

261
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:39,594
Captain! Us lose road!

262
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:42,460
Road there.
But how do we get there?

263
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:44,466
There is water all around.

264
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:02,210
Captain! Sun is low.

265
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,186
Soon night come.
Night come, we die.

266
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:08,156
If the camp is close by,
they'll hear us.

267
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,971
We'll have to spend
the night here, Dersu.

268
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:32,139
It's dangerous to go on.
What shall we do?

269
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:38,945
Captain! Listen.
Listen good.

270
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:44,954
Have to work fast.
Us not work good, us die.

271
00:47:45,062 --> 00:47:47,792
- What work?
- Cut grass.

272
00:49:07,044 --> 00:49:09,774
Captain! Work fast!

273
00:50:56,586 --> 00:50:58,747
Captain! Work fast!

274
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:50,890
Captain! Must hold grass!

275
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:37,342
Take rope!

276
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:53,686
Captain! Get up! Get up!

277
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:09,862
As the wind howled,
I sank into darkness.

278
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:13,875
I don't know how long I slept.

279
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:53,276
Hey, bear!

280
00:55:53,383 --> 00:55:57,046
Climb out of den!
Sun is up!

281
00:57:55,405 --> 00:57:58,431
Only then did I realize
what Dersu had done for me.

282
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:01,908
His witshad saved me.

283
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:13,650
Thank you, Dersu.
Thank you.

284
00:58:13,756 --> 00:58:15,656
What would I have done without you?

285
00:58:15,758 --> 00:58:18,989
Go together, work together.
No need thanks.

286
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,567
That's Olentiev!

287
00:59:09,078 --> 00:59:11,410
From that point on...

288
00:59:11,514 --> 00:59:13,414
our expedition became more difficult.

289
00:59:20,924 --> 00:59:22,824
Let's go! Go!

290
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:29,863
Severe frost.

291
00:59:29,966 --> 00:59:31,900
Exhaustion.

292
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:33,400
Hunger.

293
00:59:35,004 --> 00:59:40,271
Man is very small
before the face of nature.

294
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:21,570
Forward! Forward! Don't stop!

295
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,578
Forward!

296
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:37,391
Captain!
Me find smell of smoke.

297
01:01:39,729 --> 01:01:41,629
Udegheis are frying fish.

298
01:01:47,103 --> 01:01:49,003
Thank you.

299
01:02:48,464 --> 01:02:50,022
Captain.

300
01:02:52,869 --> 01:02:54,769
Where go tomorrow?

301
01:02:57,140 --> 01:03:01,133
We'll reach Chernigovka,
join our men there...

302
01:03:01,244 --> 01:03:04,145
and then take the train
to Vladivostok.

303
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:10,410
Come with me.
It's nice and comfortable in town.

304
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:18,385
No, thank you.

305
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:20,189
Me cannot.

306
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:23,697
What me work in town?

307
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,825
Hunting, no.

308
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:27,835
Sable chase, no.

309
01:03:33,209 --> 01:03:35,109
At least come to the station with me.

310
01:03:35,211 --> 01:03:39,272
I'll get food
and some money for you there.

311
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:43,611
Me food, money not need.

312
01:03:46,923 --> 01:03:49,016
Me now search sables.

313
01:03:50,193 --> 01:03:53,253
Sables same money.

314
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:26,927
What's the matter, Dersu?

315
01:04:29,432 --> 01:04:32,230
Me bad man.

316
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:49,017
Me want some cartridge.

317
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:54,455
Olentiev, give him
everything that's left.

318
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:00,561
Thank you, Captain.

319
01:05:13,442 --> 01:05:17,606
Me tomorrow go straight ahead.

320
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:22,079
Four suns go.

321
01:05:22,184 --> 01:05:24,618
Find Daubikhe...

322
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:27,416
then go Ulakhen...

323
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:30,919
then Fujin.

324
01:05:32,561 --> 01:05:34,688
Me heard...

325
01:05:34,797 --> 01:05:37,288
many, many sable there.

326
01:05:39,468 --> 01:05:41,368
Deer too.

327
01:06:29,685 --> 01:06:31,585
Me heard about it.

328
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:43,131
People around say.
Now me understand.

329
01:06:54,243 --> 01:06:56,803
Good-bye, military men.

330
01:07:03,953 --> 01:07:05,511
Farewell.

331
01:07:08,991 --> 01:07:12,392
Good-bye, Dersu.
Maybe we'll meet again.

332
01:07:16,298 --> 01:07:18,198
Good-bye, Captain.

333
01:07:20,336 --> 01:07:21,735
Well...

334
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:33,405
Maybe we'll meet again.

335
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:37,150
Good-bye.

336
01:07:56,105 --> 01:07:59,802
He's a fine man.
I never met anyone like him.

337
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:03,470
He's a rare man.
May God give him good health.

338
01:08:06,682 --> 01:08:10,812
In the islands, the hunter

339
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:16,180
Roams all day long

340
01:08:17,493 --> 01:08:21,259
But no luck for him

341
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:26,595
And he curses himseIf

342
01:08:26,702 --> 01:08:31,298
What's he going to do

343
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:35,810
How is he to serve

344
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:40,245
He cannot be cheerful

345
01:08:40,349 --> 01:08:44,843
So what
He'll try to aim better

346
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:48,082
So the hunter goes

347
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:51,159
To warmer waters

348
01:10:40,502 --> 01:10:41,799
That spring...

349
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:45,772
once again I set out to traveI
across the Ussurii area.

350
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:32,710
Go! Go!

351
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:55,601
Where are you going?

352
01:12:19,935 --> 01:12:21,664
To the left!

353
01:12:22,771 --> 01:12:26,332
Careful! Look after the horses!

354
01:14:00,169 --> 01:14:02,797
For three months, we have been
walking in the forest.

355
01:14:02,905 --> 01:14:06,272
Spring in the forest
quickly gave way to summer.

356
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:09,708
We've explored a large area.

357
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:14,875
But if we had Dersu,
we'd have accomplished more.

358
01:14:16,351 --> 01:14:19,252
All this time,
I was thinking with anticipation...

359
01:14:19,354 --> 01:14:22,687
that maybe I would meet him again.

360
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:24,691
Where are you, Dersu?

361
01:14:42,611 --> 01:14:46,980
Up the spring, go!

362
01:15:06,101 --> 01:15:08,160
Faster, guys.
Bring the water.

363
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:14,074
Andriucha!
Throw up more branches!

364
01:15:19,381 --> 01:15:21,281
What is taking so long?

365
01:15:22,384 --> 01:15:24,284
Faster, faster! Don't smile!

366
01:15:24,386 --> 01:15:26,786
And you said you would bring a boar!

367
01:15:39,735 --> 01:15:43,728
Vladimir Pavlovich.
I met a hunter two miles from here.

368
01:15:43,839 --> 01:15:47,832
He was asking about our unit--
who we are, who's the captain.

369
01:15:49,444 --> 01:15:50,706
Did you tell him?

370
01:15:50,812 --> 01:15:53,906
How could I, sir?
I know how to keep a military secret.

371
01:15:54,016 --> 01:15:56,883
Eh, Turtygin, Turtygin.
Did he remain there?

372
01:15:56,985 --> 01:16:01,012
No, sir. He started
to collect his backpack.

373
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:06,793
Vladimir Pavlovich!
Your rifle!

374
01:17:46,762 --> 01:17:50,220
- Hello, Captain!
- Hello, Dersu!

375
01:17:52,968 --> 01:17:54,868
You are my dear man.

376
01:18:01,043 --> 01:18:03,978
You haven't changed at all, Dersu.

377
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:06,980
Haven't changed.
Haven't grown older.

378
01:18:19,127 --> 01:18:27,398
You, my eagle with blue-black wings

379
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:37,678
Where have you been flying
for so long

380
01:18:51,126 --> 01:18:54,027
How have you been these years?

381
01:18:57,399 --> 01:18:59,458
Shot lots of sables?

382
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:01,126
Plenty.

383
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:03,864
- Get much money.
- Oh! That's good!

384
01:19:05,073 --> 01:19:08,668
Only all this money go.

385
01:19:08,777 --> 01:19:10,301
How come?

386
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:14,849
Rich trader me invite.
Much vodka.

387
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:17,418
Me give him money to keep for me.

388
01:19:17,519 --> 01:19:20,249
After that, his men no where.

389
01:19:20,355 --> 01:19:22,255
Why so?

390
01:19:22,357 --> 01:19:23,756
Me don't understand.

391
01:19:38,106 --> 01:19:47,310
You, my eagle with blue-black wings

392
01:19:48,483 --> 01:19:56,982
Where have you been flying
forso Iong

393
01:19:58,093 --> 01:20:07,661
I was flying there over the mountains

394
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:18,277
Where it all was silence

395
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:25,912
Next morning,
the forest was shrouded in thick fog.

396
01:20:27,422 --> 01:20:29,982
We were leading the way.

397
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:33,857
I was confident
because Dersu was now with me.

398
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:44,671
Dersu, what do you think?

399
01:20:44,773 --> 01:20:47,537
Will the weather clear up?

400
01:20:47,642 --> 01:20:49,667
Yes.

401
01:20:49,778 --> 01:20:53,771
Earth and hill all sweating now.

402
01:20:53,882 --> 01:20:55,782
Soon they'll get completely well.

403
01:20:56,952 --> 01:20:59,045
Why are they lagging behind?

404
01:20:59,154 --> 01:21:01,714
It's high time
they catch up with us.

405
01:21:01,823 --> 01:21:03,381
Let us wait.

406
01:21:08,597 --> 01:21:10,155
Me lost pipe.

407
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:16,269
Me think pipe be near.
Must go back.

408
01:21:19,641 --> 01:21:21,666
How I lose pipe?

409
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:25,572
Either got old...

410
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:28,342
or my head got bad.

411
01:21:59,948 --> 01:22:03,247
Look, Captain.
This is track tiger.

412
01:22:03,351 --> 01:22:05,342
Him behind us go.

413
01:22:05,453 --> 01:22:08,513
When us come here,
was not track on road.

414
01:22:08,623 --> 01:22:10,181
Him close here.

415
01:22:11,526 --> 01:22:14,017
When us stopped over there,
he was right here!

416
01:22:14,129 --> 01:22:17,758
Me go back, tiger run away.

417
01:22:34,716 --> 01:22:39,312
That is nothing, Captain.
Tiger never make big noise.

418
01:22:43,091 --> 01:22:46,151
Excuse us, Captain, for lingering.

419
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:48,559
Two horses got stuck in the bog.

420
01:22:48,663 --> 01:22:51,564
Is this your pipe, Dersu?

421
01:22:57,339 --> 01:23:00,240
- What is it with you?
- There's a tiger nearby.

422
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:05,138
Hey, guys, careful!

423
01:23:05,246 --> 01:23:06,645
A tiger's nearby!

424
01:23:07,749 --> 01:23:09,148
Calm down!

425
01:23:11,853 --> 01:23:13,753
Calm down, I say!

426
01:23:15,090 --> 01:23:16,990
Come on, come on!

427
01:23:35,210 --> 01:23:37,644
Again tiger go our track!

428
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:46,449
Why go behind?
What do you need, tiger?

429
01:23:46,554 --> 01:23:47,851
What do you want?

430
01:23:47,956 --> 01:23:52,518
Us go road, not bother you,
and you go behind!

431
01:23:52,627 --> 01:23:55,755
Is there not enough space
in forest, tiger?

432
01:24:29,330 --> 01:24:31,230
Let's go!

433
01:24:47,582 --> 01:24:49,482
Why have you halted?

434
01:24:53,221 --> 01:24:55,280
Looks like fallen trees there.

435
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:32,184
- Dersu, what's that?
- Ludiovo.

436
01:25:32,293 --> 01:25:34,022
Ludiovo? And what's that?

437
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:36,461
Animals go to river, drink water.

438
01:25:36,564 --> 01:25:40,056
Want to go round trunks and branches
and fall into pit.

439
01:25:40,168 --> 01:25:43,069
They catch animals, sell the skins.

440
01:25:46,374 --> 01:25:48,808
Detail several men to follow me.

441
01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:52,971
Belonozhkin, Zagourskii, Zakharov,
Bochkariov, follow me.

442
01:26:45,967 --> 01:26:47,366
Careful.

443
01:27:03,017 --> 01:27:04,416
Look here.

444
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:11,958
Look in the other pits.

445
01:27:27,575 --> 01:27:28,974
Go.

446
01:27:31,813 --> 01:27:36,216
Sir! A doe and two reindeer there.
Already dead.

447
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:42,882
Pasha, what do you have there?

448
01:27:42,991 --> 01:27:45,425
I found two pits.

449
01:27:45,526 --> 01:27:47,756
Only carrion in there.

450
01:27:49,897 --> 01:27:51,296
What about you, Andriucha?

451
01:27:51,399 --> 01:27:53,299
I fell in myself!

452
01:27:54,736 --> 01:27:57,671
Vasia! Vasia!

453
01:27:57,772 --> 01:28:01,674
- What's there?
- I found a whole flaying house!

454
01:28:03,411 --> 01:28:06,608
- Who did it?
- Bad Chinese did this.

455
01:28:06,714 --> 01:28:09,808
Why leave ludiovo, but not fill holes?

456
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:13,519
Bad to kill animals for nothing.

457
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:19,852
Bring axes and hoes here!

458
01:29:04,772 --> 01:29:06,171
What happened, Dersu?

459
01:29:06,274 --> 01:29:07,832
Hounhous! Chinese bandits!

460
01:29:11,946 --> 01:29:15,848
They make holes in my shirt,
and I make holes in theirs!

461
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:17,713
- How many are there?
- Eight.

462
01:29:17,819 --> 01:29:20,879
Turtygin, two remain here.
The rest ofyou follow me.

463
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:49,282
They got away, the vipers.

464
01:29:50,418 --> 01:29:53,581
Hounhous bad Chinese.
Bad.

465
01:29:53,688 --> 01:29:56,589
Steal money, fur.

466
01:29:56,691 --> 01:29:58,852
Steal wife, kill men.

467
01:30:10,838 --> 01:30:12,430
Sir, here.

468
01:30:34,328 --> 01:30:38,025
Hounhous steal three women.

469
01:30:38,132 --> 01:30:42,034
Me not understand
what they do with men.

470
01:30:50,578 --> 01:30:51,977
Turtygin!

471
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:32,745
Hey, guys, come here quick!

472
01:32:05,086 --> 01:32:08,647
Much mosquito, horsefly there.

473
01:32:08,756 --> 01:32:10,587
By night your face like this.

474
01:32:10,691 --> 01:32:12,158
Then much pain.

475
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:13,818
Then die.

476
01:32:13,928 --> 01:32:16,590
Good us found at daytime.

477
01:32:16,697 --> 01:32:19,257
Very, very good.

478
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:20,834
All alive.

479
01:32:20,935 --> 01:32:24,234
I'll kill those Hounhous!

480
01:32:25,339 --> 01:32:26,738
Hounhous!

481
01:32:34,515 --> 01:32:37,211
That Chang Pao, not Hounhous!

482
01:32:47,495 --> 01:32:50,123
My name's Chang Pao.
We fight Hounhous.

483
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:52,756
I'm Arseniev.
We're exploring this area.

484
01:32:52,867 --> 01:32:54,266
- Hello.
- Hello.

485
01:33:02,476 --> 01:33:05,502
They took the women with them,
as always.

486
01:33:05,613 --> 01:33:08,946
Hounhous go there.
Move, hurry!

487
01:33:09,050 --> 01:33:12,042
Dersu, calm down.
They won't get far away.

488
01:33:12,153 --> 01:33:14,212
Will you take care of these men?
 
489
01:33:16,724 --> 01:33:18,624
Detachment, fall in.

489
01:33:16,724 --> 01:33:18,624
Detachment, fall in.

490
01:33:31,906 --> 01:33:33,305
In those places
where they robbed and killed...

491
01:33:33,407 --> 01:33:35,671
people told us that the bandits
are not more than ten.

492
01:33:35,776 --> 01:33:37,266
We'll handle them ourselves.

493
01:33:37,378 --> 01:33:38,936
Well, good luck then.

494
01:33:39,046 --> 01:33:40,946
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

495
01:33:58,199 --> 01:34:01,430
Danger no.
Hounhous end.

496
01:34:06,173 --> 01:34:11,076
At first sight, this river
seemed quiet and peaceful.

497
01:34:12,546 --> 01:34:18,280
I sent some men with horses
to look for a place to ford it.

498
01:34:18,386 --> 01:34:22,948
I myself with the others
tried to cross the river on a raft.

499
01:34:32,166 --> 01:34:34,066
Stand here.

500
01:34:34,168 --> 01:34:35,567
Let me.

501
01:34:47,915 --> 01:34:49,314
Pull it!

502
01:35:02,830 --> 01:35:04,730
Give me the weapons.

503
01:35:27,855 --> 01:35:29,755
The pole! Where's the pole?

504
01:35:33,227 --> 01:35:35,627
The pole! Throw it!

505
01:35:38,032 --> 01:35:39,590
Come on! Do it!

506
01:35:42,570 --> 01:35:45,971
Go along the bank, men!

507
01:36:05,726 --> 01:36:08,524
Along the bank!
Run along the bank!

508
01:36:16,437 --> 01:36:18,428
Get ahead of us! Ahead!

509
01:36:22,476 --> 01:36:23,875
Run ahead!

510
01:36:25,479 --> 01:36:28,141
Jump, Captain, jump!

511
01:36:28,249 --> 01:36:29,682
Come on, come on!

512
01:38:09,617 --> 01:38:13,178
- If we only had a rope!
- We used all the rope for the raft!

513
01:38:16,290 --> 01:38:18,758
Cut down tree! Cut down!

514
01:38:22,663 --> 01:38:24,961
- This one?
- No!

515
01:38:28,102 --> 01:38:30,764
- This one?
- No!

516
01:38:35,643 --> 01:38:38,612
- This one?
- Uh-huh!

517
01:38:38,712 --> 01:38:40,270
Get the axes!

518
01:38:43,717 --> 01:38:46,481
Tie the tree! Quick!

519
01:38:46,587 --> 01:38:48,487
Tie the tree!

520
01:38:49,456 --> 01:38:50,855
Take off your belts!

521
01:38:56,163 --> 01:38:57,721
These will do too.

522
01:39:20,254 --> 01:39:22,154
- We'll need levers.
- Cut them!

523
01:39:47,915 --> 01:39:49,246
Hold on! Hold on!

524
01:39:50,351 --> 01:39:53,752
Come on, guys, faster, faster!

525
01:39:57,791 --> 01:39:59,349
How are you there?

526
01:40:34,795 --> 01:40:36,592
Hold it!

527
01:40:36,697 --> 01:40:38,824
Let it go little by little!

528
01:40:38,932 --> 01:40:40,092
Go, go, go!

529
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:43,169
Hold it! Let go!

530
01:41:12,966 --> 01:41:14,866
Dersu, give me your hand!

531
01:41:17,004 --> 01:41:18,403
Grab me!

532
01:41:31,185 --> 01:41:33,085
You were like a bear!

533
01:42:09,756 --> 01:42:12,657
Summer end, Captain.

534
01:42:12,759 --> 01:42:14,659
Autumn come.

535
01:42:17,364 --> 01:42:19,525
That's good.
A bit to the left.

536
01:42:19,633 --> 01:42:22,761
A bit to the left.
Good.

537
01:42:30,978 --> 01:42:32,377
Okay, get ready.

538
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:35,414
Attention.

539
01:42:35,516 --> 01:42:36,744
Hold it.

540
01:42:38,051 --> 01:42:39,279
Good.

541
01:42:40,387 --> 01:42:43,845
Turtygin, come here.
Now you take a picture of us.

542
01:42:54,801 --> 01:42:56,359
Press here, okay?

543
01:43:02,910 --> 01:43:06,311
My fondest memories of Dersu...

544
01:43:06,413 --> 01:43:10,782
are connected with
the beginning of that autumn.

545
01:44:16,617 --> 01:44:18,915
- What's wrong with that horse?
- Tiger.

546
01:44:48,115 --> 01:44:49,514
Listen, tiger!

547
01:44:50,917 --> 01:44:53,044
Soldiers fire rifle!

548
01:44:53,153 --> 01:44:55,951
You go away. Go away!

549
01:46:31,184 --> 01:46:32,674
What me do?

550
01:46:34,087 --> 01:46:35,486
Kill tiger.

551
01:46:37,891 --> 01:46:39,882
The tiger ran away.
He's unharmed.

552
01:46:39,993 --> 01:46:43,895
No, tiger always run until die.

553
01:46:45,565 --> 01:46:48,466
Now me much frightened.

554
01:46:49,569 --> 01:46:50,968
Don't be afraid, Dersu.

555
01:46:51,071 --> 01:46:53,301
A dead tiger can't harm you.

556
01:46:53,407 --> 01:46:55,307
Kanga will!

557
01:46:55,409 --> 01:46:57,309
He send another tiger!

558
01:46:59,346 --> 01:47:04,306
Kanga is a forest spirit
whom the Goldi worship.

559
01:47:05,952 --> 01:47:09,251
From that day Dersu changed.

560
01:47:09,356 --> 01:47:11,916
He became morose and irritabIe.

561
01:47:14,161 --> 01:47:15,719
What you do?

562
01:47:17,030 --> 01:47:19,931
That sign say no ginseng here.

563
01:47:25,605 --> 01:47:27,072
You break.

564
01:47:27,174 --> 01:47:30,405
People search for ginseng,
all for nothing.

565
01:47:33,246 --> 01:47:35,146
Bad man are you.

566
01:48:06,446 --> 01:48:10,348
So he just jumped in the river
in all his clothes. He was drunk.

567
01:48:12,152 --> 01:48:13,551
In all his clothes!

568
01:48:15,856 --> 01:48:18,120
And I had an adventure--

569
01:48:18,225 --> 01:48:20,625
Why throw meat into fire?

570
01:48:21,862 --> 01:48:24,296
Meat throw into fire, lose.

571
01:48:24,397 --> 01:48:27,594
Tomorrow we go,
other people here come...

572
01:48:27,701 --> 01:48:29,430
see meat, eat.

573
01:48:30,537 --> 01:48:31,970
Who would come here?

574
01:48:32,072 --> 01:48:34,199
How's that? Who come?

575
01:48:34,307 --> 01:48:37,242
Badger come, marten come.

576
01:48:37,344 --> 01:48:40,745
Crow come, mouse come.

577
01:48:40,847 --> 01:48:43,111
All kinds of men in forest.

578
01:49:58,291 --> 01:50:00,316
Good evening, Dersu.

579
01:50:00,427 --> 01:50:01,655
I say, salute!

580
01:50:39,366 --> 01:50:41,926
The Ussurii autumn is brief.

581
01:50:42,035 --> 01:50:44,765
Winter colds come fast.

582
01:50:44,871 --> 01:50:47,237
I started getting ready for winter...

583
01:50:47,340 --> 01:50:52,471
and sent some of the men
with all our horses to Olga Bay.

584
01:50:55,081 --> 01:50:57,777
Smells! Men here!

585
01:50:57,884 --> 01:50:59,784
- What men?
- Boars!

586
01:51:04,157 --> 01:51:05,715
I don't smell anything.

587
01:51:20,774 --> 01:51:23,675
- Dersu, why didn't you shoot?
- I not see.

588
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:29,180
Why not me see boar?

589
01:51:32,919 --> 01:51:37,481
My nose see better than eyes.

590
01:51:42,162 --> 01:51:45,222
I did not know then...

591
01:51:45,331 --> 01:51:48,732
that this small incident
wasa fore runner of tragic events.

592
01:51:52,505 --> 01:51:53,904
A stag!

593
01:51:57,177 --> 01:51:58,576
Where, Captain?

594
01:52:22,302 --> 01:52:23,701
Where?

595
01:52:27,841 --> 01:52:31,072
There, under the half-fallen tree.

596
01:52:52,298 --> 01:52:54,198
- Did I hit it?
- No.

597
01:52:55,935 --> 01:52:57,835
Didn't you see it?

598
01:54:18,518 --> 01:54:21,749
Everyone misses sometimes, Dersu.

599
01:54:22,856 --> 01:54:25,086
Why me not hit it?

600
01:56:19,238 --> 01:56:22,730
Captain! Before,
I always first see an animal!

601
01:56:22,842 --> 01:56:25,436
Shoot, always hit target.

602
01:56:25,545 --> 01:56:28,207
Now not hit.
Bad are my eyes.

603
01:56:28,314 --> 01:56:31,215
How I live in forest now?

604
01:57:15,862 --> 01:57:18,456
Come to Khabarovsk with me.

605
01:57:18,564 --> 01:57:20,464
My home is your home.

606
01:57:42,321 --> 01:57:45,222
New Year's Eve came.

607
01:58:04,410 --> 01:58:06,810
It was a strange night.

608
01:59:59,125 --> 02:00:02,185
The tiger come to kill me.

609
02:00:14,207 --> 02:00:16,232
Thank you, Captain!
Thank you!

610
02:00:16,342 --> 02:00:17,639
What happened, Dersu?

611
02:00:17,743 --> 02:00:21,770
Captain, you say your home my home.
Thank you, Captain!

612
02:00:21,881 --> 02:00:23,644
Will you come with me to my place?

613
02:00:23,749 --> 02:00:25,842
My eyes get bad.

614
02:00:25,952 --> 02:00:28,614
Kanga not want me to live in forest.

615
02:00:28,721 --> 02:00:30,279
He send the tiger.

616
02:00:46,906 --> 02:00:51,002
Probably what Dersu
called the tiger...
617
02:00:51,110 --> 02:00:54,375
was the specter of
his fear of the forest...

617
02:00:51,110 --> 02:00:54,375
was the specter of
his fear of the forest...

618
02:00:54,480 --> 02:00:58,974
conjured by the imagination...

619
02:00:59,085 --> 02:01:01,315
of a man grown old.

620
02:01:27,113 --> 02:01:30,605
Listen here.
Vova recorded Dersu.

621
02:01:30,716 --> 02:01:32,115
Well, well.

622
02:01:42,728 --> 02:01:46,755
The Captain go hills, work.

623
02:01:48,200 --> 02:01:49,997
Go back to city...

624
02:01:50,102 --> 02:01:54,129
sit at a table, write, work.

625
02:01:54,240 --> 02:01:57,869
Me no work in the city.

626
02:01:59,045 --> 02:02:01,172
Stare into fire.

627
02:02:01,280 --> 02:02:03,976
Look at hills far away.

628
02:02:04,083 --> 02:02:06,074
And that's it.

629
02:02:06,185 --> 02:02:07,618
It's true.

630
02:02:07,720 --> 02:02:10,154
He doesn't like the city.

631
02:02:10,256 --> 02:02:12,486
Never mind.
He'll get used to it.

632
02:02:14,593 --> 02:02:17,926
Vova, did Dersu hear it?

633
02:02:18,030 --> 02:02:19,759
Yes.

634
02:02:19,865 --> 02:02:23,767
- What did he say?
- He said, ''Right, not word miss.''

635
02:02:28,641 --> 02:02:30,734
Does he often talk to you
about the forest?

636
02:02:30,843 --> 02:02:33,311
Yes. Dersu is not
afraid of anything.

637
02:02:33,412 --> 02:02:36,904
Neither of wolves,
nor of boars, or of bears.

638
02:02:37,016 --> 02:02:39,917
Snow storms and floods
are nothing for him.

639
02:02:41,487 --> 02:02:44,012
You know, Dersu is Vova's hero.

640
02:02:44,123 --> 02:02:46,023
He is crazy about him.

641
02:02:47,560 --> 02:02:50,324
And I owed him my life
on several occasions.

642
02:02:50,429 --> 02:02:53,296
He never mentioned it.

643
02:02:53,399 --> 02:02:56,857
Well, he thinks it is quite
a regular thing to do.

644
02:02:56,969 --> 02:03:03,374
Most people like to boast
about such things and exaggerate.

645
02:03:58,364 --> 02:04:03,324
This men always with me
roam the forest...

646
02:04:03,436 --> 02:04:05,836
many, many years.

647
02:04:23,522 --> 02:04:27,686
This is a bear tooth...

648
02:04:33,199 --> 02:04:34,757
and claws.

649
02:04:40,806 --> 02:04:44,207
And these are claws of lynx.

650
02:04:47,546 --> 02:04:49,741
For you. Take.

651
02:04:49,849 --> 02:04:51,749
You give it to me?

652
02:04:51,851 --> 02:04:55,150
Yes, Little Captain.

653
02:04:55,254 --> 02:04:56,312
Really?

654
02:04:56,422 --> 02:04:59,255
I am so happy.
It will be my talisman.

655
02:04:59,358 --> 02:05:03,317
Don't you have tiger claws?
Didn't you hunt a tiger?

656
02:05:04,797 --> 02:05:07,197
I shoot at tiger but--

657
02:05:08,767 --> 02:05:12,703
It bad to kill tiger.

658
02:05:12,805 --> 02:05:14,966
Why?

659
02:05:15,074 --> 02:05:16,473
Very...

660
02:05:18,010 --> 02:05:19,477
very bad.

661
02:05:49,742 --> 02:05:51,972
Take this. Thank you.

662
02:05:54,713 --> 02:05:57,045
Why give money for water?

663
02:05:57,149 --> 02:05:59,049
Much water is in river.

664
02:06:01,287 --> 02:06:04,279
- Why you take money for water?
- What?

665
02:06:04,390 --> 02:06:06,290
You don't understand anything.

666
02:06:07,927 --> 02:06:11,021
You are bad man!

667
02:06:19,772 --> 02:06:22,673
- Where are you going?
- Shoot.

668
02:06:22,775 --> 02:06:26,438
Don't even think of it! It's not
allowed to shoot guns in a city.

669
02:06:26,545 --> 02:06:28,740
In barrel much dirt.

670
02:06:28,847 --> 02:06:31,645
Me shoot a bullet, clean barrel.

671
02:06:31,750 --> 02:06:34,514
Then wipe with cloth, shoot well.

672
02:06:34,620 --> 02:06:37,282
There are many people here.
It's dangerous.

673
02:06:37,389 --> 02:06:40,654
Me fire not people.
Me fire at air.

674
02:06:40,759 --> 02:06:44,160
All the same, you cannot.
The city isn't the same as the hills.

675
02:06:44,263 --> 02:06:45,662
Do you understand?

676
02:06:48,167 --> 02:06:49,566
Do you?

677
02:07:12,491 --> 02:07:14,891
Well, how are you, Dersu?

678
02:07:18,130 --> 02:07:22,157
Sit I here, just like duck.

679
02:07:23,769 --> 02:07:28,672
How can men sit in box?

680
02:07:29,975 --> 02:07:31,875
You are right.

681
02:07:31,977 --> 02:07:34,207
It isn't a very nice room.

682
02:07:45,157 --> 02:07:48,388
We'll have to change the wallpaper...

683
02:07:48,494 --> 02:07:50,758
make everything more cozy.

684
02:07:52,464 --> 02:07:57,026
Meanwhile,
what if you live in my study.

685
02:07:59,004 --> 02:08:01,302
Don't bother, Captain.

686
02:08:01,407 --> 02:08:04,808
I pitch tent outdoors.

687
02:08:06,111 --> 02:08:07,510
Sleep.

688
02:08:08,647 --> 02:08:10,376
I don't disturb anyone.

689
02:08:11,517 --> 02:08:13,917
See, Dersu...

690
02:08:14,019 --> 02:08:16,920
it's not allowed in a city.

691
02:08:18,457 --> 02:08:19,856
Why not?

692
02:08:21,026 --> 02:08:22,288
Bad!

693
02:08:23,462 --> 02:08:26,056
How should I explain?

694
02:08:26,165 --> 02:08:28,633
That's a rule.

695
02:08:28,734 --> 02:08:30,133
A rule.

696
02:08:32,771 --> 02:08:34,830
Shoot a gun I can't.

697
02:08:34,940 --> 02:08:36,840
Sleep outdoors I can't.

698
02:08:38,510 --> 02:08:41,411
I not get enough air at all.

699
02:09:02,367 --> 02:09:05,063
Pa, what happened?
Dersu's been arrested!

700
02:09:05,170 --> 02:09:07,001
The police just called.

701
02:09:07,106 --> 02:09:08,505
What is it again?

702
02:09:08,607 --> 02:09:12,065
You know, he saw me buying firewood
yesterday and grew very angry...

703
02:09:12,177 --> 02:09:15,078
and went to the city park
to chop down a tree.

704
02:11:10,696 --> 02:11:12,357
Please...

705
02:11:12,464 --> 02:11:15,126
let me go back to hills.

706
02:11:15,234 --> 02:11:18,362
Live in city I cannot.

707
02:11:20,305 --> 02:11:22,364
Where will you go?

708
02:11:22,474 --> 02:11:24,704
To the hills.

709
02:11:26,745 --> 02:11:28,144
Captain.

710
02:11:31,884 --> 02:11:33,283
Missus.

711
02:11:38,357 --> 02:11:40,257
Little Captain.

712
02:11:42,094 --> 02:11:44,358
All fine people.

713
02:11:44,463 --> 02:11:46,522
Me go-- bad!

714
02:11:48,100 --> 02:11:51,627
But I cannot live in a city.

715
02:12:53,799 --> 02:12:56,529
Here, take this rifle as a gift.

716
02:12:57,636 --> 02:12:59,536
New model.

717
02:13:00,706 --> 02:13:03,231
It's easy to aim.

718
02:13:04,609 --> 02:13:07,510
Even with bad eyesight
you won't miss.

719
02:13:09,014 --> 02:13:10,413
Here.

720
02:13:14,653 --> 02:13:16,553
Thank you, Captain.

721
02:13:26,965 --> 02:13:28,193
to Mr. Arseniev.

722
02:13:28,300 --> 02:13:30,234
Your visiting card
found on dead Goldi.

723
02:13:30,335 --> 02:13:32,326
Request your presence
to identify body.

724
02:13:32,437 --> 02:13:34,667
Police station
of KorfovskalIla Railway Station.''

725
02:14:35,734 --> 02:14:37,634
Mr. Arseniev?

726
02:15:03,361 --> 02:15:05,261
Did you know him?

727
02:15:07,099 --> 02:15:08,999
We were friends.

728
02:15:17,075 --> 02:15:18,975
And his name was...

729
02:15:20,212 --> 02:15:21,770
Dersu Uzala.

730
02:15:24,549 --> 02:15:25,948
His occupation?

731
02:15:28,420 --> 02:15:29,819
A hunter.

732
02:15:31,289 --> 02:15:33,189
How strange.

733
02:15:33,291 --> 02:15:35,350
He didn't have a rifle.

734
02:15:37,462 --> 02:15:39,362
There must have been.

735
02:15:39,464 --> 02:15:41,659
A rifle of the latest model.

736
02:15:41,766 --> 02:15:45,429
No, nothing was found...

737
02:15:45,537 --> 02:15:48,438
except your visiting card.

738
02:15:52,010 --> 02:15:54,274
It's clear now.

739
02:15:54,379 --> 02:15:59,282
The criminal wanted to get the rifle,
so he killed the man.

740
02:16:02,921 --> 02:16:04,388
Ready, sir.

741
02:16:04,489 --> 02:16:07,083
The ground's frozen.
It was hard digging the grave.

742
02:16:07,192 --> 02:16:08,591
Bury him.

743
02:16:34,719 --> 02:16:35,947
So...

744
02:16:37,088 --> 02:16:40,353
now I'll ask you to sign.

745
02:16:42,160 --> 02:16:43,559
Here.

746
02:17:08,386 --> 02:17:11,446
Beg your pardon.
I'm a busy man.

747
02:17:23,235 --> 02:17:24,634
Thank you.

748
02:17:26,905 --> 02:17:28,805
So...

749
02:17:28,907 --> 02:17:30,807
may I leave?

750
02:19:28,693 --> 02:19:30,593
Dersu.
