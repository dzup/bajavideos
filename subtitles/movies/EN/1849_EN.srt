1
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:04,837
To live... with the soul held

2
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:07,840
by a sweet memory
which always makes me cry.

3
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:10,843
From "Volver"
by Carlos Gardel and Alfredo Le Pera

4
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:28,861
El Chino's Bar
Buenos Aires, August 2001

5
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:31,857
Warming up your tools?
Making sure nothing breaks.

6
00:02:58,912 --> 00:02:59,913
- How are you, Abel?
- Good.

7
00:02:59,948 --> 00:03:01,813
Hey, Abelito!

8
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,818
Come in, Signora!

9
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:10,857
A beautiful woman like you
can never disturb us! Come in!

10
00:03:10,892 --> 00:03:12,825
How are you?

11
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,428
<i>Mama, I want a bridegroom</i>

12
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:28,830
<i>who dances the Tango,
who is manly and brave,</i>

13
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:31,837
<i>with his hat pulled over one eye,</i>

14
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,347
<i>and a braided cord on his trousers.</i>

15
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,351
<i>He shouldn't be stiff,</i>

16
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,889
<i>his portrait should be
like one on a medal.</i>

17
00:03:42,924 --> 00:03:45,857
<i>Mama, I want a bridegroom</i>

18
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:50,852
<i>who dances Tango,
who is manly and brave.</i>

19
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:56,903
I love my job
and I want to die singing.

20
00:03:56,938 --> 00:03:58,871
I hope it happens!

21
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:03,808
- Let's begin! - Alright.
- Let's go take our places

22
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:06,812
and start singing.

23
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:36,831
The Last Applause

24
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:44,383
Avery good evening to you!

25
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:46,886
Tonight will be a real treat!

26
00:04:46,921 --> 00:04:48,353
Good evening.

27
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:52,847
Thank you for letting us perform
here for you again

28
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:58,898
at "El Chino's Bar. " El Chino
is not Chinese, he's Argentinean.

29
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:01,834
But El Chino is sick,
so you won't be seeing him tonight.

30
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:06,839
He's in the hospital
and he's already doing better.

31
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:09,807
The worst is over.
Now he's watching us,

32
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:14,802
so I ask you for applause,
he is listening! Viva El Chino!

33
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:17,815
"El Chino's" is a unique place

34
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:21,809
because El Chino is unique
and this is his world.

35
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:25,824
Jorge "El Chino" García
December 1999

36
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:29,862
Here, there used to be,
just like in all of Buenos Aires,

37
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:31,829
a lot of fighting.

38
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:36,824
Punching, kicking, the whole works.
On the street, out back, everywhere.

39
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:42,875
You had to do it, too.
When you're young, you like to fight.

40
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,843
So you fought.

41
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:49,847
Did you record that? Good!

42
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:54,546
Where did that moron put the telephone?
It was here.

43
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:56,354
What a moron!

44
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:01,828
El Chino used to show off his room
like it was the palace of Versailles.

45
00:06:01,863 --> 00:06:03,796
This is the kitchen.

46
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:08,835
The grill is back there
and this is my pad,

47
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,803
my bachelor pad.

48
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:16,843
Wait. I'll get the light. Should I?
You have to move or I can't.

49
00:06:16,878 --> 00:06:19,811
He never denied his origins

50
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:23,850
nor the way he lived.
The dogs slept with him in his bed!

51
00:06:23,885 --> 00:06:26,819
They are my maternal grandparents,

52
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:31,813
my paternal grandparents,
and that is Sacristán.

53
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:36,818
Everyone who came in said, "Beautiful!"
Not even in the Wild West

54
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:41,868
- was there anything like "El Chino's. "
- That's my father. He looks like me.

55
00:06:41,903 --> 00:06:44,735
My mother and I on Mothers' Day.

56
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,738
<i>Afterwards...
What do I care about that?</i>

57
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:52,879
<i>All my life is a yesterday
that detains me in my past,</i>

58
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:55,847
<i>eternal, ancient youth</i>

59
00:06:55,882 --> 00:07:00,785
<i>that has left me afraid...</i>

60
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,789
This is the real thing
like it used to be.

61
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:08,783
There's no stage, no microphones.
Here, you gotta sing or you gotta sing.

62
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:15,790
<i>What did my hands do to her?</i>

63
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:20,317
<i>What have they done</i>

64
00:07:20,352 --> 00:07:23,798
<i>to leave such pain</i>

65
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:27,812
<i>in my breast?</i>

66
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:31,806
<i>Pain of an old grove...</i>

67
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:34,250
Tango isn't opera.

68
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:38,415
Tango is very difficult.
You have to feel it and express it.

69
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,122
And speak it in the right moment.

70
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:43,828
That is Tango.

71
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:48,823
<i>Orange tree in bloom...</i>

72
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:55,840
<i>First one has to know suffering,</i>

73
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:59,834
<i>then how to love,
then how to depart, and at the end...</i>

74
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:04,772
My name is Delfina Celia Muñoz.
I work here with my husband,

75
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,785
El Chino from the Pompeya quarter.

76
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:12,780
It is six months ago tomorrow,
no, today,

77
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,158
that my son died

78
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,195
of viral hepatitis.
Answer that!

79
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,803
He got acute hepatitis
and was taken from me.

80
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,307
But life goes on.

81
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,812
Excuse me, but...

82
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,819
<i>The perfume of orange blossoms,</i>

83
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:46,859
<i>like empty promises of love
that escape with the wind.</i>

84
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:47,825
<i>Afterwards...</i>

85
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,828
If you took me away from here,

86
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:55,129
from this bar, it would be
like shooting me, killing me.

87
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,835
It is my life.

88
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,807
If I had to leave here,
what could I do? I'm 70 years old.

89
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:05,766
<i>...like a bird without sight.</i>

90
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:24,796
Applause for Abel Frías!

91
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:33,596
<i>I get hit over the head
and I forget immediately.</i>

92
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,605
<i>I remain tame,
I remain slow, always the same.</i>

93
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:41,779
<i>I'm absolutely convinced
that everyone is good and noble.</i>

94
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:45,715
<i>But I keep getting hit over the head,
over and over again.</i>

95
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:50,515
<i>I don't know if I am too sensitive;
I don't know if I am too dumb.</i>

96
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:54,815
<i>Always ready, always inclined
to believe in others,</i>

97
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:58,830
<i>to trust my friends,</i>

98
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:02,834
<i>to believe in love,</i>

99
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:07,873
<i>and in colored fish
and in universal peace.</i>

100
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:11,877
<i>Such good faith God has given me!</i>

101
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:15,540
<i>And why? They tricked me.</i>

102
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:18,850
<i>I'm lonelier than a mailbox on a corner,</i>

103
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:23,388
<i>more squeezed than a sardine...</i>

104
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:26,659
I don't think they ever loved me

105
00:10:26,694 --> 00:10:29,895
the way I really needed it. No.

106
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,863
They never did.

107
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:34,866
This is my bedroom.

108
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:40,565
I can show you everything I own.
These are my treasures.

109
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:42,264
My mother...

110
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:44,569
Pretty, right?

111
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,970
This is my favorite singer, Gardel.

112
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:51,883
I hung his picture here for inspiration.

113
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:57,885
But my little altar is the most
important of all. I tell it everything.

114
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,221
My mother,

115
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,863
all of my family that is gone,
that's why I have them here.

116
00:11:03,898 --> 00:11:07,822
But what I like the most here
is my mother,

117
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,329
she's in this urn.

118
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:14,874
She is where she wanted to be. With me.

119
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:16,841
So I am not so alone.

120
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,844
<i>I don't know if I was loved...</i>

121
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,244
It's the truth!

122
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:27,853
I loved...
but I have no idea what happened.

123
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,152
I think I gave them too much slack.

124
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,552
Only me.

125
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:36,862
<i>Let's forget it.
I don't know if I was loved,</i>

126
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,521
<i>but when I was really in love,</i>

127
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:42,867
<i>I was cast away. Such meanness!</i>

128
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:46,861
I don't want to be
your "poor Cristina," no, no.

129
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:51,876
I cried, others did, too.
That's how it is.

130
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:55,915
<i>I'll never learn.
If they cheat on me, I won't lie.</i>

131
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,919
<i>Again and again,
they pretend love and friendship,</i>

132
00:11:59,954 --> 00:12:03,582
<i>I gave away all my love,</i>

133
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:07,825
<i>now my pockets are empty,</i>

134
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,864
<i>and I wear a tag:
"The stupidest in the country. "</i>

135
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:16,824
<i>Such good faith
God has given me and why?</i>

136
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,838
That is why I sing. Every song

137
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:24,832
reflects a part of life
and sometimes they give you...

138
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,311
hope.

139
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,848
<i>Tell me, what good</i>

140
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:35,843
<i>was the good faith
that God gave me?</i>

141
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,865
Buona sera, if you are Italian.

142
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,870
Buona sera.

143
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:56,864
I speak Italian
because it's my mother tongue.

144
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,847
Now I can't say "help me, Mama"
any longer. So I sing Italian songs

145
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:04,714
because it's my only way
of coping with the responsibility

146
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,817
of having to sing in a place

147
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:09,412
where everyone sings Tango.
But everyone sings

148
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:13,814
Tangos written by the descendents
of Italian immigrants.

149
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:19,820
I think that is the reason.
If it's not, tell me.

150
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:34,846
The last lights of my village,
as I was leaving my land

151
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:39,840
are a pain that never left me.

152
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:45,856
<i>I got up this morning,</i>

153
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:50,896
<i>Oh bella, ciao, ciao, ciao...</i>

154
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:55,866
<i>I got up this morning</i>

155
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:59,633
<i>and I found the invader.</i>

156
00:13:59,668 --> 00:14:03,365
Being uprooted is unnatural.

157
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,845
It's not natural
to leave your fatherland.

158
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,813
Nothing can justify it.

159
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:13,615
Nothing. It is a pain that never
goes away because it isn't natural.

160
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:17,812
<i>And this is the flower of the Partisan</i>

161
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:23,818
<i>who died for liberty.</i>

162
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,837
Tangos often talk about absences.

163
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:37,502
No Tangos
were written by immigrants themselves.

164
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:42,847
But by their children
and grandchildren born here.

165
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,750
But that 'uprootedness'
can still be felt in their music,

166
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,853
that means it is inherited.

167
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,892
Would you like to see where I sleep?
This is my bedroom.

168
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:56,851
But don't film the dirt and the mess!

169
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,990
Try not to.

170
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:05,429
Here I sleep and here I dream
with my eyes closed, or open.

171
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:10,798
See? My wife
and my children a few years ago.

172
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:18,816
This is my wife.
I thank her every day.

173
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:22,810
Every evening I thank her
for making me a widower.

174
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,824
Sometimes a woman will say to me,

175
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:29,418
"Disgraceful!
How can you thank her for that?"

176
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:32,831
Because I learned a lot. A lot.

177
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:42,875
He lives in Puente Alsina,
but he's not carrying a knife,

178
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,843
only a bunch of songs!
We know him as

179
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:49,837
"The Troubadour of Puente Alsina,"
Horacio Acosta!

180
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:57,845
He makes me laugh
with his comic Milonga about a wake.

181
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:03,794
I laugh
because he does it so well. This Acosta.

182
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,798
El Acostá, "the tall guy. "

183
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:11,803
A good show is all that counts.

184
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:15,340
What you do shouldn't come to nothing.

185
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,843
That's what's special about El Chino.

186
00:16:17,878 --> 00:16:20,812
<i>A fly came flying in...</i>

187
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:24,816
<i>and flew around indifferently...</i>

188
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:29,820
<i>- and landed, of all places...
- Where?</i>

189
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:34,860
<i>...on the dead man's nose.
Rocatagliatta, the annoying one,</i>

190
00:16:34,895 --> 00:16:38,864
<i>more drunk than a fish,
saw the fly on his nose</i>

191
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:40,832
<i>and smashed it.</i>

192
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:45,848
When he smashes the fly,
and you see how the audience

193
00:16:45,883 --> 00:16:49,830
jumps back, I always tell him,
"You do that so well!"

194
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:53,845
- It's really impressive!
- Good to keep in shape, huh?

195
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:59,840
<i>...and with his left hand, he threw
Carmona in the air... - And who else?</i>

196
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:02,787
<i>- The coffin!
- No!</i>

197
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:12,786
<i>And the cops suddenly
showed up at the gathering...</i>

198
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:19,133
<i>and put all the drunks</i>

199
00:17:19,168 --> 00:17:21,431
<i>in the police van.</i>

200
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:26,800
<i>Garabito and Chicharrón
stole all the wine and the dead man...</i>

201
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:29,814
What about the dead man, Acosta?

202
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,315
What a high voice you have, Chino!

203
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:38,857
I'm taking his place.
I'm supposed to say it and I am.

204
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,825
What about the dead man, Acosta?

205
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,863
Give her a hand,
you have to know one thing:

206
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:48,822
She only had 15 days to learn it.

207
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:54,828
- Amazing! - What happened?
- To the dead guy?

208
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:00,777
<i>- He was arrested...
- No! That's too much!</i>

209
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,783
<i>...because a young cop</i>

210
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,788
<i>brought him in as a witness</i>

211
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,518
<i>so that he...</i>

212
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,794
They didn't spoil my punch line!

213
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:20,788
Not today. Today it's going great.
Nobody knows the ending.

214
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:24,803
<i>...could make a statement.</i>

215
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,848
In January, it'll be 26 years
that I've been singing at "El Chino's. "

216
00:18:35,883 --> 00:18:40,512
I love music more than anything
and most especially Tango.

217
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:45,016
There is not a single one
that couldn't be true.

218
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:50,386
That's what makes them
so difficult to sing right.

219
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:53,554
You have to feel and sing
what the author was feeling.

220
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:58,826
Because when he was writing it,
there were probably

221
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,772
tears running down his cheeks.

222
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,913
I am in a difficult situation
with my house.

223
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:12,064
It is mortgaged
and I'm about to lose it.

224
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:15,181
In a nutshell, I have a lot of problems.

225
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:18,981
It's difficult to make decisions.

226
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:22,654
Without money,
you can't make any decisions.

227
00:19:22,689 --> 00:19:25,885
Without possibilities,
notjust without money.

228
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:28,399
Like I said,
I'll probably lose my home.

229
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:33,131
My problems are too big

230
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:37,397
to have any expectátions anymore.

231
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:39,408
That's the problem.

232
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:46,406
Now I want to introduce to you
the singer we've been waiting for:

233
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,420
Julio César, that's all I have to say.

234
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:52,116
Here he is!

235
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:03,468
<i>This Colombina
planted in the rings of her eyes</i>

236
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:06,437
<i>smoke from the fire of her heart.</i>

237
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:11,033
<i>That Marquise
with the crazy laugh</i>

238
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:15,480
<i>has painted her lips
to kiss a clown.</i>

239
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:18,448
<i>From the balcony to the coach,</i>

240
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:23,443
<i>flies the nervous, thin streamer</i>

241
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:29,859
<i>like a picturesque broche
over the Carnival night.</i>

242
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:36,466
El Chino's whole life was singing.

243
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:41,506
And now that he's away for a couple
of days, something is missing.

244
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:45,465
The soul of this place is missing.

245
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:54,484
El Chino doesn'tjust give us...

246
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:58,472
a job, he gives us
the chance to do what we love.

247
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:02,425
That's why this place
is irreplaceable for us.

248
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:09,332
<i>You can hear them everywhere,
the little Carnival bells.</i>

249
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:14,473
All together now!
But in waltz time!

250
00:21:14,508 --> 00:21:16,441
Everyone join in, alright?

251
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:19,842
It goes like this...

252
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:23,448
<i>I want to meet you,</i>

253
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,764
<i>to know where you go,</i>

254
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,045
<i>happy little mask,</i>

255
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,456
<i>calling to me as you go by.</i>

256
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,493
<i>"How are you? Do you know me?"</i>

257
00:21:34,528 --> 00:21:36,460
<i>Adiós, adiós, adiós...</i>

258
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:40,464
<i>You are the mysterious woman
of my dreams.</i>

259
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:44,458
<i>Don't disguise your voice,
take off your mask!</i>

260
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:48,473
<i>Your eyes in the parade
reveal your anxiety...</i>

261
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:56,481
- Hello, Mama.
- Already here?

262
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,418
- And the game?
- 0:0.

263
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:05,412
- Acatastrophe!
- It's a totally boring game.

264
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:10,918
It's perfect
for a film about a Tango singer:

265
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:15,467
"So old and still not married
because he takes care of his mother. "

266
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:17,230
But...

267
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:21,428
If I don't leave now
I'll never leave.

268
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,443
Like this?

269
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:29,446
This is a picture of us
when we were engaged.

270
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:33,178
- My husband... - How old is it?
- This photo is...

271
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:38,047
56 years old.

272
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:41,959
Such endurance!

273
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:45,463
- "Endurance"?
- Such endurance.

274
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:51,333
- That's what you do...
- When you're in love.

275
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,095
That's true love!

276
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:57,874
Do you remember
how old we were when we met?

277
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:02,207
- I was 25.
- When we met!

278
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:07,417
- 21.
- You were 21, and I was 18.

279
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:13,413
You used to
do the deliveries with your father.

280
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:17,121
You always went past our door.

281
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:20,124
- That's how it started.
- Then I brought you the milk.

282
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:22,524
Then you brought me the milk.

283
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:26,436
And one day I took you with me.

284
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:30,430
- To go on a walk.
- Right, on a walk.

285
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:33,478
And suddenly my mother appeared,

286
00:23:33,513 --> 00:23:37,141
to see where we were going.

287
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:41,941
Not quite four years.
He's three years and a bit older.

288
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,649
But he looks old enough to be my dad!

289
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:54,977
I worked in a textile factory.

290
00:23:55,012 --> 00:23:58,458
From when I was 14 till... 38.

291
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:01,404
38 or 40, more or less.

292
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,446
I was prepared
to look after my house,

293
00:24:07,481 --> 00:24:10,414
my children and my husband,

294
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:15,409
but not to be a performer in public.

295
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,424
<i>The lights...</i>

296
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:25,430
<i>have been put out...</i>

297
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,433
And when I was about 48,

298
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:32,437
El Chino heard me here.

299
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:37,438
"How this woman sings!
Why didn't I know? She's my neighbor!"

300
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:43,448
<i>The workers go to their toils,</i>

301
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:47,451
<i>like every morning,</i>

302
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:51,445
<i>while, talking nonsense,</i>

303
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,460
<i>a drunken Italian walks past them.</i>

304
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,464
<i>And suddenly
sounds of an orchestra can be heard.</i>

305
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:04,391
That's how it started.
And from then we never stopped.

306
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:08,405
<i>She has a child,</i>

307
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,399
<i>and they baptized it,</i>

308
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:17,426
<i>that's why they're dancing,</i>

309
00:25:17,461 --> 00:25:21,408
<i>the trash from next door.</i>

310
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:26,424
Encore!

311
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:31,428
That's how it was.

312
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:37,424
We never imagined
that it would all end the way it did.

313
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:52,450
La Chacarita Cemetery
November 2003

314
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:55,452
- Good day.
- Good day.

315
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:58,456
- I'd like some carnations.
- Carnations? - Yes.

316
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:01,391
- A dozen.
- A dozen?

317
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:04,395
Yes, a dozen.

318
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:11,402
El Chino was someone who...

319
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:15,406
He always said,
"If my son dies, I'll die with him. "

320
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:20,400
But we always thought
he wasjust saying it.

321
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:23,004
But that's what happened.

322
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:24,813
That's what happened.

323
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:50,434
I brought you the colors
of your soccer team.

324
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:43,426
El Chino is gone

325
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:48,421
and left us with
a strange feeling of being orphaned.

326
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:53,437
Because this place was our home.

327
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:05,774
There's an old saying,
"No one is irreplaceable. "

328
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,076
But it's not true in his case.

329
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:12,788
El Chino was irreplaceable here.
But, oh well...

330
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:17,384
I knew him and his ways so well

331
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:22,890
that I keep everything going
just like he did.

332
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:27,405
- How are you?
- Fine, and you?

333
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:30,407
Good. Tired, but good.

334
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:32,409
- Lots of work?
- Piles of work.

335
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:35,447
Delfina and I stayed, because I believe

336
00:28:35,482 --> 00:28:39,406
humans know when it's their time.

337
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:45,219
El Chino felt it
and said to Delfina,

338
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,025
"If something happens to me,

339
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,725
let Omar run the place,
he knows what's up. "

340
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:55,432
When El Chino was gone,

341
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:58,435
it was over.

342
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,938
Everything changed.

343
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:04,375
They wanted to make something else
out of the place.

344
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,777
Many of us stopped going there.

345
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:12,781
I miss him and my son.

346
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,388
Both of them.
They left me very early.

347
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:24,394
And I had to take over the place.

348
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:28,388
Even though I had never run a business.

349
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,800
Now I have to.

350
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,036
No, no. I don't even pass by there.

351
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,608
I feel so impotent.

352
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:49,113
I'd like to tell them all to go to hell.

353
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,423
<i>The green is calling,</i>

354
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,255
<i>the green,</i>

355
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,430
<i>the green is calling.</i>

356
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:10,737
That's all they offer the people.
People come and there's nothing.

357
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:15,139
Nothing. Notjust that El Chino's gone,
but there's nothing else either.

358
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,439
That's why I think the place
will disappear eventually.

359
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:24,472
<i>The noises are lost</i>

360
00:30:24,507 --> 00:30:27,458
<i>to the afternoon...</i>

361
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,496
<i>The green coffee beans clothe themselves</i>

362
00:30:31,531 --> 00:30:34,124
<i>in brown skin...</i>

363
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:42,166
Almost everyone who worked here
left one by one.

364
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:47,466
Now I'm the only one left.

365
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,423
Jasmine, carnations, flowers!

366
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:04,019
- Hello!
- How're you doing, man?

367
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:07,431
Got some work? That's good. See you.

368
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:09,831
Good luck.

369
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:18,431
My life changed
because everything collapsed.

370
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:21,944
Destiny made me lose my house,

371
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,439
because I wanted to help people.
But I'm not complaining.

372
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:29,452
I did it with all my heart
because I wanted to.

373
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,490
You see how I live. I'm happy.

374
00:31:32,525 --> 00:31:34,457
I'm alright. I have fun.

375
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:37,460
I yell, I do everything I can.

376
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:43,501
And until the day I die
I will never stop singing.

377
00:31:43,536 --> 00:31:45,469
It's the best thing in my life.

378
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:02,419
Three Years Later
August 2006

379
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:17,423
In everything, but especially the arts,
if you have no angel,

380
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:20,437
no guardian angel...

381
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:25,441
El Chino had an angel, that's for sure.

382
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:30,436
As long as he lived,
it was always "El Chino's Bar".

383
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:36,453
And when El Chino was gone,
the angel flew away.

384
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,458
And the bar's time had passed.

385
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:44,051
Sadly.

386
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:54,266
- Want some Maté tea?
- Yes, please.

387
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:57,167
- Is it warm?
- I think so.

388
00:32:58,509 --> 00:32:59,874
It's cold.

389
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:02,811
To warm you up.

390
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:07,452
- This'll warm my vocal cords.
- Are you going? Want some more?

391
00:33:07,487 --> 00:33:12,474
- No, I'm fine - You going like that?
- No, I'll put on my coat.

392
00:33:12,509 --> 00:33:17,462
- Your jacket's so thin and wrinkled.
- I'll put my coat over it.

393
00:33:17,497 --> 00:33:18,428
- Yes?
- Yes.

394
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:22,467
- Do you want more Maté tea?
- No, thank you. - Alright.

395
00:33:22,502 --> 00:33:27,427
He started singing when he was six.

396
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:31,442
He sang everywhere,
every birthday party, every celebration.

397
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:38,438
And he kept on with it.
He started to learn folk music.

398
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:42,487
We supported him
because he liked it so much.

399
00:33:42,522 --> 00:33:46,253
He even sang at "La Boca. "

400
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:50,052
- Hurry or the tourists will be gone.
- Think so? - Get out your bandoneon.

401
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:54,056
But I think he was pretty unlucky.

402
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:57,957
I'm not saying it because he's my son,
but he sings very well.

403
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:09,811
<i>That the world was a mess
and will always be one, that I know.</i>

404
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:14,314
<i>In the year 506
and in 2000 just the same.</i>

405
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:18,320
<i>And that there were always
thieves, Machiavellis and victims,</i>

406
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:22,517
<i>happy and bitter people,
originals and imitations.</i>

407
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,428
<i>But the fact that the 20th century</i>

408
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:30,423
<i>is a display of insolent malice,
no one can deny.</i>

409
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:34,437
<i>We wallow in the same dirty mud...</i>

410
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:37,441
I am not over it.
But you can'tjust hang your head.

411
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:42,435
I don't know...
There are moments you...

412
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:46,484
when you have to be strong inside.

413
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:48,349
Otherwise...

414
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:52,490
I can't do anything else.
I have been singing my whole life.

415
00:34:52,525 --> 00:34:56,459
I went to a couple bars
where I knew a singer or musician,

416
00:34:56,494 --> 00:35:01,432
introduced myself to the owner
and sang some songs as a test...

417
00:35:01,467 --> 00:35:04,401
I hate doing that,
but when they don't know you,

418
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:09,821
- it's the only way.
- At least you men have it easier.

419
00:35:09,856 --> 00:35:14,207
I can'tjust go out at night
and see where I'll end up.

420
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:20,008
Nowadays, they even insist
that you bring an audience.

421
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:24,755
It's like
my friend Carlitos Álvarez says:

422
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:28,424
"We're the best,
but we're the worst paid. "

423
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:32,793
Ain't that the truth?
I don't know if we're the best...

424
00:35:32,828 --> 00:35:37,128
<i>Step aside!
Nobody cares if you were born honest.</i>

425
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:40,835
<i>It doesn't matter if one works</i>

426
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:44,840
<i>night and day like an ox,</i>

427
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:47,443
<i>if one lives off women's backs,</i>

428
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:52,438
<i>if one kills or heals,
or one lives outside the law.</i>

429
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:03,427
Let's see
how generous the tourists are.

430
00:36:03,462 --> 00:36:05,088
At least we got something.

431
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:07,021
It is not easy

432
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:08,898
being a singer.

433
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:14,438
Especially for those of us who
are convinced we're on the right path.

434
00:36:14,473 --> 00:36:18,397
Sometimes we run out of water
right in the middle.

435
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:23,212
Everyone wants to climb the Himalayas,
but only a few make it.

436
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:25,506
Oh well...

437
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:35,114
Good day.
My name is Cristina de los Ángeles.

438
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:38,253
This is my demo-CD of Tangos.

439
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:41,221
Could you please
give it to the director?

440
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,669
- Thank you.
- Have a nice day.

441
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,088
I miss it,

442
00:36:50,123 --> 00:36:51,971
that old bar.

443
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,975
It is such a shame,
what has become of it.

444
00:36:56,714 --> 00:37:01,083
It was an escape for me, an...

445
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,620
I was another person there.

446
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:05,616
During the week,

447
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:09,660
I have no problem with washing,
scrubbing and cleaning,

448
00:37:09,695 --> 00:37:13,118
but on the weekends I miss it.

449
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:15,632
Something is missing.

450
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:24,140
Come on! Let's go.

451
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:28,834
It's over. Even the friendship
between the singers ended.

452
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,685
I gave my dear friend my best homage.

453
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,652
Because...

454
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:41,650
When I left, I said, "I will never
set foot in the bar again. "

455
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:44,661
I did it in his honor.

456
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:50,666
I managed it on my own...

457
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:53,465
but I really
could have used a psychologist.

458
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:55,672
I became very ill.

459
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:59,675
Friends of mine died of it.

460
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:03,648
Don Walter, the Itálian,
died of a broken heart.

461
00:38:03,683 --> 00:38:06,014
Cristina was very close...

462
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,141
to becoming ill herself.

463
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:50,793
<i>I don't want to hear anyone say</i>

464
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:56,059
<i>that you forced me
out of your sweet life.</i>

465
00:38:56,701 --> 00:39:01,604
<i>My heart cries out for a lie</i>

466
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:05,620
<i>hoping for your impossible call.</i>

467
00:39:05,655 --> 00:39:09,602
<i>I don't want anyone to be able</i>

468
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:14,607
<i>to know how bitter and deep
my eternal loneliness is.</i>

469
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:19,612
<i>The hours go past
and the minute hand</i>

470
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:24,617
<i>grinds the nightmare
of its slow tick-tock.</i>

471
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:51,438
<i>In the painful shadow
of my room I must wait,</i>

472
00:39:51,473 --> 00:39:56,586
<i>hoping for her footsteps
that may never come.</i>

473
00:39:56,621 --> 00:40:01,699
<i>Sometimes it seems to me
that she stops</i>

474
00:40:01,734 --> 00:40:05,658
<i>and dares not to come in.</i>

475
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:11,186
<i>But no one is there
and she won't be coming.</i>

476
00:40:11,221 --> 00:40:15,668
<i>It is a ghost
that my illusion creates.</i>

477
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:20,673
<i>And when it vanishes,</i>

478
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:26,679
<i>it leaves only ashes in my heart.</i>

479
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:36,885
Hello, Inés?
Cristina here. How are you?

480
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:40,731
Long time no see.
I wanted to invite you.

481
00:41:40,766 --> 00:41:42,790
Are you busy tomorrow?

482
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:49,699
Great. Then you're not busy tomorrow.

483
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:57,714
Here. See you next week.

484
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,654
Is that you, Julio César?

485
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,657
Guess who it is!

486
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:09,658
Don't faint!

487
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:15,359
I met some young people yesterday
who play Tango.

488
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:19,191
Women who play bandoneon.
Really nice people.

489
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:24,663
I told them about us
and they invited us tomorrow...

490
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:58,708
- Finally we can meet again.
- It has been an eternity!

491
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:04,682
- You all look so young!
- Time goes backwards for us.

492
00:43:04,717 --> 00:43:07,651
How are you, Julio?
So nice you could come.

493
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:12,821
And when I heard the Tangos,
I wanted to sing along.

494
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:16,956
- Am I looking pale?
- No, not pale, but a little sad.

495
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:20,663
He's going to pay today!
He's happy to pay.

496
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:25,703
It's not the Tango we know,
but at least it's back in fashion.

497
00:43:25,738 --> 00:43:28,706
That's right. We're used to

498
00:43:28,741 --> 00:43:30,173
certain ideas.

499
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:33,069
Would you like to sing with me again?

500
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:38,239
They invited me and
I want to pass the invitation on.

501
00:43:38,716 --> 00:43:42,379
- How will we get there, Abel?
- Yes, how? - In my car.

502
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,689
- You have a car? No way!
- Yes. I'll drive.

503
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:49,692
- Do you have a driver's license?
- Yes, since a year ago.

504
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:54,494
- Can you turn already?
- Yes, but I can't use the reverse yet.

505
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:57,701
- No way. - Forwards, yes.
- It is magnificent!

506
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:00,226
Congratulations!

507
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:03,639
This is a real joy.

508
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:07,678
- I haven't sung with a large orchestra
in a long time. - It's a ten-piece.

509
00:44:07,713 --> 00:44:13,639
- The big orchestras are dying out.
- No one can afford them.

510
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:17,653
I'm not saying anything.

511
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:20,657
Everything comes around again,
life turns like a wheel.

512
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:26,652
Haven't you seen how the young people
are wearing old-fashioned clothes?

513
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:33,659
My granddaughter wears my old petticoats
as summer dresses.

514
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:37,667
I wanted to wear my granddad's
old long johns...

515
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:40,677
With the flower pattern, please!

516
00:44:52,723 --> 00:44:56,682
<i>Turbid harbor,
where they cast their anchors,</i>

517
00:44:57,728 --> 00:45:01,676
<i>the ships
which will stay on the piers forever.</i>

518
00:45:01,711 --> 00:45:05,624
<i>Shadows that disappear
in the night of pain,</i>

519
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:10,629
<i>castaways from the world
who have lost their hearts.</i>

520
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:16,645
<i>Bridges and ropes where the winds howl,</i>

521
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:21,184
<i>coal freighters
that will never again set to sea.</i>

522
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:25,689
<i>Somber cemetery
of the ships that when they die,</i>

523
00:45:25,724 --> 00:45:30,694
<i>still dream of sailing out to sea.</i>

524
00:45:30,729 --> 00:45:32,662
<i>Fog of the Riachuelo...</i>

525
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:36,222
- Here?
- Here. See: "El Colonial".

526
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,668
<i>I continue waiting.</i>

527
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:42,638
<i>Fog of the Riachuelo...</i>

528
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:48,678
- Can we just go in?
- I think so.

529
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:52,682
- Come on.
- What an old building!

530
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:58,416
<i>...her voice never spoke my name again
by my side...</i>

531
00:45:58,722 --> 00:46:01,987
- Wonderful. Look at the lamps.
- I hear something.

532
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:04,626
I hear something.

533
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:08,630
<i>Anchors that will never be raised,</i>

534
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:12,669
<i>decks of ships
whose ropes cannot be cast off...</i>

535
00:46:12,704 --> 00:46:16,628
Here they are. I told you!

536
00:46:17,674 --> 00:46:20,642
Hello there. We found you!

537
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:25,546
- Hello. - These are
the three friends I told you about.

538
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:27,684
Doña Ines, a wonderful singer,

539
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:30,050
the singer Julio César,

540
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:32,518
and Abel Frías,

541
00:46:32,689 --> 00:46:36,693
the guitarist for every occasion.
And I sing

542
00:46:36,728 --> 00:46:39,696
for serenades, divorces,

543
00:46:39,731 --> 00:46:41,789
weddings...

544
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:46,359
<i>She never came again,
I never saw her again.</i>

545
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:51,708
<i>Her voice never spoke my name again
at my side,</i>

546
00:46:51,743 --> 00:46:53,675
<i>the same voice</i>

547
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:56,679
<i>that had said "goodbye. "</i>

548
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:03,208
I think we should use this chance
to sing something together.

549
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,452
Doña Inés can start.

550
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:09,091
Me? I'd be glad to.

551
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,663
- Check the key with Nicolás.
- Alright. - Have a go.

552
00:47:12,698 --> 00:47:15,183
Try something.

553
00:47:15,218 --> 00:47:17,633
Sure, but what?

554
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:21,729
- Do you like Gardel? - Of course!
"When you're not there"? - Good.

555
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:23,639
In what key?

556
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:27,132
Let's do it in G.

557
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:32,638
<i>Alone on the path of my destiny,</i>

558
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:36,653
<i>without the protection of your glance,</i>

559
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:43,649
<i>I am like a bird that breaks</i>

560
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:50,701
<i>the chords of its song on the way.</i>

561
00:47:50,736 --> 00:47:53,670
<i>When you're not there,</i>

562
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:57,674
<i>the flower has no perfume</i>

563
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:01,610
<i>when you leave...</i>

564
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:04,614
Thank you.

565
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:08,618
- See you Sunday, God willing.
- Till Sunday.

566
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:14,424
With Pepe? We had 60 years.

567
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:17,126
Sixty years.

568
00:48:21,865 --> 00:48:25,130
One has to accept it
because that's the way it is.

569
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:27,637
One of us had to go first.

570
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:31,640
That's that. I wasn't expecting it.

571
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:36,635
I thought he'd be around longer.
But that's how it was.

572
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:49,648
<i>When you're not here,
my hope dies.</i>

573
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:55,654
<i>If you go,
my dream goes with you.</i>

574
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:05,608
<i>Hear my lament,</i>

575
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:10,647
<i>that I confide to the wind,</i>

576
00:49:10,682 --> 00:49:13,615
<i>everything is pain,</i>

577
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:18,610
<i>when you're not here.</i>

578
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:25,127
You sing beautifully! Very good!

579
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:34,636
I miss him. I miss him so much.

580
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:38,630
Every night
I lay down with the same...

581
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:42,644
...thought: "How lonely I am!"

582
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:45,682
Even though I am not really alone.
Plenty of people live here,

583
00:49:45,717 --> 00:49:48,651
but in my room,
in my bed, I am alone.

584
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:56,649
<i>Twentieth century, junk shop,
problematic and feverish!</i>

585
00:49:57,694 --> 00:50:01,653
<i>If you don't cry, you don't get fed
and if you don't steal, you're a fool.</i>

586
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:06,668
<i>Go ahead!
Keep it up!</i>

587
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:11,185
<i>Down in hell, we will meet again.</i>

588
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:15,667
<i>Stop thinking, step aside!</i>

589
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:18,681
<i>Nobody cares if you were born honest.</i>

590
00:50:19,716 --> 00:50:22,685
<i>It doesn't matter if one works</i>

591
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:27,689
<i>night and day like an ox,</i>

592
00:50:27,724 --> 00:50:32,729
<i>if one lives off the others,
if one kills or heals,</i>

593
00:50:32,764 --> 00:50:34,696
<i>or one lives outside the law.</i>

594
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:37,700
- I went low.
- So we'll do it that way.

595
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:43,706
- Do you want to try going up?
- Let's see how that sounds.

596
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:07,663
Great. That's what we'll do.

597
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,687
How did you like the rehearsal?

598
00:51:32,722 --> 00:51:38,728
I never thought I would sing with an
orchestra of such magnitude and quality.

599
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:40,696
But you have the voice for it.

600
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:43,323
So will you take me?

601
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:46,702
We're thinking it over...

602
00:51:47,737 --> 00:51:51,571
- We tálked about it and...
- What?

603
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:56,007
We would like you all to sing with us.

604
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:59,749
- "La Imperial" with four singers!
- I don't need to think about it.

605
00:51:59,784 --> 00:52:04,243
- True, true.
- Thank you for your trust.

606
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:08,657
- We'll have to work out a program.
- Sure.

607
00:52:08,692 --> 00:52:12,651
We can'tjust improvise.
The audience deserves that respect.

608
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:17,178
And we do, too.
The musicians and the singers.

609
00:52:17,213 --> 00:52:20,659
- And you, Inés?
- This is such a luxury for us.

610
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:26,187
- Do you think you can do it?
- I don't know. At my age...

611
00:52:26,222 --> 00:52:30,669
- Why not? You're still young!
- Let's see if I can manage it.

612
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:35,685
I had a fulfilling life.

613
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:41,725
I started singing when I was eight.
I've sung pretty much everything...

614
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,456
- Can we count on you, Julio?
- Absolutely. - Cristina?

615
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:46,991
I'll tell you tomorrow.

616
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:52,701
Come on!

617
00:52:52,736 --> 00:52:54,499
Yes, alright!

618
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:58,469
Let's hope... That is: I hope
that I can keep up with you.

619
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:00,334
Singing is for me...

620
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:05,239
I want to sing,
to sing till I leave this planet.

621
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:10,642
Terrible! You can't tell
if it's raining or if it's...

622
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:14,657
What weather!

623
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,250
Please!

624
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:20,959
A little bit is alright, but...

625
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:24,098
this is too much!

626
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,691
One, two, three!

627
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:51,421
It's the first time I'm late!

628
00:53:56,533 --> 00:54:00,629
<i>I am afraid
of the encounter with the past</i>

629
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:05,630
<i>that returns to confront my life.</i>

630
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:09,140
<i>I am afraid of the nights</i>

631
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:14,239
<i>filled with memories
that shackle my dreams.</i>

632
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:18,654
<i>But the travelerwho flees</i>

633
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:21,649
<i>sooner or later</i>

634
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:25,695
<i>stops his steps.
And although forgetfulness,</i>

635
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:28,663
<i>which destroys everything</i>

636
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:32,498
<i>has killed my old illusion...</i>

637
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:34,260
We'll wait for you here.

638
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:38,071
Take as much time as you want,
we'll follow you.

639
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:41,541
- Where do you mean?
- "The mocking gaze of the stars"

640
00:54:41,576 --> 00:54:44,874
<i>- At "I keep hidden," when you...
- I keep hidden</i>

641
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,481
<i>a humble hope</i>

642
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:53,283
<i>that is all my heart's riches.</i>

643
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:58,688
- Good?
- Great. We just have to coordinate it.

644
00:54:58,828 --> 00:55:02,628
Yes, that's good.
But to sing Gardel is...

645
00:55:02,866 --> 00:55:05,528
- difficult.
- A responsibility. I love him,

646
00:55:05,669 --> 00:55:07,830
but I am afraid of disappointing him.

647
00:55:08,672 --> 00:55:10,640
Let's do from "I am afraid" again.

648
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:14,644
Is the piano ready?
Sorry. Once again.

649
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:17,647
I wasn't really there.

650
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:24,654
<i>I am afraid
of the encounter with the past...</i>

651
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:45,573
Love for me is over now.
Or in "intensive care"!

652
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:49,668
But I'm not so worried about it.

653
00:55:50,714 --> 00:55:54,673
If life has something in store for me,
it will come along.

654
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,687
I had two great loves.

655
00:55:58,722 --> 00:56:00,622
I was crazy about the first one.

656
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:04,616
It was a poisonous love.
It didn't do me any good.

657
00:56:05,662 --> 00:56:07,129
But oh well... he died.

658
00:56:07,263 --> 00:56:10,632
And now I'm here and I'm in a movie!

659
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:15,672
- And you sing. - Then came a...
clandestine affair. He was married.

660
00:56:15,707 --> 00:56:18,641
- Who knew about it?
- No one. Only us two.

661
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:22,644
- We used to tálk a lot!
- That must have been

662
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:24,647
pure adrenaline the whole time
when you were together.

663
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:29,648
- The kisses we gave each other...
- 700... - Don't remind me!

664
00:56:29,986 --> 00:56:33,649
Stay cool, Cristina! Keep your calm.

665
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:38,957
I want to find someone!

666
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:41,664
<i>To return</i>

667
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:47,659
<i>with a withered brow,
and from the snow of time,</i>

668
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:51,708
<i>my temples white.</i>

669
00:56:51,743 --> 00:56:54,676
<i>To feel</i>

670
00:56:54,711 --> 00:56:58,163
<i>that life is but a puff of wind,</i>

671
00:56:58,198 --> 00:57:01,616
<i>that 20 years are nothing,</i>

672
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:04,619
<i>that the fevered look,</i>

673
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:06,622
<i>stumbling in the shadows</i>

674
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:10,626
<i>seeks you and calls your name.</i>

675
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,628
<i>To live</i>

676
00:57:13,663 --> 00:57:17,632
<i>with the soul held</i>

677
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:22,627
<i>by a sweet memory
which always makes me cry.</i>

678
00:57:38,688 --> 00:57:41,657
- Very good!
- But a bit low...

679
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:43,654
Everything changes.

680
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:49,459
One changes, too.
My face has changed.

681
00:57:52,702 --> 00:57:56,763
But myself, my roots
and my convictions haven't.

682
00:57:58,007 --> 00:57:59,668
They haven't changed.

683
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:15,624
<i>My Mama spoils me a lot.</i>

684
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:29,638
Stop, stop!

685
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:34,635
Do you remember that "whinny"
you played me recently?

686
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:41,650
Really impressive!

687
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:48,646
I thought I was singing
with a serious orchestra!

688
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:53,173
- But not all musicians are serious.
- If I sing of a bird,

689
00:58:53,208 --> 00:58:56,654
- will you play "cheep cheep?"
- We're not all what we seem.

690
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:01,602
Listen, you do the "whinny"
and I'll do the "airplane. "

691
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:04,607
Then we'll have everything.

692
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:39,676
<i>All because of the length
of a horse's head.</i>

693
00:59:39,711 --> 00:59:43,635
<i>It gives up just before the end.</i>

694
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:47,650
<i>And seems to say to you:</i>

695
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:52,644
<i>"Don't forget, brother,
you know you shouldn't bet. "</i>

696
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:54,654
<i>All because of a head.</i>

697
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:56,656
<i>Instant, violent love</i>

698
00:59:56,793 --> 01:00:00,661
<i>for that flirtatious and cheerful woman</i>

699
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:06,703
<i>who swore a lie of love
with a smile on her face,</i>

700
01:00:06,738 --> 01:00:08,671
<i>burning all my love</i>

701
01:00:09,706 --> 01:00:11,673
<i>in a blaze.</i>

702
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:13,676
"Because of a head" is a Tango

703
01:00:14,711 --> 01:00:16,679
that unites two loves.

704
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:21,081
The love of horse races, of horses
and the love of women.

705
01:00:21,317 --> 01:00:23,285
Both are very expensive,

706
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:27,679
but women give you a bit more.
They give you something else.

707
01:00:28,725 --> 01:00:30,693
Horses are a bit more dangerous.

708
01:00:31,728 --> 01:00:36,688
<i>Losing by a head</i>

709
01:00:37,033 --> 01:00:42,699
<i>all that madness.
Her kissing mouth</i>

710
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:50,310
<i>wipes away the sadness
and soothes the bitterness.</i>

711
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:56,716
Look what it says:
"For Mama, Pichuco. "

712
01:00:56,953 --> 01:01:01,652
- That was 30 years ago.
- 30 years? 30 years are nothing!

713
01:01:02,692 --> 01:01:04,455
This one isn't so old.

714
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:06,662
It's at "El Chino's. "

715
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:12,261
- And these girls?
- Afew of the many.

716
01:01:12,702 --> 01:01:16,706
- Cuca. - Really... - Susana.
She wrote me something on the back.

717
01:01:16,741 --> 01:01:19,106
- All types.
- Cristina...

718
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:22,375
Dorita... So many.

719
01:01:22,712 --> 01:01:25,476
So many women, but when will you marry?

720
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:28,684
Ahh... I'm still young.

721
01:01:28,818 --> 01:01:31,878
I have time to find somebody.

722
01:01:56,746 --> 01:02:00,648
<i>If she forgets me,</i>

723
01:02:00,683 --> 01:02:05,643
<i>what do I care if I lose my life
a thousand times?</i>

724
01:02:06,689 --> 01:02:09,351
<i>Why go on living?</i>

725
01:02:10,693 --> 01:02:14,697
I met Liliana when she was 13.

726
01:02:14,732 --> 01:02:17,665
I was 17, at school.

727
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:21,669
I sang at the spring festival

728
01:02:21,704 --> 01:02:24,439
and I had a four-button jacket on,
like the Beatles.

729
01:02:24,474 --> 01:02:27,175
She was crowned "Queen of Spring"
at 13 years of age!

730
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:31,476
She has a photo of that day
and I have one, too.

731
01:02:31,614 --> 01:02:35,675
We ran into each other 30 years later
and we've been together since.

732
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:39,686
If you think
that this river used to be clean...

733
01:02:40,723 --> 01:02:44,727
I went swimming here
as a kid with my mother.

734
01:02:44,762 --> 01:02:46,695
We even fished here.

735
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:51,699
- I've never been here.
- You weren't even born.

736
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:55,738
- It was really great.
- It's really nice over there.

737
01:02:55,773 --> 01:02:57,706
The changing cabins were there.

738
01:02:58,741 --> 01:03:02,678
You got a token
and you could get changed in them.

739
01:03:02,713 --> 01:03:05,646
- Times were different.
- I'm hungry, Julio,

740
01:03:05,681 --> 01:03:09,685
- want to have a sausage?
- A sausage? Alright, let's go.

741
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,652
Are you paying?

742
01:03:11,687 --> 01:03:15,646
- No! You're the hungry one! - How long
have you lived with your mother?

743
01:03:16,692 --> 01:03:19,991
- Since... '85.
- '85

744
01:03:21,697 --> 01:03:23,665
And you want to
leave your mom all alone?

745
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:32,163
She'll have to live alone.
My time is also running out.

746
01:03:35,711 --> 01:03:38,679
I'll visit her every day.

747
01:03:38,714 --> 01:03:43,083
Not like my brother
who comes every couple of months.

748
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:46,187
If I don't move out now, then when?

749
01:03:46,722 --> 01:03:49,088
I'm 58 already.

750
01:03:56,432 --> 01:04:00,635
<i>For your fame,
for your looks,</i>

751
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:04,674
<i>you're the most infamous gangster
of the underworld.</i>

752
01:04:04,709 --> 01:04:08,673
<i>You're the bravest of the brave,</i>

753
01:04:08,708 --> 01:04:12,637
<i>you are "Ventarrón" himself.</i>

754
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:16,652
<i>Who could be your equal,</i>

755
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:20,656
<i>you with your wild Tango moves</i>

756
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:24,660
<i>to the murmur of the bandoneons,</i>

757
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:29,654
<i>if the chance ever offered itself?</i>

758
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:42,677
<i>Now you are no longer</i>

759
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:47,682
<i>the "Ventarrón" of days gone by.</i>

760
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:51,676
<i>You're worth nothing to your friends,</i>

761
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:56,681
<i>and to the coward you're a poor soul.</i>

762
01:04:57,727 --> 01:05:01,697
<i>And when you hear a Tango,</i>

763
01:05:01,732 --> 01:05:05,633
<i>proud and rebellious,</i>

764
01:05:05,668 --> 01:05:10,638
<i>you remember that past,</i>

765
01:05:10,673 --> 01:05:15,633
<i>the glorious pride of "Ventarrón. "</i>

766
01:05:19,682 --> 01:05:22,650
- What great records!
- You see.

767
01:05:22,685 --> 01:05:25,654
- So many!
- They're a couple of years old.

768
01:05:26,689 --> 01:05:29,658
- Are these shellac?
- They're shellac.

769
01:05:32,695 --> 01:05:35,698
- Really?
- So you can see now

770
01:05:35,733 --> 01:05:38,667
what era I come from.

771
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:42,705
<i>Today a promise, tomorrow a betrayal...</i>

772
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:43,672
No, that goes like this...

773
01:05:44,707 --> 01:05:48,711
<i>Today an oath, tomorrow betrayal,</i>

774
01:05:48,746 --> 01:05:50,678
<i>student loves</i>

775
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:52,680
<i>are blossoms for but one day.</i>

776
01:05:52,715 --> 01:05:55,718
Did your voice change over the years?

777
01:05:55,753 --> 01:05:59,176
Of course. Sure it changed.

778
01:05:59,322 --> 01:06:02,621
I had to lower my tone.

779
01:06:03,659 --> 01:06:06,628
- You had a very high voice.
- Oh yes.

780
01:06:07,663 --> 01:06:12,668
When I started singing "Malena"
at "El Chino's," they all stared at me,

781
01:06:12,703 --> 01:06:17,628
because I began the song
with a long, sustained note.

782
01:06:18,674 --> 01:06:19,641
I sang...

783
01:06:20,676 --> 01:06:23,645
<i>Malena...</i>

784
01:06:30,686 --> 01:06:35,656
<i>sings the Tango like no other,</i>

785
01:06:35,691 --> 01:06:40,661
<i>and puts her heart into every verse.</i>

786
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:45,701
<i>Her voice
is a scent to the suburban weeds...</i>

787
01:06:45,736 --> 01:06:48,670
So you sang 25 years at "El Chino's. "

788
01:06:49,105 --> 01:06:54,668
How was it for you to stop singing?
That was your life?

789
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:57,673
Yes, we miss it.

790
01:06:58,714 --> 01:07:03,652
And when the weekend comes
and I am at home,

791
01:07:03,687 --> 01:07:05,620
I look out the window to see

792
01:07:06,655 --> 01:07:09,624
if people and cars are at the bar,
but no one comes.

793
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:12,626
I think it's really a pity.

794
01:07:12,661 --> 01:07:17,666
All I really had there
was friendship and...

795
01:07:17,701 --> 01:07:20,669
the chance to indulge my vices.

796
01:07:20,704 --> 01:07:23,638
Because singing is like a vice.

797
01:07:27,676 --> 01:07:31,635
- It's so cold! - How are you?
- Fine. I'm going to warm up.

798
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:34,649
- Good idea.
- See you later.

799
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:55,669
<i>A chorus of whistles in the corner,</i>

800
01:07:55,704 --> 01:07:59,658
<i>the whole place filled with card games.</i>

801
01:07:59,693 --> 01:08:03,612
<i>The drama of the pale neighbor woman,</i>

802
01:08:05,648 --> 01:08:09,617
<i>who never went out again
to watch the train.</i>

803
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:13,611
<i>And so I remember the nights,
in the Tango Quarter,</i>

804
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:17,626
<i>with the carts that came into the yard,</i>

805
01:08:18,661 --> 01:08:22,620
<i>and the moon squelching in the mud</i>

806
01:08:23,666 --> 01:08:28,501
<i>and in the distance,
the voice of the bandoneon.</i>

807
01:08:29,672 --> 01:08:32,675
<i>Come to the window bars,
you are the mistress of my soul,</i>

808
01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:36,634
<i>my captive moon,
who kisses me and then leaves...</i>

809
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:05,641
<i>I have returned again,
my cow herd is on its way,</i>

810
01:09:05,676 --> 01:09:08,610
<i>musician mule drivers help me arrive.</i>

811
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:12,614
<i>I had to stop
because of a stubborn bull,</i>

812
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:17,130
<i>here in Calicanto,
on the willow covered banks.</i>

813
01:09:17,165 --> 01:09:20,611
<i>Your love is a star
with chords like a guitar,</i>

814
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:24,625
<i>a light
that illuminates my darkness...</i>

815
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:28,619
<i>Come to the window bars,
you are the mistress of my soul...</i>

816
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:49,650
I think we should do a concert together.

817
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:54,645
We just have to find a day
where we don't have otherjobs.

818
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:57,659
"I work a lot!" Stop it!

819
01:09:58,694 --> 01:10:01,697
- You are talking like a singer!
- Let'sjust sing together!

820
01:10:01,732 --> 01:10:04,700
I'll call my agent
and find out when I have a free day.

821
01:10:04,735 --> 01:10:06,668
Give me his number and I'll call mine

822
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:10,706
- and our agents can figure it out.
- Well, my offer stands...

823
01:10:10,741 --> 01:10:13,675
Yes...
- We'll find a date.

824
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:23,719
Would you all
like to perform in "El Chino's" again?

825
01:10:23,754 --> 01:10:29,725
When I hear the words,
"Perform in El Chino again"...

826
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:35,697
It's like someone
is stabbing my heart with a knife.

827
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:43,695
Sometimes when I drive down
Beazley Street, I think,

828
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:47,800
"How long I played there!
18 years!"

829
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:55,706
I would go to China
or any place else,

830
01:10:55,851 --> 01:10:57,409
but to "El Chino's"... no!

831
01:11:06,295 --> 01:11:08,354
Come. Slow down.

832
01:11:09,298 --> 01:11:11,283
Take it easy.

833
01:11:11,318 --> 01:11:13,268
Slow down, Popy!

834
01:11:14,303 --> 01:11:17,272
Or you'll hurt my hands.

835
01:11:24,313 --> 01:11:26,315
- Good morning. How are you, Eva?
- Good morning.

836
01:11:26,350 --> 01:11:29,113
My bread, please. The usual.

837
01:11:29,318 --> 01:11:30,876
Alright.

838
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:33,288
- How are you?
- I'll pay you tomorrow.

839
01:11:34,323 --> 01:11:36,291
- Fine.
- Or I won't have any more coins.

840
01:11:43,332 --> 01:11:49,338
I should get used to the idea
that the time has come to retire,

841
01:11:49,373 --> 01:11:51,306
but I don't want to stop yet.

842
01:11:52,341 --> 01:11:55,310
I feel I can still do it.

843
01:11:59,348 --> 01:12:02,249
- It must be here.
- Here it is, "El Chino's. "

844
01:12:06,288 --> 01:12:09,291
- Shall we go in?
- Go on. - Go on in.

845
01:12:09,326 --> 01:12:11,259
"National music and culture"

846
01:12:12,294 --> 01:12:14,125
- Good day.
- Good day.

847
01:12:14,296 --> 01:12:16,264
- May we come in?
- Please do.

848
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,268
- Is this "El Chino's?"
- Yes, come in.

849
01:12:22,304 --> 01:12:24,772
We are a Tango orchestra,

850
01:12:24,907 --> 01:12:27,375
the "Orquesta Imperial. "

851
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:30,870
We're preparing something
and that's why...

852
01:12:31,313 --> 01:12:32,871
we're here.

853
01:12:33,315 --> 01:12:38,275
- Which one was El Chino?
- Him in the middle. The big picture.

854
01:12:51,333 --> 01:12:56,303
- We have a surprise for you.
- How nice!

855
01:12:56,338 --> 01:13:00,240
Nice for you, 'cause you like surprises,
but the tension is killing me!

856
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:06,245
Look where they've brought us!

857
01:13:29,304 --> 01:13:35,265
You know, you only learn to
appreciate the small things very late.

858
01:13:36,311 --> 01:13:41,281
But they are
what you look for at the end.

859
01:13:41,316 --> 01:13:44,319
What do you look for?
The love of your friends,

860
01:13:44,354 --> 01:13:47,322
the warmth of your home, the smell

861
01:13:47,357 --> 01:13:49,290
of your things...

862
01:13:50,325 --> 01:13:53,294
That's what life's about.
Not about being dazzled.

863
01:13:54,329 --> 01:13:58,288
Day by day you say farewell
to something without noticing it.

864
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:01,131
<i>To return</i>

865
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:07,231
<i>with a withered brow,
and from the snow of time,</i>

866
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:10,245
<i>my temples white.</i>

867
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:13,241
<i>To feel</i>

868
01:14:13,882 --> 01:14:17,068
<i>that life is but a puff of wind,</i>

869
01:14:17,103 --> 01:14:20,255
<i>that 20 years are nothing,</i>

870
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:23,257
<i>that the fevered look,</i>

871
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:26,260
<i>stumbling in the shadows</i>

872
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:29,264
<i>seeks you and calls your name.</i>

873
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:31,766
<i>To live</i>

874
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:35,270
<i>with the soul held</i>

875
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:42,073
<i>by a sweet memory
which always makes me cry.</i>

876
01:15:13,275 --> 01:15:17,234
<i>I don't want to hear anyone say</i>

877
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:22,239
<i>that you forced me
out of your sweet life.</i>

878
01:15:23,285 --> 01:15:27,254
<i>My heart cries out for a lie</i>

879
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:32,259
<i>hoping for your impossible call.</i>

880
01:15:32,294 --> 01:15:36,263
<i>I don't want anyone to be able to know</i>

881
01:15:36,298 --> 01:15:41,303
<i>how bitter and deep
my eternal loneliness is.</i>

882
01:15:41,338 --> 01:15:43,270
<i>The hours go past</i>

883
01:15:43,305 --> 01:15:46,274
<i>and the minute hand</i>

884
01:15:47,309 --> 01:15:52,314
<i>grinds the nightmare
of its slow tick-tock.</i>

885
01:15:52,349 --> 01:15:54,281
It is very satisfying

886
01:15:54,316 --> 01:15:57,877
to see when you make people happy.

887
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:01,221
They want to hear a Tango from you,
and then you sing it to them.

888
01:16:02,257 --> 01:16:06,226
You enjoy that they are happy
with what you do.

889
01:16:06,261 --> 01:16:12,267
But, if I ever see that people only clap
out of a sense of duty, I will give up.

890
01:16:12,302 --> 01:16:17,227
<i>In the painful shadow
of my room I must wait,</i>

891
01:16:18,273 --> 01:16:22,777
<i>hoping for her footsteps
that may never come.</i>

892
01:16:22,812 --> 01:16:27,282
<i>Sometimes it seems to me
that she stops</i>

893
01:16:27,317 --> 01:16:31,241
<i>and dares not to come in.</i>

894
01:16:32,287 --> 01:16:34,255
<i>But no one is there</i>

895
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:37,258
<i>and she won't be coming.</i>

896
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:42,252
<i>It is a ghost
that my illusion creates.</i>

897
01:16:43,298 --> 01:16:47,257
<i>And when it vanishes,
it leaves only</i>

898
01:16:48,303 --> 01:16:52,262
<i>ashes in my heart.</i>

899
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:25,239
<i>Whilst the serene moon</i>

900
01:17:26,274 --> 01:17:30,233
<i>spreads in its silver light</i>

901
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:34,248
<i>like a suffering sob,</i>

902
01:17:36,284 --> 01:17:40,253
<i>you can hear the song.</i>

903
01:17:40,288 --> 01:17:45,258
<i>The sweet, heartfelt song</i>

904
01:17:45,293 --> 01:17:49,297
<i>that the whole quarter listened to</i>

905
01:17:49,332 --> 01:17:53,296
<i>when silence ruled</i>

906
01:17:53,331 --> 01:17:57,260
<i>in the old house.</i>

907
01:17:58,306 --> 01:18:02,208
<i>It was a girl from the suburbs,
so they say,</i>

908
01:18:03,245 --> 01:18:08,205
<i>the flower of her quarter,
whom the singer loved.</i>

909
01:18:09,251 --> 01:18:14,256
<i>For her alone, he sang of his love</i>

910
01:18:14,291 --> 01:18:17,225
<i>beneath her window.</i>

911
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:22,229
<i>But another love for that woman</i>

912
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:28,270
<i>grew in the heart
of the most notorious villain,</i>

913
01:18:28,305 --> 01:18:32,769
<i>and a street lantern saw
how, in a duel,</i>

914
01:18:32,804 --> 01:18:37,234
<i>in its weak light,
the two of them died.</i>

915
01:18:43,285 --> 01:18:47,244
Sometimes I think now,
"Damn! Why is this happening now?

916
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:51,259
Why didn't it
happen to me 30 years ago?"

917
01:18:52,294 --> 01:18:56,253
But it was God's will.
That was my life.

918
01:18:57,299 --> 01:18:59,267
I won't change anything.

919
01:19:00,235 --> 01:19:04,194
<i>That is why, a howl in the night</i>

920
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:09,209
<i>arises from the calm silence,</i>

921
01:19:09,244 --> 01:19:13,203
<i>becoming this song, like a broche</i>

922
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:19,209
<i>of that past love.</i>

923
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:24,214
<i>In her sadness,
the beautiful girl</i>

924
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:29,219
<i>opened herwings as far as she could</i>

925
01:19:30,265 --> 01:19:34,269
<i>and with her virtue and grace</i>

926
01:19:34,304 --> 01:19:38,228
<i>flew up to heaven...</i>

927
01:20:29,324 --> 01:20:31,292
Look, I'm trembling!

928
01:20:33,328 --> 01:20:34,294
Thank you!

929
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:39,289
You remind me how it was
25 years ago. No more.

930
01:20:40,335 --> 01:20:43,304
That's how long ago I started here.

931
01:20:43,371 --> 01:20:46,306
And it was easier and harder.

932
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:49,344
Easier, because we were like a family
and it's harder now

933
01:20:49,379 --> 01:20:52,313
because we had to start over.
But it is easier too,

934
01:20:53,348 --> 01:20:56,351
because we used to
sing standing on a block of wood

935
01:20:56,386 --> 01:20:59,319
without a mike and with a single guitar.

936
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:03,256
Now we have luxury accompaniment.
This is a luxury.

937
01:21:03,291 --> 01:21:08,296
May God grant them the success
they deserve. They really deserve it.

938
01:21:08,331 --> 01:21:11,265
A real luxury!

939
01:21:19,307 --> 01:21:23,266
<i>That the world was a mess
and will always be one, that I know.</i>

940
01:21:24,312 --> 01:21:28,281
<i>In the year 506
and in 2000 just the same.</i>

941
01:21:28,316 --> 01:21:32,320
<i>And that there were always
thieves, Machiavellis and victims,</i>

942
01:21:32,355 --> 01:21:34,823
<i>happy and bitter people,</i>

943
01:21:34,858 --> 01:21:37,291
<i>originals and imitations.</i>

944
01:21:38,326 --> 01:21:42,330
<i>But the fact that the 20th century
is a display of insolent malice,</i>

945
01:21:42,365 --> 01:21:45,299
<i>no one can deny.</i>

946
01:21:46,334 --> 01:21:49,302
<i>We live in a big mess</i>

947
01:21:49,337 --> 01:21:54,297
<i>and wallow in the same dirty mud...</i>

948
01:21:58,346 --> 01:21:59,313

it is a restaurant with a Tango show.
