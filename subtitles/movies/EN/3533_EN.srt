1
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:03,713
Becca?

2
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,143
Becca?

3
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:10,750
- Hey, Peg.
- It looks so nice back here.

4
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,720
Well, I'm just, you know,
trying to get things back into shape.

5
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:16,522
Listen, we were wondering
if you and Howie were free tonight.

6
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:19,928
- We're having a few people over for dinner.
- That's very sweet of you, Peg.

7
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:23,161
- I know, it's really short notice...
- Actually, we have plans.

8
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:28,701
But another time, though?
Yeah, I haven't talked to Pete in ages.

9
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:32,539
You haven't missed much.
He's still the same SOB he always was.

10
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,942
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

11
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,743
- It's okay.
- I'm so sorry.

12
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:41,877
- No, no, no. No, it's fine.
- These stupid feet.

13
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,454
Well, have a great dinner, Peg.

14
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:49,591
- We'll do it again next time.
- Yeah. Absolutely.

15
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,200
- Say hi to Howie for me.
- I sure will.

16
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,801
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

17
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:24,493
- Smells good in there.
- Hey, if Peg asks, we went out tonight.

18
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,301
Where did we go?

19
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:33,236
- Saw the Stoppard play.
- Really? Did we enjoy it?

20
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,137
Very much.

21
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:39,337
She asked us to dinner again.

22
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,176
- She's just being nice.
- You're more than welcome to go over there.

23
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:57,089
- And abandon your risotto?
- Careful, Howie. The pan's hot.

24
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:08,934
- Hey.
- Hey. I'm gonna hop in the shower.

25
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:13,139
About 20 minutes.

26
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,026
Hello?

27
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:41,396
What time is it?

28
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,170
What's going on?

29
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:50,779
Thank you.

30
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:04,162
- Have you got nothing to say?
- Thank you?

31
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:09,225
- You were in a bar fight.
- It wasn't a bar fight.

32
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:13,897
- You were in a bar fighting.
- It wasn't a fight.

33
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:17,339
Some drunk girl was screaming in my face,
so I hit her and that was the end of it.

34
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:20,105
- Well, who was she?
- I don't know.

35
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:23,006
People don't just scream at you
for no reason.

36
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:26,210
Sure they do! You should get out more.

37
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,517
- God, Izzy, it's so Jerry Springer.
- What does that mean?

38
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:32,284
What, do you think I'm trashy?

39
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:35,017
You can't keep doing this.
You're not a kid anymore.

40
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,618
I didn't know there was a cut-off date.

41
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:40,495
Yeah, for acting like a jackass,
there's a cut-off date.

42
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,124
I want to stop worrying about you.

43
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:46,628
Hey, don't worry about me.
She was the one on the floor.

44
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:50,642
Can I stay with you tonight?

45
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:08,725
I got you! I got you!

46
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:10,990
Danny, look at me when you turn back.

47
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,497
- He's getting juice.
- No, he's not.

48
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,364
Danny, look at this.

49
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:18,867
Now, Danny,
I'm gonna tell you a secret, okay?

50
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:21,906
When you go back down,
I want you to give Mom a big kiss, okay?

51
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:25,842
Ready? One, two, three. That was high!

52
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:32,309
- Danny, look at me when you come back.
- He's getting juice.

53
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:34,010
- You want any cake?
- Yes.

54
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,246
Do we have cake today?

55
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:36,378
- Yeah, we do.
- Yes.

56
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:39,014
- We do?
- No, it's brownies. Come on.

57
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,889
Oh, my gosh. You really want some.

58
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,609
Well, if it isn't Ma Barker.

59
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:10,780
I'm sure that would be very funny
if I knew who that was.

60
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,191
Rick and I are gonna play squash.
I have my cell if you need me.

61
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:17,888
- Yeah.
- Squash. You go play squash, Howie.

62
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,626
- You don't even know what squash is.
- I don't care what squash is.

63
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:23,527
Hello?

64
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,406
Yeah. Yeah!

65
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:31,873
She's gonna kill me.

66
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,973
Yeah, I know.
I think Auggie must have told her.

67
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,443
Hey, I gotta go. Bye.

68
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,316
Thank you, Becca.

69
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:46,518
I know what this stuff is now.

70
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:49,527
- I like the way it cracks.
- Of course you do.

71
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,721
So, did you know that woman?

72
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:55,300
My God, why are you listening
to my phone conversations?

73
00:08:55,401 --> 00:09:00,134
- You're sleeping with the girl's boyfriend.
- It's been over between them!

74
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:01,763
They're just living together
because of the rent.

75
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:05,776
- Then why did she accost you?
- Because she's a lunatic.

76
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:11,777
And Auggie must have told her
that I'm pregnant.

77
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,815
- You are not.
- You're gonna love him.

78
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:19,085
He's a really...
He's a great guy. He's a musician.

79
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,057
- Well, that's terrific.
- Yeah, he works.

80
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:24,823
He gets work as a musician.

81
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:28,265
- How long have you known?
- A few weeks.

82
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,032
Did you tell Mom?

83
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,367
Come on. You told Mom before me?

84
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:35,963
- I had to.
- Why didn't you tell me?

85
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,100
Why do you think?

86
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,509
I'm sorry, Becca.
I know the timing really sucks.

87
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:49,315
What are you gonna do?
I'm just glad you finally told me.

88
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:17,515
Debbie has been driving me crazy
with these kitchen renovations.

89
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,450
I tell you, the countertop negotiations alone.

90
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:23,249
I told you not to marry an agent.

91
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,587
She still hasn't called, you know.

92
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,224
No, I know.

93
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:33,390
I mean, I don't mean to be a pest about it,

94
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:36,127
but I just know Becca
would love to hear from her.

95
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,533
I know. I tell her, Howie, I do.

96
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,166
But she's still...

97
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:47,609
I don't know. Freaked out, I guess.

98
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:51,274
- It's been eight months.
- I know. I'll talk to her.

99
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:55,616
Thank you. Hey, how are the kids?

100
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:57,919
They're good.

101
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:01,749
Emily's doing ballet. Robbie is in T-ball.

102
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:05,625
T-ball.

103
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,196
Hey, have you guys talked at all
about having another?

104
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:17,464
No.

105
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,345
No, it's a little soon.

106
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:29,847
- Just be a little open. That's all I'm asking.
- I'm here, aren't I?

107
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:39,725
- Hey.
- How's it going?

108
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:42,164
Good, good. We're hanging in there.

109
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:44,760
- You sure?
- Yeah.

110
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,338
- Hey, Kevin.
- Hi. Hi.

111
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,601
Yeah, we... We just...

112
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:54,746
We found out
that Becca's sister is pregnant, so...

113
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,906
- Howie.
- What?

114
00:11:57,016 --> 00:12:00,679
That can be hard.
I remember when my cousin got pregnant.

115
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:03,584
Yeah, it's not really a big deal.

116
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:05,713
Okay.

117
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,991
If you want to talk about it, though,
you know, the group's here, so...

118
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,154
Yeah, no, I don't think so.

119
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:15,227
- "Hey, everybody, fresh meat."
- Becca, be nice.

120
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,063
Doesn't she remind you of Lydia?

121
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:19,603
There was this woman in our group
a couple of years ago.

122
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:22,401
It was four. Four years ago.

123
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,976
You know,
it doesn't really matter when she was here.

124
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,875
My point is, is that she reminds me of Lydia.

125
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:32,179
She really wasn't
into the support-group model at first.

126
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:36,414
- So, how long have you been in group?
- It'll be eight years in June.

127
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,820
I didn't... I didn't realize it was that long.

128
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,994
You know, we're the veterans.
You know, for us it's...

129
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,662
It's a good way to touch base.
Everyone's on a different schedule.

130
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,198
Of course. Of course.

131
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:02,844
She... You know,
she visits me sometimes in dreams

132
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:06,017
and she tells me it's okay,

133
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:12,486
that she's with God.
And we had some good days,

134
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:19,829
and you think that when you have enough
good days, it actually is gonna get better.

135
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,424
You know, it does get better and then...

136
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:27,128
- It was her anniversary last week and...
- A year last Tuesday.

137
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,566
And it just starts all over again.

138
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:37,314
We just have to remind each other that...

139
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:40,415
- It's just part of God's plan.
- Yeah.

140
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,387
And we can't know why.

141
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,917
You know, only God can know why.

142
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:55,365
God had to take her.
He needed another angel.

143
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,036
He needed another angel.

144
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:01,300
Why didn't he just make one?
Another angel.

145
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,706
I mean, he's God, after all.

146
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,404
Why didn't he just make another angel?

147
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,315
Just...

148
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:22,650
Just putting it out there.

149
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:28,322
I'd like to go.

150
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:34,361
I think we're gonna go.
Is that all right, honey?

151
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,211
Excuse us.

152
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:49,184
They're talking, it's their time,
and you have to respect that.

153
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,119
- Come on.
- I mean, you sit there for weeks

154
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,315
and you don't say a word...

155
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:55,188
I'm sorry. I can't stand the God freaks.
You know that.

156
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,421
But they're not all like that.
Kevin and Gaby aren't.

157
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:59,963
No. Kevin and Gaby
are professional wallowers.

158
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:03,626
I mean, come on. Eight years, Howie. Eight.

159
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,233
If that's what you want to become, then...

160
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:08,829
- If you want to take a break...
- No, not a break. I'm done.

161
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:13,501
- I know that Izzy stuff got under your skin.
- Please don't do that. Please.

162
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:18,242
One semester of psychology 15 years ago
and suddenly you can analyze...

163
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,408
Jesus, Becca.

164
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:21,145
I don't like the group.

165
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:24,381
- I gave it a try. It's not for me.
- Okay.

166
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,883
It's not for you.

167
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,224
Thank you.

168
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:36,961
Do you mind if we not eat here,
'cause nothing's really jumping out at me.

169
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:06,886
Taz! Stop, stop. Come here and eat.
Come on. Come on.

170
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:12,252
Stay. Sorry, he's not really dangerous. Eat.

171
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,558
- Yeah.
- He's just kind of dumb.

172
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:15,599
No, I know. He's my dog.

173
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,899
You're Becca.

174
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:23,031
I should have recognized you, of course.
I'm Auggie.

175
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,242
- Hi, Auggie.
- Hi.

176
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:28,040
Oh, my God!

177
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,445
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming over?

178
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,813
I would have picked up the house.

179
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:36,149
- That's Auggie.
- Yeah, we met. Is Izzy here?

180
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,985
Yeah, she's here.
She got fired from Applebee's.

181
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,754
I was planning on taking
it all down to Goodwill,

182
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:48,595
but now I'm glad that I didn't,
because look at these shirts.

183
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,724
Look at them. And these sweaters...

184
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:52,463
I don't know, Becca.
I mean, they're in baby clothes for so long.

185
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,971
It'll probably be a while
before he can even fit into that stuff.

186
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:59,033
No. It comes up very quickly, you'll see.
You're gonna be happy that I saved it.

187
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:03,272
- Is he living here?
- He has to. His girlfriend kicked him out.

188
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,907
- Ex-girlfriend.
- She knows what I meant.

189
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:09,454
- Did you see this one?
- That's cute. Look at that.

190
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:11,746
What if it's a girl?

191
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:14,655
Well, then...
I don't know, I'll give it to someone else.

192
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,988
But you're gonna... You're gonna thank me.

193
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,154
There's a couple of years' worth
of clothes here.

194
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,821
Think of all the money you're gonna save.

195
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,867
- It's not about the money.
- Well, it should be.

196
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:26,529
Come on, Izzy.
You gotta start thinking about that.

197
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:31,371
I mean, especially if the dad's a musician.
It costs a lot to raise a child, I'm telling you.

198
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:34,071
It would just be weird, Becca,

199
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:37,444
if it was a boy, to see him running around
in Danny's clothes.

200
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:40,249
I would just feel weird about it.

201
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:46,558
Yeah.

202
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:53,661
- I'm sorry. Of course it would be weird.
- It was a nice offer.

203
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:57,292
You're gonna get a lot of clothes.
Christmas, birthdays.

204
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,962
- You don't have anything to worry about.
- It's probably a girl, anyway.

205
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:02,199
You know,
I'm a little psychic about these things.

206
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:07,040
Remember, I said Sheila was having a girl?
And Karin!

207
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:11,947
- I think there's a girl in there.
- I hope there is. I mean, I want a girl.

208
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:15,451
I want it to be healthy, obviously,
but I really hope it's a girl.

209
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:16,748
Me, too.

210
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:20,255
You want some coffee cake?
I've got some coffee cake for us.

211
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,792
I'm actually gonna take off

212
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:25,591
because I promised Howie
that I'd pick up some dinner.

213
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:27,392
Looks good, though.

214
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,337
Here. Eat some cake.

215
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:45,427
- When did Rick ever beat me at squash?
- Did he mention Debbie at all?

216
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,165
You can call her, you know.
Get the reports directly.

217
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:53,472
I don't want to call her. She should call me.

218
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:59,577
I would have been there for her if anything
had ever happened to Robbie or Em.

219
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:06,047
I wouldn't have vanished the way she did.

220
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:10,395
I wouldn't.

221
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,223
Howie?

222
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,163
You know what I mean?

223
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,310
Yeah.

224
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,494
Howie.

225
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,406
Turn around.

226
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:03,076
Come on. You need to relax.

227
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:20,727
- Your shoulders are all knotted up.
- Yeah.

228
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:22,825
Yeah.

229
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:26,098
Forget about Debbie

230
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:30,203
and whatever else is bothering you.

231
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:37,472
I know what this is. Dimming the lights...

232
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,044
You're trying to seduce me.

233
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:44,714
You're plying me with... With liquor.

234
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:46,256
It worked in college.

235
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:55,626
That's enough. That's enough.

236
00:23:58,069 --> 00:23:59,366
Where are you going?

237
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:03,669
No, I just... I'm feeling antsy tonight.
I'm sorry. It just... It was a weird day.

238
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,414
- Right.
- What, now you're gonna pout?

239
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,640
- It's been eight months.
- But who's keeping track?

240
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,275
I am. I'm keeping track.

241
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,856
I'm not ready yet, Howie. All right? I'm just...

242
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,787
I'm sorry if you think that that's abnormal.

243
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:25,829
I don't.
I don't think it's abnormal at all, but...

244
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:26,989
So, what's the problem?

245
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:30,226
We need to at least head in that direction,
which might feel strange at first, but...

246
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:32,735
- But you want to have sex.
- Don't say it like that.

247
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:36,831
- You're trying to rope me into having sex.
- I am not. I wasn't roping you into sex.

248
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:38,569
- AI Green isn't roping?
- No.

249
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:41,544
- AI Green?
- I thought it was nice. That's all.

250
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,647
I was trying to make things nice.

251
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:47,684
You can't. You just can't, all right?

252
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:51,017
I'm sorry. Things aren't nice anymore.

253
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:00,456
Babe, will you hold him for a second?
Just hold him like that.

254
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:03,033
- Taz, quit it.
- Yeah, tell Taz to quit it.

255
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:05,830
- All right. Now...
- 'Cause Taz wants to go on the tire.

256
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:10,670
- Hold on. Let me see Mama and...
- Okay, you ready? I'm gonna let you go.

257
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:11,969
- Ready?
- Yes.

258
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:15,046
Here it goes. There!

259
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:16,977
- Keep your feet up.
- Danny.

260
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:19,347
- Look at me on the way back, Danny.
- Keep your feet up, Danny.

261
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:45,433
Hey.

262
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:52,176
If you're not gonna go to group,
I need you to see someone.

263
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:06,822
- Any plans for the day?
- You're looking at them.

264
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:12,028
- I'll see you tonight.
- Yeah.

265
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:23,766
I'm here to see Scott Baiter
in the Events department.

266
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:27,670
I don't have a Baiter listed.

267
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:30,780
That's weird.

268
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:37,546
- Kate Finn. What about Kate?
- I have a Robert Finn in Dec Arts.

269
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:42,354
If you have an appointment,
I can just call up there.

270
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,825
Who are you?

271
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:50,833
I... I don't have an appointment. I...
I'm an old friend. I used to work here.

272
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:52,163
Becca?

273
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:58,071
- Gary!
- Hey! What are you doing here?

274
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:01,944
I had some errands to run in the city and I...

275
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:05,346
I thought I'd pop in and say hello,
but apparently nobody works here anymore.

276
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:10,251
Yeah, no, Scott went over to Christie's
back in March. Traitor.

277
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,283
It's good to see
you're still doing the coffee runs, though.

278
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:17,452
No. No, no, no. I don't usually.
I'm in Scott's old job.

279
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:23,933
- Hey, how's the family?
- You know what, Gary, I...

280
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:28,831
I know how busy it gets up there,
so I'm gonna let you get back to it.

281
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,237
Yeah, that hasn't changed.

282
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:32,332
- It was great to see you, though.
- You, too.

283
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:27,590
- There are fines, you know?
- No, I know.

284
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:31,032
The book's quite overdue.
We sent out several notices.

285
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:33,730
- Yeah, that's why I'm here.
- $7.00.

286
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,207
Thank you.

287
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:56,392
Can I help you?

288
00:29:57,395 --> 00:30:01,354
Yeah, actually. Would it be possible
for me to check this out?

289
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,098
Certainly.

290
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:16,912
"'I will become a fish in a trout stream
and I will swim away from you."'

291
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:19,882
- He's an iguana.
- Yeah, he is.

292
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:24,453
"'Lf you become a fish in a trout stream,'
said his mother,

293
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:27,491
"'I will become a fisherman
and I will fish for you..."'

294
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:28,559
Sorry.

295
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,360
What do you think's gonna happen?

296
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:32,861
- I don't know.
- Let's see.

297
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:34,226
- Hey.
- Hey.

298
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:38,898
I just scored Yankee tickets off of Rowan.
Tonight. You interested?

299
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:43,806
- I can't. I got group.
- You can't skip one night?

300
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:47,108
They're right behind home plate.

301
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:51,239
- Another time.
- If there is one.

302
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:58,821
- You going stag tonight?
- Yeah.

303
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:02,222
No. Becca, she's...
She's gonna take a little break.

304
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,352
From the group.

305
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:08,629
I'm gonna get a coffee.

306
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:14,299
- Want to sit?
- Yeah.

307
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:23,871
- Hello?
- Hi, Mom. It's me.

308
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:25,779
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

309
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:30,281
I was thinking about making
Izzy's birthday cake. Would that be all right?

310
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,253
Honey, you don't have to do all that.

311
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:35,758
I was just gonna grab her
one of those Carvel things. She likes those.

312
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:40,160
I don't mind. I really don't.
I mean, it will give me something to do.

313
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:41,630
Okay, okay.

314
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,234
No group tonight?

315
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:47,827
Howie's there. It's too much God talk for me.

316
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:54,475
- What?
- Nothing. It's just that...

317
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,612
You know,
some people find that comforting.

318
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:59,478
Yeah, well, it pisses me off.

319
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:03,452
You know, Becca, when your brother died,
I found the church very helpful.

320
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:07,888
I know. I know you did, but that's you.
That's not me, and Danny...

321
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,988
Danny isn't Arthur.

322
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,255
You know,
I brought you to church every Sunday.

323
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:14,991
Let's not start this again, okay, Mom?

324
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:19,263
I'm just... I'm just calling about the cake.

325
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,770
You're not right about everything,
you know?

326
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:25,999
- What if there is a God?
- Then I'd say he's a sadistic prick.

327
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:30,570
- All right, Becca, that's enough.
- "Worship me and I'll treat you like shit."

328
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:34,749
No wonder you like him.
He sounds just like Dad.

329
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:41,955
I'm sorry.

330
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,287
You're gonna do the cake, then?

331
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:49,056
Yeah.

332
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:54,269
All right, I'll see you tomorrow.

333
00:32:57,709 --> 00:33:00,473
Who has a birthday party
in a bowling alley, anyway?

334
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:02,910
I mean, Izzy thinks she's still 14.

335
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:05,706
If you're not up for this, we don't have to go.

336
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,308
No, it's just a party. I'm fine.

337
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:16,485
I wish you'd take that thing out of here.

338
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:19,560
We're hardly in this car.
What's the difference?

339
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,394
It's weird. It feels weird.

340
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,538
What if we gave it another try?

341
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,867
- What?
- Another baby?

342
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:32,671
I mean, we're not getting any younger.

343
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:34,608
Is that what the sex thing
was about the other night?

344
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:37,044
- No.
- You're trying to get me pregnant.

345
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:38,945
Becca, no, of course not.

346
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:43,281
I know it's scary, but maybe it might

347
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:46,850
- help us get back on track.
- On track?

348
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:49,119
What, we can't talk about it?

349
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:52,587
I think we should sell the house.

350
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,927
I've been thinking about it,
and since we're on the topic...

351
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,967
What? What do you mean?
How are we on the topic?

352
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:59,059
I talked to a realtor,
and she thinks we can pull together...

353
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:02,264
- What do you mean, talked to a realtor?
...an open house pretty quickly, and then...

354
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,671
Why would you talk to a realtor
without telling me?

355
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:06,744
I'm telling you now.

356
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:09,938
You want us to get back on track,
I think it would help if we moved.

357
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,278
- We love that house.
- He's everywhere, Howie.

358
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,317
I can see his fingerprints on the door jams.

359
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:16,614
- I see puzzles, I see his highchair.
- I like seeing his fingerprints.

360
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,019
Yeah, but that's because you don't have
to sit and stare at it all day.

361
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:20,613
You get to go to work. You get to escape.

362
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,693
- Yeah, but I don't want to move!
- I don't want another baby!

363
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:24,585
Jesus!

364
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,369
- What are you doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?

365
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:35,598
I just had to check the cake. It's fine.

366
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:42,739
Are you kidding? The Kennedys?

367
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:44,712
With the assassinations
and the lobotomies?

368
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:45,908
- Yeah.
- Right here.

369
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:49,180
Yeah. That's not a curse, though.

370
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:52,688
- It's just bad luck.
- The plane crashes?

371
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,384
Too much money. That's their curse.

372
00:34:56,394 --> 00:35:00,626
If those Kennedys lived like normal people,
most of them would still be alive.

373
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:02,459
I think it's sad.

374
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:06,128
All those good-looking people
falling out of the sky like that.

375
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:08,165
It's a frigging waste.

376
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:11,000
- Didn't I say no wine?
- She brought it herself.

377
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:15,005
Isn't this nice?
Just sitting around talking politics like this?

378
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,172
I never do this. It's a nice change.

379
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:19,213
- Let's do gifts.
- Yes.

380
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,011
- Yeah, gifts!
- All right!

381
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:22,817
- Yes!
- Okay.

382
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:28,287
- It's heavy.
- So pretty. I hate to ruin it, but I will.

383
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:33,595
It's a bathroom set.

384
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:37,425
More of a practical gift.

385
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:42,097
Is this your way of telling me you don't like
my Three Stooges shower curtain?

386
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:46,208
- I didn't know what to get you, so...
- Seriously, it's great.

387
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:49,575
- Say thank you.
- Thank you, Becca. Thank you, Howie.

388
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,514
- Don't thank me, Becca picked it out.
- Now me.

389
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:58,410
- Thank you.
- I know it's a little early, but...

390
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:02,322
- Oh, my God!
- Lovely.

391
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:05,389
So sweet. Thank you, Mama.

392
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:11,263
I thought we weren't doing baby stuff
for the birthday.

393
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:14,566
I thought we were doing it...
We were waiting for the shower.

394
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:17,368
No, honey, it's not baby stuff,
it's mommy stuff.

395
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:20,205
This is perfect, Bec.
I needed a bathroom set.

396
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:23,906
- Yeah, but you need baby stuff more.
- We can take it back.

397
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,607
- That's right, we should.
- No.

398
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:27,741
I'm gonna get you a basket
of Mustela lotions.

399
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,581
- They prevent stretch marks.
- No. Becca, let it go.

400
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,382
You can get me the lotion another time.

401
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:35,152
- No, come on.
- You can get me the lotion another time!

402
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:38,194
I got it, I got it. It's okay. It's all right.

403
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,990
- I didn't...
- Thank you. Thank you, Becca.

404
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:47,829
Here.

405
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:59,274
I just remembered what I was gonna say
about Aristotle Onassis.

406
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:03,717
It was about the son
who died in a plane crash.

407
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:04,810
Are you ready to go?

408
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:06,514
You should have stopped him
from going off

409
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:10,651
on all that Kennedy stuff,
because my point was Onassis

410
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:14,128
and how he put up a reward
to anyone who could prove

411
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:17,326
that someone had sabotaged
his son's plane.

412
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:21,303
He was so desperate to blame somebody.
Did you read this?

413
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:28,635
- He needed a reason for losing his son.
- Mom, why are you telling this story?

414
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:32,744
- I'm just talking. I can't talk?
- You never just talk.

415
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,842
You guys, thanks for coming to my party.
Becca, the cake was so good.

416
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:38,649
You forget what I went through
when your brother died.

417
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,020
You think I don't know anything,
but I do, Becca.

418
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:44,492
- Like who to blame?
- Guys, please. It's my birthday party.

419
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:48,326
- No, let it go. That's their stuff.
- No, I'm not talking about blame.

420
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,593
- I'm talking about comfort.
- Comfort.

421
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:52,931
- Where are you getting it?
- Comfort? I'm not.

422
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:54,004
Well, I think you should.

423
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:57,006
Okay, well, let me get on that
and see what I can dig up on eBay.

424
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,633
I'm just trying to help you, Becca.

425
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:02,872
You know, I wish somebody had given me
a little advice when Arthur died.

426
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,969
You know what I wish?

427
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:06,606
I wish you would stop comparing Danny
to Arthur.

428
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:08,150
- Becca.
- Danny was a 4-year-old boy

429
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:09,776
who chased his dog into the street,

430
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,822
and Arthur was a 30-year-old heroin addict
who OD'd.

431
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:17,223
Frankly, I resent
how you keep lumping them together, Mom.

432
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:19,319
He was still my son.

433
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,709
We're gonna go.
I hope you enjoy the bathroom set, Izzy.

434
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:34,778
I'm gonna.

435
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:49,222
When Arthur died
I was just as upset as she was,

436
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,387
but I didn't take it out on other people.

437
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:55,822
What about Mrs. Bailey?

438
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:59,397
Nobody's talking about Mrs. Bailey.

439
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:32,597
- Hey, did you call that guy about the roof?
- No, I couldn't find the number.

440
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:37,099
Becca, it's in my phone. It's on the mantle.

441
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,769
What's his name?

442
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:46,308
It's not under his name.

443
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:49,652
Then how am I supposed to call him if I...

444
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:52,245
- It's under "roof guy."
- "Roof guy."

445
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:59,828
- Well, what was I supposed to put it under?
- I don't know how to use this.

446
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:07,462
- It doesn't...
- No. Okay, now scroll down.

447
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,836
- Now what? You do it.
- Scroll down with your finger.

448
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:17,205
- Roof guy.
- Thank you.

449
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:18,804
You're welcome.

450
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:37,898
Are you waiting for me?

451
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:44,531
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry.
I thought that you took the bus.

452
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:48,168
- I do.
- But not today.

453
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,280
Not today. I skipped school.

454
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,214
Well, you shouldn't be playing hooky,
young man.

455
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,118
Why are you waiting for me?

456
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,729
I thought we could talk.

457
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:09,689
About what?

458
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:17,799
- Is this okay?
- Yeah, it's fine.

459
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,578
- Not too weird?
- No.

460
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:25,309
I mean...

461
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:28,779
No, I know, it's...

462
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:32,252
It's weird for me, too.

463
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:38,790
- Don't you like school?
- I like it all right.

464
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:43,126
I just thought 'cause you...
I don't know, you seem to not be going, so...

465
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:46,567
I've been accepted to college already, so...

466
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:50,799
- Not a big deal, then.
- No, it is a big deal,

467
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:53,342
but only if my mother finds out.

468
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:57,907
She said she would confiscate my phone
if I did it again.

469
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,347
Not that I use my phone anyway.

470
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:02,612
- So, where are you headed?
- Connecticut College.

471
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,814
Right. That's a good school. Not far.

472
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:11,552
I bet your parents are pleased
that you're gonna be close by.

473
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:15,063
It's just my mom, but, yeah,
she's pretty happy about it.

474
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:16,996
She keeps saying she's gonna apply
to the grad program

475
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:19,331
so she can keep an eye on me
while I'm up there.

476
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:23,273
- She's just joking, though.
- Yeah.

477
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:26,002
She's not really looking forward to it,
'cause I'm the only one at home now,

478
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:30,240
but I told her I'd come home
on the weekends and stuff if I could.

479
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:33,747
Well, that'll be nice.

480
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,782
So...

481
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,025
I'm sorry.

482
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:49,358
I know.

483
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:53,793
- You don't have to...
- I know that doesn't help.

484
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,099
No, it does, it really does, but...

485
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:58,697
- I know I should have tried to get in touch...
- It's fine.

486
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:05,114
I just really wish I had driven down
a different block that day.

487
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,077
I know.

488
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:16,849
You know, I should maybe go.

489
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:18,984
It's all right.

490
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:22,998
No, I gotta... My mom's gonna start
to wonder where I'm at.

491
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:26,028
It's okay. You really don't have to. It's...

492
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,774
Can we do this again sometime?

493
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:36,211
Sure.

494
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:38,039
Okay.

495
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:18,786
Jesus Christ.

496
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:20,481
- Hey, Gaby.
- I can't... I know.

497
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:22,650
God, I can't believe you just saw me do that.

498
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,950
I didn't mean to sneak up on you.

499
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:30,295
I thought something was wrong,
but, obviously, everything smells fine.

500
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:33,768
You can smell it, huh? God.

501
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,805
- Everyone in there's gonna know.
- Nah.

502
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:41,901
- I swear I never do this.
- Where's Kevin?

503
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:45,542
He's not coming to group.

504
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:49,813
And I blame your wife, by the way,
'cause I think she put the idea in his head.

505
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:52,645
Yeah, well, he didn't really seem
to like group all that much.

506
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:57,952
God, you know, he's got me so upset.
I mean, like, look at me. I'm... I'm...

507
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:02,723
I am smoking pot in a parking lot.

508
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:05,529
It's like I'm in high school. It's...
I'm ridiculous.

509
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:07,399
You got any more?

510
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,432
Yeah.

511
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:14,405
Come on in, partner.

512
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,439
Well, if today is rage day,

513
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:26,519
most of you know that I'm a little bit
more comfortable with rage,

514
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:28,318
talking about rage.

515
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,592
I deal with rage every single day.

516
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:37,225
I listen to guys at work going on and on

517
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:45,601
about paving their driveways or whatever.
Stupid nonsense.

518
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:52,580
They don't know.
They haven't had their lives ripped apart yet.

519
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:55,449
- They're not in the club.
- Exactly.

520
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:58,280
Meanwhile, I'm like,

521
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:02,952
"Hey, guys, my daughter died of leukemia."

522
00:46:06,363 --> 00:46:08,797
I'm sorry. I have to get some water.

523
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:20,173
You're one of those bad kids
my mother warned me about.

524
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:25,078
Yes, yeah, I am corrupting you.
But don't worry, I won't tell Becca.

525
00:46:25,649 --> 00:46:27,378
I'd appreciate that.

526
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:30,745
- Bye.
- Good night.

527
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:42,760
Becca?

528
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,595
- Becca? What'd you do here?
- What?

529
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:48,971
- God damn it.
- What?

530
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:52,667
- What'd you do to my phone?
- Jesus, Howie, I thought something had...

531
00:46:52,776 --> 00:46:55,836
This morning, when you used it,
what did you do to my phone?

532
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:57,072
Nothing, I just...

533
00:46:57,181 --> 00:46:59,706
- I just got the number for the roof guy.
- For God's sake.

534
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:02,581
- What? You told me to call him.
- You deleted Danny's video.

535
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:05,513
No. No, I didn't. No.

536
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:08,352
I just... You were right there.
I just got the number.

537
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:10,892
Yeah, and you kept pressing the screen.

538
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,019
Because I couldn't figure out
how to use your phone.

539
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:15,598
- I checked already, it's gone.
- We have 100 videos of him.

540
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:17,132
That's not the point, Becca.

541
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:19,065
Then... Then you should
have put it on your computer.

542
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:22,696
- Right, right, it's my fault.
- I didn't say that.

543
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:26,504
- I said it's gone!
- Jesus, Howie! I didn't do it on purpose!

544
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:29,170
- Are you sure?
- What does that mean?

545
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,440
What, you think I deliberately
deleted his video?

546
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:32,742
I don't know.

547
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:36,950
- You don't know?
- It's like you're trying to get rid of him.

548
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:39,921
I'm sorry, but that's how it feels.
Every day it's something new.

549
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,183
- Really?
- Yeah.

550
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:44,260
It's like you're trying to get rid
of any evidence he was ever here.

551
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:47,490
- What? You took the paintings off the fridge.
- To save them.

552
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:50,934
- To save them. They are in a box downstairs.
- Okay, his clothes.

553
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,366
We don't need all that stuff, Howie.
We just don't.

554
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:56,234
You wanting to sell the house.
Your sending Taz to your mother's.

555
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:58,331
There's a lot going on.
The dog got underfoot.

556
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:01,377
- Right. And he was a reminder.
- Yes, yes, he is a reminder.

557
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:04,811
- And since you never wanted the dog...
- I wanted one less reminder. For God's sake.

558
00:48:04,915 --> 00:48:07,475
If I hadn't bought the dog,
Danny would still be alive.

559
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:11,350
If I hadn't have run back in to get the phone,
if I had latched that gate...

560
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:12,683
I left the gate unlatched!

561
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:16,156
Come on, I'm not playing this game again,
Howie, I'm not!

562
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:19,286
- It's no one's fault, and I'm not...
- Not even the dog's!

563
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:21,830
Dogs chase squirrels! Boys chase dogs!

564
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:24,662
- I know that.
- He loved that dog and you got rid of it!

565
00:48:24,768 --> 00:48:26,292
Just like I'm getting rid of the video, huh?

566
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:29,531
It's not about the video, Becca.
It's not about the video!

567
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,006
It's not just the video,
it's about Taz and the paintings

568
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:35,374
and his clothes and everything!
There's no pictures of him around!

569
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:38,277
There's no fingerprints! There's nothing!
God damn it!

570
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:42,417
You have to stop erasing him!
You have to stop it!

571
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:46,922
Do you really think that I don't see him
every second of every day?

572
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:52,828
The video was an accident, Howie,
and believe me,

573
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,296
I will beat myself up about it forever,
I'm sure,

574
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:57,026
just like everything else
I could have prevented.

575
00:48:57,134 --> 00:49:00,228
- That's not what I want, Becca.
- No? Because it feels like it is.

576
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:03,431
It feels like maybe
I don't feel badly enough for you.

577
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:06,976
Maybe I'm not feeling enough.
What do you want from me?

578
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:14,817
Something's got to change, because this...

579
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:19,250
I can't do this like this anymore. It's...

580
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:24,991
It's too hard. It's too hard.

581
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:30,692
And I want that dog back.

582
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:34,195
- Your mother's making him fat.
- Howie.

583
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:41,636
I miss the dog.
I'm sorry, but I miss him. I want him back.

584
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:14,810
- Did you really make these?
- I did.

585
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:18,078
That's good.

586
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:23,652
- They're still warm.
- I'm glad you like them.

587
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:35,695
I've been reading that book,
the parallel universe book.

588
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,999
Yeah? Did you like it?

589
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:44,472
Yeah. It's interesting. I don't know if I buy it,

590
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:49,803
the whole alternate reality thing, I just...
I don't know.

591
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:52,412
But it's interesting.

592
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:57,876
- Did you have to do it for a school project?
- No, it's research.

593
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:01,952
Research?

594
00:51:10,934 --> 00:51:12,561
It's a comic book.

595
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,338
It's impressive.

596
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,507
- Did you do all of this?
- Yeah.

597
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:21,943
Wow. It's amazing.

598
00:51:23,613 --> 00:51:28,016
- What's it about?
- A scientist, I guess, and his son. The...

599
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:34,213
The father discovers this network of holes
that leads to other galaxies and...

600
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:39,819
- Parallel universes.
- Yeah, and, well, the scientist dies,

601
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:44,264
so the son has to go into this rabbit hole

602
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:48,667
to try and find him,
but it's not him because he's dead,

603
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,673
so it's, like, another version of him.

604
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:01,249
It's kind of stupid.

605
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,514
- No.
- No? Okay.

606
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:07,112
Not at all. I would love to read it.

607
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:16,224
Yeah, it's... Sorry. It's not...
It's not done yet, but when it is done, I will...

608
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:17,856
I will let you read it.

609
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:18,957
- Okay.
- Okay.

610
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,404
I don't want you to feel uncomfortable.

611
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,280
I... I...

612
00:52:31,381 --> 00:52:33,645
I might have been going too fast

613
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:36,283
on that day.

614
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:40,052
I mean, I'm not sure, but I might have been,

615
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,489
so that's something
I've been wanting to tell you.

616
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:50,064
It's a 30 zone,
and I might have been going 31 or 32.

617
00:52:51,968 --> 00:52:55,096
I usually look down and check,
and if I'm going over

618
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:56,570
then I would slow down, obviously,

619
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:59,767
but I don't remember checking
on your block.

620
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:06,211
So, it's possible
that I was going too fast and...

621
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:15,148
And... Well, the dog ran out really fast,
you know?

622
00:53:15,258 --> 00:53:18,227
So I swerved. I didn't know.

623
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:21,196
I didn't know.

624
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:27,537
I thought you should know,

625
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:31,931
I might have been going
a little over the limit,

626
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:34,737
and I can't be positive.

627
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:39,546
- Okay.
- Okay.

628
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:41,541
Yeah.

629
00:53:43,186 --> 00:53:44,244
All right.

630
00:53:45,488 --> 00:53:47,149
Okay.

631
00:53:49,326 --> 00:53:50,623
Thank you.

632
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:24,618
I don't want to go in there.

633
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,067
Yes, yes, yes!

634
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:44,145
- I'm sorry. It was...
- Be nice.

635
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:57,317
- My God.
- Come on.

636
00:54:57,427 --> 00:54:59,691
- I'm sorry, you suck.
- I would be doing better,

637
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:03,698
but your pot messed up
my depth perception.

638
00:55:07,203 --> 00:55:08,636
- All right.
- Yeah.

639
00:55:08,738 --> 00:55:11,229
I'm gonna support that one.
I'm totally gonna support that one.

640
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:12,638
Thank you.

641
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:16,943
Hey. You know what?
I have a confession to make.

642
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:21,450
- Remember when I said Kevin left group?
- Yeah.

643
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,485
What I meant to say was

644
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:29,155
he left me.

645
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:33,860
He left me.

646
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:39,565
Yeah, I...

647
00:55:41,604 --> 00:55:43,435
I came home and he was gone.

648
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:49,705
- God, no note or...
- No. God, there was a note. Well, not...

649
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:53,477
Not a note so much as a manifesto

650
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:59,018
on all the ways
that we were destroying each other.

651
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:02,224
I'm sorry.

652
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:06,395
I mean, this is how it generally goes, right?

653
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:12,262
It changes you. It literally changes people.

654
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:17,962
You know,
a part of me thinks it was inevitable.

655
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:24,402
I love my wife.

656
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:29,476
Of course you do.

657
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:32,617
I love her very much.

658
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:36,216
Okay.

659
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:57,409
I... I think you're right. We should maybe

660
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:01,509
look into selling the house.

661
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,687
It's probably for the best.

662
00:57:06,322 --> 00:57:07,380
Okay.

663
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:35,375
Don't do that. Quick as a Band-Aid
or we'll never get through this. Here.

664
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:43,283
Hi, kids.
Welcome to the light-up alphabet apple.

665
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:45,520
- Hi, kids...
- I don't know how to turn it off.

666
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:47,755
Only people without children
give gifts like this.

667
00:57:47,864 --> 00:57:50,628
- Come on. Come on. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

668
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:52,997
I hope you'll visit again soon.

669
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:59,366
- So, have you heard from Debbie yet?
- Nope.

670
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,376
That's too bad.

671
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:06,575
Although, it can be worse the other way.
You know, I remember when Arthur died...

672
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:07,980
You can say his name.

673
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:10,352
- Can I?
- Yes.

674
00:58:10,453 --> 00:58:13,251
You know, I don't know your rules.
I don't want to get scolded again.

675
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:16,553
You can talk about Arthur.
I just don't like the comparisons.

676
00:58:20,396 --> 00:58:21,488
Okay.

677
00:58:22,432 --> 00:58:26,391
- So, how's it worse?
- You remember Maureen Bailey?

678
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,035
Yeah.

679
00:58:29,138 --> 00:58:32,835
Well, I couldn't get rid of her
after your brother passed away.

680
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:35,342
- She was always at the house.
- Yeah, I remember that.

681
00:58:35,445 --> 00:58:39,609
Yeah, well, you know,
I never had a moment to myself,

682
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:41,843
so finally,
in the middle of coffee one afternoon,

683
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:44,545
I said, "Maureen, why are you always here?"

684
00:58:44,654 --> 00:58:46,485
- And what'd she say?
- She said,

685
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:49,683
"I want to be there, Nat.
I want to share in your grief."

686
00:58:49,792 --> 00:58:52,352
And I said, "Well, it's not working.

687
00:58:52,462 --> 00:58:54,930
"You plant your fat ass in that chair
every fricking day."

688
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,157
You did not say that!

689
00:58:56,266 --> 00:58:57,290
- I did.
- Mom!

690
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,231
- I did say that.
- You said "fat ass"?

691
00:58:59,335 --> 00:59:01,496
She sucks up all my coffee.

692
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:05,005
"And I don't see you leaving
with any of this alleged grief you're sharing.

693
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:08,475
"In fact, the only thing you do take out
of here are my cinnamon buns."

694
00:59:08,945 --> 00:59:14,679
- So I never saw her again, obviously.
- Oh, my God, I can't believe you said that.

695
00:59:15,084 --> 00:59:16,483
I feel guilty now.

696
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:18,747
- You do not.
- I do.

697
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:22,920
You're right. I... I don't miss her at all.

698
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:45,879
Okay, moving right along.
That takes care of Taz.

699
00:59:49,285 --> 00:59:50,752
The old apple pie trick, eh?

700
00:59:52,355 --> 00:59:56,951
For the open house.
Warm baked goods make it feel homier.

701
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:01,124
No, I'm just... I'm just making a pie.

702
01:00:02,198 --> 01:00:05,531
I thought you were doing it
for the open house.

703
01:00:05,635 --> 01:00:11,835
- So... Now. Now, you're not going to stay?
- God, no. No, no. You shouldn't either.

704
01:00:13,643 --> 01:00:14,610
You shouldn't.

705
01:00:14,711 --> 01:00:18,112
Come on.
Becca, I'm not going to bother anyone.

706
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:22,344
So we have the garbage cans in the back,
the sign out front, I mowed the lawn.

707
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:26,013
I thought we'd set the sign-in sheet here.
We can move through the living room.

708
01:00:26,322 --> 01:00:27,516
That's fine.

709
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:30,889
Now, my wife's gonna hide out,
but I'll stick around, if that's okay with you.

710
01:00:32,061 --> 01:00:34,188
Sure. However you want to do it.

711
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:36,966
- Okay. Perfect.
- Okay.

712
01:00:37,066 --> 01:00:38,624
- Bye, babe.
- Bye.

713
01:00:40,703 --> 01:00:42,637
Think that's everything.

714
01:01:09,432 --> 01:01:10,399
I know, it's just gorgeous...

715
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,435
Southern-western exposures. Sun all day.

716
01:01:14,537 --> 01:01:17,267
- Why don't we take a look upstairs?
- That's a great idea. I'll show you.

717
01:01:17,373 --> 01:01:18,397
- Good. Cool.
- Follow me.

718
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,635
- Come on, honey.
- It's on 3l4 of an acre,

719
01:01:20,743 --> 01:01:23,974
which is the largest lot in the neighborhood.

720
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,412
We can start with the master bedroom
if you want to see that.

721
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:28,279
Wait. What's in here?

722
01:01:30,987 --> 01:01:34,013
Well... This is... This is...

723
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:37,455
This would be a good room
for the little guy, obviously.

724
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:39,528
How about that, buddy? You like this room?

725
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:43,161
- Careful with that.
- Sweetheart. That's not our stuff.

726
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:45,928
- Thank you.
- So, how old's your son?

727
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:49,232
This is your son's room, I assume?

728
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:53,470
It... It was. It was his room.

729
01:01:53,576 --> 01:01:58,172
But he died, my son. He died.
There was a car right out front.

730
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:02,344
- Oh, my God.
- I'm...

731
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,018
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

732
01:02:06,656 --> 01:02:09,648
This must be so difficult for you.

733
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:12,955
It's... It's pretty weird.

734
01:02:15,498 --> 01:02:18,865
It's funny because I still...
I forget that he's not here sometimes.

735
01:02:18,968 --> 01:02:21,903
Like maybe he's just hiding under the bed,
he's gonna pop out like he used to do.

736
01:02:23,306 --> 01:02:24,603
But...

737
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:29,168
I still feel him here.

738
01:02:35,218 --> 01:02:38,449
- Would you like to see the master bedroom?
- Yeah. Okay, come on.

739
01:02:38,988 --> 01:02:41,479
Yeah. Sure, I'll be there.

740
01:02:43,826 --> 01:02:46,693
- Who's that?
- Becca. She wants to hang out.

741
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:53,402
- This was a good idea.
- It's nice, right?

742
01:02:54,837 --> 01:02:56,702
God, you're starting to show so early.

743
01:02:56,806 --> 01:02:59,434
I know. I feel like a big old balloon.

744
01:02:59,542 --> 01:03:02,033
I swear, once this kid is born,
I'm going right to the gym.

745
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:05,206
While Mom watches the baby.

746
01:03:05,915 --> 01:03:08,884
What does that mean,
"While Mom watches the baby"?

747
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:12,284
While you're at the gym,
Mom can watch the baby. She loves that.

748
01:03:12,388 --> 01:03:16,017
Auggie could watch the baby.
He works at night, so he'll be home.

749
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:17,456
Okay. Auggie then.

750
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:21,360
I resent the feeling that I get from you
that I don't deserve this baby.

751
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:23,932
Or that I'm not mature enough
or smart enough to take care of it.

752
01:03:24,033 --> 01:03:27,434
I mean, my God, if Mom could do it,
how hard could it be?

753
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:38,974
- This all right?
- Yeah. It's fine.

754
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:42,346
I've just got to pick up a few things
and then we can do lunch.

755
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:45,614
- Okay. Yeah.
- They're made of strawberries.

756
01:03:45,888 --> 01:03:49,016
Mommy, please,
can I have some Fruit Roll-Ups?

757
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:52,253
- No, Sammy. You know the answer.
- Please?

758
01:03:52,595 --> 01:03:55,564
- Can I have some, please?
- Sammy, no.

759
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:57,758
I want the Fruit Roll-Ups.

760
01:03:57,867 --> 01:04:00,427
- Not happening.
- Please, I'll be good.

761
01:04:00,536 --> 01:04:01,901
- Stop it.
- Please.

762
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:03,767
- No. You're not gonna get them.
- I promise.

763
01:04:03,873 --> 01:04:07,741
You know what? It's only three bucks.
Why don't you give him the Roll-Ups?

764
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:11,505
Not that it's any of your business,

765
01:04:11,614 --> 01:04:14,708
but we don't allow candy in our house,
and my son knows that.

766
01:04:14,817 --> 01:04:17,308
Come on, it's just fruit.
Why don't you give him the treat?

767
01:04:17,653 --> 01:04:18,620
Are you a mom?

768
01:04:20,456 --> 01:04:22,686
Yeah, I didn't think so. Excuse me.

769
01:04:25,995 --> 01:04:28,486
Go to the car. Becca, go to the car.

770
01:04:28,598 --> 01:04:30,190
Sammy, it's okay.

771
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:34,600
She just lost her son eight months ago,
and she's not feeling really very well.

772
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:36,137
- I'm so sorry...
- I don't care.

773
01:04:37,573 --> 01:04:39,006
Mommy's okay.

774
01:04:48,317 --> 01:04:50,148
- Hey-hey.
- Hey.

775
01:04:51,354 --> 01:04:52,616
Fun day out?

776
01:04:55,324 --> 01:04:58,782
- How'd it go here?
- Not so good. Not so good.

777
01:04:59,695 --> 01:05:03,461
I think we need to clean out that room.

778
01:05:05,968 --> 01:05:06,935
Okay.

779
01:05:07,036 --> 01:05:10,403
Maybe make it into a guest room
or something.

780
01:05:10,506 --> 01:05:12,235
Don't get any ideas.

781
01:05:17,046 --> 01:05:18,172
Jesus.

782
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:21,409
Hello.

783
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:26,777
The door was wide open, so...

784
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:30,851
- And I knocked, but...
- Taz, shut up!

785
01:05:31,394 --> 01:05:34,659
I saw the sign out front,
so I thought it'd be okay to...

786
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:36,595
- Looking to buy a house?
- Howie.

787
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:37,688
No.

788
01:05:39,468 --> 01:05:42,460
No, I just came to give you this.

789
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:45,768
I said I'd let you read it
when it was done, so...

790
01:05:49,545 --> 01:05:50,603
What is this?

791
01:05:52,048 --> 01:05:53,015
Thank you.

792
01:05:55,251 --> 01:05:59,085
We bumped into each other in the...
In the library.

793
01:06:00,723 --> 01:06:04,557
And... And we decided to meet.

794
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:08,587
You decided to meet?

795
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:12,028
Yeah. Couple of times.

796
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:13,123
Okay.

797
01:06:13,235 --> 01:06:15,703
- Sorry. I didn't realize that you...
- It's...

798
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:19,437
- Did you meet here?
- No. No. We met in the park.

799
01:06:22,578 --> 01:06:23,704
You met in the park.

800
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:27,339
Yeah.

801
01:06:28,184 --> 01:06:29,515
So, my wife

802
01:06:31,087 --> 01:06:34,147
agrees to meet you in a public place,
and you...

803
01:06:35,624 --> 01:06:38,115
And you what? You apologize?

804
01:06:39,095 --> 01:06:41,689
- I guess.
- You guess? Okay.

805
01:06:42,965 --> 01:06:46,423
- Okay. Okay. You apologize and...
- Come on, Howie, that's enough now.

806
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:47,797
- And then what?
- That's enough.

807
01:06:47,903 --> 01:06:49,996
- Look at me.
- Howie. That is enough.

808
01:06:50,106 --> 01:06:52,472
- What is that?
- It's a comic book.

809
01:06:52,575 --> 01:06:56,739
It's a comic book? A comic book.
Did she tell you to bring it here?

810
01:06:57,413 --> 01:06:58,971
- No, she didn't.
- No, she didn't,

811
01:06:59,081 --> 01:07:01,208
because this is our house!

812
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:04,809
And just because there's a sign out front
doesn't mean that you can pop in!

813
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:08,356
- Howie, all right. All right.
- And you just don't... No, it's not all right!

814
01:07:08,457 --> 01:07:10,755
You just don't walk into somebody's home
like that!

815
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:14,822
- You should show a little fucking respect!
- I gotta go.

816
01:07:16,932 --> 01:07:18,627
You're an asshole.

817
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:21,936
Wait! Wait, Jason! Wait a minute. I'm sorry!

818
01:07:22,671 --> 01:07:24,161
I'm an asshole.

819
01:07:37,586 --> 01:07:39,747
Taz, stop it.

820
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:53,425
Taz! Taz!

821
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:56,203
Taz, stop it!

822
01:08:00,209 --> 01:08:01,198
Buddy.

823
01:08:36,846 --> 01:08:38,905
Why didn't you tell me?

824
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:45,743
Same reason you don't tell me
why you come home reeking of pot.

825
01:09:26,061 --> 01:09:27,824
Does it ever go away?

826
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:33,067
No.

827
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:39,100
I don't think it does. Not for me, it hasn't.
It's going on 11 years.

828
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:44,441
It changes, though.

829
01:09:46,715 --> 01:09:48,012
How?

830
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:51,652
I don't know.

831
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:59,492
The weight of it, I guess.
At some point, it becomes bearable.

832
01:10:00,596 --> 01:10:04,589
It turns into something
that you can crawl out from under

833
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:07,669
and carry around like a brick in your pocket.

834
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:14,241
And you even forget it for a while,
but then you reach in for whatever reason,

835
01:10:16,111 --> 01:10:17,669
and there it is.

836
01:10:19,648 --> 01:10:21,115
"Right. That."

837
01:10:22,785 --> 01:10:24,343
Which can be awful.

838
01:10:25,588 --> 01:10:27,351
But not all the time.

839
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:29,880
It's kind of...

840
01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:37,263
Not that you like it, exactly,
but it's what you've got instead of your son.

841
01:10:37,366 --> 01:10:40,597
So, you carry it around.

842
01:10:46,609 --> 01:10:49,476
And it doesn't go away.

843
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:53,745
Which is...

844
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:57,218
Which is what?

845
01:11:02,057 --> 01:11:05,117
Fine. Actually.

846
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:17,187
Hello?

847
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:18,789
Hi.

848
01:12:20,135 --> 01:12:22,433
Hi, it's Howie.

849
01:12:25,307 --> 01:12:27,502
Howie Corbett from group.

850
01:12:29,645 --> 01:12:30,942
Hi, Howie.

851
01:12:38,287 --> 01:12:39,914
There you go, boy.

852
01:12:42,658 --> 01:12:44,888
- Hey.
- Hi.

853
01:12:44,993 --> 01:12:46,187
You going to group?

854
01:12:46,295 --> 01:12:49,093
- Yeah. You didn't want to go, did you?
- No.

855
01:13:27,302 --> 01:13:29,770
...the president, essentially, will get up.

856
01:13:29,872 --> 01:13:31,100
What do you think?

857
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:45,246
Hi, it's Jason. Please leave a message.

858
01:14:20,189 --> 01:14:21,781
You find the house okay?

859
01:14:26,061 --> 01:14:27,187
Howie?

860
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:21,339
I'm sorry.

861
01:16:45,534 --> 01:16:46,660
Becca?

862
01:16:51,974 --> 01:16:53,100
Becca?

863
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:57,738
Becca?

864
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:03,243
Becca?

865
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:21,052
God!

866
01:18:23,298 --> 01:18:24,424
Sorry.

867
01:18:26,435 --> 01:18:29,734
- What time is it?
- Almost 6:00.

868
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:33,735
And you're just getting home?

869
01:18:49,091 --> 01:18:51,889
- So, how was it?
- It was okay.

870
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:56,527
- Well, you look nice.
- Thank you.

871
01:18:58,433 --> 01:19:00,594
Is she your girlfriend?

872
01:19:01,369 --> 01:19:03,929
No, she's just a friend.

873
01:19:04,039 --> 01:19:06,439
- She's pretty.
- Yeah.

874
01:19:07,342 --> 01:19:08,809
She is pretty.

875
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:13,643
I liked this so much.

876
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:20,151
- It's... Well, it's beautiful.
- Thank you. Thanks.

877
01:19:20,522 --> 01:19:25,152
It reminded me of Eurydice and Orpheus.
Do you know that myth?

878
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:26,887
No.

879
01:19:27,662 --> 01:19:30,722
Eurydice dies,
and Orpheus misses her so much

880
01:19:30,832 --> 01:19:36,532
that he travels to Hades to retrieve her and...
Well, in the end, it doesn't work out.

881
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:40,132
I should read it.

882
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:44,342
So, is the scientist your dad?

883
01:19:45,313 --> 01:19:48,680
- The scientist that the boy's looking for?
- No.

884
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:52,986
- Is it based on him?
- No, my dad was an English teacher.

885
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:55,590
I was curious about that.

886
01:19:56,291 --> 01:19:58,191
It's just a story.

887
01:19:58,293 --> 01:20:00,955
- I know. I was just...
- Reading into it.

888
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:09,634
- Do you think they're real?
- Parallel universes?

889
01:20:13,175 --> 01:20:14,904
I think it's basic science.

890
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:19,170
You know, if space is infinite,

891
01:20:19,281 --> 01:20:21,272
then everything's possible.

892
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:25,486
So, somewhere out there, I'm what?
I'm making pancakes?

893
01:20:27,522 --> 01:20:29,353
- Or I'm at a water park?
- Sure. Yeah.

894
01:20:29,457 --> 01:20:32,858
- Yeah?
- Yeah, both. You know, whatever.

895
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:35,691
I think, you know,
it's the laws of probability.

896
01:20:35,797 --> 01:20:40,393
There are tons of you's out there,
and there's tons of me's floating around.

897
01:20:41,536 --> 01:20:45,028
Yeah. And this is just the sad version of us.

898
01:20:46,608 --> 01:20:47,734
Yeah, I guess.

899
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:51,643
But there's other versions,
and in these other versions,

900
01:20:51,746 --> 01:20:55,409
- everything goes our way.
- Assuming you believe in science.

901
01:20:58,353 --> 01:21:01,015
I like that thought. It's nice.

902
01:21:05,493 --> 01:21:08,291
Somewhere out there
I'm having a good time.

903
01:22:16,965 --> 01:22:18,728
I thought you'd left.

904
01:22:22,037 --> 01:22:23,732
No, I didn't leave.

905
01:22:30,512 --> 01:22:34,710
I was thinking we could invite
Rick and Debbie over for a cookout.

906
01:22:39,321 --> 01:22:43,087
Well, she's never gonna call me.
She thinks I hate her, so...

907
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:46,017
I'll let her off the hook.

908
01:22:49,764 --> 01:22:53,564
- A cookout?
- Be good to see the kids.

909
01:22:53,668 --> 01:22:56,159
Have to...
Have to get something for Emily, though.

910
01:22:56,271 --> 01:22:59,365
It was her birthday.
She turned four last week.

911
01:22:59,474 --> 01:23:00,600
Right.

912
01:23:02,143 --> 01:23:03,201
Okay.

913
01:23:08,083 --> 01:23:11,450
- Danny's is coming up.
- I know.

914
01:23:13,722 --> 01:23:16,953
- It's gonna be a tough one.
- Yeah.

915
01:23:21,329 --> 01:23:22,762
So, that kid,

916
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:25,125
Jason,

917
01:23:27,335 --> 01:23:30,998
- did you tell him we didn't blame him?
- We don't blame him.

918
01:23:31,106 --> 01:23:34,667
No, I know, but did you let him know that?

919
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:37,102
Yeah, I guess so.

920
01:23:38,046 --> 01:23:39,411
That's good.

921
01:23:40,582 --> 01:23:42,777
- You could talk to him if you want.
- I don't want to.

922
01:23:42,884 --> 01:23:43,942
Okay.

923
01:23:50,225 --> 01:23:51,692
It's so quiet.

924
01:23:53,428 --> 01:23:55,828
Well, that's 'cause I slipped Taz
a couple of Ambien.

925
01:23:56,965 --> 01:23:59,490
- Funny.
- You think I'm joking?

926
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:09,142
So, what're we gonna do?

927
01:24:13,581 --> 01:24:14,912
About what?

928
01:24:16,017 --> 01:24:18,178
I don't know.

929
01:24:18,286 --> 01:24:21,016
I don't know. Just pick something.

930
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:26,318
Well,

931
01:24:30,265 --> 01:24:34,759
we could go to Village Toys.
Pick up Candy Land for Emily.

932
01:24:36,237 --> 01:24:38,705
It's probably something she'd like.

933
01:24:41,309 --> 01:24:42,901
Candy Land. Yeah.

934
01:24:48,116 --> 01:24:49,583
And then what?

935
01:24:51,453 --> 01:24:53,614
Then we wrap it.

936
01:24:58,726 --> 01:24:59,784
And then

937
01:25:02,730 --> 01:25:04,459
we have the cookout.

938
01:25:07,836 --> 01:25:10,396
And they'll come over.

939
01:25:11,272 --> 01:25:12,466
- Hi.
- Hi.

940
01:25:15,810 --> 01:25:20,304
And we'll have a couple other people over,
so it's not too awkward for anyone.

941
01:25:20,415 --> 01:25:22,576
Hi! Oh, my gosh. Look at you!

942
01:25:22,684 --> 01:25:26,450
And then, to make them feel comfortable,

943
01:25:26,554 --> 01:25:31,821
we'll ask a bunch of questions
about what the kids have been up to,

944
01:25:33,361 --> 01:25:36,159
and we'll pretend we're really interested.

945
01:25:37,065 --> 01:25:38,396
And then...

946
01:25:40,235 --> 01:25:44,296
And then we'll wait for someone
to bring up Danny

947
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:47,605
while the kids are playing,

948
01:25:48,776 --> 01:25:52,837
and maybe that will go on for a little while.

949
01:25:53,982 --> 01:25:55,472
And after that,

950
01:25:57,252 --> 01:25:58,810
they'll go home.

951
01:26:02,323 --> 01:26:03,790
And then what?

952
01:26:08,463 --> 01:26:09,896
I don't know.

953
01:26:15,103 --> 01:26:16,730
Something, though.
