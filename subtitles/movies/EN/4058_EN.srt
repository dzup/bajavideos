1
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:07,494
How long till we
get home, Papa?

2
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,762
It's still a ways.

3
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:12,930
Oh, fine.

4
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:15,736
Go to sleep, Andrea.

5
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:17,401
Lay your head down.

6
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:21,908
Do as he says, Andrea.
Your dad's right.

7
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:23,539
Lay down and take a nap.

8
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:26,710
It could be a while
before we get there.

9
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:45,830
Why does it take so long
to get home from here?

10
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:48,135
Because it's a long road.

11
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,903
How much more now?

12
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:52,274
40 minutes, an hour.

13
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:54,279
An hour?

14
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:57,043
When you wake up
we'll already be there, okay?

15
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:17,870
Look out!

16
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,173
Mommy, Mommy!

17
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,543
Andrea, have you been hurt?

18
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,582
Are you able to walk?

19
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,910
Luca.

20
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,480
Luca!

21
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,551
Luca!

22
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,995
Luca!

23
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:52,530
Where are you, damn it?

24
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:59,040
There's no signal.

25
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,603
We're in the middle
of the woods.

26
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,016
Come on.

27
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,210
Look, one bar.

28
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,248
One bar.

29
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,614
Maybe it's good enough
to call.

30
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,846
- Try!
- All right.

31
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,650
All right, I'll call
the police.

32
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:47,215
It's gonna--
it's gonna be okay.

33
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:49,158
Hello?

34
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,390
There's been an accident.

35
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:54,331
My husband--
my husband is--

36
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,368
my husband is dead.

37
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,734
Yes.

38
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,932
Hello?

39
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,497
Hello?

40
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,338
Hello, can you hear me?

41
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,282
I got disconnected.

42
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,784
No.
What do we do?

43
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:17,512
- Come with me.
- Where are we going?

44
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:20,389
We'll walk out a way,

45
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,121
we'll find somebody
sooner or later.

46
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:27,230
- But--
- Don't talk, run.

47
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,638
Come on, baby, run.

48
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:41,770
Mommy, look.
There's a car.

49
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,339
Hold on.
Stop! Stop!

50
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,977
Go by the side of
the road and wait there. Go on.

51
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:50,216
Hey, you there!

52
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,451
Stop, please!
Help!

53
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,512
Help me.

54
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:29,320
Help me, please.

55
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,138
I beg you...

56
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,809
help me.

57
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,775
I beg you.

58
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:00,320
Mommy!

59
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:09,727
"The Last House
in the Woods."

60
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,808
Uh, yesterday?

61
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:08,251
I hung around with a friend.

62
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,414
We had a drink in a bar.

63
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,118
Yes, a friend.

64
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:16,525
A girl.
Don't you trust me?

65
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:19,156
You're always so suspicious.

66
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,792
Come on.

67
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:24,564
Yes. Okay.

68
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:28,129
Listen, could you give me
some driving lessons?

69
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,333
In exchange I'll give you

70
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,072
anything you want.

71
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:36,546
Yes, anything.

72
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,277
Think about it.

73
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,080
I said anything.

74
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:42,643
Come on now,
don't make me repeat it again.

75
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:45,850
Oh, I almost forgot.

76
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:48,450
It can't be anything to do
with sex, all right?

77
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,017
What's your hurry, moron?

78
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:30,659
Then there was Matteo,

79
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:34,097
Paolo and Sandro.

80
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,191
So that's eight, then.

81
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:37,792
Nine with you.

82
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,395
- Right, eight before me.
- Mmm-hmm.

83
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,234
No wait.

84
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,175
Before you there were
actually nine.

85
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:47,940
- Nine?
- Mmm-hmm.

86
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,608
I forgot about Maximilian.

87
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:53,811
But nothing ever really
happened with him.

88
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:55,217
What the heck
does that mean?

89
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:58,518
We just kissed.

90
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,286
Well, anyway,

91
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:04,819
nobody is as important
a man as Ricardo.

92
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,831
Me neither?

93
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,459
Be quiet, stupid.
It's different with you.

94
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,196
And what's so different?

95
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,932
You're a special guy.

96
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,997
There's nobody like you.

97
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:17,736
So am I just as important
as Ricardo then?

98
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,074
Mmmm.

99
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:23,411
Well?
You won't answer me?

100
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:25,211
Oh fuck,
what's with you guys?

101
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:26,342
What guys?

102
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,353
Men are always comparing
charts and facts.

103
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:31,151
Probably because
you're all insecure.

104
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:33,987
Fuck you.

105
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,831
Come on, Rino.
Did I hurt your feelings?

106
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,632
Forget about it.

107
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,435
I didn't mean it.
I was just kidding.

108
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:50,498
Aw.

109
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,546
You really are
important to me.

110
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:03,248
Of course
I'm important to you.

111
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:06,587
Every one of those other guys
is zero in front of me.

112
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:10,220
Don't get too cocky now.
You know I hate it when you do.

113
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,560
I was just kidding with you.

114
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:13,996
Okay.

115
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,697
Hey.

116
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:21,433
I want to make love,
but I want you to draw.

117
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,771
- What?
- Really.

118
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:27,142
I want to see what your mind comes up
with while we're making love.

119
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:30,239
But you have to keep drawing like this.
Don't hold back.

120
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:35,650
Okay, let's do it.

121
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:42,217
Let's see if you can
keep concentrating.

122
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:43,761
Huh?

123
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:45,387
It'll be easy.

124
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:48,331
Oh really?

125
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,334
We'll see about that.

126
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:14,224
It's gonna be a great drawing.
You'll see.

127
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,854
Oh yeah.
It'll be a masterpiece.

128
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:28,195
We'll never break up.

129
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,708
I--

130
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,404
I'll never break up
with you.

131
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,726
Hope in the car, Aurora.

132
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,563
What are you here for?
What do you want?

133
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,933
- I want to talk.
- Again?

134
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,905
We talked enough.
I said everything I had to say.

135
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:05,205
I know, but I still want to talk.
Please get in.

136
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,042
- Please.
- Only five minutes.

137
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,549
Then you'll take me to Gaia's.
I have an appointment with her.

138
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:15,280
- All right.
- And don't get crazy.

139
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,616
Promise.

140
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:06,004
Uh...
did you have a good time?

141
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:09,097
Yeah, but let's get
away from here.

142
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:11,472
This place is really weird.

143
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,374
Yeah, you're right.

144
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,515
Big or small,
I'm gonna bang 'em all.

145
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,921
Ee-ee!

146
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:28,391
Ginger, you're gonna be
a bad motherfucker tonight.

147
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,587
- Want to trip?
- Diego, you take a trip

148
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,563
and we'll have fun
with your ass.

149
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,691
Okay.

150
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,258
So what kind do you guys want,
a pink heart or a green roller?

151
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:38,803
Give me the red one,
Diego.

152
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,169
Diego, I want a blue one.

153
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,105
Ginger,
tonight is our night.

154
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:46,542
It's superbly a ee-ee!

155
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:50,875
Oh shit. Cesare, watch where the fuck
you're driving.

156
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,542
- What happened?
- What's up, pussy?

157
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,313
You got to throw up?
Don't be like Ginger.

158
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:56,445
He threw up on the side
of my car last week.

159
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:59,082
Hey, man, all the pills
fell on the floor.

160
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:00,853
Hey, what the fuck?

161
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:03,827
Ginger, do something
or I'm gonna kill that little bastard.

162
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,420
- Pick them up.
- Fuck you, man.

163
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:06,930
Hey, you better
do it, man

164
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,864
or I'll make you clean them up
with your fucking tongue.

165
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:12,162
Hey, are you all right?

166
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,432
Yeah.
I mean...

167
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:18,272
what do you
think we should--

168
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:21,507
well, you know.
You and l?

169
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,549
Oh.
It's always that.

170
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,447
Yeah.

171
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:31,449
I don't know, Rino.
I'm so confused.

172
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:33,514
You mean you don't want
to go out with me?

173
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:35,787
Don't start again.

174
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:37,795
What?

175
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:39,888
I don't want to be
your girlfriend.

176
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:42,024
You understand?

177
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,831
Diego, if I find even one
left back there tomorrow

178
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:47,997
I swear to God I'm gonna shove it
right up your asshole.

179
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:50,701
It'll be a fucking
suppository for the guy.

180
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:52,300
He'd like that.

181
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,471
It's your fault they fell.
You drive like shit.

182
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:56,707
Yeah, whatever.
Just give us two of them.

183
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,443
Come on, pass up
a couple, man.

184
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,644
- Two what?
- Two pills, you dickhead.

185
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:10,355
All right,
we shouldn't have made love.

186
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,260
I'm sorry.

187
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,498
You're still
in love with me.

188
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,398
I told you I'm not.

189
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:22,198
Well, what about
what we just did?

190
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,974
A moment of weakness.

191
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,775
But it's just not
the same thing.

192
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:31,145
I want to bang
a virgin, Cesare.

193
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,446
- I want to fuck a virgin!
- A nice little virgin slut.

194
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:36,010
- Man oh man.
- Cesare, pull over.

195
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:38,318
- I have to puke, man.
- What is he saying?

196
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,085
I've got to throw up.

197
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,059
What the fuck
is the fag saying back there?

198
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:43,958
- Who gives a shit?
- Pull over, okay?

199
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,759
- I've got to throw up.
- You're a real asshole.

200
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,629
Come on, I'm sick, dude.

201
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,759
Cesare, I need to bang a chick.
Let him hurl.

202
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,770
Fine then, you fuckhead.

203
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:01,643
Throw up, pussy.

204
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:04,045
Go on, man.

205
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:19,759
Give me some time
to think it over.

206
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,925
- How much time?
- I don't know.

207
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,629
- A while, I guess.
- Okay, how about a week?

208
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:28,264
Jeez, Rino.
Just don't push.

209
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:33,068
All right.

210
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:35,579
So are you mad?

211
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,808
Surprise!

212
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:39,748
- Get out.
- No!

213
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:42,286
No!
What do you want?

214
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:44,845
What the fuck are you
gonna do, pussy?

215
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:54,822
No! Rino!

216
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,334
Come on, baby.
You know you want it.

217
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,965
Let's see what we have here.

218
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,098
Oh, man.
What a pussy.

219
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:05,302
You've got only 20 bucks?
Cheap bastard.

220
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:08,039
- Let me go!
- Shut up, bitch!

221
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,510
- No!
- Ee-ee!

222
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,050
Come on, you're in deep shit.

223
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:14,779
And now we fuck
your little girl.

224
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:17,117
No! No!

225
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,589
No. No!

226
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,683
No!

227
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:26,929
Please, let me go.

228
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,399
Please!

229
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,663
Are you a virgin?
You're not a virgin?

230
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,466
Don't worry,
neither am l.

231
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:40,810
Please!

232
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,408
Get off her, you animal.

233
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:47,316
And don't move.
Come here, you little slut.

234
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:50,787
This is gonna be so fucking
fun, so enjoy it, huh?

235
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,653
You're a pretty little girl,
aren't you?

236
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:54,715
Yeah, you are.
Oh, man!

237
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:07,397
You put Giulio
to sleep, Clara?

238
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:10,066
Yeah, of course.

239
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,770
He fell asleep immediately.

240
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:22,146
It's his birthday
in a few days.

241
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,747
Thought about
what he would like?

242
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,491
Fist things first.

243
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,223
You give me a nice blowjob
right here and now.

244
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:34,459
Yeah, nice and sweet.

245
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,057
- Like an appetizer.
- Let me go!

246
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:38,967
No? Let me put it this way:.
if you don't suck my dick now

247
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:42,598
I'll give you a bigger smile
from ear to ear.

248
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:44,107
Now come on, unzip me.

249
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:46,508
Come on, I'm so horny.

250
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,102
Oh yeah, that's good.

251
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,410
Come on.
Come on, do it.

252
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,950
Do it.
That's good.

253
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:55,612
Come on. Come on.
Hurry up.

254
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:58,383
Oh, I can't wait.

255
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,550
Bravo.
That's good.

256
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:06,728
- Do it!
- Hold off. A car.

257
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:08,732
Don't worry about it, man.
They won't stop.

258
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:13,733
Stop!
Stop!

259
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:16,000
Stop!

260
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:18,440
- What's going on?
- Please help me!

261
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,239
Hey, dude.

262
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:23,042
Get back in, Clara.

263
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,413
Please, let's get
out of here.

264
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:28,351
Don't worry. You're safe now.
Get in the car.

265
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,355
Hey, Pops, you mind
your own fucking business, all right?

266
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:33,516
- You got that?
- Let's get out of here now.

267
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:34,923
Get in the car.
Go on.

268
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:37,393
Hey, bitch, we're not done
with you yet.

269
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:41,761
Don't be worried
about it, okay?

270
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,893
Antonio will make
everything all right.

271
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:49,173
Fuck it.
Maybe you'd better beat it.

272
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:51,607
Huh?

273
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,808
What part didn't you
understand?

274
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:03,611
Pops, here's the deal:
You and your chick get the fuck out now

275
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:06,214
and you leave the pretty girl
here with us. You got me?

276
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,191
If not, I'll cut open
your throat, all right?

277
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:14,221
Fucking better answer.

278
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,928
All right, man,
you're gonna--

279
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,096
Fucking shit, man!

280
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,402
Cesare, come on.

281
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:26,577
Disappear now.

282
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:31,174
Think about it.

283
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:34,082
We forget the whole thing,
you guys go home, right?

284
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:36,484
- You fucking shithead.
- Come on, man.

285
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:39,422
Man, come on.

286
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,523
- Cesare.
- Cesare, let's go.

287
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:47,895
Don't make me do it.

288
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:50,059
- Get out of here.
- Fuck you.

289
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:53,536
Okay, Pops.
You win.

290
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,338
Let's go.

291
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,707
- Right, let's go.
- Yeah, come on.

292
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:06,047
Rino!
Where's Rino?

293
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:08,518
- You slut.
- Come on, answer.

294
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,817
He's in here, okay?

295
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,914
You can keep sucking his dick
as long as you want.

296
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:15,323
- Assholes!
- Fuck you.

297
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,419
Yeah, fuck you,
you bitch.

298
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:20,624
Let's go.
Come on, let's get out of here.

299
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:21,961
Stupid bitch.

300
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:25,132
You're lucky
the old man showed up.

301
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:26,966
- Your ass was mine.
- Rino!

302
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:29,165
Dirty old skank bitch.

303
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:32,937
Rino.
Rino, please wake up.

304
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:35,605
Rino.
Rino, wake up.

305
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,978
Rino.

306
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:40,847
Are you okay,
huh?

307
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,615
- Come on.
- Aurora.

308
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:46,521
Oh my God,
they hurt you.

309
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:58,868
Maybe you should come
to our house to settle down for a bit.

310
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:01,405
We don't live
far from here.

311
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,829
Help me.

312
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,850
You want tea, coffee?
A drink or something?

313
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,847
Yes, a tea.
Thanks.

314
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:34,858
Fine then.
I'll make it for Rino as well as Clara.

315
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,570
Are you sure you don't want me
to call the police?

316
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,664
No no.

317
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:26,006
It's really not a problem
if your concern is Clara and l.

318
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:28,341
We'd be happy to testify.

319
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:31,542
No.
No, it's all right.

320
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:34,016
I'd rather forget about it.
No big deal.

321
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:35,609
Are you sure then?

322
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,814
You really don't have to be
afraid of those guys.

323
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:40,255
No, it's okay really.

324
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,816
I appreciate your concern.

325
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:45,260
It's just it would scare
my parents.

326
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,797
Okay.

327
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:49,891
I'll take you home then
or back to your car.

328
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:52,596
Yeah. Yeah, back to the car
would be good.

329
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,502
Let's wait till
Rino's better though.

330
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:57,063
Fine then.

331
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:01,173
Sorry to have disturbed
you both.

332
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:03,680
It's okay.
Seriously.

333
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:10,283
Do you--
do you two live here alone?

334
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,949
Alone?
No.

335
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,685
There's Giulio too--
our son.

336
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,818
Ah, where is he?

337
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,556
Upstairs asleep.

338
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,531
He's only seven and he goes
to sleep quite early.

339
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,872
Listen,
mind if I ask something?

340
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:32,500
Yes, of course.

341
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:34,204
Please don't keep me
in suspense.

342
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,045
Okay.

343
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:41,580
How come you decided
to keep a gun?

344
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:44,679
Uh, I always have a gun.

345
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:46,883
You know,
living in this house,

346
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,949
being out in the middle
of the woods,

347
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:52,895
makes you-- well, it makes us feel
safe to have one.

348
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:55,364
Of course I have
a permit for it.

349
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,126
Does it frighten you?

350
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:00,728
No no.
I was just curious.

351
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:22,425
- Am I hurting you?
- No no.

352
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:24,223
It's fine.
it doesn't hurt.

353
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:26,627
Okay, then I'll continue.

354
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,263
We're almost done.

355
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,446
Feeling better?

356
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:52,354
Yeah.
Yeah, thanks.

357
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:55,755
Would you like to lie down
on the couch?

358
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:57,761
Oh, no.

359
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,296
Actually,
we'd better go soon.

360
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:01,730
My parents are strict.

361
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,597
Certainly.

362
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:05,932
I guess they'd be worried.

363
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:07,995
Do you want to call
to say you're all right?

364
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:10,936
No, it'll be okay.

365
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:13,170
I already said that
there was a good chance

366
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:15,041
that I wasn't going to
be home for dinner.

367
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:17,513
- So no problem.
- Fine.

368
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:26,683
You're very pretty,
you know?

369
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:33,728
I mean it.
You're a pretty girl.

370
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:38,864
The boys must all like you
a lot, don't they?

371
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:42,498
Well, yeah.
A couple, I guess.

372
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,709
Rino must feel lucky.

373
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:51,143
Yeah.

374
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:55,309
How have things
with you two been?

375
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:57,047
I like him a lot.

376
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:01,320
But?

377
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:06,027
Not satisfied?

378
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:08,122
No.

379
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:13,266
I love him like you'd--

380
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:16,000
well, like the way you'd
love a friend, I guess.

381
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:17,939
Or maybe a brother.

382
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:20,307
It's almost like

383
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:23,472
there's no real love left.

384
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:27,779
You could be right.

385
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:31,344
He can't give me
everything I want.

386
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:35,388
He's so different.

387
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:40,692
The one that's different
could be you.

388
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:46,398
It's normal at your age.

389
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:50,069
I...

390
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,734
What?

391
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,373
You what?

392
00:31:57,448 --> 00:31:59,211
I'm not sure I feel like...

393
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:11,485
Papa, there you are.

394
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,768
Papa?

395
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:21,964
Now, Giulio,

396
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,873
didn't I tell you not
to go downstairs?

397
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:29,847
Sorry, Mom.

398
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:32,405
Say hi to the lady
and I'll bring you back upstairs.

399
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:35,145
- Hi.
- Hi.

400
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:39,855
And Papa.
Say good night.

401
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:42,085
Good night, Papa.

402
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,685
Good night, Giulio.

403
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,555
Look at you.
Your face is a mess.

404
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,940
I'm sorry about that.

405
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:03,606
Believe me, he just frightened me.
I shouldn't have done that.

406
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:06,377
- Don't worry about it.
- Forgive me, I'm so ashamed.

407
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:08,282
Really, it's okay.

408
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:12,086
Aurora, it's
a normal reaction.

409
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,147
Just take it easy.

410
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,493
I'll get the tea.

411
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:24,617
I think that I'd better
go check on Rino.

412
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:27,694
No, please stay.

413
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:29,460
Let me go.

414
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,892
Rino.

415
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:04,798
How is Rino?

416
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:13,572
Where is Rino?

417
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:19,679
Where's Rino?

418
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:30,517
Just stay calm now, Aurora.

419
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:40,101
I'm sorry.
I was gonna let you go.

420
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:44,499
But it's too late now.

421
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:48,511
It's impossible, Aurora.

422
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:58,749
I do it for Giulio.

423
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:03,083
I do it for our son.

424
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:12,894
Keep calm now.

425
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:26,139
Rino!

426
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:29,812
Rino, where are you?

427
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:37,851
Rino!

428
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:43,358
Rino!

429
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,634
Rino?

430
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:57,205
Aurora!

431
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:37,786
Rino!

432
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:40,551
What did they do to you?

433
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,456
Come on out, Aurora.

434
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:45,461
Come out now.

435
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:47,292
Hi.

436
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,396
What's your name?

437
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:54,434
Aurora.

438
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:56,336
I'm Giulio.

439
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:58,238
Hi, Giulio.

440
00:37:58,309 --> 00:37:59,970
Come on, open up.

441
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:02,103
Open the door.

442
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:04,943
- I'll untie you, then we'll get away.
- I won't hurt you, Aurora.

443
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:11,583
Forget me, Aurora.
Please run!

444
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:13,715
- Go and save yourself.
- No, we'll go together.

445
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,486
Don't waste time.
Please, you must escape.

446
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:18,221
Aurora, it's not safe
in that room.

447
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,265
The window--
go out that way.

448
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:24,529
- Please forgive me.
- Go now, hurry.

449
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,661
I love you.

450
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:29,501
Yeah, me too.

451
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:30,835
Hurry.

452
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:37,773
Hurry!

453
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:40,339
Don't go, Aurora.
Don't go.

454
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:41,407
Don't look back.

455
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,783
Aurora, let me in.

456
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:46,254
I'm going to break down
the door.

457
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,226
She went out the window.
She escaped, Dad.

458
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:10,839
Aurora!

459
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:21,747
Aurora, stop.

460
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:36,500
Aurora, come back!

461
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:38,701
Aurora!

462
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,941
- Clara.
- What's going on?

463
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:50,179
She got away.

464
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:52,381
She climbed over the gate.

465
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:12,598
It's okay, Giulio.

466
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,069
Come over here.

467
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:21,004
There's nothing wrong now

468
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:23,137
so don't worry.

469
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:29,280
Your mommy's here
with you now, okay?

470
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:37,284
You're safe and sound
here with us.

471
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:47,062
Let's go.
Come on now.

472
00:43:47,524 --> 00:43:49,992
Help.

473
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:02,801
Help me.

474
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:04,670
Anyone there?

475
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:15,042
Help me!

476
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,280
Somebody, please.

477
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:19,288
I need your help!

478
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:21,119
Anybody!

479
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,048
Hi.

480
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,825
Well done,
Emidio.

481
00:44:58,896 --> 00:45:00,488
Well done!

482
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:02,794
Ha ha ha ha!

483
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:07,805
Are you serious?

484
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:09,705
Are you serious?

485
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:12,207
It was fucking
unbelievable.

486
00:45:12,276 --> 00:45:13,743
- She was hot.
- All right!

487
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:15,210
- What a babe, man.
- She was hot.

488
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:16,871
She was a real slut too,
I tell you.

489
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:18,778
- Hey, what'd she do to you?
- Yeah, come on, tell us.

490
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:20,646
Okay okay, we were on
the dance floor making out.

491
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:23,346
You saw that. And then she drags me
into the men's room.

492
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:26,253
She throws me up against the wall
and she unzips my fly.

493
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:28,291
- What a whore!
- What then?

494
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:30,292
What do you fucking
think, man?

495
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,692
- She gave me a blowjob.
- Fucking A.

496
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:34,321
She sucked out
my brains, man.

497
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,889
She swallowed every drop
until I was fucking bone-dry.

498
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:39,026
- That slut!
- Oh, come on, come on.

499
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:40,832
- How about after that?
- She gave me her phone number

500
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,769
and then later on I saw her making out
with some other guy.

501
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,932
What'd the bitch say?

502
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:48,205
She said, "lf you have to empty your
balls, give me a call. Call anytime."

503
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:52,706
Can you believe that?

504
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:54,717
- What the fuck is this?
- What?

505
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:56,776
- What's going on?
- We're out of gas.

506
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:59,414
- No fucking way.
- You've got to be kidding me.

507
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:01,185
Oh, fuck.

508
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,886
- Out of gas?
- Yeah! Shit.

509
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:05,724
Fuck, I knew it!
Come on!

510
00:46:05,796 --> 00:46:07,229
Why didn't you get
gas before, man?

511
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:09,094
- What do we do now, bro?
- Easy, Diego.

512
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:11,828
Yeah yeah, fuck you!
It's always the same thing.

513
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:13,699
I knew it! I shouldn't
have come out with you!

514
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,864
- It's always the same shit.
- Shut up!

515
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:18,430
What the fuck are we gonna
do all the way out here?

516
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:20,534
- Tell me that.
- Diego, fuck, man!

517
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,408
I'm gonna kill you tonight
if you don't shut up!

518
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:23,446
Easy.

519
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:26,176
Diego, look, just call
the Viking.

520
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:27,615
Tell him to come
pick us up.

521
00:46:27,684 --> 00:46:29,117
Why do I have to call?

522
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:31,154
Let's not get into it.
We're already in deep shit here.

523
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:34,054
- Can't you see?
- Why do we always got to use my phone?

524
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,490
Look, I'm out of credit
and so is Ginger.

525
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,585
And if both of us are out of credit,
that leaves you.

526
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:40,061
So what?
I have credit.

527
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,791
"Diego is always there
with his phone.

528
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:43,890
He's always got credit so
let's use his phone."

529
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,298
You don't care about me.

530
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:47,394
Hey, we got no
fucking money. You know that.

531
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,098
So what do you care?
I got credit, right?

532
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:51,368
I always pay for everything.
You guys never have any cash.

533
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:53,068
- That's it. I'm gonna gut you.
- Easy easy.

534
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,770
- Take it easy.
- Give me that phone, you motherfucker.

535
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:57,507
- Come on. Asshole.
- Fuck you.

536
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:02,685
There are zero
credits left.

537
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:04,584
Please enter
your credit card number--

538
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,646
Sucker's out of credit.

539
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:11,120
Diego, go fuck off, asshole.

540
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:23,831
What was that?

541
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:25,841
Shut the fuck up.
Let me listen.

542
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:27,877
They banging a girl
out there?

543
00:47:29,379 --> 00:47:32,075
- Wanna go see?
- Shit, yeah.

544
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:36,215
Wait.
No no no.

545
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:37,412
We shouldn't go.

546
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:39,546
Look, shut your hole.
Take your cell phone

547
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:41,557
- and follow us.
- No, guys, hold on.

548
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:44,560
Guys, please.
It's cold and it's dark.

549
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:46,994
Why do we want
to go in the woods?

550
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:48,827
Guys!

551
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:50,924
Guys, hey, come on!

552
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:53,794
Wait!

553
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:10,883
Good morning,
pretty princess.

554
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:13,013
She's awake.
She's awake now.

555
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:15,081
- Yeah, she's awake.
- Yeah.

556
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:25,262
Glad to see you
return to us, Aurora.

557
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:28,730
Return to the family.

558
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:36,035
Prepare the room.

559
00:48:44,821 --> 00:48:46,982
Help me!

560
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:10,864
I didn't want you to
see any of this, Aurora.

561
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,875
But you just
wouldn't listen.

562
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,878
And now...

563
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:19,643
you'll see it all.

564
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:39,632
Dude, what now?

565
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,102
What do you mean?
We go in.

566
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:42,331
They were banging
a girl, right?

567
00:50:42,406 --> 00:50:44,237
Now we go in
and we bang the girl.

568
00:50:44,307 --> 00:50:46,275
No. No.
No way, Cesare.

569
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:47,742
- I say we go in.
- No no.

570
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:49,802
We beat up all the men,
we bang all the ladies

571
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,348
and we walk out with all
their fucking DVD players.

572
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:54,179
Wait, that's trespassing
and stealing.

573
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:55,946
Who fucking cares, man?

574
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:58,249
- Hey, cut it out.
- What the fuck's the matter with you?

575
00:50:58,321 --> 00:50:59,515
Pussy. Let's go.

576
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:01,386
Hey, let's use Diego
as a ladder.

577
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:04,256
We should.
Let's help the little baby.

578
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:06,522
Up you go.

579
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:57,636
- Come on.
- Let's go, guys.

580
00:52:57,707 --> 00:52:59,607
What are we doing here?

581
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:00,938
Shut up.

582
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,740
What the fuck
are we doing?

583
00:53:02,812 --> 00:53:04,336
Be quiet.

584
00:53:04,414 --> 00:53:06,939
Shit, let's go.

585
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,383
- Keep low.
- Shh.

586
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:14,117
We gotta get out of here.
The lights are on.

587
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:16,182
- There's people in there.
- Man, that's the point.

588
00:53:16,259 --> 00:53:18,159
Shut up. Christ,
let's not get caught.

589
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:20,196
- Come on, come on.
- Let's forget this.

590
00:53:20,263 --> 00:53:21,662
Let's go.
Come on.

591
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:23,096
Quiet!

592
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:26,431
This is a stupid
fucking idea.

593
00:53:26,503 --> 00:53:27,902
Shut up!

594
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:32,101
See that window?

595
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:34,643
We get in that way
and surprise 'em.

596
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:38,014
Hey, I gotta get back.

597
00:53:38,081 --> 00:53:40,174
I gotta take my mom to
the doctor tomorrow morning.

598
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,717
Shut the fuck up.

599
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:08,704
Why is she upset, Papa?

600
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:11,906
Because she has been
a bad girl, Giulio.

601
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:16,815
Now she'll get the punishment
she deserves.

602
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:25,521
Come on, come on.

603
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:27,392
You go first.
You're the smallest.

604
00:54:27,464 --> 00:54:29,523
- Are you nuts?
- I said get up there, shorty.

605
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,067
- Move it.
- Why do I have to go first?

606
00:54:32,135 --> 00:54:33,432
Just get your ass
up there.

607
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:34,629
Let go.

608
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:39,832
Cut it out.

609
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:41,843
Come on.
Lean on me.

610
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:54,417
Let's go!

611
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:58,887
Someone--
someone's out there.

612
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:01,522
I saw somebody
running away.

613
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,130
Antonio?

614
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,015
I'll go see.

615
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:26,646
Don't.
It may be dangerous.

616
00:55:28,024 --> 00:55:30,219
Don't worry, Clara.

617
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,025
You've had
enough to eat.

618
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:41,400
Come on now.

619
00:55:44,974 --> 00:55:46,805
Mama.

620
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:50,044
Mama.

621
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:57,582
What do you want
us to do?

622
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:02,951
You put Giulio to bed.

623
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,426
I'll be back soon.

624
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:07,759
You both keep
the girl here and watch her.

625
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:10,493
- We keep her here.
- Keep her here.

626
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:35,614
Holy shit.

627
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:38,388
Hey, isn't that guy--

628
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:40,053
Quiet, asshole.

629
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:42,826
Cesare, that's that fucking
pops we met on the road, man.

630
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,799
So I see.

631
00:56:44,868 --> 00:56:46,597
Guys, come on.

632
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:49,604
- He's got a motherfucking gun.
- No way.

633
00:56:49,672 --> 00:56:52,664
We burn that sucker.

634
00:57:57,607 --> 00:58:00,474
You both just
heard your papa.

635
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:02,977
I'll bring Giulio upstairs
and you two stay here.

636
00:58:03,046 --> 00:58:05,674
- Yes, Mama.
- Yes, Mama.

637
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:08,182
Mama, I don't want
to go up yet.

638
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:10,446
I want to wait
for Papa.

639
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,420
No, Giulio.

640
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,889
You have to listen
to your mama.

641
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:44,910
What's that, Mom?

642
00:58:44,988 --> 00:58:47,218
No-- nothing, sweetheart.

643
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:00,567
Who's out there?

644
00:59:25,862 --> 00:59:27,557
Good boy.

645
00:59:29,966 --> 00:59:32,025
Sleep well, Giulio.

646
00:59:33,202 --> 00:59:35,295
Sleep now,

647
00:59:35,371 --> 00:59:37,134
my darling son.

648
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,875
I'm gonna break your
fucking face, motherfucker.

649
00:59:42,946 --> 00:59:44,914
Got that?

650
00:59:44,981 --> 00:59:48,348
You're gonna beg me to
kill you fucking faster.

651
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:50,147
Cesare, come on, man.
That's enough.

652
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:52,084
- Come on, man. Cesare!
- You fucker!

653
00:59:52,155 --> 00:59:53,986
Whoa whoa!

654
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,955
Oh, fuck it.

655
01:00:34,864 --> 01:00:36,032
Shit, man,
you killed that guy.

656
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:37,294
Shit, man,
you killed that guy.

657
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:38,857
You saw.

658
01:00:38,935 --> 01:00:42,132
He deserved what he got.

659
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:43,672
The bastard.

660
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:55,744
No.

661
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:57,786
This wasn't
in the plan.

662
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:02,122
Fuck it, man.
We're going in.

663
01:01:02,191 --> 01:01:04,523
Huh?
Ain't that right, Ginger?

664
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:05,856
- Uh-huh.
- Right?

665
01:01:05,928 --> 01:01:07,589
We're going in, Diego!

666
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:10,292
Huh? We beat 'em all.
Let's go. Let's do it.

667
01:01:10,366 --> 01:01:12,061
Beat those motherfuckers.
Huh?

668
01:01:12,135 --> 01:01:14,569
We crush
those suckers! Huh?

669
01:01:14,637 --> 01:01:16,696
Come on, come on.

670
01:01:25,048 --> 01:01:26,538
Come on, let's go.

671
01:01:42,432 --> 01:01:44,400
The door's open.

672
01:01:46,636 --> 01:01:47,864
Come on.

673
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:19,123
Holy shit.

674
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:21,636
- What the fuck?
- Fuck.

675
01:02:21,704 --> 01:02:23,638
What?

676
01:02:23,706 --> 01:02:25,139
Oh, man!

677
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:27,506
- What the fuck happened here?
- This is gross.

678
01:02:38,354 --> 01:02:40,845
Please help me now.

679
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:43,949
- They're all monsters.
- What the hell is this shit?

680
01:02:44,026 --> 01:02:46,290
- Who did this?
- They're monsters.

681
01:02:46,362 --> 01:02:47,829
- They're monsters.
- It's impossible.

682
01:02:47,897 --> 01:02:49,831
Cesare, let's go.
Let's go.

683
01:02:49,899 --> 01:02:51,696
- Let's get out of here.
- Hey, come on!

684
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:54,032
Shut the fuck up!

685
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:00,736
Who's there?

686
01:03:09,085 --> 01:03:10,609
Who's there?

687
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:52,355
Cesare.

688
01:03:52,428 --> 01:03:53,793
Diego.

689
01:03:53,863 --> 01:03:56,889
The priest always told me
that I should behave.

690
01:04:08,444 --> 01:04:10,844
Check upstairs.
Go on.

691
01:04:13,282 --> 01:04:15,307
- Man, I can't.
- Listen, Ginger.

692
01:04:15,384 --> 01:04:17,215
- But I can't.
- Get a grip.

693
01:04:18,254 --> 01:04:19,687
Move.

694
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:24,458
Come on.

695
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:30,561
Come on, Ginger.

696
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:32,498
- It's gonna be fine, man.
- No more.

697
01:04:32,568 --> 01:04:34,263
- No more, no more.
- Listen, bro.

698
01:04:34,337 --> 01:04:36,328
Okay?
You gotta get a grip, bro.

699
01:04:36,405 --> 01:04:38,305
I need you to
be focused right now.

700
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:41,400
Okay, Ginger?
Aren't you Ginger, the ass-kicker?

701
01:04:41,477 --> 01:04:43,570
Aren't you Ginger
with a giant dick?

702
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:45,841
Hey hey, look.
Look here.

703
01:04:45,915 --> 01:04:47,542
These are just what
you want, right?

704
01:04:47,617 --> 01:04:48,743
Huh?

705
01:04:48,818 --> 01:04:51,548
See?
One for you and...

706
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:53,179
one for me.

707
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:56,119
And now we go get them.

708
01:04:56,192 --> 01:04:58,387
Let's split up.
You go by the window,

709
01:04:58,461 --> 01:05:00,053
- I go by the garage.
- Okay.

710
01:05:00,129 --> 01:05:02,063
Got me? We don't know
how many there are,

711
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:04,099
but we will fucking
kick their asses!

712
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:06,896
Eee! Eee!

713
01:05:06,969 --> 01:05:08,766
Go.

714
01:05:45,241 --> 01:05:46,799
They have a kid.

715
01:07:28,911 --> 01:07:33,007
No no!

716
01:07:33,082 --> 01:07:35,642
No!

717
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:49,126
Sweetheart, Mommy has
to leave for a minute.

718
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:51,723
But I'll be back
right away, okay?

719
01:09:00,769 --> 01:09:03,329
- Cesare.
- Ginger.

720
01:09:03,405 --> 01:09:05,236
Cesare.

721
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:08,501
Ginger.

722
01:09:09,712 --> 01:09:11,680
I'm sorry, Cesare.

723
01:09:13,082 --> 01:09:14,447
I'm sorry.

724
01:09:14,517 --> 01:09:16,485
Ginger!

725
01:09:16,552 --> 01:09:18,076
Ginger.

726
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,685
- Eee!
- Ginger.

727
01:09:22,758 --> 01:09:24,225
Ginger!

728
01:09:24,293 --> 01:09:25,954
Ginger!

729
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:44,836
How could you do it?
My brother!

730
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:46,541
You monster.

731
01:09:50,653 --> 01:09:52,644
You freak.
Come on!

732
01:09:52,721 --> 01:09:55,212
Monster!

733
01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:38,188
Will you help me?

734
01:11:40,496 --> 01:11:41,520
Yeah.

735
01:12:05,954 --> 01:12:07,615
Thank you!

736
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:09,351
Thank you!

737
01:12:15,731 --> 01:12:17,392
Come on now.

738
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:19,331
Let's go.

739
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:33,671
No!

740
01:12:49,164 --> 01:12:51,928
You did all this,
you little slut.

741
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,696
Let me go!
Let me out of here.

742
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:55,594
Antonio.

743
01:15:19,114 --> 01:15:21,173
What's this?

744
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:23,013
What is this?

745
01:15:23,085 --> 01:15:24,848
It's a boy.

746
01:15:26,755 --> 01:15:29,246
Can't you see?

747
01:15:29,324 --> 01:15:32,487
A boy who came here
to visit us.

748
01:15:32,561 --> 01:15:34,995
Why?

749
01:15:35,063 --> 01:15:36,758
But why?

750
01:15:36,832 --> 01:15:39,096
Why what?

751
01:15:39,167 --> 01:15:41,931
Why did you do this
to him?

752
01:15:49,511 --> 01:15:51,911
Tell me what
I should have done.

753
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:54,574
I don't understand.

754
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:57,778
How could you?
You are a spoiled girl.

755
01:15:57,853 --> 01:16:00,219
How could you possibly
understand what it's like

756
01:16:00,289 --> 01:16:02,189
to love your son?

757
01:16:02,257 --> 01:16:05,886
A parent would do
anything for their child.

758
01:16:05,961 --> 01:16:09,920
Yes, even if that means that they
have to bring pain to others.

759
01:16:22,978 --> 01:16:25,378
Giulio was a monster.

760
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:29,949
We don't know why.

761
01:16:30,018 --> 01:16:31,417
He was born like that.

762
01:16:33,288 --> 01:16:36,018
Those teeth.
Those teeth.

763
01:16:38,393 --> 01:16:40,759
We brought him to
this house in the woods,

764
01:16:40,829 --> 01:16:44,890
me sure it was
far away from everybody,

765
01:16:44,967 --> 01:16:47,902
pPretended he
was ordinary.

766
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:52,532
We went so far as to give him
two monsters for brothers.

767
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:54,769
We made believe
they were ours--

768
01:16:54,843 --> 01:16:56,640
our children.

769
01:16:56,712 --> 01:17:00,443
All of this so he would think
this was a normal life.

770
01:17:02,517 --> 01:17:04,280
But things began to change.

771
01:17:04,353 --> 01:17:06,719
It's like we had both
ran out of ideas.

772
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:09,120
We were going crazy.

773
01:17:10,993 --> 01:17:13,291
Then one day

774
01:17:13,362 --> 01:17:16,354
something changed.

775
01:17:16,431 --> 01:17:18,626
It made perfect sense.

776
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:20,793
You see,
that was the day

777
01:17:20,869 --> 01:17:23,667
Giulio bit Antonio's hand.

778
01:17:27,943 --> 01:17:29,911
He bit off one of
his fingers.

779
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:35,377
And we knew
what he wanted

780
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:37,645
and what we had to do.

781
01:17:40,088 --> 01:17:42,283
So we went out
and started to kill...

782
01:17:45,193 --> 01:17:47,855
to feed our child.

783
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:56,096
I mean, we did all this
for our little boy, right?

784
01:17:56,171 --> 01:17:58,139
Any parent would.

785
01:17:58,206 --> 01:18:01,334
And then this child...

786
01:18:04,279 --> 01:18:06,747
this poor child...

787
01:18:09,217 --> 01:18:11,151
Help me!

788
01:18:11,219 --> 01:18:13,210
Open the door!

789
01:18:15,424 --> 01:18:18,621
So similar to
our own son.

790
01:18:22,998 --> 01:18:27,458
If only that night I hadn't
given birth to a monster.

791
01:18:30,005 --> 01:18:31,734
Mommy?

792
01:18:35,644 --> 01:18:37,578
Mommy?

793
01:18:40,949 --> 01:18:42,746
Kill me.

794
01:19:38,373 --> 01:19:40,364
Oh!

795
01:21:02,757 --> 01:21:04,190
Rino.

796
01:21:04,259 --> 01:21:06,159
Rino, let's go.
Come on.

797
01:21:06,228 --> 01:21:07,957
Wake up.

798
01:21:08,029 --> 01:21:09,860
It's all over now.

799
01:21:09,931 --> 01:21:11,831
Rino?

800
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:13,731
Rino, answer.

801
01:21:15,937 --> 01:21:17,734
Rino, let's go, please.

802
01:21:49,137 --> 01:21:51,105
I'll never forget you.

803
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:53,869
Goodbye.
