1
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,431
who are you?

2
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:33,610
what is this?

3
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:37,281
your majesty, caught him up
in a fishing net. a fishing net.

4
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,366
sire, he's been telling stories.
stories that...

5
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,410
we believe he's found a...

6
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,336
ponce de león.

7
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,799
says he found
ponce de león's ship.

8
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,677
- or sailed on it.
- no, i told you,

9
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,096
ponce de león died 200 years ago.

10
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:04,766
aye, but he died searching
for something, didn't he?

11
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,188
the fountain of youth.

12
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,069
how soon can you sail?

13
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,489
with the tide.

14
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:38,759
over here!
lucky heather!

15
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,970
pirate swords! pirate swords!

16
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:45,515
pirate's execution today.
watch him swing!

17
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,517
pirate puppets!

18
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,186
take that, you!

19
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,146
hurry, papa, or we'll miss the hanging!

20
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,983
it's not a hanging, dear, it's a trial.
the hanging comes this afternoon.

21
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,777
pirate hanging today!

22
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,615
come on. up you get.

23
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,493
move along, pirate.

24
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,038
or should i say, "captain pirate"?

25
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,417
come on. come on! up you go.

26
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,419
quiet! order!

27
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,297
quiet!

28
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,883
now appearing before the court,

29
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:23,262
the notorious and infamous
pirate, pillager,

30
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,805
- and highwayman...
- quiet!

31
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,640
...captain jack sparrow!

32
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:34,398
i told you, the name's gibbs!
joshamee gibbs!

33
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,358
- how many times...
- hear ye, hear ye!

34
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,818
presiding over these trials,

35
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:43,573
all rise and attend,
the right honorable justice smith!

36
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,127
my dear sir.

37
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,048
quiet!

38
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,677
now...

39
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,055
...what do we have here?

40
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,515
jack?

41
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,142
shut up!

42
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:11,935
i don't recognize him.

43
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:15,272
not necessary. you were saying?

44
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,066
jack sparrow is not my name.

45
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,110
my name is joshamee gibbs.

46
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,987
is that so?

47
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,157
- it says jack sparrow here.
- i told 'em.

48
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,452
i'm not jack sparrow, who i would
be happy to identify to the court

49
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:31,496
- if it would help my case.
- i think that would be a poor defense,

50
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,333
unless you want to be bludgeoned again
like a harp seal.

51
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,627
the prisoner claims of being innocent

52
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:40,172
to being jack sparrow. how do you find?

53
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,050
no trial? but aren't we here
to examine the evidence...

54
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,719
foreman, your finding. guilty?

55
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,721
guilty verdict means he'll hang.

56
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,558
hang him! string him up!

57
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,355
- guilty?
- that's not fair!

58
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,731
shut it.

59
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:02,778
joshamee gibbs, the crime ofwhich
you've been found guilty of

60
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:05,655
is being innocent of being jack sparrow.

61
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,200
i hereby commute your sentence,

62
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,994
and order that you be imprisoned
for the remainder

63
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,997
of your miserable, moribund,
mutton-chopped life.

64
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,083
- what?!
- hang him!

65
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,417
- hang him!
- there.

66
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,921
- balderdash!
- string him up! hang him high!

67
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,217
means shall be arranged
to transport this prisoner

68
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,386
to the tower of london.

69
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,190
thanks very much.

70
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:45,779
ta.

71
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:52,202
come on. get up there.

72
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,331
get up!

73
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:04,673
hell's teeth.
now we're both headed for prison.

74
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,509
not to worry.
i've paid off the driver.

75
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:11,012
ten minutes, we'll be outside
london town, horses waiting.

76
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,681
tonight, we make the coast.

77
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,183
then it's just a matter
of finding a ship.

78
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:19,104
- all part of the plan, yes?
- exactly.

79
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,189
i arrived in london town
just this morning

80
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:24,484
to rescue one joshamee gibbs
from one appointment with the gallows.

81
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,403
seeing as how you're still alive,

82
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,281
i'd say it's all been
very successful thus far.

83
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,158
what happened to you, gibbs?

84
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:33,869
i thought you were employed elsewhere
or otherwise engaged.

85
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:37,497
aye. but i always listened like a thief
for news of the black pearl.

86
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,083
nobody's seen where
she might next make port.

87
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,294
then, i hear a rumor:

88
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,922
jack sparrow's in london
with a ship and looking for a crew.

89
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,799
- am not.
- but that's what i heard.

90
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,177
fact is, you're signing up men tonight.

91
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:51,845
pub called the captain's daughter.

92
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:55,223
- am not!
- well, i thought it a bit odd,

93
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:59,060
but then, you've never been
the most predictable of sorts.

94
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,229
tell me something.

95
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:04,900
there is another jack sparrow out there
sullying my good name?

96
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,194
- an impostor.
- indeed.

97
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:11,072
but... an impostor with a ship.

98
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,783
and in need of a crew.

99
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,952
which, as fate would have it, so am i.

100
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,580
what about you, jack?

101
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:22,584
last i heard, you were hell-bent
to find the fountain of youth.

102
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,252
any luck?

103
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,257
circumstances arose
and forced a compelling insight

104
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,384
regarding discretion and valor.

105
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:34,638
- meaning, you gave up.
- i did not.

106
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:37,599
i am just as bent as ever.
hellishly so.

107
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:42,562
i shall taste those waters,
master gibbs. mark my words.

108
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,358
short trip.

109
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:58,328
all part of the plan, yes?

110
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,541
no.

111
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,049
you are jack sparrow?

112
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,760
there should be a "captain"
in there somewhere.

113
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,429
i've heard of you.

114
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,640
and you know who i am.

115
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:45,226
face is familiar.
have i threatened you before?

116
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:49,147
you are in the presence of george
augustus, duke of brunswick-luneburg,

117
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,150
archtreasurer and prince-elector
of the holy roman empire,

118
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,695
king of great britain and ireland,
and of you.

119
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,532
- doesn't ring a bell.
- i am informed

120
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,120
you have come to london
to procure a crew for your ship.

121
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,414
vicious rumor. not true.

122
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:09,668
then you lied to me when you
told me you were jack sparrow.

123
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:13,046
i am jack sparrow,
but i'm not here to procure a crew.

124
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,590
that is... someone else.

125
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:20,303
someone else named jack sparrow.

126
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,223
you've brought me the wrong wastrel.

127
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,643
find the proper one
and dispose of this impostor.

128
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,853
no, wait, wait, wait. hang on a minute.

129
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,398
i'm jack sparrow, the one and only.

130
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,233
and i am in london.

131
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,443
to procure a crew.

132
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,278
to undertake a voyage

133
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,863
- to the fountain...
- what?

134
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:43,576
will someone please remove
these infernal chains?

135
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:44,869
come, come.

136
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,749
we know you're in possession of a map.

137
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:53,044
so confiscate the map,
and to the gallows with him!

138
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,046
have you a map?

139
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,429
- no.
- where is it?

140
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:06,266
the truth? i lost it.

141
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:10,395
- quite recently, in fact.
- i have a report.

142
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:14,149
the spanish have located
the fountain of youth.

143
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:19,404
i will not have some
melancholy spanish monarch,

144
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:24,159
a catholic, gain eternal life!

145
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,663
you do know the way to the fountain?

146
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,957
of course i do.
look at me.

147
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,959
you could guide an expedition.

148
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,630
with your permission, your heinie,

149
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,175
you will be providing, then, a ship...

150
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,428
...and a crew?

151
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,097
and a captain.

152
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,948
afternoon, sire.

153
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:09,329
if i may be so bold,
why is that man not in chains?

154
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,372
he must be manacled at once.

155
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,126
at the center of my palace? hardly.

156
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,420
hector.

157
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:21,049
how nice to see a fellow pirate
make good of himself.

158
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:24,344
pirate? nay. privateer.

159
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:30,058
on a sanctioned mission under the
authority and protection of the crown.

160
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,686
as may be, but first,

161
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:36,022
what has become of my beloved pearl?

162
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,275
i lost the pearl as i lost my leg.

163
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,694
- lost the pearl?
- aye.

164
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:45,740
i defended her mightily enough,
but she be sunk nonetheless.

165
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:55,875
if that ship be sunk properly,
you should be sunk with it.

166
00:13:56,043 --> 00:14:01,297
captain barbossa, each second we tarry,
the spanish outdistance us.

167
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:04,884
i have every confidence
you will prevail and be rewarded

168
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,345
with the high station you so desire.

169
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:12,267
- to serve doth suffice, sire.
- you, sir, have stooped.

170
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,728
jack, our sands be all but run.

171
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:19,190
where's the harm
in joining the winning side?

172
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:23,111
and you do meet
a nicer class of person.

173
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,655
i understand everything.

174
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,366
except that wig.

175
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,834
he's getting away!
stop him!

176
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,588
- head him off!
- no! stop that pirate!

177
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,569
come down!

178
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:18,249
- he escaped?
- leave it to me, sire.

179
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:27,091
guards! guards!

180
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,367
- arms at ready!
- aye, sir!

181
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,833

182
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,565
finders keepers!

183
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:25,942
there!

184
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:50,758
is that it?

185
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,432
halt! stop that carriage!

186
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,850
head him off!

187
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,485
out of the way!

188
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,514
stop that pirate!

189
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,226
move out of the way!

190
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,193
stop that man!

191
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:52,862
don't let him get away!

192
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,121
fire!

193
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,736
he's getting away!
after him! stop him!

194
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,616
after him!

195
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,379
filthy pirate.

196
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,641
hello, jackie.

197
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,854
hello, dad.

198
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,447
i heard you're putting together a crew.

199
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:21,450
if enough people keep saying it,
it must be true.

200
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:24,370
i heard where you're headed.
the fountain.

201
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,997
have you been there?

202
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:30,168
does this face look like
it's been to the fountain of youth?

203
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:34,797
- depends on the light.
- son, the fountain.

204
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:38,759
there'll be items required
for the profane ritual.

205
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,553
two chalices.

206
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:44,724
- on the map there was a chalice.
- two, silver.

207
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,727
from the ponce de león ship.
you'll need both.

208
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:51,480
- for?
- the ritual. don't be a fool, jackie.

209
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:54,692
find out every detail
before you set sail.

210
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,694
oh, set sail. love to.

211
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,071
but for that, i may need a ship.

212
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:02,491
those folk, over there,
they have a ship.

213
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:05,203
they're signing up sailors right now.

214
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,538
my heart is pierced by cupid

215
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,665
i disdain all glittering gold

216
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,168
and one last thing, jackie.

217
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,881
the fountain will test you.
mark my words.

218
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,341
my heart is pierced by cupid

219
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,426
i disdain all glittering gold

220
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,304
there is nothing can console me

221
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,057
but my jolly sailor bold

222
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,405
i hear you be recruiting a crew.

223
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,616
aye. that is,

224
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:47,536
jack sparrow be putting together
a modest venture.

225
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,624
you got some nerve, ain't ya?

226
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,292
turning up here dressed like that?

227
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,419
what are you, some kind of impostor?

228
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,755
have you any idea who i am, mate?

229
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,550
oi, muckers!

230
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:04,303
there's a bloke here what's
forgotten his own name!

231
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,350
lads, i'm sailing with sparrow.

232
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,269
who'll buy a sailor a drink?

233
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:14,897
who's next?

234
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:26,409
bring us some more of those ones.

235
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,744
yeah, make it four.

236
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:41,340
you've stolen me,
and i'm here to take meself back.

237
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,125
stop doing that.

238
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,095
only one person alive knows that move.

239
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,980
always wanted to do that.

240
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,691
hello, angelica.

241
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:09,989
hello, jack. are you impressed?

242
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:13,325
i think i almost killed you
once or twice there.

243
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:17,538
i'm touched at this most
sincerest form of flattery.

244
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,208
but why?

245
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:24,003
you were the only pirate
i thought i would pass for.

246
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,880
that is not a compliment.

247
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:31,969
don't worry, jack.
i forgave you a long time ago.

248
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:37,266
- for what? for leaving you?
- recall that i left you.

249
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:41,312
a gentleman allows a lady
to maintain her fictions.

250
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,982
look, sparrow. as long as
my sailors get their money,

251
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,153
they're willing to put up with
any number of peculiarities.

252
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,990
there is one peculiarity
with which i will not put up with.

253
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,702
i will be impersonated as "captain."
nothing less.

254
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,871
well, for that, you need a ship,

255
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,499
and as it turns out, i have one.

256
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,376
i could use a ship.

257
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:07,254
i hear tell you've been to the fountain.

258
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,548
there be a lot of hear-telling
going on these days.

259
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:14,220
- the fountain of youth.
- dearest angelica, fret not.

260
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:17,097
you still have a few usable years left.

261
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,601
always so charming.

262
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:21,852
you didn't answer me.

263
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,563
aye. regarding the fountain.
waste of time, really...

264
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:28,317
milady, i see unseamanlike fellows
of an officious-looking nature.

265
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:31,111
wretched pirates!
find 'em! maggots!

266
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,492
friends of yours?

267
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,286
i may have unintentionally
slighted some king or other.

268
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:41,205
open it!

269
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,999
- yeah, you haven't changed.
- implying the need?

270
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,501
yes.

271
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,336
open this door,
in the name of his majesty.

272
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,839
you betrayed me.
you seduced me and you used me.

273
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,716
i was innocent of the ways of men.

274
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:56,136
you demonstrated a lot of technique
for someone i supposedly corrupted.

275
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:59,056
imminent danger. here, now, milady!

276
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,766
open it!

277
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:04,520
i was ready to take my vows. and you...

278
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:07,314
what were you doing in
a spanish convent, anyway?

279
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:10,192
mistook it for a brothel.
honest mistake.

280
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,781
- there he is!
- over there!

281
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:36,135
we are at a disadvantage.

282
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:39,680
speak for yourself.
unlike some who pretend to be,

283
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,599
but cannot, in fact, hold a candle to,

284
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,183
i am captain jack sparrow.

285
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,973
how can you say i used you?

286
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,309
you know exactly how.

287
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,562
i know, but how can you say it?

288
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:36,737
- so, what is it?
- what is what?

289
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,405
about the fountain.

290
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,034
what do you know?

291
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:45,579
you don't happen to be in possession

292
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:48,957
of two silver chalices,
circa ponce de león?

293
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:51,543
- no.
- thought not.

294
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:55,297
- why?
- i hear stories.

295
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,257
rumors.

296
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:59,551
you are, of course, aware of the ritual.

297
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,595
yes, i am.

298
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:06,684
what is it?
what is required?

299
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:13,273
a mermaid, jack.

300
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:22,658
there's been a mistake.

301
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:26,328
it's a life sentence, not death. life!

302
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:35,087
- barbossa.
- thank you, gentlemen.

303
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:38,215
i trust you can tie a noose.

304
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,758
that's a hard thing,

305
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:42,886
forcing a man to twist
his own hanging rope.

306
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:46,557
you must lie in your bed
the way you made it.

307
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:49,768
what's happened to you?

308
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:53,313
- where be jack sparrow?
- he escaped.

309
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:54,898
i'm on a tight schedule, gibbs.

310
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,401
the hms providence
sets sail at first light.

311
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,695
if you do not care to watch it
hanging here dead,

312
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,864
with a mouth full of flies...

313
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,159
...speak now.

314
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,371
take me with you.
any point of the compass...

315
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:14,334
take you where, gibbs?
the fountain? aye?

316
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:17,504
is that where jack be headed?

317
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:21,675
have you anything
you can offer me, gibbs?

318
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,343
anything at all?

319
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,640
upon me naked word,
you'll not see the dawn.

320
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,400
hand it over.

321
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,449
- you fool!
- i had just enough time

322
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,076
to study those infernal circles.

323
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:52,873
every route, every destination.
all safe... in here.

324
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:58,378
welcome back to his majesty's navy,
master gibbs.

325
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,477
show a leg, sailor!

326
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,853
aye, sir.

327
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,689
what?

328
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:21,026
- there's been a horrible mistake.
- keep moving.

329
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,489
- i'm not supposed to be here.
- many a man's woken up at sea,

330
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,574
no idea what, when, wherefore or why.

331
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,952
no memory of the night afore,
whence he signed up

332
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,620
and drank away all his bonus money.

333
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,747
no, no, no. you don't understand, mate.

334
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,291
i'm captain jack sparrow.
the original. the only.

335
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:39,002
scrum, and the pleasure's all mine.
now, keep moving.

336
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,971
scrum.

337
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:51,348
get your elbows in!

338
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,727
why is there a glass coffin?

339
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:58,313
do i look like a man in charge?

340
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:01,400
- where am i?
- 'scuse me, captain sparrow, sir.

341
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,193
i be right honored
to welcome you aboard

342
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:06,613
our world-renowned vessel of infamy,
queen anne's revenge.

343
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,660
blackbeard.

344
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,887
work!

345
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:37,436
- he's a curious one.
- he's been zombiefied.

346
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,230
zombiefied.

347
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,859
blackbeard's doing.
all the officers are the same.

348
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,736
makes 'em more compliant.

349
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,989
and perpetually ill-tempered.

350
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,285
- come on. scrub.
- yeah.

351
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:04,004
pull! pull! pull!

352
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:11,094
five days underway, at least.

353
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:15,057
aye. you can tell that
by the smell of the sea?

354
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:16,934
smell of the crew.

355
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:23,607
oi. what did that poor sod do?

356
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,776
and how can i make sure to not?

357
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,236
him? churchly fellow.

358
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:30,405
always going on about the lord almighty.

359
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:32,282
bible-thumper on this ship?

360
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,326
a missionary is his story.

361
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:37,204
what i heard was
he got captured in a raid.

362
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:40,207
rest of the ship got killed,
but not 'im.

363
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,667
first mate wouldn't let it happen

364
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:44,503
on account of his premier standing
with the lord.

365
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:49,049
a first mate sticking her neck out
for some prisoner.

366
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,801
that you don't see.

367
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,637
"her"? first mate is a "her"?

368
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,013
back to work!

369
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,566
steady as she goes.

370
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:25,168
you are a ruthless,
soulless, cross-grained cur.

371
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:28,797
- i told you i had a ship.
- no, blackbeard has a ship,

372
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,758
upon which i am now imprisoned.

373
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:33,885
we can do this, jack.

374
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:38,598
the fountain of youth,
like you always wanted.

375
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:43,854
blackbeard. edward teach.
the pirate all pirates fear.

376
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,148
resurrector of the dead
in his spare time.

377
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:49,151
- he will listen to me.
- he listens to no one.

378
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:52,195
maybe to his own daughter?

379
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:57,659
daughter as in... beget by?

380
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:02,372
long-lost. recently found.

381
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,334
who loves her dear papa
with all her soul.

382
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,545
- he bought that?
- i sold that.

383
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,804
then it's the fountain of youth for him,

384
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,807
or him and you, not you and me.

385
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:23,018
no, jack, that's the best part.

386
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,228
he will be dead.

387
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,940
you'll be handling
that part yourself, then?

388
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:31,318
there is a prophecy.

389
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,653
maybe you don't believe
in the supernatural.

390
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:36,281
oh, no, no.
i've seen a thing or two.

391
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:42,829
the prophecy is this:

392
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:46,792
blackbeard will meet his death
within a fortnight

393
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:50,378
at the hands of a one-legged man.

394
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,714
that's why he needs the fountain, jack.

395
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:11,817
master gibbs, short we are a map.

396
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:15,028
perhaps you'd be so kind
as to provide us an heading.

397
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,909
be a gem and pour me a gulper.

398
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:24,496
nay. we be privateers,
not pirates, master gibbs.

399
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,748
and in the king's name,
we behave as such.

400
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,709
aye, captain.

401
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:35,924
be we on the proper course, gibbs?

402
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:40,679
aye, it be proper. there's your proof.

403
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,478
the spaniard.

404
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:54,776
all hands! battle stations!
get to windward!

405
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:57,988
- all hands, windward!
- harden up two points!

406
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,575
- two points!
- cast loose the cannons!

407
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:09,291
- gunners, take posts!
- take position! gunners ready, sir!

408
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:13,295
- out! thrust!
- await orders.

409
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,756
steady!

410
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,718
guns armed, awaiting orders, sir.

411
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:29,060
sir. orders, sir?

412
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:38,403
he never so much as turned his head.

413
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,405
the fountain is the prize.

414
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:44,159
it appears we be not even worth
the time it'd take to sink us.

415
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:48,205
and now we've fallen behind.
all hands, make more sail!

416
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,916
all hands, more sail!

417
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:54,377
ride hard between wind and tide!

418
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:07,974
the topic, gentlemen, is mutiny.

419
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,518
mutiny most foul.

420
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:14,189
aye. i signed up to sail
under jack sparrow, not some pretender.

421
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,607
and a lady, at that.

422
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,943
and mention was failed to
be made of this uncanny crew.

423
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,445
make my toes curl, they do.

424
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:23,657
i got 'em. all of them.

425
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,742
- well done.
- good lad.

426
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,328
on to it, then. blackbeard.

427
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,914
- what are his habits?
- stays mostly to his cabin.

428
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,833
that's right, mostly to his cabin.

429
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:37,170
- yes, but when he comes out...
- he don't really come out.

430
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,507
he must come out sometime.

431
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,593
not really, no.

432
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:47,138
any of you sail with him before?

433
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:48,723
- no, no.
- i've never.

434
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:49,891
definitely not.

435
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:53,895
- any of you seen him before?
- not really, no.

436
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,691
stays to his cabin,
no one sailed with him,

437
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,859
no one's seen him...

438
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:03,029
good news, gentlemen.
this is not blackbeard's ship.

439
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:04,990
this is not the queen anne's revenge.

440
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:07,158
no, this be the queen anne's revenge,
right enough.

441
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:08,743
how do you know?

442
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:12,163
i've seen the name,
on the back of the ship.

443
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:20,380
gentlemen, sirs, fellow conscriptees...

444
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,217
...you have been monstrously deceived.

445
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:28,513
- we are decepted, then?
- yes.

446
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:31,558
you've nay been informed
of a destination.

447
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,852
death lies before us

448
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:38,815
as we sail for the fountain of youth.

449
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,319
it would be a sorry plight, mates.

450
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:46,573
- death, for certain.
- the garden of darkened souls.

451
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:50,076
- untimely our ends will be.
- unless...

452
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,746
...we take the ship.

453
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:57,584
we take the ship, then. now!

454
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,340
go on, then.

455
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:06,760
- help me, shipmates!
- give it to 'em!

456
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:09,137
- wake up! it's ours!
- come on!

457
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,930
get up! off your backside!

458
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,851
- get off your fannies!
- take it to them, lads!

459
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,811
help me! fight!

460
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:31,785
jack.

461
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:38,041
if this is a dream,
you can keep the sword and boots on.

462
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,712
- if it's not...
- it's a dream.

463
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,386
no, it's not!

464
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:53,264
i thought i should give you
fair warning, we're taking the ship.

465
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:55,809
nothing personal.

466
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,770
think you might be better off
if you just...

467
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:01,731
...stay out of it.

468
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,631
boggit.

469
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,529
wretch!

470
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,144
you're either with us or against us!

471
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,480
i am not with you,
neither am i against you!

472
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:24,981
can he do that?

473
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:28,151
he's religious.
i believe it's required.

474
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,784
fight to the bitter end,
you cack-handed deck apes!

475
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:51,007
take him, men.
tie him down tight!

476
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,482
the ship is ours!

477
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,555
gentlemen.

478
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:49,482
i be placed in a bewilderment.

479
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:54,279
there i were, resting,

480
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:59,075
and upon a sudden,
i hear an ungodly row on deck.

481
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:04,080
sailors abandon their posts

482
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,749
without orders, without leave.

483
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:11,087
men before the mast,

484
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,631
taking the ship for themselves.

485
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:17,677
what be that, first mate?

486
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:20,680
- mutiny, captain.
- again?

487
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,808
- mutiny!
- aye.

488
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:26,060
mutiny.

489
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:32,025
and what fate befalls mutineers?

490
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:35,695
now, we know the answer to that,
do we not?

491
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:39,407
mutineers hang!

492
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:30,958
captain, i wish to report a mutiny.

493
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,087
i can name fingers and point names.

494
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:35,713
no need, mr. sparrow.

495
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:39,092
they are sheep. you, their shepherd.

496
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,683
have i mentioned, sir,
what a lovely daughter you have?

497
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,769
a fitting last sight for a doomed soul.

498
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:52,313
remember, father.
we need him.

499
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:53,940
if i don't kill a man
every now and then,

500
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:56,484
- they forget who i am.
- coward!

501
00:44:58,153 --> 00:45:00,279
they do not forget.

502
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:02,824
your crew sees you
for the miscreant you are.

503
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:05,284
a coward, no matter how many you slay.

504
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:07,829
twice in one day,
i find myself in a bewilderment.

505
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:10,123
you are not bewildered, you are afraid.

506
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,126
you dare not walk the path of
righteousness, the way of the light.

507
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:17,505
no, sir. the truth is
it be much simpler than all that.

508
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:20,550
- i am a bad man.
- that, too.

509
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:22,677
i might have to kill you too, catechist.

510
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:25,430
- no!
- all latin blood like her mother.

511
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:27,640
father, i beg you.

512
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:31,519
there i be again,
forgetting why the missionary is here.

513
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:36,065
my daughter fears for my soul,
or what's left of it.

514
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:40,737
you truly wish to save me, my child?

515
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,822
every soul can be saved.

516
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,742
be that true, young cleric?

517
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:49,579
yes. though you i see
as a bit of a long shot.

518
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:54,542
still, i pray for every unfortunate soul
on this hell-bound vessel.

519
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:59,756
you disarm me with your faith.

520
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,592
eight bells!

521
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,720
which of you unfortunate souls
stood watch?

522
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:10,850
- i did. i stood watch.
- gunner.

523
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:17,607
you?

524
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:22,236
aye.

525
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:24,363
the cook.

526
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:27,366
peerect. lower the longboat!

527
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:34,624
bring her about!

528
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:49,222
- why do you do this?
- mutiny. our laws be clear.

529
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:51,641
our laws allow the captain
to show leniency.

530
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:54,393
i have given this man
a chance to determine his fate,

531
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:56,229
a gift not afforded to all.

532
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:06,781
oh, you now.

533
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:10,701
chance to show the worth
of your prayers.

534
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:14,914
pray he be delivered from... evil?

535
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,590
course made!

536
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:26,592
stop. give that man a chance.
give yourself a...

537
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:54,912
you know when i feel closest
to our maker?

538
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,914
when i see suffering, pain and anguish.

539
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:59,584
that's when the true design
of this world is revealed.

540
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:03,421
and i see it revealed when in times
of hardship and tragedy,

541
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,840
kindness and compassion
are shown to those in need.

542
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,384
perhaps you should pray
for him to be unharmed, yes?

543
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,720
- please, there's still hope...
- again!

544
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:26,027
i actually have no interest
in the fountain whatsoever,

545
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:28,029
so, if your heart is set,

546
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:30,364
you may drop me off
anywhere you like.

547
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:32,283
that'll be all, quartermaster.

548
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:38,789
your words surround you like fog
and make you hard to see.

549
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:42,752
and what of you,
the mighty blackbeard?

550
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,671
beheaded they say.
still, your body swam

551
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:49,258
three times around your ship,
then climbed back onboard.

552
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:52,011
and here you are, running scared.

553
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:56,057
- scared.
- to the fountain.

554
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:59,226
the quartermaster
sees things before they happen.

555
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:03,856
he has foreseen my death,
and so the fates have spoken.

556
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:06,359
the threads of destiny woven.

557
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:09,445
you have a ridiculously
high regard for fate, mate.

558
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,197
- and you?
- me?

559
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:15,618
i'm skeptical of predicting
any future... which includes me.

560
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:21,540
it'd be foolish to battle fate,
but i'd be tempted to cheat it.

561
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:24,543
i will reach the fountain.
you will lead me.

562
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:31,008
that knife will serve you no better
than the mutiny you devised.

563
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:32,927
mutiny served me well.

564
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:35,012
it gained me an audience with you.

565
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:38,224
aye.

566
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:41,435
to warn you.

567
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:43,980
regarding your first mate,

568
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:47,024
who pretends to be persons she is not.

569
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:48,651
do tell.

570
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:53,030
she is not your daughter.

571
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:59,370
you dare to speak
thusly of my flesh and blood?

572
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:04,041
sir, the woman is consummate
in the art of deception.

573
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:08,629
i know. as i mostly unwittingly
set her on her wicked path.

574
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:10,715
though i cannot claim credit

575
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:13,801
for her existing abundance
of natural talent.

576
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,305
angelica.
my beloved daughter,

577
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:21,058
the one true good thing
i have done in this life,

578
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:23,853
and you claim to be the one
who corrupted her?

579
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:28,024
sir, what she is is pure evil.

580
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,568
more to be feared than a wild beast.

581
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:34,530
hungry wild beast with gnashing teeth.

582
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:36,699
vengeful, hungry from hell beast...

583
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,993
- father?
- sweetness!

584
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:42,496
no need to hurt him, father.

585
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:45,875
he will help us. won't you, jack?

586
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:49,754
you see? even now,
she attends to your welfare,

587
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:53,466
giving lie to the claims
you make of her.

588
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:05,519
you will lead us to the fountain. yes?

589
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:08,022
put another way.

590
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:12,234
if i do not make it
to the fountain in time...

591
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,864
...neither will you.

592
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:23,162
i'll have a wee look-see at those charts
straight away then, shall i?

593
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,167
sir.

594
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:33,380
- aye?
- captain, sir,

595
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:35,925
i am unhappy to report rumors, sir,

596
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,260
among the crew,
as to our destination.

597
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:41,430
shut your trap and make way.

598
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:49,063
- that's the way of it, then.
- no disrespect, sir.

599
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:52,691
what do the men fear?
say it. speak the words.

600
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:54,777
whitecap bay.

601
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:58,030
aye, whitecap bay.

602
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:02,243
and every worthless seaman
fears the name, and rightly so,

603
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,745
though few know why or dare to ask.

604
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:06,539
be the stories true?

605
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:08,499
say what robs you of
your staunch heart, gibbs,

606
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:11,794
or forever leave it
to the wider fields of fancy.

607
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:16,090
mermaids, captain.

608
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:18,008
aye. mermaids.

609
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:22,304
sea ghouls, devil fish,
dreadful in hunger for flesh of man.

610
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:26,016
mermaid waters, that be our path.

611
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:27,726
cling to your soul, gibbs,

612
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:31,522
as mermaids be given
to take the rest...

613
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,065
...to the bone.

614
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:37,778
steady! steady, men!
find your courage,

615
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,822
or be ready to purpose your fear!

616
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,366
save yourselves!

617
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:47,788
- man overboard!
- nay! a deserter.

618
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:49,707
- come about.
- nay!

619
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:54,795
gentlemen, i shall not ask
any more of any man than what

620
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:59,425
that man can deliver, but i do ask this:
are we not king's men?

621
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:01,010
aye.

622
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:03,929
- on the king's mission?
- aye.

623
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:08,309
i did not note any fear in the eyes
of the spanish as they passed us by.

624
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:11,187
- are we not king's men?
- aye!

625
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:14,273
aye! hands all off, and bear away!

626
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:17,359
stave on ahead to whitecap bay!

627
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,363
bear on, whitecap bay!

628
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:36,837
come.

629
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,297
little drink?

630
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:41,675
wine, music, candlelight.

631
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:44,053
i think we've traveled down
this road before, jack.

632
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,013
yes, we have.

633
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:48,390
i remember it well.

634
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:55,064
winding, twisting and
turning, gyrating, writhing.

635
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,524
incessant writhing.

636
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:59,526
do you recall saint dominique?

637
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:02,529
la martinique.

638
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:04,365
i tried to kill you in saint dominique.

639
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:06,283
either or.

640
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:09,119
hardly appropriate for a first mate.

641
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:12,706
was i the first? i've often wondered.

642
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:17,086
you can be so charming
when you want something, jack.

643
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,713
the trick is finding out what.

644
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,925
the truth, then, is it?

645
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:26,136
blackbeard has served his purpose.

646
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:28,597
you and i can go to
the fountain together,

647
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:31,809
where we shall bathe one another
in equal shares of fame

648
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,978
and other assorted debaucheries.

649
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:37,106
and i'll tell you
the ritual of the fountain.

650
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:40,067
yes. the profane ritual.

651
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:44,989
can i trust you, jack?

652
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:49,535
- i need you on my side.
- oh, my dearest angelica.

653
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:53,122
you and i are as
thick as thieves, love.

654
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,499
tell me the rules.

655
00:54:57,669 --> 00:55:01,297
water from the fountain of youth.

656
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:06,552
the shimmering tear of a mermaid.

657
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,014
the silver chalices of ponce de león.

658
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,684
with these items...

659
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:15,936
- yes?
- with these items,

660
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:19,481
you may take all the years
of life from another, jack.

661
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:23,569
you know what that means.

662
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:26,613
we cannot go alone, you and i.

663
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:29,033
the ritual requires a victim.

664
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:34,621
- that is unfortunate.
- yes, it is.

665
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:38,500
i find my desire for the fountain
greatly lessened.

666
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:42,546
but there is something onboard
you do want.

667
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:49,678
what about blackbeard?

668
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:53,432
he's in the chart room.
we'll have to be quick.

669
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:05,110
he keeps each ship as a prize.

670
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:11,325
you help me,
and i promise you your pick.

671
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:14,870
though i think i know the one
you will choose.

672
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:23,253
the black pearl in a bottle?

673
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:25,130
why is the black pearl in a bottle?

674
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,764
he's even more annoying in miniature.

675
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:37,935
- do we have a deal, jack?
- angelica, i know you.

676
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:40,938
you are not going to steal the life
of some innocent man.

677
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:43,816
what about the one-legged man?

678
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,694
i need years, jack.

679
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:52,950
not for me. for my father.

680
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,871
i am truly the daughter of blackbeard.

681
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:01,083
you've fallen for your own con, love.

682
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,502
no, he is my father.

683
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,337
the lies i told you were not lies.

684
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:10,008
you lied to me by telling me the truth?

685
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:12,177
- yes.
- that's very good.

686
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:14,763
- may i use that?
- i'm sure you will, anyway.

687
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:17,266
of course i will.

688
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:20,102
so, will you not give up this quest?

689
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:23,856
i want a father, jack.
i haven't had one.

690
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:28,360
angelica, your father, blackbeard...

691
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,280
...he is evil,

692
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,615
and he will kill you given the chance.

693
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:36,869
- he cannot be saved.
- and who are you to set

694
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:39,204
the limits on redemption?

695
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:42,666
you stole years of my life, jack.
you owe me.

696
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:45,878
and you are en route
to getting yourself killed,

697
00:57:46,045 --> 00:57:48,338
and i am not inclined
to stand by and watch.

698
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:52,217
whitecap bay!

699
00:57:57,348 --> 00:58:00,726
all hands on deck!
set to the longboats!

700
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:05,814
lay 'em out flat!

701
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:11,278
no tangles. make 'em look
pretty for our dainty guests.

702
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:15,240
we're gonna need light.
a lot of light.

703
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,035
come!

704
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:45,062
smell that? whale oil.
stuff burns like a miracle from god.

705
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:48,941
- can you make it work?
- made by the english.

706
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:50,192
let's not get our hopes up.

707
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:03,163
the old moon in
the arms of the new one.

708
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:04,540
first of the summer.

709
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:08,669
peerect for hunting a mermaid's tear.

710
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:24,851
we're doomed.
they be drawn to man-made light.

711
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:27,688
- sharks?
- worse than sharks, boy.

712
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:30,357
there'll be mermaids upon us
within the hour,

713
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:33,986
you mark my words.
and we're the bait.

714
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:42,286
i heard it said a kiss from a mermaid
protects a sailor from drowning.

715
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:46,290
don't be a fool!
mermaids are all female, son,

716
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:49,209
and lovely as a dream of heaven.

717
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:53,630
but when it comes time
to churn butter, so to speak,

718
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:55,757
they snatch a sailor out of a boat

719
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:58,927
or off the deck of a ship,
have their way,

720
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:04,016
and then the sailors are pulled
to bottom and drowned and eaten.

721
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:07,894
or, sometimes, the other way around.

722
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,815
- sing.
- what?

723
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:15,319
they like to hear singing.

724
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:23,243
my name is maria

725
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:26,538
a merchant's daughterfair

726
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:30,292
- louder.
- and i have left my parents

727
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,629
and 3,000 pounds a year

728
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:36,798
my heart is pierced by cupid

729
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:40,385
i disdain all glittering gold

730
01:00:40,553 --> 01:00:44,014
there is nothing can console me

731
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:47,059
but my jolly sailor bold

732
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:52,773
my heart is pierced by cupid

733
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:56,610
i disdain all glittering gold

734
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:59,488
there is nothing can console me

735
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:04,117
but my jolly sailor bold

736
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:23,553
lord save me.

737
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:30,268
man, look. look there.

738
01:01:31,145 --> 01:01:32,229
you'll scare her off!

739
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:33,897
aye, and good riddance!

740
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,570
can you talk?

741
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:44,783
yes.

742
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:53,792
you're beautiful.

743
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:58,380
- are you the one who sings?
- aye.

744
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,719
are you my jolly sailor bold?

745
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:08,181
- aye, that i be.
- scrum, comport yourself!

746
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,518
boys! there ain't much
been given to me

747
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:14,062
in my brief, miserable life,
there's the truth in it.

748
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,939
but, by god, i'll have it said

749
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:19,484
that scrum had himself a kiss
from a proper mermaid!

750
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:24,364
my heart is pierced by cupid

751
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:28,034
i disdain all glittering gold

752
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:31,580
there is nothing can console me

753
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:35,834
but my jolly sailor bold

754
01:02:37,336 --> 01:02:40,839
come all ye pretty fair maids

755
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:45,218
whoever you may be

756
01:02:45,386 --> 01:02:48,930
who love a jolly sailor bold

757
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:53,810
thatploughs the raging sea

758
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:58,064
my heart is pierced by cupid

759
01:02:58,232 --> 01:03:02,402
i disdain all glittering gold

760
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:06,740
there is nothing can console me

761
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:11,244
but my jolly sailor bold

762
01:03:11,412 --> 01:03:16,541
my heart is pierced by cupid

763
01:03:16,709 --> 01:03:19,920
i disdain all glittering gold

764
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:24,132
there is nothing can console me

765
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:28,094
but my jolly sailor bold

766
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:07,259
out upon it! it has begun!

767
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:51,011
light 'em up!

768
01:04:51,178 --> 01:04:55,724
muster your courage!
drive 'em to shore!

769
01:05:06,193 --> 01:05:09,613
nets into the water! quickly!

770
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:02,499
retreat, all, to land!
for your lives!

771
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:07,253
retreat, i say!

772
01:06:07,421 --> 01:06:09,422
cowards! back in the water!

773
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:13,760
there be no refuge on land! on my word!

774
01:06:46,877 --> 01:06:48,420
come on!

775
01:08:23,015 --> 01:08:25,183
we got one!

776
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:30,814
i'm in love!

777
01:08:33,567 --> 01:08:34,984
check the wounded!

778
01:08:35,152 --> 01:08:37,904
see if you can find
one mermaid still alive!

779
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:18,361
come, give a hand!

780
01:09:19,613 --> 01:09:21,614
well done, sailor.

781
01:09:22,616 --> 01:09:24,242
did everyone see that?

782
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:26,411
because i will not be doing it again.

783
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:31,249
back to the ship.
we head for a protected cove. now.

784
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:51,019
- lord. is that...?
- mermaid.

785
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:54,689
- give up this madness now.
- i cannot.

786
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:56,608
ever walk on the beach,

787
01:09:56,775 --> 01:09:59,027
look back and see your footsteps
in the sand?

788
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:03,156
it's like that,
except the footsteps lie before me.

789
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:07,118
- footstep, actually.
- whitecap bay, sir.

790
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:08,870
we must hasten.

791
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:20,548
we travel by foot.
gibbs, i require a heading.

792
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:23,843
- but, sir, the men.
- they be dead already.

793
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:27,096
- they don't sound dead.
- oh, is that so?

794
01:10:27,264 --> 01:10:31,559
well, i hear nothing
but seagulls nesting.

795
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:33,770
what is it that you hear, mr. groves?

796
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:40,235
seagulls... nesting.

797
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:43,446
- nothing more.
- heading, gibbs?

798
01:10:52,122 --> 01:10:53,665
my god.

799
01:10:53,832 --> 01:10:55,833
your head or my heading.

800
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:58,169
i'll have me one or t'other,
i don't care which.

801
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:05,635
all hands, forward!

802
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:25,571
- it's to you now, sparrow.
- was that really necessary?

803
01:11:25,739 --> 01:11:28,366
best you not know the exact
whereabouts of my ship.

804
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:33,204
- i be a cautious man.
- so be i.

805
01:11:33,372 --> 01:11:35,081
what i want first...

806
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:40,712
...is ponce de león's ship.

807
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:19,625
why is it we've got to bring her along?

808
01:12:19,793 --> 01:12:23,004
because tears don't keep.
we need them fresh.

809
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:25,882
what is the ritual again?

810
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:28,468
water from the fountain
and a mermaid's tear?

811
01:12:28,635 --> 01:12:30,136
and two silver chalices.

812
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:32,930
one cup with a tear, one without.

813
01:12:34,224 --> 01:12:36,601
so, one with a tear and water in both?

814
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:38,269
quite complicated, is it not?

815
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:41,481
both get water. one gets a tear.

816
01:12:41,648 --> 01:12:44,275
the person who drinks
the water with the tear

817
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:46,903
gets all the years of life
from the other.

818
01:12:48,113 --> 01:12:50,156
how many years?

819
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:54,577
all the years
that they have lived,

820
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:58,247
and they could have lived,
if fate had been kinder.

821
01:13:07,591 --> 01:13:08,841
clergyman.

822
01:13:10,844 --> 01:13:13,763
on the off chance that this
does not go well for me,

823
01:13:13,931 --> 01:13:15,473
i would like it noted here and now

824
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:18,851
that i am fully prepared
to believe in whatever i must,

825
01:13:19,019 --> 01:13:20,770
so that i may be
welcomed into that place

826
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:23,314
where all the goody-goodies
get to go. savvy?

827
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:27,110
we have a word for that, jack.
you can convert.

828
01:13:27,277 --> 01:13:29,737
i was thinking more
of an as-needed basis.

829
01:13:33,742 --> 01:13:34,992
quartermaster!

830
01:13:35,619 --> 01:13:37,328
- aye?
- she cannot breathe!

831
01:13:37,496 --> 01:13:40,540
- she has water.
- she needs air!

832
01:13:44,503 --> 01:13:46,421
- open this.
- she will escape.

833
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:50,299
- you're killing her.
- i support the missionary's position.

834
01:13:58,851 --> 01:13:59,892
see?

835
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:06,649
onward.

836
01:14:30,883 --> 01:14:34,302
just as i thought. not this way!

837
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:37,805
this is the way, isn't it?

838
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:40,766
'course it is, but we
should go around to the east.

839
01:14:40,934 --> 01:14:42,768
that would take us out of
the path of the chalices.

840
01:14:42,936 --> 01:14:44,687
- well, then we'll circle back.
- there is no time.

841
01:14:44,855 --> 01:14:46,481
you're the one who insisted
on bringing the bloody mermaid.

842
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:48,608
- well, the mutiny didn't help.
- you walk like a girl.

843
01:14:48,775 --> 01:14:50,860
- you would know.
- someone must go.

844
01:14:51,945 --> 01:14:53,446
you mean split up?

845
01:14:53,614 --> 01:14:56,491
you mean jump?
this i cannot wait to see.

846
01:14:56,658 --> 01:15:00,578
sparrow will go.
find the ship, retrieve the chalices.

847
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:02,747
sparrow? what makes you
think he will come back?

848
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:06,125
yes, what makes you think
he will come back?

849
01:15:06,293 --> 01:15:08,753
we cannot trust him, father. i'll go.

850
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:11,339
she'll go.

851
01:15:15,385 --> 01:15:16,719
how much farther to the fountain?

852
01:15:16,887 --> 01:15:18,554
i'm running out of time.

853
01:15:20,557 --> 01:15:22,683
about a day's march north,
following that river,

854
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:26,312
you'll get to a series of pools.
then you're close.

855
01:15:28,815 --> 01:15:30,066
you will go.

856
01:15:32,986 --> 01:15:35,279
i was sure it would come to this.

857
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:53,005
you know that feeling you get sometimes
when you're standing in a high place?

858
01:15:53,173 --> 01:15:55,091
sudden urge to jump?

859
01:15:57,010 --> 01:15:58,553
i don't have it.

860
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:01,472
i need those chalices.

861
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:04,100
shoot. save me the bother of the fall.

862
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:07,311
you will go. you will return...

863
01:16:08,647 --> 01:16:10,606
...or i will kill her.

864
01:16:13,443 --> 01:16:14,944
you won't kill your own daughter.

865
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:17,863
quartermaster, get me six more pistols,

866
01:16:18,031 --> 01:16:19,615
remove the shot from all but two,

867
01:16:19,783 --> 01:16:22,243
but do not tell me which two.

868
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:27,123
you get to choose, mr. sparrow.

869
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:34,338
no.

870
01:16:37,467 --> 01:16:40,261
- yes.
- you're sure?

871
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:41,846
'course i am.

872
01:16:50,105 --> 01:16:51,147
again.

873
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:55,192
please, they're not even loaded.

874
01:17:00,073 --> 01:17:01,407
again.

875
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:04,160
if you're so keen on killing her,

876
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:06,704
- why don't you just let herjump?
- what?

877
01:17:07,497 --> 01:17:09,957
if you jump and die,

878
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:13,753
then she will have her chance.

879
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,379
again.

880
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:20,509
oi...

881
01:17:20,677 --> 01:17:24,513
...if i jump, will i survive?

882
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:28,184
the doll.

883
01:17:44,534 --> 01:17:49,246
- yes, now you will survive.
- this is nonsense! i'm going!

884
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:11,227
wet. wet again.

885
01:18:13,563 --> 01:18:16,440
we go on.
due north to the fountain.

886
01:18:17,275 --> 01:18:18,609
well played, father.

887
01:18:20,404 --> 01:18:22,697
you knew which guns were loaded, right?

888
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:27,410
of course, my love.

889
01:18:37,087 --> 01:18:39,797
be nice to have a map about now.

890
01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:41,590
or a ship.

891
01:18:42,342 --> 01:18:46,053
stop! hold very still.

892
01:18:47,514 --> 01:18:51,016
ye dare not let it touch your skin.

893
01:18:59,776 --> 01:19:02,987
what? what be wrong with
an older man having a hobby?

894
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:05,656
what are you stopping for, eh? push on!

895
01:19:05,824 --> 01:19:07,992
- push on!
- you can sleep when you're dead.

896
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,326
push on!

897
01:19:10,954 --> 01:19:14,290
fortune continues to favor us.

898
01:19:42,068 --> 01:19:44,278
the santiago.

899
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:47,156
famously captained by ponce de león.

900
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:51,368
there's no one there.

901
01:19:51,536 --> 01:19:52,536
right, then.

902
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:28,614
we must not stop.

903
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:38,415
you will walk.

904
01:20:57,602 --> 01:20:59,728
i cannot.

905
01:20:59,896 --> 01:21:01,647
walk or die.

906
01:21:08,113 --> 01:21:09,321
put your arms around me.

907
01:21:09,489 --> 01:21:12,867
- i do not ask for help.
- but you need it.

908
01:21:29,801 --> 01:21:34,096
- we're in a hurry, yes?
- do not fall behind.

909
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:55,159
hold here 'til i say!

910
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:10,090
such beauty.

911
01:22:10,258 --> 01:22:13,552
surely you're one of
god's own creations,

912
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:16,639
and not a descendant
of those dark creatures

913
01:22:16,806 --> 01:22:19,058
who found no refuge on the ark.

914
01:22:21,853 --> 01:22:23,979
such beauty...

915
01:22:25,273 --> 01:22:26,857
...and yet deadly.

916
01:22:27,859 --> 01:22:31,320
- deadly? no.
- you attacked me.

917
01:22:31,488 --> 01:22:36,408
no. you are different.

918
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:38,535
different?

919
01:22:38,703 --> 01:22:42,706
are you not? you protect.

920
01:22:46,127 --> 01:22:47,169
did you...?

921
01:22:48,838 --> 01:22:51,590
you pushed me down out of the way.

922
01:22:52,759 --> 01:22:57,221
- you see the fountain?
- no, but we are close.

923
01:22:57,806 --> 01:22:59,640
bring the creature.
cover its head.

924
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:01,767
she has a name!

925
01:23:06,314 --> 01:23:07,815
pray tell.

926
01:23:14,072 --> 01:23:15,906
she is syrena.

927
01:23:56,906 --> 01:23:58,407
ponce de león.

928
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:05,789
if 40 pirates
dreamt 40 nights of treasure,

929
01:24:05,957 --> 01:24:09,501
it would not match
the contents of this room.

930
01:24:09,669 --> 01:24:11,211
you.

931
01:24:14,007 --> 01:24:15,799
- you.
- no...

932
01:24:16,968 --> 01:24:19,219
- ...you.
- i was here first.

933
01:24:19,387 --> 01:24:23,390
- you, why are you here?
- blackbeard sent me.

934
01:24:23,558 --> 01:24:26,018
- why are you?
- silver chalices

935
01:24:26,186 --> 01:24:29,521
- for my royal liege.
- oh, please.

936
01:24:30,815 --> 01:24:32,566
back, back! we have to balance it out!

937
01:24:34,569 --> 01:24:37,154
the whole ship will slide!

938
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:42,534
right, then.

939
01:24:42,702 --> 01:24:48,624
what ifwe each choose an item
of approximately equal weight?

940
01:24:51,294 --> 01:24:52,711
put it back!

941
01:24:54,255 --> 01:24:56,298
we touch nothing!

942
01:25:04,224 --> 01:25:05,182
what about that?

943
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:07,684
the chalices.

944
01:25:09,437 --> 01:25:10,938
oi! why do you get to look first?

945
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:12,773
fine, then.

946
01:25:32,043 --> 01:25:33,585
- together.
- together.

947
01:25:36,339 --> 01:25:37,339
rocks.

948
01:25:38,424 --> 01:25:39,758
the spanish.

949
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:42,177
they're ahead of us, mate.

950
01:25:43,096 --> 01:25:46,348
i shall have a look at that map.
if it's what i fear...

951
01:25:56,442 --> 01:25:58,652
i wonder why they left this behind.

952
01:26:01,656 --> 01:26:05,409
don't touch the map.

953
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:11,874
they know the path,

954
01:26:12,041 --> 01:26:15,919
but i can also see where
they'll most likely make camp.

955
01:26:29,392 --> 01:26:30,684
jack!

956
01:26:33,897 --> 01:26:38,025
gibbs, i was just on me way
to break you out ofjail.

957
01:26:39,986 --> 01:26:41,486
you stole my map.

958
01:26:42,071 --> 01:26:44,489
right. best be started.

959
01:26:47,577 --> 01:26:49,077
olé.

960
01:27:06,471 --> 01:27:07,971
mermaids.

961
01:27:10,808 --> 01:27:13,727
careful, these pools run deep.

962
01:27:13,895 --> 01:27:17,439
if she escapes, all is lost.
quartermaster.

963
01:27:19,108 --> 01:27:22,361
look. look!

964
01:27:23,988 --> 01:27:26,907
staked out to die, to dry in the sun.

965
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:30,661
only half in the water.
not enough to live,

966
01:27:30,828 --> 01:27:34,998
butjust enough to make the dying slow.

967
01:27:36,209 --> 01:27:37,209
think on it.

968
01:27:37,377 --> 01:27:40,754
your people, murdered,
harvested for their tears.

969
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:45,217
syrena, won't you cry?

970
01:27:46,135 --> 01:27:47,928
all die, even you.

971
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:51,515
- soon, i hear.
- listen...

972
01:27:53,601 --> 01:27:55,435
listen.

973
01:27:55,603 --> 01:27:58,897
can you not hear your sisters scream?

974
01:27:59,065 --> 01:28:01,483
do you not hear them?

975
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:05,320
we need but one tear.

976
01:28:08,199 --> 01:28:09,491
vile creature!

977
01:28:09,659 --> 01:28:12,202
- chop off her fingers, one by one!
- choke her!

978
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:14,955
cut out the tears
from behind the eyes!

979
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:16,415
where's your voice in this?

980
01:28:17,333 --> 01:28:20,335
maybe she'll have a change of heart
when the sun rises.

981
01:28:20,503 --> 01:28:24,381
oh, aye, she will burn,
but i cannot wait for the sun.

982
01:28:24,549 --> 01:28:26,216
perhaps we should build a fire.

983
01:28:26,384 --> 01:28:28,510
- no.
- do not contest me, cleric.

984
01:28:28,678 --> 01:28:31,722
- you will not torture her.
- we need only one tear.

985
01:28:31,889 --> 01:28:35,017
i will tear every scale
from her body one by one if i see fit.

986
01:28:35,184 --> 01:28:36,727
if that displeases you, go pray.

987
01:28:36,894 --> 01:28:39,980
i was wrong. not every soul
can be saved. yours cannot.

988
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:42,983
behold, gentlemen,
a man formerly of faith.

989
01:28:43,151 --> 01:28:46,028
that vile creature, as you call her,
is worth a hundred of you.

990
01:28:46,195 --> 01:28:47,904
oh, you care for her?

991
01:28:49,949 --> 01:28:51,950
you fancy her.

992
01:28:53,661 --> 01:28:56,371
and do not deny what is
clear to my eyes.

993
01:28:58,207 --> 01:28:59,291
question is...

994
01:29:02,503 --> 01:29:04,463
...does she fancy you?

995
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:10,302
by god, she does. we are in luck!

996
01:29:11,763 --> 01:29:13,597
bring forth a tear...

997
01:29:15,141 --> 01:29:17,642
...or witness the death
of this poor soul.

998
01:29:19,812 --> 01:29:23,231
syrena, if you could manage a tear,

999
01:29:23,399 --> 01:29:24,941
i would be grateful.

1000
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:27,903
sadness, yes,

1001
01:29:28,071 --> 01:29:33,450
- but no sorrow... yet.
- not by your hand, father!

1002
01:29:33,618 --> 01:29:36,244
time and tide wait for none.
quartermaster.

1003
01:29:48,591 --> 01:29:52,052
aye, mermaids are tough.

1004
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:54,221
the lot of them.

1005
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:58,767
tie her up like the others.
and get rid of this.

1006
01:30:03,356 --> 01:30:06,316
- you are confident?
- yes.

1007
01:30:06,484 --> 01:30:09,444
i am a woman. so is she.

1008
01:30:17,495 --> 01:30:20,497
what's your play, jack?
throwing in with barbossa.

1009
01:30:21,582 --> 01:30:23,333
there is a girl...

1010
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:26,670
...a female... of the opposite sex.

1011
01:30:26,838 --> 01:30:30,757
- when is there not?
- perhaps i should say "damsel."

1012
01:30:30,925 --> 01:30:33,927
you're rescuing a damsel?
well, there's a first.

1013
01:30:34,095 --> 01:30:37,305
yes, but it's just that
i may have caused said damsel

1014
01:30:37,473 --> 01:30:41,017
- some manner of harm many moons ago.
- out with it.

1015
01:30:41,185 --> 01:30:44,479
gibbs, this is the woman from seville.

1016
01:30:44,647 --> 01:30:48,525
ah, you pretended to love her,
then you left her and broke her heart.

1017
01:30:48,693 --> 01:30:53,363
worse. i may have had,
briefly, mind you...

1018
01:30:55,575 --> 01:30:58,702
- ...stirrings.
- stirrings?

1019
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:02,831
- stirrings.
- what? like feelings, you mean?

1020
01:31:02,999 --> 01:31:06,001
no, no, no. not quite all the way
to feelings. more like...

1021
01:31:10,131 --> 01:31:11,715
all right, feelings, damn you.

1022
01:31:11,883 --> 01:31:16,553
and you left her still.
that's low.

1023
01:31:18,014 --> 01:31:19,222
thank you.

1024
01:31:26,147 --> 01:31:27,564
stealth over force.

1025
01:31:27,732 --> 01:31:31,443
i'll take it from here
on account of your condition.

1026
01:31:32,612 --> 01:31:34,446
you don't have termites, do you?

1027
01:31:34,614 --> 01:31:36,573
i appreciate your concern, jack,

1028
01:31:36,741 --> 01:31:39,242
but i'll be keeping
you company all the same.

1029
01:31:39,410 --> 01:31:42,454
hold here, lieutenant commander.
wait for my signal.

1030
01:32:14,445 --> 01:32:16,530
there. that one.
that be the leader.

1031
01:32:16,697 --> 01:32:19,157
make note of his tent
because that's where...

1032
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:24,871
no, wait. by god,
that must be them right there.

1033
01:32:28,417 --> 01:32:30,627
your sword smells funny.

1034
01:32:30,795 --> 01:32:35,674
aye. poison from the
innards of poisonous toads.

1035
01:32:35,841 --> 01:32:38,927
just a scratch,
you're a dead man in minutes.

1036
01:32:39,095 --> 01:32:41,388
would you mind pointing it
the other way?

1037
01:32:41,556 --> 01:32:43,306
i don't like toads.

1038
01:32:48,187 --> 01:32:51,606
- what are you doing?
- planning an escape route.

1039
01:32:51,774 --> 01:32:55,819
- isn't that how you do it?
- yes.

1040
01:32:55,987 --> 01:32:59,072
or sometimes i just... improvise.

1041
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:27,559
now what?

1042
01:33:28,477 --> 01:33:30,979
we stroll out, slow and steady.

1043
01:33:31,147 --> 01:33:32,939
just like we belong.

1044
01:34:32,416 --> 01:34:36,628
- i'm sorry, syrena.
- philip, you're alive.

1045
01:34:36,796 --> 01:34:40,965
- yes.
- you came for me.

1046
01:34:42,843 --> 01:34:44,344
why?

1047
01:34:46,472 --> 01:34:48,765
you're different, are you not?

1048
01:34:50,976 --> 01:34:55,313
do you know not of kindness?
compassion?

1049
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:14,499
tears of sorrow, never.

1050
01:35:14,667 --> 01:35:17,085
mermaids be too tough for that.

1051
01:35:17,253 --> 01:35:19,379
but tears ofjoy...

1052
01:35:20,923 --> 01:35:23,299
they say these be
the more potent anyway.

1053
01:35:23,467 --> 01:35:26,428
syrena, on my word,
i had no part in this.

1054
01:35:27,722 --> 01:35:29,139
let her go.
you don't need her now.

1055
01:35:29,306 --> 01:35:32,225
let her go? no.

1056
01:35:32,393 --> 01:35:35,353
secure her bonds.
we leave her with her own.

1057
01:35:44,947 --> 01:35:46,906
how's that escape route working?

1058
01:35:47,074 --> 01:35:49,993
here's your chance to improvise.

1059
01:35:50,161 --> 01:35:51,453
i'm attempting it.

1060
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:54,414
i might be able to get a hand loose.

1061
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:56,833
oh, you got a knife.
that's very good.

1062
01:35:57,960 --> 01:35:59,461
better.

1063
01:36:04,925 --> 01:36:06,176
i want one of those.

1064
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:15,101
here's to revenge. sweet and clear.

1065
01:36:15,269 --> 01:36:19,689
- revenge?
- come, come, hector.

1066
01:36:19,857 --> 01:36:21,232
if you wanted the chalices,

1067
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:24,068
you'd seen they were missing and gone.

1068
01:36:24,236 --> 01:36:27,363
you were lying in wait, for blackbeard.

1069
01:36:29,366 --> 01:36:32,577
king george. privateer. wig.

1070
01:36:33,746 --> 01:36:35,163
cheap theatrical facade.

1071
01:36:35,331 --> 01:36:38,166
- i'm not buying it.
- you weren't there that night.

1072
01:36:38,334 --> 01:36:42,128
- when the pearlwas lost?
- taken, not lost.

1073
01:36:44,757 --> 01:36:48,885
we were off the coast of hispaniola
when we came under attack.

1074
01:36:49,053 --> 01:36:52,472
no provocation nor warning
nor offer of parley.

1075
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:55,266
we were peppered with cannon fire.

1076
01:36:56,435 --> 01:36:59,646
and then the sea beneath
the pearl began to roil.

1077
01:37:01,232 --> 01:37:03,608
the pearlwas pitching
and yawing violently.

1078
01:37:03,776 --> 01:37:05,610
every plank, every rail,

1079
01:37:05,778 --> 01:37:08,613
every spar, all at once,
began to creak.

1080
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:11,783
the rigging had come to life.

1081
01:37:11,951 --> 01:37:14,619
our own ship turned against us...

1082
01:37:14,787 --> 01:37:18,039
...tangling the crew,
wrapping around 'em like snakes.

1083
01:37:18,207 --> 01:37:20,583
and wrapping around me leg.

1084
01:37:20,751 --> 01:37:23,127
but me arms were free
and me sword was to hand.

1085
01:37:23,295 --> 01:37:26,798
i am the master of me ship,
not blackbeard.

1086
01:37:26,966 --> 01:37:30,426
i am the master of my fate,
not blackbeard.

1087
01:37:31,470 --> 01:37:33,805
so i did what needed done.

1088
01:37:40,688 --> 01:37:42,605
i survived.

1089
01:37:44,191 --> 01:37:48,361
so... you're not after the fountain.

1090
01:37:48,529 --> 01:37:52,156
i care not for king george
or tavern yarns

1091
01:37:52,324 --> 01:37:54,534
that give hope for a healed limb.

1092
01:37:56,203 --> 01:37:59,831
but i'd give my left arm
for a chance at blackbeard.

1093
01:37:59,999 --> 01:38:03,001
- not your right?
- i need me good arm

1094
01:38:03,168 --> 01:38:07,797
to drive my poisoned blade
through his heart.

1095
01:38:08,799 --> 01:38:11,217
i'll see you get the chance, mate.

1096
01:39:30,005 --> 01:39:31,297
the prisoner's escaping.

1097
01:39:38,597 --> 01:39:41,265
he's escaping!
fan out! find him!

1098
01:39:41,433 --> 01:39:42,517
go! go!

1099
01:39:44,603 --> 01:39:47,438
hold your fire! i want him alive!

1100
01:39:55,698 --> 01:39:57,615
i figured that was the signal.

1101
01:40:40,743 --> 01:40:44,203
- go! prepare to move out!
- the enemy is soon upon us.

1102
01:40:45,956 --> 01:40:48,875
i'm sorry about the chalices, jack,
but i've an appointment to keep.

1103
01:40:49,043 --> 01:40:52,003
- i'll not be going back.
- no need.

1104
01:40:52,171 --> 01:40:55,173
- shall we have a drink?
- we'll drink at the fountain.

1105
01:41:13,567 --> 01:41:17,111
how is it we can never meet
without you pointing something at me?

1106
01:41:18,322 --> 01:41:20,198
you brought the chalices, sparrow?

1107
01:41:20,365 --> 01:41:22,950
aye. oi!

1108
01:41:26,455 --> 01:41:29,540
- i see you brought a friend.
- i did.

1109
01:41:29,708 --> 01:41:32,919
and the one-legged man, he is near.
aye?

1110
01:41:33,087 --> 01:41:34,462
aye.

1111
01:41:35,297 --> 01:41:36,297
now...

1112
01:41:36,465 --> 01:41:39,258
before i go just handing them over,
i do have one or two conditions.

1113
01:41:39,426 --> 01:41:41,469
- name them.
- firstly,

1114
01:41:41,637 --> 01:41:43,971
i'll be having me compass back.
no, no, that's secondly.

1115
01:41:44,139 --> 01:41:46,349
firstly, upon your word,

1116
01:41:46,517 --> 01:41:48,476
you will bring no harm to angelica.

1117
01:41:48,644 --> 01:41:50,978
i'll make no vows
to the likes of you, sparrow.

1118
01:41:51,146 --> 01:41:53,564
but it costs me nothing to admit

1119
01:41:53,732 --> 01:41:56,567
that she was never in harm's way.

1120
01:41:57,236 --> 01:41:59,403
secondly then, priorly firstly,

1121
01:41:59,571 --> 01:42:01,197
i will be having me compass back.

1122
01:42:02,116 --> 01:42:04,117
please? i do deserve it.

1123
01:42:04,284 --> 01:42:07,745
do you have any idea how difficult
it was to catch that filthy pig?

1124
01:42:07,913 --> 01:42:10,248
not the big one,
the four-legged one.

1125
01:42:13,710 --> 01:42:17,463
thank you. and thirdly, mr. beard,

1126
01:42:17,631 --> 01:42:20,299
there are times, not very often,

1127
01:42:20,467 --> 01:42:23,553
when i do reflect
upon my heinous misdeeds.

1128
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:27,974
chief among them, i note how poorly
i have treated mr. gibbs,

1129
01:42:28,142 --> 01:42:30,768
- my loyal first mate.
- aye! now you bring it up...

1130
01:42:30,936 --> 01:42:33,604
left him to rot in jail, i did.
didn't care.

1131
01:42:33,772 --> 01:42:38,401
still don't. but, point being,
you must let him go free.

1132
01:42:40,279 --> 01:42:43,614
- is that it?
- i think so.

1133
01:42:43,782 --> 01:42:46,367
quick, or the pig runs,
and good luck getting those chalices.

1134
01:42:46,535 --> 01:42:47,952
jack, if it's all the same to you,
i'd be just as...

1135
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:49,412
done.

1136
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:50,746
release the swine.

1137
01:42:56,587 --> 01:42:59,797
perhaps, if you don't mind,
i could tag along with you folk for a...

1138
01:43:02,593 --> 01:43:04,802
this will lead you to freedom, mate.

1139
01:43:11,518 --> 01:43:14,353
i could have swore it was
somewhere right around here.

1140
01:44:44,486 --> 01:44:46,821
we must not stop.

1141
01:45:04,172 --> 01:45:05,548
dead end.

1142
01:45:06,591 --> 01:45:08,509
dead. end.

1143
01:45:09,219 --> 01:45:10,594
dead end.

1144
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:14,598
jack, i'm starting to think
you don't know where you're going.

1145
01:45:15,434 --> 01:45:18,227
it is not the destination
so much as the journey, they say.

1146
01:45:19,479 --> 01:45:20,896
chalices, if you please.

1147
01:45:32,951 --> 01:45:34,452
stand back.

1148
01:45:56,850 --> 01:45:58,392
jack...

1149
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:00,394
...have you ever, in fact...

1150
01:46:00,562 --> 01:46:06,108
...seen with your own eyes...
the fountain of youth?

1151
01:46:06,276 --> 01:46:08,444
i'm sorry, could you
repeat the question, please?

1152
01:46:08,612 --> 01:46:10,071
quartermaster.

1153
01:46:11,031 --> 01:46:11,947
no, no!

1154
01:46:15,660 --> 01:46:17,787
wait, wait! wait.

1155
01:46:21,083 --> 01:46:25,503
"aqua... de vida."

1156
01:47:04,876 --> 01:47:07,378
master scrum...

1157
01:47:07,546 --> 01:47:10,381
- ...do you mind?
- squire?

1158
01:48:09,107 --> 01:48:11,066
so beautiful.

1159
01:48:50,607 --> 01:48:53,192
sparrow, i'll be the first
to taste those waters.

1160
01:48:57,697 --> 01:48:59,281
father.

1161
01:49:02,577 --> 01:49:04,828
the one-legged man.

1162
01:49:07,415 --> 01:49:11,335
- you brought him here.
- would i do that?

1163
01:49:11,503 --> 01:49:13,587
edward teach!

1164
01:49:13,755 --> 01:49:17,007
for crimes committed on the high seas,

1165
01:49:17,175 --> 01:49:21,011
by the authority granted me
by his majesty the king...

1166
01:49:21,179 --> 01:49:24,348
...and with a goodly amount
of personal satisfaction...

1167
01:49:24,516 --> 01:49:27,560
...i hereby place you
in the custody of the court,

1168
01:49:27,727 --> 01:49:31,021
and declare you to be my prisoner.

1169
01:49:32,107 --> 01:49:35,609
my trick's out, is that it?

1170
01:49:35,777 --> 01:49:40,155
such crimes do include, but are not
limited to, piracy, treason,

1171
01:49:40,323 --> 01:49:44,451
murder, torture of
the most heinous sort,

1172
01:49:44,619 --> 01:49:48,497
including the brutal theft of one used,
twisted, hairy right leg.

1173
01:49:49,332 --> 01:49:54,003
you... dare face this sword?

1174
01:49:54,170 --> 01:49:56,589
this far away from your ship? aye.

1175
01:49:56,756 --> 01:50:01,468
aye. that be the cold breath
of fate i feel down my nape.

1176
01:50:01,636 --> 01:50:07,266
but i'll have one last fight, by god.

1177
01:50:07,434 --> 01:50:09,143
kill 'em all!

1178
01:50:10,812 --> 01:50:12,563
hang on a minute.

1179
01:50:12,731 --> 01:50:16,609
i just... i just need
to understand something.

1180
01:50:16,776 --> 01:50:20,112
right, so, you will fight against them,

1181
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:21,572
they will fight against you.

1182
01:50:21,740 --> 01:50:25,409
all on account of him
wanting to kill him?

1183
01:50:25,577 --> 01:50:29,496
where is the sense? exactly.

1184
01:50:29,664 --> 01:50:33,375
i say, let them fight
each other while we lay back,

1185
01:50:33,543 --> 01:50:36,962
watch, have a drink,
place some wagers!

1186
01:50:38,089 --> 01:50:39,381
aye.

1187
01:50:41,968 --> 01:50:43,552
- kill 'em!
- no quarter!

1188
01:51:14,084 --> 01:51:15,709
get off me!

1189
01:51:48,702 --> 01:51:49,702
scrum, the chalices!

1190
01:51:51,871 --> 01:51:52,955
and the tear! follow!

1191
01:51:57,001 --> 01:51:58,168
fight!

1192
01:51:59,129 --> 01:52:02,631
hand it over. the tear.
there's a good lad.

1193
01:52:02,799 --> 01:52:05,092
i'm more afraid of her
than i am of you.

1194
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:13,016
hand it over.
there's a good lad.

1195
01:52:16,438 --> 01:52:20,149
- the chalices, if you please.
- sorry, jack.

1196
01:52:20,316 --> 01:52:24,528
i told you, i need years.
and now, yours will do.

1197
01:52:32,495 --> 01:52:33,662
scrum!

1198
01:52:55,351 --> 01:52:56,810
syrena...

1199
01:53:00,523 --> 01:53:03,317
oh god, you will not take her.

1200
01:53:03,485 --> 01:53:08,405
if you have taken her,
you will give her back.

1201
01:53:08,573 --> 01:53:10,908
give her back...

1202
01:53:11,075 --> 01:53:13,911
give her back, please. please.

1203
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:40,270
i expected fate
to put up more of a fight, eh?

1204
01:53:57,163 --> 01:54:00,874
i will not have that smile
on your face as i strike you down.

1205
01:54:02,377 --> 01:54:05,420
take a gander, edward teach.

1206
01:54:35,994 --> 01:54:39,288
this land is hereby forever
claimed in the glorious name

1207
01:54:39,455 --> 01:54:41,999
of his majesty king george...

1208
01:54:48,298 --> 01:54:51,174
someone make a note
of that man's bravery.

1209
01:54:58,182 --> 01:55:01,894
señorita, the chalices, porfavor.

1210
01:55:18,620 --> 01:55:24,249
only god can grant eternal life,
not this pagan water.

1211
01:55:35,345 --> 01:55:38,805
men, destroy this profane temple!

1212
01:55:41,559 --> 01:55:42,851
the fountain!

1213
01:55:56,950 --> 01:55:58,450
you are a fool.

1214
01:55:58,618 --> 01:56:01,870
you seek in this place
what only faith can provide.

1215
01:56:02,038 --> 01:56:04,539
faith? in faith,
there is light enough to see

1216
01:56:04,707 --> 01:56:06,917
but darkness enough to blind.

1217
01:56:10,546 --> 01:56:12,798
what devilry is this?

1218
01:56:16,803 --> 01:56:19,388
- for the pearl.
- what have you done?

1219
01:56:22,934 --> 01:56:25,310
angelica! don't! it's poison!

1220
01:56:29,983 --> 01:56:32,275
i'm not such the fool
to take on blackbeard

1221
01:56:32,443 --> 01:56:35,821
without a little venomous advantage.

1222
01:56:37,156 --> 01:56:38,615
jack!

1223
01:56:50,461 --> 01:56:52,504
i claim blackbeard's ship and crew,

1224
01:56:52,672 --> 01:56:56,091
and this sword,
payment for my missing limb!

1225
01:57:10,523 --> 01:57:11,898
hang on! pull!

1226
01:57:57,195 --> 01:57:59,529
do not waste my tear.

1227
01:58:29,018 --> 01:58:31,144
drink this.
this one has the tear.

1228
01:58:31,312 --> 01:58:33,271
- you must drink the other.
- no!

1229
01:58:34,065 --> 01:58:37,275
i cannot save you both.
one of you must sacrifice.

1230
01:58:38,236 --> 01:58:41,321
you take it, father, for your soul.

1231
01:58:43,366 --> 01:58:48,787
captain teach, she's dying.
you must save your daughter.

1232
01:58:49,997 --> 01:58:52,749
this one takes life?

1233
01:58:52,917 --> 01:58:54,751
this one has the tear and gives life?

1234
01:58:54,919 --> 01:58:56,169
aye, hurry!

1235
01:59:05,096 --> 01:59:09,349
angelica...
save me, my child.

1236
01:59:11,269 --> 01:59:12,686
no.

1237
01:59:21,404 --> 01:59:22,821
i love you, father.

1238
01:59:35,835 --> 01:59:37,419
wait a minute.

1239
01:59:39,630 --> 01:59:42,424
in fact, it might have been
the other way around.

1240
01:59:43,301 --> 01:59:47,095
this cup had the tear,
that one had the other bit.

1241
01:59:47,263 --> 01:59:48,471
trickster!

1242
01:59:48,639 --> 01:59:50,473
- devil!
- father!

1243
01:59:57,523 --> 01:59:59,024
you bastard! how could you?

1244
02:00:00,067 --> 02:00:01,484
your father saved you.

1245
02:00:01,652 --> 02:00:04,154
perhaps his soul is now redeemed, eh?

1246
02:01:05,007 --> 02:01:07,092
you are hurt.

1247
02:01:09,345 --> 02:01:11,221
in body only.

1248
02:01:12,932 --> 02:01:17,143
my mind is at peace...
because of you.

1249
02:01:18,229 --> 02:01:21,064
- me?
- yes.

1250
02:01:22,108 --> 02:01:24,484
i was lost.

1251
02:01:25,486 --> 02:01:30,115
the wind, the tides...

1252
02:01:30,283 --> 02:01:33,326
...they ought to renew a man's faith.

1253
02:01:34,912 --> 02:01:36,830
but for me, only you.

1254
02:01:37,748 --> 02:01:41,459
philip, i can save you.

1255
02:01:41,627 --> 02:01:44,546
you need only ask.

1256
02:01:46,048 --> 02:01:50,802
- i seek but one thing.
- what is that?

1257
02:01:51,846 --> 02:01:54,180
forgiveness.

1258
02:01:54,348 --> 02:01:57,642
if not for me, you would
never have been captured.

1259
02:01:57,810 --> 02:01:59,436
ask.

1260
02:02:01,355 --> 02:02:03,148
forgive me?

1261
02:02:28,299 --> 02:02:29,507
i hate you.

1262
02:02:29,675 --> 02:02:31,968
the bloke who saved your life?

1263
02:02:32,136 --> 02:02:35,305
the years i possess,
stolen from my own father!

1264
02:02:35,473 --> 02:02:38,475
i only helped blackbeard do what
any father should have done.

1265
02:02:38,642 --> 02:02:41,811
you are cruel and ignorant.

1266
02:02:45,566 --> 02:02:49,319
one pistol, one shot.

1267
02:02:49,487 --> 02:02:51,696
to kill myself before i starve?

1268
02:02:51,864 --> 02:02:53,406
there's no trusting you, love.

1269
02:02:53,574 --> 02:02:55,992
besides, this is a
well-traveled trade route.

1270
02:02:56,160 --> 02:02:57,744
you can signal a passing ship.

1271
02:02:57,912 --> 02:03:01,331
or you can just bite the
proverbial bullet, as it were.

1272
02:03:01,499 --> 02:03:03,083
and how will i get free
of these bonds?

1273
02:03:03,250 --> 02:03:05,960
you broke free of your bonds
half an hour ago,

1274
02:03:06,128 --> 02:03:08,922
waiting for the precise moment
to pounce.

1275
02:03:11,634 --> 02:03:13,301
admit it, jack.

1276
02:03:13,469 --> 02:03:17,347
- you still love me.
- if you had a sister and a dog,

1277
02:03:17,515 --> 02:03:19,808
i'd choose the dog.

1278
02:03:19,975 --> 02:03:23,311
treasure!
there is a chest with jewels!

1279
02:03:23,479 --> 02:03:25,688
jewels with the power
to rule the wind and tide!

1280
02:03:25,856 --> 02:03:28,942
- you're making that up!
- wait...

1281
02:03:29,777 --> 02:03:33,446
i am with child. yours.

1282
02:03:34,698 --> 02:03:36,074
i don't recall that we ever had...

1283
02:03:36,242 --> 02:03:38,952
- you were drunk!
- i've actually never been that drunk.

1284
02:03:39,120 --> 02:03:40,203
wait!

1285
02:03:42,123 --> 02:03:44,165
there is something i want to say to you.

1286
02:03:44,333 --> 02:03:48,503
something i wanted to say
from the moment we first met.

1287
02:03:49,463 --> 02:03:50,547
go on, then.

1288
02:03:52,925 --> 02:03:54,217
i love you.

1289
02:03:57,847 --> 02:03:59,639
as do i.

1290
02:03:59,807 --> 02:04:03,226
always have. always will.

1291
02:04:07,773 --> 02:04:09,232
i gotta go.

1292
02:04:09,400 --> 02:04:10,400
jack!

1293
02:04:12,736 --> 02:04:14,320
this is not over!

1294
02:04:15,406 --> 02:04:16,448
jack!

1295
02:04:26,041 --> 02:04:27,542
missed!

1296
02:04:42,850 --> 02:04:45,852
the revenge is mine.

1297
02:04:52,568 --> 02:04:53,985
sir...

1298
02:04:56,489 --> 02:04:58,323
we found this below decks.

1299
02:05:24,433 --> 02:05:26,684
all hands!
ply to windward!

1300
02:05:26,852 --> 02:05:30,396
get cracking,
ye blooming cockroaches!

1301
02:05:33,108 --> 02:05:35,693
the crown served me well.

1302
02:05:35,861 --> 02:05:38,821
but now, by the gods of sea and sky...

1303
02:05:38,989 --> 02:05:43,076
...make way for tortuga!

1304
02:05:54,213 --> 02:05:57,340
gibbs, you filthy, besotted shellback,
you made it!

1305
02:05:57,508 --> 02:05:59,050
aye!

1306
02:05:59,218 --> 02:06:00,718
and i trust we managed a profit

1307
02:06:00,886 --> 02:06:05,098
- from ourjoint enterprise?
- feast your eyes.

1308
02:06:10,187 --> 02:06:12,689
the compass led me straight and true.

1309
02:06:12,856 --> 02:06:14,816
what of blackbeard's men
guarding the ship?

1310
02:06:14,984 --> 02:06:18,820
i employed the selfsame maneuver
we perfected in new guinea.

1311
02:06:18,988 --> 02:06:23,032
seemed a shame to leave
an entire fleet behind.

1312
02:06:23,200 --> 02:06:25,243
shame indeed.

1313
02:06:37,214 --> 02:06:38,548
i hate that monkey.

1314
02:06:38,716 --> 02:06:42,135
so, the pearl...
any idea how to get her out?

1315
02:06:42,303 --> 02:06:45,305
we shall need a crossbow,
an hourglass, three goats.

1316
02:06:45,472 --> 02:06:48,474
one of us must learn to play the trumpet
whilst the other one goes like this...

1317
02:06:49,018 --> 02:06:52,270
- i know a man with a goat.
- good. i can go like this.

1318
02:06:54,940 --> 02:06:56,566
jack, i have to ask...

1319
02:06:56,734 --> 02:06:59,569
you had the chalices,
the water, the tear...

1320
02:06:59,737 --> 02:07:02,238
you could have lived maybe forever.

1321
02:07:02,406 --> 02:07:04,365
the fountain does test you, gibbs.

1322
02:07:04,533 --> 02:07:07,410
but better to not know
which moment may be your last.

1323
02:07:07,578 --> 02:07:09,579
every morsel of your entire being

1324
02:07:09,747 --> 02:07:12,832
alive to the infinite mystery of it all.

1325
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,501
and who's to say
i won't live forever, eh?

1326
02:07:15,669 --> 02:07:18,755
discoverer of the fountain of youth.

1327
02:07:18,922 --> 02:07:21,799
i have no say in it, gibbs.

1328
02:07:21,967 --> 02:07:23,926
it's a pirate's life for me.

1329
02:07:24,887 --> 02:07:26,387
savvy?
