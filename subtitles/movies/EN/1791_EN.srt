1
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,587
I am Gunnery Sergeant Hartman,
your senior drill instructor.

2
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,825
From now on,
you will speak only when spoken to...

3
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:45,597
... and the first and last words
out of your filthy sewers will be ""sir.""

4
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,637
Do you maggots understand that?

5
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:49,035
Sir, yes, sir.

6
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:52,508
Bullshit. I can't hear you.
Sound off like you got a pair.

7
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,044
Sir, yes, sir.

8
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:58,571
If you ladies leave my island,
if you survive recruit training...

9
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:00,083
... you will be a weapon.

10
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:03,279
You will be a minister of death
praying for war.

11
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:06,254
But until that day, you are pukes.

12
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,792
You are the lowest form of life on Earth.

13
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,328
You are not even human-fucking-beings.

14
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:16,390
You are nothing but unorganized,
grabasstic pieces of amphibian shit.

15
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:19,436
Because I am hard, you will not like me.

16
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:22,302
But the more you hate me,
the more you will learn.

17
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,568
I am hard but I am fair.

18
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:27,008
There is no racial bigotry here.

19
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,310
I do not look down on niggers,
kikes, wops or greasers.

20
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,975
Here, you are all equally worthless.

21
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,112
And my orders are to weed out
all non-hackers...

22
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,123
... who do not pack the gear
to serve in my beloved Corps.

23
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,284
Do you maggots understand that?

24
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:43,690
Sir, yes, sir.

25
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:45,592
Bullshit. I can't hear you.

26
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:47,756
Sir, yes, sir!

27
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:51,199
-What's your name, scumbag?
-Sir, Private Brown, sir!

28
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,927
Bullshit. From now on
you're Private Snowball.

29
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:56,439
-Do you like that name?
-Sir, yes, sir!

30
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:59,305
Well, there's one thing
that you won't like, Snowball:

31
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,640
They don't serve fried chicken
and watermelon...

32
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:03,908
... on a daily basis in my mess hall.

33
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:05,574
Sir, yes, sir!

34
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:09,314
Is that you, John Wayne? Is this me?

35
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,184
Who said that?

36
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,314
Who the fuck said that?

37
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:16,951
Who's the slimy little communist-shit,
twinkle-toed cocksucker down here...

38
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,758
... who just signed
his own death warrant?

39
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,125
Nobody, huh?

40
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:25,999
The fairy-fucking-godmother said it.
Out-fucking-standing.

41
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:28,766
I will P. T. you all until you fucking die.

42
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,706
I'll P. T. you until your assholes
are sucking buttermilk.

43
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,733
-Was it you, you scroungy little fuck?
-Sir, no, sir.

44
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:38,111
You piece of shit. You look
like a fucking worm. I'll bet it was you.

45
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:41,640
-Sir, no, sir.
-Sir, I said it, sir.

46
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:45,512
Well, no shit.

47
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:49,025
What have we got here?
A fucking comedian. Private Joker.

48
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:51,083
I admire your honesty.

49
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:54,722
Hell, I like you. You can come over
to my house and fuck my sister.

50
00:03:56,369 --> 00:04:00,601
You little scumbag.
I've got your name. I've got your ass.

51
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:02,799
You will not laugh. You will not cry.

52
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,206
You will learn by the numbers.
I will teach you.

53
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,943
Now get up. Get on your feet.

54
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:12,847
You best unfuck yourself or I will unscrew
your head and shit down your neck.

55
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:16,375
-Sir, yes, sir.
-Private Joker, why did you join my Corps?

56
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,615
-Sir, to kill, sir.
-So you're a killer?

57
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:21,647
-Sir, yes, sir.
-Let me see your war face.

58
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:24,217
-Sir?
-You've got a war face?

59
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:29,229
That's a war face.
Now let me see your war face.

60
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:33,930
Bullshit. You didn't convince me.
Let me see your real war face.

61
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,697
You don't scare me. Work on it.

62
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:38,468
Sir, yes, sir!

63
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:39,907
What's your excuse?

64
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,444
Sir, excuse for what, sir?

65
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,447
I'm asking the fucking questions, private.
Do you understand?

66
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,642
-Sir, yes, sir.
-Well, thank you very much.

67
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,380
-Can I be in charge for a while?
-Sir, yes, sir.

68
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:52,684
-Are you shook-up? Are you nervous?
-Sir, I am, sir.

69
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,918
-Do I make you nervous?
-Sir....

70
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:57,790
Sir what?
Were you about to call me an asshole?

71
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,296
-Sir, no, sir.
-How tall are you, private?

72
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,957
Sir, 5'9"", sir.

73
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:04,899
Five-foot-9. I didn't know
they stacked shit that high.

74
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:07,369
You trying to squeeze an inch
in on me somewhere?

75
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,532
-Sir, no, sir.
-Bullshit. It looks like the best part of you...

76
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,441
... ran down the crack of your mama's ass
and ended up as a stain on the mattress.

77
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,944
I think you've been cheated.

78
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,213
Where the hell are you from, private?

79
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,875
-Sir, Texas, sir.
-Holy dogshit. Texas?

80
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:24,114
Only steers and queers
come from Texas, Private Cowboy.

81
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,782
And you don't much look like a steer to me,
so that kind of narrows it down.

82
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:29,952
-Do you suck dicks?
-Sir, no, sir.

83
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:32,427
-Are you a peter puffer?
-Sir, no, sir.

84
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:35,022
I'll bet you would fuck
a person in the ass...

85
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:38,830
... and not even have the goddamn common
courtesy to give him a reach around.

86
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,098
I'll be watching you.

87
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,868
Did your parents have any children
that lived?

88
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:47,274
-Sir, yes, sir.
-I'll bet they regret that.

89
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:50,371
You're so ugly you could be
a modern-art masterpiece.

90
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,144
-What's your name, fat-body?
-Sir, Leonard Lawrence, sir.

91
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,014
Lawrence? Lawrence what, of Arabia?

92
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,817
-Sir, no, sir.
-That name sounds like royalty. You royalty?

93
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:00,948
-Sir, no, sir.
-Do you suck dicks?

94
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:04,051
-Sir, no, sir.
-Bullshit. I'll bet you could suck a golf ball...

95
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,186
-... through a garden hose.
-Sir, no, sir.

96
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,799
I don't like the name Lawrence.

97
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,094
Only faggots and sailors
are called Lawrence.

98
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,898
-From now on you're Gomer Pyle.
-Sir, yes, sir.

99
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:15,734
Do you think I'm cute, Private Pyle?
You think I'm funny?

100
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:19,003
-Sir, no, sir.
-Wipe that disgusting grin off your face.

101
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:21,066
Sir, yes, sir.

102
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,374
Well, any-fucking-time, sweetheart.

103
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,240
-Sir, I'm trying, sir.
-Private Pyle, I'll give you three seconds...

104
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,513
... exactly three fucking seconds...

105
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,249
... to wipe that stupid-looking grin
off your face...

106
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:36,418
... or I will gouge out your eyeballs
and skull-fuck you.

107
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:39,121
One. Two. Three.

108
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:43,929
-Sir, I can't help it, sir.
-Bullshit. Get on your knees, scumbag.

109
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,635
Now choke yourself.

110
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:51,867
Goddamn it, with my hand, numb-nuts.

111
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:56,073
Don't pull my fucking hand over there.
I said, choke yourself.

112
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,082
Now lean forward and choke yourself.

113
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:05,081
-Are you through grinning?
-Sir, yes, sir.

114
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,816
Bullshit. I can't hear you.

115
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,191
Sir, yes, sir.

116
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:13,184
Bullshit. I still can't hear you.
Sound off like you've got a pair.

117
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,163
Sir, yes, sir.

118
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:18,224
That's enough. Get on your feet.

119
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:25,803
Pyle, you had best square your ass away
and start shitting me Tiffany cuff links...

120
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,573
... or I will definitely fuck you up.

121
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,704
Sir, yes, sir.

122
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:35,308
Left, right, left, right
left, right, left.

123
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,820
Left, right, left, right, left.

124
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,618
Left, right, left, right, left....

125
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,420
Parris Island, South Carolina...

126
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:45,826
... the United States Marine Corps
Recruit Depot.

127
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:49,628
An eight-week college
for the phony-tough and the crazy-brave.

128
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,635
Mama and Papa were laying in bed

129
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,569
Mama and Papa were laying in bed

130
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:58,575
Mama rolled over
And this is what she said

131
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:01,111
Mama rolled over, this is what she said

132
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,204
-Oh, give me some, give me some
-Oh, give me some, give me some

133
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:05,681
-P. T.
-P. T.

134
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:07,183
-P. T.
-P. T.

135
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:08,684
-Good for you
-Good for you

136
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,345
-And good for me
-And good for me

137
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,787
-Good
-Good

138
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,688
Up in the morning to the rising sun

139
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:17,352
Up in the morning to the rising sun

140
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,294
Gonna run all day till the running's done

141
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:23,594
Gonna run all day till the running's done

142
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,603
Ho Chi Minh is a son of a bitch

143
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:29,196
Ho Chi Minh is a son of a bitch

144
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,264
Got the blue balls, crabs
And the seven-year itch

145
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:35,505
Got the blue balls, crabs
And the seven-year itch

146
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:39,209
Left, right, left, right, left.

147
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:42,309
Your left shoulder.

148
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:46,350
Left, right, left. Port.

149
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:51,326
Left, right. Attack. Halt.

150
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,194
Left shoulder.

151
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:01,035
Private Pyle, what are you trying to do
to my beloved Corps?

152
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,732
-Sir, I don't know, sir.
-You are dumb, Private Pyle...

153
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,175
... but do you expect me to believe
that you don't know left from right?

154
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:09,712
-Sir, no, sir.
-Then you did that on purpose.

155
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,771
-You wanna be different.
-Sir, no, sir.

156
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,841
-What side was that, Private Pyle?
-Sir, left side, sir.

157
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:19,549
-Are you sure, Private Pyle?
-Sir, yes, sir.

158
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:23,287
-What side was that, Private Pyle?
-Sir, right side, sir.

159
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:25,829
Don't fuck with me again, Pyle.

160
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:27,625
Pick up your fucking cover.

161
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,028
Sir, yes, sir.

162
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:32,035
Your left shoulder.

163
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:36,270
Left, right, left. Port.

164
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,304
Left shoulder.

165
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:44,805
Your right shoulder.

166
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:50,975
Left, right, left, right.
Your left shoulder.

167
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,886
Left, two, three, four.

168
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:57,586
Your right shoulder.

169
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:04,359
Tonight you pukes will sleep
with your rifles.

170
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:08,029
You will give your rifle a girl's name.

171
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:13,406
Because this is the only pussy
you people are going to get.

172
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:18,039
Your days of finger-banging
old Mary Jane Rottencrotch...

173
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:22,381
... through her purty pink panties
are over.

174
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,614
You're married to this piece.

175
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,453
This weapon of iron and wood.

176
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,824
And you will be faithful.

177
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,360
Arms.

178
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,732
Prepare to mount.

179
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:43,265
Mount.

180
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:49,639
Port.

181
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,715
Pray.

182
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,447
This is my rifle.

183
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:02,116
There are many like it,
but this one is mine.

184
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:04,957
My rifle is my best friend.

185
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,792
It is my life.

186
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:11,255
I must master it
as I must master my life.

187
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,395
Without me, my rifle is useless.

188
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:17,429
Without my rifle, I am useless.

189
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,474
I must fire my rifle true.

190
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:24,673
I must shoot straighter than my enemy,
who is trying to kill me.

191
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,809
I must shoot him before he shoots me.

192
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:29,511
I will.

193
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,351
Before God, I swear this creed.

194
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:36,222
My rifle and myself are defenders
of my country.

195
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:38,659
We are the masters of our enemy.

196
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:41,322
We are the saviors of my life.

197
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:45,699
So be it until there is no enemy,
but peace.

198
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,567
Amen.

199
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,901
Arm.

200
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,374
At ease.

201
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:57,772
Good night, ladies.

202
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,579
Good night, sir.

203
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:03,547
-Hit it, sweetheart.
-Sir, aye, aye, sir.

204
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,878
Right shoulder.

205
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:14,651
That is not
your daddy's shotgun, Cowboy.

206
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:19,033
Left shoulder.

207
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:26,701
Move the rifle around your head,
not your head around the rifle.

208
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,377
Port.

209
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:37,214
Four inches from your chest, Pyle.
Four inches.

210
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,350
This is my rifle, this is my gun

211
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:43,017
This is for fighting, this is for fun

212
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:45,618
This is my rifle, this is my gun

213
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:48,187
This is for fighting, this is for fun

214
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:50,858
This is my rifle, this is my gun

215
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:53,460
This is for fighting, this is for fun

216
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,062
This is my rifle, this is my gun

217
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:58,665
This is for fighting, this is for fun

218
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:01,210
This is my rifle, this is my gun

219
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,144
This is for fighting, this is for fun

220
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:11,051
You ' re bouncing.

221
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:28,101
T en fucking seconds.

222
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:33,132
It should take you no less than 1 0
fucking seconds to negotiate this obstacle.

223
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,802
Quickly, move it out.

224
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:38,609
There ain't one swinging-dick private
in this platoon's gonna graduate...

225
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:43,050
... until they can get this obstacle down
to less than 1 0 fucking seconds.

226
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,536
Next two privates. Quickly.

227
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:11,478
Get over that goddamn obstacle. Move it.

228
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,709
Next two privates. Quickly.

229
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:15,251
Hurry up. Get up there.

230
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:18,117
-Private Joker, are you a killer?
-Sir, yes, sir.

231
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,155
Let me hear your war cry.

232
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:24,057
Next two privates, go. Quickly.

233
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,357
Get your fat ass over there, Private Pyle.

234
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,261
Oh, that's right, Private Pyle.

235
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:32,325
Don't make any fucking effort
to get up to the top of the fucking obstacle.

236
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:36,999
If God wanted you up there, he would have
miracled your ass up by now, wouldn't he?

237
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:39,906
-Sir, yes, sir.
-Get your fat ass up there, Pyle.

238
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,274
-Sir, yes, sir.
-What is the matter with you?

239
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:46,646
I'll bet if there was some pussy up there on
top of that obstacle, you could get up there.

240
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,514
-Couldn't you?
-Sir, yes, sir.

241
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:52,885
Your ass looks like about 1 50 pounds
of chewed bubble gum. Do you know that?

242
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,492
Sir, yes, sir.

243
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,228
One for the commandant.

244
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:02,425
One for the Corps.

245
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:06,366
Get up there. Pull.

246
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:10,237
I guess the Corps don't get theirs.
Get up there, Pyle.

247
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,435
Pull. Pull, Pyle, pull.

248
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:16,137
One pull-up, Pyle. Come on, pull.

249
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:19,910
You gotta be shitting me, Pyle.
Get your ass up there.

250
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:23,749
Do you mean to tell me that you cannot
do one single pull-up?

251
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:28,280
You are a worthless piece of shit, Pyle.
Get out of my face.

252
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:30,452
Get up there, Snowball.

253
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:33,259
Get up here, fat-boy.

254
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,697
Quickly. Move it up.
Move it up, Pyle. Move it up.

255
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:41,067
You climb obstacles like old people fuck.
Do you know that, Private Pyle?

256
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,539
Get up here. You're too slow.
Move it. Move it.

257
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:48,237
Private Pyle, whatever you do,
don't fall down.

258
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,609
That would break my fucking heart.

259
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:54,241
Quickly. Up and over. Up and over.

260
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,947
Well, what in the fuck are you waiting for,
Private Pyle?

261
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:01,855
Get up and over.
Move it, move it, move it.

262
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,552
Are you quitting on me?

263
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,755
Well, are you?

264
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:11,221
Then quit, you slimy fucking
walrus-looking piece of shit.

265
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:13,894
Get the fuck off of my obstacle.

266
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,803
Get the fuck down off of my obstacle.

267
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,171
Now. Move it.

268
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:24,703
I'm gonna rip your balls off so you
cannot contaminate the rest of the world.

269
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:27,512
I will motivate you, Private Pyle...

270
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:32,282
... if it short-dicks every cannibal
on the Congo.

271
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:35,886
Pick them up and set them down, Pyle.

272
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:38,120
Quickly. Move it out.

273
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:42,893
Were you born a fat, slimy,
scumbag puke piece of shit, Private Pyle?

274
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:45,400
Or did you have to work on it?

275
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:49,166
Move it up. Quickly. Hustle up.

276
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:53,903
The fucking war will be over by the time
we get out there, won't it, Private Pyle?

277
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,637
Move it.

278
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:59,978
Are you going to fucking die, Pyle?
Are you going to die on me?

279
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:02,177
Do it now.

280
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,812
Move it up. Hustle it up.
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

281
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:09,452
Do you feel dizzy?

282
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,960
Do you feel faint?

283
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:17,658
Jesus H. Christ,
I think you've got a hard-on.

284
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:23,297
Quickly, ladies. Assholes and elbows.
Move it out.

285
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:24,999
Get up here.

286
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:28,840
Move it. Move it, move it, move it.

287
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:30,972
Quickly.

288
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,938
Quickly. Get up here.
Hurry up. Move it out.

289
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:51,200
Reveille. Reveille. Reveille.

290
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,235
Drop your cocks and grab your socks.

291
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,294
Today is Sunday.
Divine worship at 0800.

292
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,864
Get your bunks made
and get your uniforms on.

293
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:01,968
Police call will commence
in two minutes.

294
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:03,546
Private Cowboy, Private Joker.

295
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:05,274
-Sir, yes, sir.
-Sir, yes, sir.

296
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:09,012
As soon as you finish your bunks,
I want you two turds to clean the head.

297
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:12,248
-Sir, aye, aye, sir.
-I want that head so sanitary...

298
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:16,485
... that the Virgin Mary herself would be
proud to go in there and take a dump.

299
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,027
-Sir, yes, sir.
-Sir, yes, sir.

300
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:20,427
Private Joker, do you believe
in the Virgin Mary?

301
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,396
Sir, no, sir.

302
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:29,267
Well, Private Joker,
I don't believe I heard you correctly.

303
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,636
Sir, the private said, "" No, sir,"" sir.

304
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,973
Why, you little maggot.
You make me wanna vomit.

305
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:39,311
You goddamn communist heathen.
Sound off that you love the Virgin Mary...

306
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,680
... or I'm gonna stomp your guts out.

307
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:44,186
Now, you do love the Virgin Mary,
don't you?

308
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:45,618
Sir, negative, sir.

309
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,282
Private Joker,
are you trying to offend me?

310
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,791
Sir, negative, sir.

311
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:53,022
Sir, the private believes that
any answer he gives will be wrong...

312
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:57,089
... and the senior drill instructor will
beat him harder if he reverses himself, sir.

313
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:58,827
Who's your squad leader, scumbag?

314
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:01,837
Sir, the private's squad leader
is Private Snowball, sir.

315
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:03,895
Private Snowball.

316
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,704
Sir, Private Snowball
reporting as ordered, sir.

317
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:10,576
Private Snowball, you're fired.
Private Joker is promoted to squad leader.

318
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:13,172
-Sir, aye, aye, sir.
-Disappear, scumbag.

319
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:16,082
-Sir, aye, aye, sir.
-Private Pyle.

320
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:19,179
-Sir, Private Pyle reporting as ordered, sir.
-From now on...

321
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:22,657
... Private Joker is your new squad leader
and you will bunk with him.

322
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,125
He'll teach you everything.

323
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:26,491
-He'll teach you how to pee.
-Sir, yes, sir.

324
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:30,761
Private Joker is silly and he's ignorant,
but he's got guts and guts is enough.

325
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,665
Now, you ladies, carry on.

326
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,033
Sir, aye, aye, sir.

327
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:45,005
The bolt. The bolt goes in the receiver.

328
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,750
Operating-rod handle.

329
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:53,414
Operating-rod guide.

330
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:57,057
And the left one over the right.

331
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,322
Right one over the left.

332
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,998
Left one over the right.

333
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,433
The right one over the left.

334
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:12,239
Just throw your other leg over.

335
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:18,743
Attaboy.

336
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:24,810
That's it. Now just pull the next one over
and you're home free.

337
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:27,316
Ready?

338
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,320
Just throw it over.

339
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,968
Attaboy.

340
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,106
Set it down.

341
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:49,436
All right?

342
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,470
There you go.

343
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,281
Congratulations, Leonard.

344
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:58,047
You did it.

345
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:01,849
Fold the blanket
and the sheet back together.

346
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:04,359
Make a four-inch fold.

347
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:07,224
Okay? Got it?

348
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,287
You do it.

349
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:13,161
Right shoulder.

350
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:15,431
Your left shoulder.

351
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:20,606
Port.

352
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,914
Order.

353
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:52,433
Your right shoulder.

354
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:58,441
Square these weapons away.

355
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:01,472
My Corps' arms should be
parallel to the....

356
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:06,918
The deadliest weapon in the world...

357
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:10,949
... is a Marine and his rifle.

358
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:14,621
It is your killer instinct
which must be harnessed...

359
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,861
... if you expect to survive in combat.

360
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:22,564
Your rifle is only a tool.

361
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:25,301
It is a hard heart that kills.

362
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:30,935
If your killer instincts
are not clean and strong...

363
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:34,142
... you will hesitate
at the moment of truth.

364
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:36,310
You will not kill.

365
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,854
You will become dead-Marine.

366
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:42,357
And then you will be in a world of shit.

367
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,257
Because Marines...

368
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:48,024
... are not allowed to die
without permission.

369
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,861
Do you maggots understand?

370
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,559
Sir, yes, sir.

371
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:55,936
I love working for Uncle Sam

372
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:58,872
I love working for Uncle Sam

373
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,808
Lets me know just who I am

374
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,778
Lets me know just who I am

375
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,783

I don 't know, but I've been told

384
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:28,893
I don 't know, but I've been told

385
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,838
Eskimo pussy is mighty cold

386
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,808
Eskimo pussy is mighty cold

387
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,311
-Good
-Good

388
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:37,846

00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:46,923
-Good for me
-Good for me

395
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:51,018
Trim them.

396
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:55,762
Toe jam.

397
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:00,502
Pop that blister.

398
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:12,070
Jesus H. Christ.

399
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:16,249
Private Pyle,
why is your footlocker unlocked?

400
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:17,581
Sir, I don't know, sir.

401
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:21,214
Private Pyle, if there is one thing
in this world that I hate...

402
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:24,692
... it is an unlocked footlocker.
You know that, don't you?

403
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:27,423
-Sir, yes, sir.
-lf it wasn't for dickheads like you...

404
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,159
... there wouldn't be thievery
in the world, would there?

405
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:32,291
-Sir, no, sir.
-Get down.

406
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:40,497
Well, now, let's just see
if there's anything missing.

407
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:45,276
Holy Jesus.

408
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,247
What is that?

409
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:50,013
What the fuck is that?

410
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:51,883
What is that, Private Pyle?

411
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:53,319
Sir, a jelly doughnut, sir.

412
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,858
-A jelly doughnut?
-Sir, yes, sir.

413
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:59,088
-How did it get here?
-Sir, I took it from the mess hall, sir.

414
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:01,391
Is chow allowed in the barracks,
Private Pyle?

415
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:05,297
-Sir, no, sir.
-Are you allowed to eat jelly doughnuts?

416
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,836
-Sir, no, sir.
-And why not, Private Pyle?

417
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,667
Sir, because I'm too heavy, sir.

418
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:14,869
-Because you are a disgusting fat-body.
-Sir, yes, sir.

419
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:18,608
Then why did you hide a jelly doughnut
in your footlocker, Private Pyle?

420
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:20,740
Sir, because I was hungry, sir.

421
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:24,013
Because you were hungry.

422
00:25:27,426 --> 00:25:31,214
Private Pyle has dishonored himself...

423
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:34,024
... and dishonored the platoon.

424
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:38,158
I have tried to help him,
but I have failed.

425
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:43,228
I have failed
because you have not helped me.

426
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:47,469
You people have not given Private Pyle...

427
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:49,841
... the proper motivation.

428
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:55,509
So from now on,
whenever Private Pyle fucks up...

429
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:57,951
... I will not punish him.

430
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:00,614
I will punish all of you.

431
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,852
And the way I see it, ladies...

432
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:06,088
... you owe me for one jelly doughnut.

433
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:08,960
Now get on your faces.

434
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:12,097
Open your mouth.

435
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,761
They're paying for it, you eat it.

436
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,306
Ready, exercise.

437
00:26:17,476 --> 00:26:20,104
One, two, three, four

438
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:22,769
I love the Marine Corps

439
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:25,314
One, two, three, four

440
00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:27,873
I love the Marine Corps

441
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:30,476
One, two, three, four

442
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:32,987
I love the Marine Corps

443
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:35,649
One, two, three, four

444
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:38,159
I love the Marine Corps

445
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,696
One, two, three, four....

446
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:44,891
You really look like shit today, Leonard.

447
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:52,972
Joker.

448
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,144
Everybody hates me now.

449
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:02,550
Even you.

450
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,922
Nobody hates you, Leonard.

451
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:10,588
You just keep making mistakes.

452
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:13,060
Getting everybody in trouble.

453
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,527
I can't do anything right.

454
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,961
I need help.

455
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:28,843
I'm trying to help you, Leonard.

456
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:32,709
I'm really trying.

457
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:37,013
Tuck your shirt in.

458
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:43,415
One, two, three, 1 9.

459
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:45,620
One, two, three, 20.

460
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:47,856
One, two, three, 21.

461
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:50,058
One, two, three, 22.

462
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:52,157
One, two, three, 23.

463
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,362
One, two, three, 24.

464
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,530
One, two, three, 25.

465
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:58,596
One, two, three, 26.

466
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:00,802
One, two, three, 27.

467
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:02,970
One, two, three, 28.

468
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:05,070
One, two, three, 29.

469
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,741
One, two, three, 30.

470
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:35,028
Do it.

471
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:36,401
Do it.

472
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:48,880
Remember, it's just a bad dream, fat-boy.

473
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:19,013
Port.

474
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:23,243
Left shoulder.

475
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,254
Right shoulder.

476
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:33,421
Port.

477
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:39,390
Do we love our beloved Corps, ladies?

478
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:43,894
Semper fi, do or die.
Gung ho. Gung ho. Gung ho.

479
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:46,202
What makes the grass grow?

480
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:48,343
Blood, blood, blood.

481
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,243
What do we do for a living, ladies?

482
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:53,111
Kill, kill, kill.

483
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:54,876
I can't hear you.

484
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:56,748
Kill, kill, kill.

485
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:59,981
Bullshit. I still can't hear you.

486
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:01,785
Kill, kill, kill.

487
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:06,493
Do any of you people know
who Charles Whitman was?

488
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:10,490
None of you dumb-asses knows?

489
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:12,830
Private Cowboy.

490
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:17,361
Sir, he was that guy who shot all those
people from that tower in Austin, Texas, sir.

491
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,375
That's affirmative.
Charles Whitman killed 1 2 people...

492
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:24,743
... from a 28-story observation tower
at the University of Texas.

493
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:27,805
From distances of up to 400 yards.

494
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,818
Anybody know
who Lee Harvey Oswald was?

495
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,048
Private Snowball.

496
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:35,554
Sir, he shot Kennedy, sir.

497
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:38,560
That's right.
And do you know how far away he was?

498
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:43,053
Sir, he was pretty far.
From that book-suppository building, sir.

499
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,190
All right, knock it off.

500
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,258
Two hundred and fifty feet.

501
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:51,637
He was 250 feet away
and shooting at a moving target.

502
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:57,407
Oswald got off three rounds with an old
ltalian bolt-action rifle in only six seconds...

503
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:01,040
... and scored two hits,
including a head shot.

504
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:05,383
Do any of you people know where
these individuals learned how to shoot?

505
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,918
Private Joker.

506
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,015
Sir, in the Marines, sir.

507
00:32:10,195 --> 00:32:12,720
In the Marines. Outstanding.

508
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:17,857
Those individuals showed what one
motivated Marine and his rifle can do.

509
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:20,596
And before you ladies leave my island...

510
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:24,105
... you will all be able
to do the same thing.

511
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:45,857
Today...

512
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,191
... is Christmas.

513
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:53,565
There will be a magic show at 0930.

514
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:57,499
Chaplain Charlie will tell you...

515
00:32:57,675 --> 00:33:02,237
... about how the free world
will conquer communism...

516
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:07,043
... with the aid of God and a few Marines.

517
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:11,510
God has a hard-on for Marines...

518
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:16,353
... because we kill everything we see.

519
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:18,917
He plays his games...

520
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:21,793
... we play ours.

521
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:26,824
To show our appreciation
for so much power...

522
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:32,363
... we keep heaven packed
with fresh souls.

523
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:37,103
God was here before the Marine Corps.

524
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:40,274
So you can give your heart to Jesus...

525
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:44,148
... but your ass belongs to the Corps.

526
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:46,278
Do you ladies understand?

527
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:49,449
-Sir, yes, sir.
-I can't hear you.

528
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:51,458
Sir, yes, sir.

529
00:33:57,235 --> 00:34:00,534
It's been swabbed and brushed.

530
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:03,703
Everything...

531
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,440
... is clean.

532
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:12,111
Beautiful.

533
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,346
So that it slides perfect.

534
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:19,951
Nice.

535
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,421
Everything clean.

536
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:26,855
Oiled.

537
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:32,089
So that your action is beautiful.

538
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,304
Smooth Charlene.

539
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:03,056
Leonard talks to his rifle.

540
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:06,930
Yeah.

541
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:17,372
I don't think Leonard
can hack it anymore.

542
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:21,312
I think Leonard's a Section Eight.

543
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:26,844
It don't surprise me.

544
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:40,734
I wanna slip my tube steak
into your sister.

545
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,003
What will you take in trade?

546
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:50,134
What do you got?

547
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:06,389
Outstanding, Private Pyle.

548
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:09,260
I think we finally found
something that you do well.

549
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:11,299
Sir, yes, sir.

550
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,469
What's your sixth general order?

551
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:19,132
Sir, the sixth general order
is to receive and obey...

552
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:21,700
... and pass on to the sentry
who relieves me...

553
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:23,642
... all orders....

554
00:36:23,815 --> 00:36:25,578
Sir, the private's sixth general....

555
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:28,172
The private has been instructed
but does not know.

556
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:31,618
You slimy scumbag,
get on your face and give me 25.

557
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:33,882
Sir, aye, aye, sir.

558
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:40,461
How many counts in that movement
you just executed?

559
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:43,794
-Sir, four counts, sir.
-What's the idea of looking in the chamber?

560
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:48,234
Sir, to guarantee the private is not giving
the inspecting officer a loaded weapon, sir.

561
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:49,896
What's your fifth general order?

562
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:54,101
Sir, the fifth general order is to quit my post
only when properly relieved, sir.

563
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:56,075
What's this weapon's name,
Private Pyle?

564
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:59,080
Sir, the private's weapon's name
is Charlene, sir.

565
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:02,014
Private Pyle, you are definitely
born-again hard.

566
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:05,781
Hell, I may even allow you to serve
as a rifleman in my beloved Corps.

567
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:08,050
Sir, yes, sir.

568
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:13,157
I don 't want no teenage queen

569
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:15,925
I don 't want no teenage queen

570
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,762
I just want my M14

571
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:21,530
I just want my M14

572
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:24,402
If I die in a combat zone

573
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:27,135
If I die in a combat zone

574
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:29,871
Box me up and ship me home

575
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:32,675
Box me up and ship me home

576
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,478
Pin my medals upon my chest

577
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:38,247
Pin my medals upon my chest

578
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:41,017
Tell my mom I done my best

579
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,091
Tell my mom I done my best

580
00:37:45,604 --> 00:37:49,199
Graduation is only a few days away...

581
00:37:49,374 --> 00:37:53,936
... and the recruits of Platoon 3092
are salty.

582
00:37:54,112 --> 00:37:58,071
They are ready to eat their own guts
and ask for seconds.

583
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:04,077
The drill instructors are proud to see
that we are growing beyond their control.

584
00:38:04,456 --> 00:38:07,846
The Marine Corps does not want robots.

585
00:38:08,026 --> 00:38:10,984
The Marine Corps wants killers.

586
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:14,929
The Marine Corps wants to build
indestructible men.

587
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,898
Men without fear.

588
00:38:19,972 --> 00:38:24,432
Today, you people are
no longer maggots.

589
00:38:25,978 --> 00:38:29,573
Today, you are Marines.

590
00:38:30,148 --> 00:38:32,981
You 're part of a brotherhood.

591
00:38:33,151 --> 00:38:37,247
From now on, until the day you die...

592
00:38:37,422 --> 00:38:39,720
... wherever you are...

593
00:38:39,892 --> 00:38:43,384
... every Marine is your brother.

594
00:38:44,496 --> 00:38:47,590
Most of you will go to Vietnam.

595
00:38:47,766 --> 00:38:50,997
Some of you will not come back.

596
00:38:51,169 --> 00:38:53,364
But always remember this:

597
00:38:53,538 --> 00:38:55,403
Marines die.

598
00:38:55,574 --> 00:38:58,099
That's what we're here for.

599
00:38:58,277 --> 00:39:01,371
But the Marine Corps lives forever...

600
00:39:01,546 --> 00:39:06,279
... and that means you live forever.

601
00:39:10,155 --> 00:39:11,816
-Peckett.
-Sir, yes, sir.

602

-Adams.
-Sir, yes, sir.

606
00:39:19,498 --> 00:39:21,193
1 800, Engineers.

607
00:39:21,366 --> 00:39:22,890
You go out and find mines.

608
00:39:23,068 --> 00:39:24,865
-Cowboy.
-Sir, yes, sir.

609

0300, lnfantry.

612

-Joker.
-Sir, yes, sir.

613
00:39:32,377 --> 00:39:35,505
421 2, Basic Military Journalism.

614
00:39:35,681 --> 00:39:37,740
You gotta be shitting me, Joker.

615
00:39:37,916 --> 00:39:39,440
You think you're Mickey Spillane?

616
00:39:39,618 --> 00:39:41,643
You think you're some kind
of fucking writer?

617
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:44,243
Sir, I wrote for
my high school newspaper, sir.

618
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:48,086
Jesus H. Christ.
You're not a writer, you're a killer.

619
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,488
A killer, yes, sir.

620
00:39:49,661 --> 00:39:51,219
Gomer Pyle.

621
00:39:51,396 --> 00:39:53,990
-Gomer Pyle.
-Sir, yes, sir.

622
00:39:54,166 --> 00:39:58,091
You forget your fucking name?
0300, lnfantry. You made it.

623
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,397
-Perkins.
-Sir, yes, sir.

624
00:40:04,576 --> 00:40:07,409
Our last night on the island.

625
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:10,104
I draw fire watch.

626
00:41:12,911 --> 00:41:16,039
Hi, Joker.

627
00:41:38,036 --> 00:41:41,563
Are those live rounds?

628
00:41:47,579 --> 00:41:51,401
Seven-six-two millimeter.

629
00:41:53,051 --> 00:41:56,441
Full metal jacket.

630
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:06,952
Leonard...

631
00:42:07,132 --> 00:42:10,989
... if Hartman comes in here
and catches us...

632
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:15,230
... we'll both be in a world of shit.

633
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:20,808
I am...

634
00:42:22,147 --> 00:42:24,536
... in a world...

635
00:42:26,084 --> 00:42:28,609
... of shit.

636
00:42:31,857 --> 00:42:33,085
Left shoulder.

637
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,059
Right shoulder.

638
00:42:40,165 --> 00:42:41,427
Lock and load.

639
00:42:46,238 --> 00:42:47,603
Order.

640
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:52,239
This is my rifle.

641
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:55,174
There are many like it,
but this one is mine.

642
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:59,747
My rifle is my best friend.
It is my life.

643
00:42:59,918 --> 00:43:02,409
Get back in your bunks.

644
00:43:02,587 --> 00:43:04,748
What is this Mickey Mouse shit?

645
00:43:04,923 --> 00:43:09,781
What in the name of Jesus H. Christ
are you animals doing in my head?

646
00:43:09,961 --> 00:43:13,294
Why is Private Pyle out of his bunk
after lights out?

647
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:16,298
Why is Private Pyle
holding that weapon?

648
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:19,824
Why aren't you stomping
Private Pyle's guts out?

649
00:43:20,005 --> 00:43:23,202
Sir, it is the private's duty
to inform the senior drill instructor...

650
00:43:23,375 --> 00:43:28,108
... that Private Pyle has a full magazine
and has locked and loaded, sir.

651
00:43:35,687 --> 00:43:39,418
Now you listen to me, Private Pyle...

652
00:43:39,591 --> 00:43:42,355
... and you listen good.

653
00:43:42,794 --> 00:43:45,058
I want that weapon...

654
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:47,858
... and I want it now.

655
00:43:48,366 --> 00:43:52,632
You will place that rifle
on the deck at your feet...

656
00:43:52,804 --> 00:43:55,637
... and step back away from it.

657
00:44:03,081 --> 00:44:06,573
What is your major malfunction,
numb-nuts?

658
00:44:06,751 --> 00:44:11,017
Didn't Mommy and Daddy show you
enough attention when you were a child?

659
00:44:36,581 --> 00:44:38,640
Easy, Leonard.

660
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,179
Go easy, man.

661
00:45:09,881 --> 00:45:11,109
No!

662
00:46:11,609 --> 00:46:13,270
Hey, baby.

663
00:46:13,445 --> 00:46:16,471
You got girlfriend Vietnam?

664
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:19,276
Not just this minute.

665
00:46:19,451 --> 00:46:22,750
Well, baby, me so horny.

666
00:46:22,921 --> 00:46:25,082
Me so horny.

667
00:46:25,256 --> 00:46:27,816
Me love you long time.

668
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,588
You party?

669
00:46:29,761 --> 00:46:31,888
Yeah, we might party.

670
00:46:32,063 --> 00:46:34,861
-How much?
-Fifteen dollar.

671
00:46:35,033 --> 00:46:39,060
-Fifteen dollars for both of us.
-No. Each you $1 5.

672
00:46:39,237 --> 00:46:41,159
Me love you long time.

673
00:46:41,339 --> 00:46:43,967
Me so horny.

674
00:46:44,142 --> 00:46:46,440
Fifteen dollar too beaucoup.

675
00:46:46,611 --> 00:46:49,876
-Five dollars each.
-Me sucky-sucky.

676
00:46:50,048 --> 00:46:52,642
Me love you too much.

677
00:46:54,052 --> 00:46:57,351
Five dollars is all my mom
allows me to spend.

678
00:46:57,522 --> 00:47:00,446
Okay. Ten dollar each.

679
00:47:00,625 --> 00:47:03,116
What do we get for $1 0?

680
00:47:03,294 --> 00:47:06,092
Everything you want.

681
00:47:06,264 --> 00:47:09,427
-Everything?
-Everything.

682
00:47:10,468 --> 00:47:14,564
Well, old buddy, feel like spending
some of your hard-earned money?

683
00:47:14,739 --> 00:47:16,627
Just a minute.

684
00:47:16,975 --> 00:47:21,105
You know, half these gook whores
are serving officers in the Vietcong.

685
00:47:21,279 --> 00:47:23,042
The other half have got TB.

686
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:26,737
Be sure you only fuck
the ones that cough.

687
00:48:15,133 --> 00:48:18,398
That little sucker really had
some moves on him, didn't he?

688
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:20,231
Yeah.

689
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,634
You know what really pisses me off
about these people?

690
00:48:24,809 --> 00:48:26,140
What?

691
00:48:26,344 --> 00:48:30,166
We're supposed to be helping them, and
they shit all over us every chance they get.

692
00:48:30,348 --> 00:48:32,304
I just can't feature that.

693
00:48:32,484 --> 00:48:35,942
Don't take it too hard, Rafterman.
It's just business.

694
00:48:37,755 --> 00:48:41,111
I hate Da Nang, Joker.
I wanna go out into the field.

695
00:48:41,292 --> 00:48:43,248
I've been in country
almost three months...

696
00:48:43,428 --> 00:48:46,192
... and all I do is take handshake shots
at award ceremonies.

697
00:48:46,364 --> 00:48:49,390
You'd get wasted your first day in the field
and it'd be my fault.

698
00:48:49,567 --> 00:48:51,865
A high school girl could do my job.

699
00:48:52,036 --> 00:48:53,833
I wanna get out into the shit.

700
00:48:54,005 --> 00:48:56,599
I wanna get some trigger time.

701
00:48:57,509 --> 00:49:01,001
If you get killed, your mom will find me
after I rotate back to the world...

702
00:49:01,179 --> 00:49:02,942
... and she'll beat the shit out of me.

703
00:49:03,114 --> 00:49:05,605
That's a negative, Rafterman.

704
00:49:08,353 --> 00:49:12,312
Okay, guys. Let's keep it short and sweet
today. Anybody got anything new?

705
00:49:14,659 --> 00:49:18,322
There's a rumor going around that
the Tet ceasefire is gonna be canceled.

706
00:49:18,763 --> 00:49:20,253
Rear-echelon paranoia.

707
00:49:20,598 --> 00:49:24,728
A bro in intelligence says Charlie might try
to pull off something big during Tet.

708
00:49:24,903 --> 00:49:27,394
They say the same thing every year.

709
00:49:27,539 --> 00:49:29,336
There's a lot of talk about it, sir.

710
00:49:29,507 --> 00:49:31,304
I wouldn't lose any sleep over it.

711
00:49:31,476 --> 00:49:35,640
The Tet holiday is like the Fourth of July,
Christmas and New Year all rolled into one.

712
00:49:35,813 --> 00:49:39,169
Every zipperhead in Nam,
North and South, will be banging gongs...

713
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:42,205
... barking at the moon
and visiting his dead relatives.

714
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:45,976
Right. Ann-Margret
and entourage are due here next week.

715
00:49:46,157 --> 00:49:49,422
I want someone on the airfield
and stick with her for a couple of days.

716
00:49:49,594 --> 00:49:52,085
-Rafterman, you take it.
-Aye, aye, sir.

717
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:53,925
And get some good low-angle stuff.

718
00:49:54,098 --> 00:49:58,159
Don't make it too obvious,
but I wanna see fur and early-morning dew.

719
00:49:58,336 --> 00:50:00,600
-Yes, sir.
-""Diplomats in dungarees.

720
00:50:00,772 --> 00:50:04,469
Marine engineers lend a helping hand
rebuilding Dong Phuc village recently....""

721
00:50:04,642 --> 00:50:07,941
Chili, if we move Vietnamese,
they are evacuees...

722
00:50:08,112 --> 00:50:11,206
... if they come to us to be evacuated,
they are refugees.

723
00:50:11,382 --> 00:50:13,145
I'll make a note of it, sir.

724
00:50:13,818 --> 00:50:16,343
""NVA soldier deserts
after reading pamphlets.

725
00:50:16,521 --> 00:50:20,548
A young North Vietnamese Army regular,
who realized his side could not win...

726
00:50:20,725 --> 00:50:23,523
... deserted from his unit after reading
Open Arms pamphlets.""

727
00:50:23,695 --> 00:50:26,789
That's good, Dave. But why say
North Vietnamese Army regular?

728
00:50:26,965 --> 00:50:30,696
Is there an irregular?
How about North Vietnamese Army soldier?

729
00:50:30,868 --> 00:50:31,926
I'll fix it up, sir.

730
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:34,395
Lawrence Welk Show
is out on TV in two weeks.

731
00:50:34,572 --> 00:50:35,732
Dave, do 1 00 words on it.

732
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:38,432
-AFTV will give you some background stuff.
-Sir.

733
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:40,373
"" Not while we're eating.

734
00:50:40,545 --> 00:50:43,070
NVA learned Marines
on a search-and-destroy mission...

735
00:50:43,247 --> 00:50:45,579
... don't like to be interrupted
while eating chow.""

736
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:49,641
Search-and-destroy. We have a new
directive from MAF on this.

737
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:54,415
In future, in place of search-and-destroy,
substitute the phrase sweep-and-clear.

738
00:50:54,592 --> 00:50:57,891
-Sweep-and-clear, got it?
-Got it. Very catchy.

739
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:00,994
And, Joker, where's the weenie?

740
00:51:01,566 --> 00:51:03,124
Sir?

741
00:51:03,301 --> 00:51:07,226
The kill, Joker. The kill. I mean, all that fire,
the grunts must have hit something.

742
00:51:07,405 --> 00:51:08,667
Didn't see them.

743
00:51:09,707 --> 00:51:13,097
Joker, I've told you,
we run two basic stories here.

744
00:51:13,277 --> 00:51:16,735
Grunts who give half their pay to buy
gooks toothbrushes and deodorants.

745
00:51:16,914 --> 00:51:19,178
Winning of hearts and minds. Okay?

746
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:22,945
And combat action that results in a kill.
Winning the war.

747
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:26,818
Now, you must have seen blood trails.
Drag marks?

748
00:51:26,991 --> 00:51:28,652
It was raining, sir.

749
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,993
Well, that's why God passed
the law of probability.

750
00:51:32,163 --> 00:51:35,257
Now rewrite it and give it
a happy ending. Say, one killed.

751
00:51:35,433 --> 00:51:37,799
Make it a sapper or an officer. Which?

752
00:51:38,302 --> 00:51:39,633
Whichever you say.

753
00:51:39,804 --> 00:51:42,295
Grunts like reading about dead officers.

754
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:45,671
Okay, an officer. How about a general?

755
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:47,441
Joker...

756
00:51:47,612 --> 00:51:51,002
... maybe you'd like our guys
to read the paper and feel bad.

757
00:51:51,182 --> 00:51:54,310
I mean, in case you didn't know it,
this is not a very popular war.

758
00:51:54,485 --> 00:51:56,612
Now, it is our job to report the news...

759
00:51:56,788 --> 00:51:59,848
... that these why-are-we-here
civilian newsmen ignore.

760
00:52:00,625 --> 00:52:04,220
Sir, maybe you should go out
on some ops yourself.

761
00:52:04,395 --> 00:52:08,126
I'm sure you could find a lot more
blood trails and drag marks.

762
00:52:08,733 --> 00:52:10,724
Joker, I've had my ass in the grass.

763
00:52:10,902 --> 00:52:12,858
Can't say I liked it much.

764
00:52:13,037 --> 00:52:16,029
Lots of bugs and too dangerous.

765
00:52:16,207 --> 00:52:19,233
As it happens, my present duties
keep me where I belong...

766
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:21,605
... in the rear with the gear.

767
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:32,118
Tet. The year of the monkey.

768
00:52:32,290 --> 00:52:35,418
Vietnamese Lunar New Year's Eve.

769
00:52:35,593 --> 00:52:40,690
Down in Dogpatch, the gooks are
shooting off fireworks to celebrate.

770
00:52:49,407 --> 00:52:53,070
I am fucking bored to death, man.

771
00:52:53,678 --> 00:52:56,169
I gotta get back in the shit.

772
00:52:56,314 --> 00:52:59,408
I ain't heard a shot fired
in anger in weeks.

773
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:01,583
Joker's so tough...

774
00:53:01,819 --> 00:53:05,209
... he'd eat the boogers
out of a dead man's nose...

775
00:53:05,389 --> 00:53:07,277
... then ask for seconds.

776
00:53:07,792 --> 00:53:09,851
Listen up, pilgrim.

777
00:53:10,027 --> 00:53:14,521
A day without blood is
like a day without sunshine.

778
00:53:14,999 --> 00:53:16,296
Shit.

779
00:53:16,467 --> 00:53:20,358
Joker thinks the bad bush is between
an old mama-san's legs.

780
00:53:20,538 --> 00:53:22,460
He's never been in the shit.

781
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,370
It's hard to talk about it, man.
It's like on Hastings.

782
00:53:25,543 --> 00:53:28,068
You weren't on
Operation Hastings, Payback.

783
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:30,908
-You weren't even in country.
-Eat shit and die...

784
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:33,937
... you fucking Spanish-American.
You fucking pogue.

785
00:53:34,118 --> 00:53:35,517
I was there, man.

786
00:53:35,686 --> 00:53:37,415
I was in the shit with the grunts.

787
00:53:37,588 --> 00:53:41,376
Don't listen to
any of Payback's bullshit, Rafterman.

788
00:53:41,559 --> 00:53:44,949
Sometimes he thinks he's John Wayne.

789
00:53:45,663 --> 00:53:47,153
You listen to Joker, new guy.

790
00:53:47,298 --> 00:53:48,925
He knows ti ti.

791
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,624
Very little.

792
00:53:50,802 --> 00:53:53,600
You know he's never been in the shit.
He ain't got the stare.

793
00:53:53,771 --> 00:53:57,298
-The stare?
-The thousand-yard stare.

794
00:53:57,475 --> 00:54:00,467
A Marine gets it after he's been
in the shit for too long.

795
00:54:00,645 --> 00:54:02,169
It's like--

796
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:04,468
It's like you're really seeing beyond.

797
00:54:05,216 --> 00:54:06,444
I got it.

798
00:54:06,617 --> 00:54:08,448
All field Marines got it.

799
00:54:08,619 --> 00:54:10,109
And you'll have it too.

800
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:11,585
I will?

801
00:54:11,756 --> 00:54:13,314
Hey, Payback...

802
00:54:13,491 --> 00:54:16,585
... how do you stop five black dudes
from raping a white chick?

803
00:54:17,195 --> 00:54:20,084
-Fuck you, Stork.
-Throw them a basketball.

804
00:54:25,102 --> 00:54:27,195
-lncoming.
-Oh, shit.

805
00:54:28,873 --> 00:54:30,761
Them are outgoing.

806
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:34,940
-That ain't outgoing.
-That ain't outgoing.

807
00:54:35,112 --> 00:54:36,739
Now, what did I just say?

808
00:55:14,852 --> 00:55:18,083
Hey, I hope they're just fucking with us.

809
00:55:18,256 --> 00:55:21,521
-I ain't ready for this shit.
-Amen.

810
00:56:14,445 --> 00:56:16,333
Cease fire.

811
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:22,545
-Cease fire.
-Cease fire.

812
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:28,181
Cease fire.

813
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:41,161
The enemy...

814
00:56:41,339 --> 00:56:43,830
... has very deceitfully...

815
00:56:44,008 --> 00:56:46,863
... taken advantage
of the Tet ceasefire...

816
00:56:47,044 --> 00:56:50,377
... to launch an offensive
all over the country.

817
00:56:50,715 --> 00:56:54,378
So far, we 've had it pretty easy here.

818
00:56:54,552 --> 00:56:56,747
But we seem to be the exception.

819
00:56:57,488 --> 00:57:02,243
Charlie has hit every major military target
in Vietnam and hit them hard.

820
00:57:02,426 --> 00:57:08,285
In Saigon the United States Embassy
has been overrun by suicide squads.

821
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:10,388
-Shit.
-Jesus Christ, man.

822
00:57:10,568 --> 00:57:14,095
Khe Sanh is standing by to be overrun.

823
00:57:15,373 --> 00:57:17,933
We also have reports
that a division of NVA...

824
00:57:18,109 --> 00:57:23,035
... has occupied all of the city of Hue
south of the Perfume River.

825
00:57:23,214 --> 00:57:26,274
In strategic terms,
Charlie's cut the country in half...

826
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:29,214
... the civilian press
are about to wet their pants...

827
00:57:29,387 --> 00:57:34,313
... and we've heard even Cronkite's
gonna say the war is now unwinnable.

828
00:57:34,925 --> 00:57:36,654
In other words...

829
00:57:36,827 --> 00:57:41,651
... it's a huge shit sandwich
and we're all gonna have to take a bite.

830
00:57:44,535 --> 00:57:46,298
Sir.

831
00:57:46,604 --> 00:57:49,459
Does this mean that Ann-Margret's
not coming?

832
00:57:54,278 --> 00:57:58,635
Joker, I want you
to get straight up to Phu Bai.

833
00:57:59,116 --> 00:58:02,313
Captain January will need all his people.

834
00:58:02,486 --> 00:58:04,750
-Yes, sir.
-And, Joker...

835
00:58:04,922 --> 00:58:07,914
... you will take off that damn button.

836
00:58:08,092 --> 00:58:11,516
How's it gonna look if you get killed
wearing a peace symbol?

837
00:58:11,695 --> 00:58:13,185
Sir.

838
00:58:13,330 --> 00:58:15,525
Permission to go with Joker?

839
00:58:16,233 --> 00:58:18,189
-Permission granted.
-Thank you, sir.

840
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:21,293
Sir, permission not to take
Rafterman with me?

841
00:58:21,472 --> 00:58:23,565
You still here?

842
00:58:23,741 --> 00:58:27,370
Vanish, Joker, most ricky-tick,
and take Rafterman with you.

843
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:29,877
You're responsible for him.

844
00:59:05,716 --> 00:59:07,343
Get some.

845
00:59:08,185 --> 00:59:09,914
Get some.

846
00:59:12,523 --> 00:59:15,412
Get some. Get some. Yeah. Yeah.

847
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:20,158
Get some. Get some.
Come on. Come on.

848
00:59:24,201 --> 00:59:25,793
Get some.

849
00:59:33,310 --> 00:59:35,471
Get some, baby.

850
00:59:35,813 --> 00:59:38,202
Get some. Get some. Get some.

851
00:59:39,216 --> 00:59:41,844
Get some. Get some, come on.
Get it, come on.

852
00:59:42,019 --> 00:59:44,510
Get some. Get some. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

853
00:59:44,688 --> 00:59:46,883
I've got you, mother.

854
00:59:51,729 --> 00:59:54,857
Anyone who runs is a VC.

855
00:59:55,432 --> 00:59:57,957
Anyone who stands still...

856
00:59:58,135 --> 01:00:01,059
... is a well-disciplined VC.

857
01:00:03,007 --> 01:00:06,636
You guys ought to do a story
about me sometime.

858
01:00:07,811 --> 01:00:10,871
Why should we do a story about you?

859
01:00:11,248 --> 01:00:13,341
Because I'm so fucking good.

860
01:00:13,517 --> 01:00:15,644
That ain't no shit neither.

861
01:00:15,819 --> 01:00:20,279
I've done got me 1 57 dead gooks killed.

862
01:00:20,457 --> 01:00:23,221
And 50 water buffaloes too.

863
01:00:23,394 --> 01:00:26,192
Them are all certified.

864
01:00:26,363 --> 01:00:29,218
Any women or children?

865
01:00:29,733 --> 01:00:31,360
Sometimes.

866
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:36,200
How can you shoot women and children?

867
01:00:36,807 --> 01:00:38,104
Easy.

868
01:00:38,275 --> 01:00:40,664
You just don't lead them so much.

869
01:00:42,213 --> 01:00:44,169
Ain't war hell?

870
01:01:20,751 --> 01:01:22,878
Top, we wanna get in the shit.

871
01:01:23,053 --> 01:01:24,543
Down the road. Two-Five.

872
01:01:24,722 --> 01:01:27,486
Two-Five. Outstanding. Thanks, Top.

873
01:01:52,249 --> 01:01:53,876
Excuse me.

874
01:01:54,051 --> 01:01:55,416
Sir.

875
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:58,680
We're looking for 1 st Platoon,
Hotel Two-Five.

876
01:01:58,856 --> 01:02:00,289
I got a bro named Cowboy there.

877
01:02:00,457 --> 01:02:01,856
You people one-one?

878
01:02:02,026 --> 01:02:04,324
No, sir.
We're reporters from Stars and Stripes.

879
01:02:04,495 --> 01:02:06,326
-Stars and Stripes?
-Yes, sir.

880
01:02:06,497 --> 01:02:08,522
I'm Cowboy's platoon commander.

881
01:02:08,699 --> 01:02:11,497
Cowboy's just down the road
in the platoon area.

882
01:02:11,669 --> 01:02:15,332
-You mind if we tag along, sir?
-No problem. Welcome aboard.

883
01:02:15,506 --> 01:02:18,737
By the way, my name's Schinoski.
Walter J. Schinoski.

884
01:02:18,909 --> 01:02:21,139
My people call me Mr. Touchdown.

885
01:02:21,312 --> 01:02:22,802
I played ball for Notre Dame.

886
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:24,277
-Notre Dame?
-Yeah.

887
01:02:24,448 --> 01:02:27,144
-All right.
-You here to make Cowboy famous?

888
01:02:27,318 --> 01:02:28,910
Never happen, sir.

889
01:02:29,086 --> 01:02:33,352
Well, if you people came looking for a story,
this is your lucky day.

890
01:02:33,524 --> 01:02:36,687
We got Condition Red
and we're definitely expecting rain.

891
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:39,624
Outstanding, sir.
We taking care of business?

892
01:02:39,797 --> 01:02:41,287
Well, the NVA are dug in deep.

893
01:02:41,465 --> 01:02:43,990
Hotel Company's still working
this side of the river...

894
01:02:44,168 --> 01:02:46,363
... street by street and house by house.

895
01:02:46,537 --> 01:02:48,528
Charles definitely
got his shit together...

896
01:02:48,706 --> 01:02:50,970
... but we're still getting
some decent kills here.

897
01:02:51,141 --> 01:02:55,339
We heard some scuttlebutt, sir, about
the NVA executing a lot of gook civilians.

898
01:02:55,512 --> 01:02:56,945
That's affirmative.

899
01:02:57,114 --> 01:03:00,743
I saw some bodies about a half a klick
this side of Phu Cam Canal.

900
01:03:00,918 --> 01:03:03,079
Will you show me where, sir?

901
01:03:05,456 --> 01:03:07,014
Here's the canal.

902
01:03:30,013 --> 01:03:33,176
The dead have been covered with lime.

903
01:03:34,385 --> 01:03:37,240
The dead know only one thing:

904
01:03:37,921 --> 01:03:40,446
It is better to be alive.

905
01:03:46,764 --> 01:03:48,356
Excuse me?

906
01:03:48,532 --> 01:03:50,796
-Good morning, lieutenant.
-Morning.

907
01:03:50,968 --> 01:03:54,529
I make it 20.
Is that the official body count, sir?

908
01:03:54,705 --> 01:03:56,138
What outfit are you men with?

909
01:03:56,306 --> 01:03:58,433
Sir, we're reporters
from Stars and Stripes.

910
01:03:58,709 --> 01:04:00,233
-Oh, I see.
-I'm Sergeant Joker...

911
01:04:00,411 --> 01:04:02,709
... and this photographer is Rafterman.

912
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,474
I'm Lieutenant Cleves
and I'm from Hartford, Connecticut.

913
01:04:05,649 --> 01:04:08,573
-Have you got a body count, sir?
-We think it's 20.

914
01:04:08,752 --> 01:04:10,845
Do you know how it happened, sir?

915
01:04:11,221 --> 01:04:14,987
Well, it seems the NVA came in
with a list of gook names.

916
01:04:15,159 --> 01:04:19,721
Government officials, policemen,
ARVlN officers, school teachers.

917
01:04:19,897 --> 01:04:21,888
They went around
to their houses real polite...

918
01:04:22,065 --> 01:04:25,398
... and asked them to report
the next day for political reeducation.

919
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:28,167
Everybody who turned up got shot.

920
01:04:28,338 --> 01:04:29,965
Some they buried alive.

921
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:31,504
Ready.

922
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:34,543
Colonel.

923
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:38,775
Marine, what is that button
on your body armor?

924
01:04:38,949 --> 01:04:40,211
A peace symbol, sir.

925
01:04:40,384 --> 01:04:42,978
-Where did you get it?
-I don't remember, sir.

926
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:45,285
What is that written on your helmet?

927
01:04:45,456 --> 01:04:46,946
Born to kill, sir.

928
01:04:47,157 --> 01:04:50,115
You write born to kill on your helmet
and wear a peace button.

929
01:04:50,294 --> 01:04:52,626
What's that supposed to be,
some kind of sick joke?

930
01:04:52,796 --> 01:04:55,356
-No, sir.
-What is it supposed to mean?

931
01:04:55,532 --> 01:04:56,897
I don't know, sir.

932
01:04:57,067 --> 01:04:58,557
-You don't know much.
-No, sir.

933
01:04:58,702 --> 01:05:01,967
Get your head and your ass wired together
or I will take a shit on you.

934
01:05:02,139 --> 01:05:03,868
-Yes, sir.
-Now answer my question...

935
01:05:04,041 --> 01:05:06,407
... or you'll be standing tall
before the man.

936
01:05:06,577 --> 01:05:09,535
I was trying to suggest something
about the duality of man, sir.

937
01:05:09,713 --> 01:05:13,308
-The what?
-The duality of man. The Jungian thing, sir.

938
01:05:14,518 --> 01:05:16,748
-Whose side are you on, son?
-Our side, sir.

939
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:18,547
-You love your country?
-Yes, sir.

940
01:05:18,722 --> 01:05:20,314
How about getting with the program.

941
01:05:20,491 --> 01:05:22,914
Jump on the team and come on in
for the big win.

942
01:05:23,093 --> 01:05:24,117
Yes, sir.

943
01:05:24,294 --> 01:05:28,754
All I've asked of my Marines is for them to
obey my orders as they would God's word.

944
01:05:28,932 --> 01:05:30,661
We are here to help the Vietnamese...

945
01:05:30,834 --> 01:05:34,759
... because inside every gook
there is an American trying to get out.

946
01:05:34,938 --> 01:05:36,599
It's a hardball world, son.

947
01:05:36,773 --> 01:05:40,402
We've gotta try to keep our heads
until this peace craze blows over.

948
01:05:40,577 --> 01:05:41,601
Aye, aye, sir.

949
01:05:52,055 --> 01:05:55,786
Hey, bro. We're looking for 1 st Platoon,
Hotel Two-Five.

950
01:05:55,959 --> 01:05:57,756
Around the back.

951
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:09,464
-First Platoon?
-Yeah, through there.

952
01:06:33,163 --> 01:06:35,222
Hey, Lone Ranger.

953
01:06:39,269 --> 01:06:42,932
-Holy shit. It's the Joker.
-You old motherfucker.

954
01:06:48,011 --> 01:06:49,000
What's happening?

955
01:06:49,179 --> 01:06:53,001
Thought I hoped I'd never see you again,
you piece of shit.

956
01:06:53,517 --> 01:06:55,041
What's happening, man?

957
01:06:55,218 --> 01:06:58,608
Oh, just waiting to get back
to the land of the big PX.

958
01:06:58,789 --> 01:07:00,745
Yeah? Well, why go back?

959
01:07:00,924 --> 01:07:02,448
Here or there, samey-same.

960
01:07:02,626 --> 01:07:04,321
-Been getting any?
-Only your sister.

961
01:07:04,494 --> 01:07:08,590
Well, better my sister than my mom,
though my mom's not bad.

962
01:07:09,199 --> 01:07:11,793
Hey, you Hogs, listen up.

963
01:07:11,969 --> 01:07:15,132
This is my bro, Joker, from the lsland,
and this is...?

964
01:07:15,305 --> 01:07:17,261
-Rafterman.
-Rafterman.

965
01:07:17,441 --> 01:07:20,274
They're from Stars and Stripes.
They'll make you famous.

966
01:07:20,444 --> 01:07:21,741
-Fucking A.
-Yeah.

967
01:07:21,912 --> 01:07:23,834
We're the Lusthog Squad.

968
01:07:24,014 --> 01:07:26,574
We're life-takers and heartbreakers.

969
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:30,242
We shoot them full of holes
and fill them full of lead.

970
01:07:34,691 --> 01:07:37,387
You a photographer?

971
01:07:38,829 --> 01:07:41,389
No, I'm a combat correspondent.

972
01:07:42,399 --> 01:07:44,890
Oh, you seen much combat?

973
01:07:47,638 --> 01:07:50,004
Well, I've seen a little on TV.

974
01:07:54,344 --> 01:07:57,108
You're a real comedian.

975
01:07:58,382 --> 01:08:01,112
Well, they call me the Joker.

976
01:08:02,386 --> 01:08:04,877
Well, I got a joke for you.

977
01:08:05,022 --> 01:08:08,287
I'm gonna tear you a new asshole.

978
01:08:11,495 --> 01:08:13,360
Well, pilgrim...

979
01:08:13,530 --> 01:08:18,661
... only after you eat the peanuts
out of my shit.

980
01:08:24,074 --> 01:08:26,167
You talk the talk.

981
01:08:27,377 --> 01:08:30,210
Do you walk the walk?

982
01:08:34,618 --> 01:08:36,108
Now, you might not believe it...

983
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:41,548
... but under fire, Animal Mother's one of
the finest human beings in the world.

984
01:08:41,725 --> 01:08:45,855
All he needs is somebody to throw
hand grenades at him the rest of his life.

985
01:08:46,029 --> 01:08:50,193
That's a roger, come on.
Sit down. Come on, new guy.

986
01:08:52,936 --> 01:08:55,200
Hey, jungle-bunny.

987
01:08:55,372 --> 01:08:58,170
Thank God for the sickle cell, huh?

988
01:08:58,341 --> 01:09:00,172
Yeah, Mother.

989
01:09:01,445 --> 01:09:03,242
Hey, photographer.

990
01:09:04,648 --> 01:09:06,673
You wanna take a good picture?

991
01:09:07,951 --> 01:09:09,384
Here, man.

992
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:11,210
Take this.

993
01:09:20,063 --> 01:09:22,918
This is my bro.

994
01:09:32,509 --> 01:09:34,602
This is his party.

995
01:09:34,778 --> 01:09:36,939
He's the guest of honor.

996
01:09:37,881 --> 01:09:40,543
Today is his birthday.

997
01:09:41,151 --> 01:09:43,949
Happy birthday, zipperhead.

998
01:09:44,955 --> 01:09:47,344
I will never forget this day.

999
01:09:47,524 --> 01:09:52,814
The day I came to Hue City
and fought 1 million NVA gooks.

1000
01:09:53,296 --> 01:09:56,595
I love the little commie bastards, man,
I really do.

1001
01:09:57,067 --> 01:10:00,298
These enemy grunts are as hard
as slant-eyed drill instructors.

1002
01:10:02,272 --> 01:10:05,230
These are great days we're living, bros.

1003
01:10:06,376 --> 01:10:10,403
We are jolly green giants,
walking the earth with guns.

1004
01:10:11,148 --> 01:10:13,537
These people we wasted here today...

1005
01:10:13,717 --> 01:10:16,948
... are the finest human beings
we will ever know.

1006
01:10:18,755 --> 01:10:20,416
After we rotate back to the world...

1007
01:10:20,590 --> 01:10:23,889
... we're gonna miss not having
anyone around who's worth shooting.

1008
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:33,022
-Stay put, keep your heads down.
-Stay put.

1009
01:11:33,196 --> 01:11:34,823
Stay put.

1010
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:52,039
Shit.

1011
01:11:59,923 --> 01:12:03,415
Delta Six Actual, this is Murphy. Over.

1012
01:12:05,128 --> 01:12:08,791
Delta Six Actual, this is Murphy. Over.

1013
01:12:09,933 --> 01:12:11,298
Delta Six.

1014
01:12:11,468 --> 01:12:14,596
Delta Six, we are receiving incoming fire
from the vill.

1015
01:12:15,071 --> 01:12:16,663
The lieutenant is down.

1016
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:19,798
We're going to stop here
and check out what's in front of us. Over.

1017
01:12:25,448 --> 01:12:27,939
Okay, Lusthog Squad, listen up.

1018
01:12:28,618 --> 01:12:30,711
Gonna move up these roads
and check the vill.

1019
01:12:30,887 --> 01:12:33,253
I want the third team up this road here.

1020
01:12:33,423 --> 01:12:37,314
First and second fire team behind me
up this other road, okay?

1021
01:12:37,794 --> 01:12:40,649
Let's go. Let's get it done.

1022
01:17:07,275 --> 01:17:09,971
Is that you, John Wayne? Is this me?

1023
01:17:10,144 --> 01:17:13,307
Hey, start the cameras.
This is Vietnam: The Movie.

1024
01:17:13,481 --> 01:17:15,847
Yeah, Joker can be John Wayne,
I'll be a horse.

1025
01:17:16,017 --> 01:17:18,679
-T. H. E. Rock can be a rock.
-I'll be Ann-Margret.

1026
01:17:18,853 --> 01:17:20,775
Animal Mother can be a rabid buffalo.

1027
01:17:20,955 --> 01:17:23,446
-I'll be General Custer.
-Who'll be the lndian?

1028
01:17:23,625 --> 01:17:26,651
Hey, we'll let the gooks play the lndians.

1029
01:18:04,832 --> 01:18:06,823
You're going home now.

1030
01:18:10,838 --> 01:18:12,669
Semper fi.

1031
01:18:15,643 --> 01:18:18,237
We're mean Marines, sir.

1032
01:18:21,616 --> 01:18:23,743
Go easy, bros.

1033
01:18:27,889 --> 01:18:29,948
Better you than me.

1034
01:18:33,661 --> 01:18:36,323
Well, at least they died
for a good cause.

1035
01:18:37,131 --> 01:18:39,361
What cause was that?

1036
01:18:40,868 --> 01:18:42,426
Freedom.

1037
01:18:43,237 --> 01:18:46,161
Flush out your headgear, new guy.

1038
01:18:47,875 --> 01:18:50,730
You think we waste gooks for freedom?

1039
01:18:51,879 --> 01:18:54,074
This is a slaughter.

1040
01:18:55,316 --> 01:18:58,843
If I'm gonna get my balls
blown off for a word...

1041
01:18:59,921 --> 01:19:02,810
... my word is poon tang.

1042
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:08,290
Tough break for Hand Job.

1043
01:19:09,197 --> 01:19:12,655
He was all set
to get shipped out on a medical.

1044
01:19:14,202 --> 01:19:16,158
What was the matter with him?

1045
01:19:18,506 --> 01:19:21,703
He was jerking off 1 0 times a day.

1046
01:19:22,810 --> 01:19:26,405
It's no shit. At least 1 0 times a day.

1047
01:19:28,349 --> 01:19:33,673
Last week he was sent down to Da Nang
to see the Navy head shrinker.

1048
01:19:34,088 --> 01:19:38,149
The crazy fucker starts jerking off
in the waiting room.

1049
01:19:38,693 --> 01:19:41,253
Instant Section Eight.

1050
01:19:41,929 --> 01:19:45,353
He was just waiting
for his papers to clear Division.

1051
01:19:47,869 --> 01:19:50,724
You ready? Turn over.

1052
01:19:52,273 --> 01:19:54,571
Hue City interviews, roll 34.

1053
01:19:56,677 --> 01:20:00,670
Well, like-- Like you see, you know,
it's a major city...

1054
01:20:00,848 --> 01:20:04,375
... so we have to assault with tanks,
we roll in the streets.

1055
01:20:04,552 --> 01:20:06,941
So they send us in first to squat...

1056
01:20:07,121 --> 01:20:10,852
... make sure that there are no little....

1057
01:20:11,993 --> 01:20:15,224
No Vietnamese waiting with B-40 rockets
to blow the tanks away.

1058
01:20:15,396 --> 01:20:17,887
So we clear it out
and we roll the tanks in...

1059
01:20:18,065 --> 01:20:20,397
... and basically blow the place to hell.

1060
01:20:21,002 --> 01:20:24,597
When we're in Hue,
when we're in Hue City...

1061
01:20:24,772 --> 01:20:26,728
... it's like a war, you know...

1062
01:20:26,908 --> 01:20:28,796
... Like what-- What--

1063
01:20:28,976 --> 01:20:31,968
What I thought about a war,
what I thought a war was--

1064
01:20:32,146 --> 01:20:34,637
You know, was supposed to be.

1065
01:20:35,817 --> 01:20:38,012
There's the enemy, you kill them.

1066
01:20:38,619 --> 01:20:41,747
I don't think there's any question about it.
I mean, we're the best.

1067
01:20:41,923 --> 01:20:44,050
I mean, all that bullshit
about the Air Cav....

1068
01:20:44,225 --> 01:20:46,352
When the shit hits the fan,
who do they call?

1069
01:20:46,527 --> 01:20:49,860
They call Mother Green
and her killing machine.

1070
01:20:50,031 --> 01:20:53,023
Do I think America belongs in Vietnam?

1071
01:20:53,701 --> 01:20:57,626
I don't know.
I belong in Vietnam, I'll tell you that.

1072
01:20:57,805 --> 01:21:00,035
Can I quote LBJ?

1073
01:21:01,576 --> 01:21:05,068
""l will not send American boys...

1074
01:21:05,246 --> 01:21:07,510
...8 or 1 0,000 miles
around the world...

1075
01:21:07,682 --> 01:21:11,880
... to do a job that Asian boys
ought to be doing for themselves.""

1076
01:21:13,788 --> 01:21:18,111
Personally think they don't really
want to be involved in this war...

1077
01:21:18,292 --> 01:21:22,058
... you know, I mean, like they--
It's sort of like...

1078
01:21:22,597 --> 01:21:25,987
... they took away our freedom
and gave it to the gookers, you know.

1079
01:21:26,167 --> 01:21:27,725
But they don't want it.

1080
01:21:27,902 --> 01:21:30,325
They'd rather be alive than free, I guess,
you know.

1081
01:21:30,504 --> 01:21:32,495
Poor, dumb bastards.

1082
01:21:33,374 --> 01:21:38,107
Well, the ones I'm fighting at
are some pretty-- Pretty bad boys.

1083
01:21:38,279 --> 01:21:40,042
I'm not real....

1084
01:21:41,215 --> 01:21:44,048
I'm not real keen
on some of these fellas...

1085
01:21:44,218 --> 01:21:47,642
... that are supposedly on our side.

1086
01:21:47,822 --> 01:21:50,655
I keep meeting them
coming the other way.

1087
01:21:52,727 --> 01:21:53,751
Yeah.

1088
01:21:54,328 --> 01:21:56,523
I mean, we're getting killed
for these people...

1089
01:21:56,697 --> 01:21:58,858
... and they don't even appreciate it.

1090
01:21:59,533 --> 01:22:01,455
They think it's a big joke.

1091
01:22:02,103 --> 01:22:04,094
Well, if you ask me...

1092
01:22:04,572 --> 01:22:06,597
... we're shooting the wrong gooks.

1093
01:22:07,074 --> 01:22:10,601
Well, it depends on the situation.
I mean, I'm here to take combat photos.

1094
01:22:10,778 --> 01:22:14,339
But if the shit gets too thick,
I mean, I'll go to the rifle.

1095
01:22:15,349 --> 01:22:18,113
What do I think about
America's involvement in the war?

1096
01:22:18,286 --> 01:22:20,049
Well, I think we should win.

1097
01:22:20,688 --> 01:22:22,679
I hate Vietnam.

1098
01:22:22,857 --> 01:22:24,882
There's not one horse
in this whole country.

1099
01:22:25,059 --> 01:22:27,186
They don't have one horse in Vietnam.

1100
01:22:27,361 --> 01:22:29,955
There's something
basically wrong with that.

1101
01:22:31,365 --> 01:22:33,321
Well, if they'd send us
more guys, maybe...

1102
01:22:33,501 --> 01:22:37,528
... and bomb the hell out of the North,
they might give up.

1103
01:22:38,306 --> 01:22:43,835
I wanted to see exotic Vietnam,
the jewel of Southeast Asia.

1104
01:22:44,445 --> 01:22:48,802
I wanted to meet interesting and
stimulating people of an ancient culture...

1105
01:22:48,983 --> 01:22:50,280
... and kill them.

1106
01:22:50,718 --> 01:22:55,542
I wanted to be the first kid on my block
to get a confirmed kill.

1107
01:23:14,241 --> 01:23:16,402
Ten-hut.

1108
01:23:18,212 --> 01:23:19,736
-All right.
-My, oh, my.

1109
01:23:19,914 --> 01:23:22,803
-Good morning, little schoolgirl.
-Look at this lady.

1110
01:23:22,984 --> 01:23:25,077
I'm a little schoolboy too.

1111
01:23:25,453 --> 01:23:26,750
My, my, my.

1112
01:23:27,321 --> 01:23:30,620
-What you got there, chief?
-Do you want number one fucky?

1113
01:23:31,792 --> 01:23:34,625
Hey, any of you boys
want number one fucky?

1114
01:23:34,795 --> 01:23:37,184
I'm so horny,
I can't even get a piece of hand.

1115
01:23:37,365 --> 01:23:40,562
-Me want sucky.
-Sucky, fucky, smoke cigarette in her pussy.

1116
01:23:40,735 --> 01:23:43,295
She give you everything you want,
long time.

1117
01:23:43,504 --> 01:23:47,429
Everything you want.
Hey, how much there, chief?

1118
01:23:47,608 --> 01:23:49,872
-Fifteen dollars each.
-No.

1119
01:23:52,213 --> 01:23:54,875
Fifteen dollar beaucoup money.

1120
01:23:55,049 --> 01:23:56,311
Five dollar each.

1121
01:23:56,484 --> 01:23:58,281
Come on, she love you good.

1122
01:23:58,452 --> 01:23:59,976
Boom-boom long time.

1123
01:24:00,154 --> 01:24:01,849
-Ten dollars.
-Five dollars.

1124
01:24:02,023 --> 01:24:03,513
No. Ten dollars.

1125
01:24:03,657 --> 01:24:05,852
Be glad to trade you some ARVlN rifles.

1126
01:24:06,027 --> 01:24:08,860
Ain't never been fired
and only dropped once.

1127
01:24:09,764 --> 01:24:11,527
Okay, $5. You give me.

1128
01:24:11,699 --> 01:24:14,031
-Okay, okay.
-All right.

1129
01:24:15,302 --> 01:24:16,667
Let's get mounted.

1130
01:24:22,076 --> 01:24:23,634
Something wrong there, chief?

1131
01:24:23,811 --> 01:24:25,767
She says no boom-boom
with soul brother.

1132
01:24:25,946 --> 01:24:27,504
What the motherfuck?

1133
01:24:27,681 --> 01:24:30,206
She says soul brother too beaucoup,
too beaucoup.

1134
01:24:30,384 --> 01:24:31,715
What is this, man?

1135
01:24:31,886 --> 01:24:36,949
I think what he's trying to tell you
is you black boys pack too much meat.

1136
01:24:37,958 --> 01:24:40,654
Too beaucoup, too beaucoup.

1137
01:24:40,828 --> 01:24:42,489
Oh, shit.

1138
01:24:42,663 --> 01:24:46,360
This baby-san looks like she could
suck the chrome off a trailer hitch.

1139
01:24:46,534 --> 01:24:49,594
She say too beaucoup, too beaucoup.

1140
01:24:49,770 --> 01:24:51,692
Excuse me, ma'am.

1141
01:24:52,406 --> 01:24:54,397
What we have here, little yellow sister...

1142
01:24:54,575 --> 01:24:59,000
... is a magnificent specimen
of pure Alabama blacksnake.

1143
01:24:59,213 --> 01:25:01,773
But it ain't too goddamn beaucoup.

1144
01:25:02,817 --> 01:25:04,739
Okay, okay.

1145
01:25:05,453 --> 01:25:07,409
Okay, okay.

1146
01:25:08,756 --> 01:25:11,020
All right. Yeah. This is my boogie.

1147
01:25:11,192 --> 01:25:13,387
-Hey, we need a batting order.
-I'm going first.

1148
01:25:13,561 --> 01:25:16,951
Back off, white bread.
Don't get between a dog and his meat.

1149
01:25:17,131 --> 01:25:20,430
All fucking niggers must fucking hang.

1150
01:25:20,601 --> 01:25:23,729
-Hey, Animal, man.
-You son of a--

1151
01:25:23,904 --> 01:25:28,034
Hey, hey, I won't be long.
I'll skip the foreplay.

1152
01:25:28,209 --> 01:25:30,507
-I don't want it after you, man.
-Fuck you.

1153
01:26:03,711 --> 01:26:06,009
Intelligence passed the word down...

1154
01:26:06,180 --> 01:26:09,741
... that during the night
the NVA had pulled out of our area...

1155
01:26:09,917 --> 01:26:12,875
... to positions across the Perfume River.

1156
01:26:13,053 --> 01:26:17,444
Our squad is sent on patrol
to check out the report.

1157
01:26:48,923 --> 01:26:51,687
Face outboard and take cover. Do it.

1158
01:27:05,172 --> 01:27:06,696
Shit.

1159
01:27:15,282 --> 01:27:17,170
He ain't gonna make it.

1160
01:27:20,087 --> 01:27:21,714
Shit.

1161
01:27:28,229 --> 01:27:31,494
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy.

1162
01:27:32,933 --> 01:27:36,425
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy.

1163
01:27:37,304 --> 01:27:38,794
Hotel One. Over.

1164
01:27:38,973 --> 01:27:40,998
Murph, this is Cowboy.

1165
01:27:41,175 --> 01:27:44,508
Crazy's hit. Booby trap.

1166
01:27:45,713 --> 01:27:47,408
Wait, One.

1167
01:27:48,582 --> 01:27:53,042
Okay. You're senior NCO, Cowboy.
You're in charge.

1168
01:27:53,354 --> 01:27:54,946
-Continue with the patrol...
-Shit.

1169
01:27:55,122 --> 01:27:57,420
-... and call in at the next checkpoint.
-Shit.

1170
01:27:57,591 --> 01:28:00,321
Roger. Out.

1171
01:28:06,734 --> 01:28:08,599
I ' m squad leader.

1172
01:28:11,605 --> 01:28:13,994
Follow you anywhere, scumbag.

1173
01:28:15,109 --> 01:28:16,667
All right.

1174
01:28:17,478 --> 01:28:19,036
He's dead.

1175
01:29:00,154 --> 01:29:01,678
Cowboy.

1176
01:29:08,495 --> 01:29:09,757
What's up?

1177
01:29:10,030 --> 01:29:13,261
I think we made a mistake
at the last checkpoint.

1178
01:29:13,434 --> 01:29:15,823
Here, see what you think.

1179
01:29:17,938 --> 01:29:20,964
I think we're here...

1180
01:29:21,508 --> 01:29:24,432
... and we should be here.

1181
01:29:26,046 --> 01:29:28,173
-We're here?
-Yeah.

1182
01:29:28,349 --> 01:29:31,614
-We should be here?
-Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

1183
01:29:37,758 --> 01:29:39,487
Fuck.

1184
01:29:44,832 --> 01:29:46,459
What do you think?

1185
01:29:48,102 --> 01:29:50,866
Well, I think we should change direction.

1186
01:30:04,818 --> 01:30:06,376
Okay.

1187
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:09,045
We'll change direction.

1188
01:30:19,700 --> 01:30:21,258
What's up?

1189
01:30:21,435 --> 01:30:23,357
Changing direction.

1190
01:30:24,071 --> 01:30:25,299
What are we, lost?

1191
01:30:25,472 --> 01:30:28,566
Joker, shut the fuck up.

1192
01:30:28,876 --> 01:30:31,003
Okay, listen up.

1193
01:30:31,178 --> 01:30:33,271
-Can you hear me?
-Yeah.

1194
01:30:33,447 --> 01:30:35,278
Okay, we're changing direction.

1195
01:30:35,449 --> 01:30:37,178
We're heading over that way.

1196
01:30:37,351 --> 01:30:40,548
Eightball's gonna go over there
and see can he find a way through.

1197
01:30:41,054 --> 01:30:43,443
-Got it?
-Got it.

1198
01:30:44,158 --> 01:30:47,150
Eightball, let's dance.

1199
01:30:47,728 --> 01:30:50,026
Put a nigger behind the trigger.

1200
01:31:51,124 --> 01:31:52,648
Fuck.

1201
01:32:08,375 --> 01:32:09,774
Cease fire.

1202
01:32:09,943 --> 01:32:11,831
Cease fire, goddamn it.

1203
01:32:12,012 --> 01:32:14,537
Cool it, goddamn it. Cool it. Cease fire.

1204
01:32:14,715 --> 01:32:16,239
-Hold it.
-Cease fire.

1205
01:32:16,416 --> 01:32:17,644
-Cease fire.
-Cease fire.

1206
01:32:17,818 --> 01:32:21,345
Okay, listen up. Did anybody see a sniper?
Did anybody see anything?

1207
01:32:21,522 --> 01:32:23,183
Anybody see a sniper?

1208
01:32:23,357 --> 01:32:24,847
-Nothing.
-Negative.

1209
01:32:25,025 --> 01:32:28,916
Okay, then save your ammo.
Nobody fire till I tell you.

1210
01:32:29,863 --> 01:32:31,023
Eightball.

1211
01:32:31,198 --> 01:32:33,792
No, no. Cease fire. Cease fire.

1212
01:32:33,967 --> 01:32:35,662
Animal, cease fire.

1213
01:32:35,836 --> 01:32:37,963
Cowboy, it's Sergeant Murphy.

1214
01:32:38,138 --> 01:32:39,628
This is Cowboy. Over.

1215
01:32:39,773 --> 01:32:43,231
This is Murphy.
What is your present position? Over.

1216
01:32:43,410 --> 01:32:45,708
Murph, we're receiving enemy sniper fire.

1217
01:32:45,879 --> 01:32:47,141
Eightball is down.

1218
01:32:47,314 --> 01:32:50,203
Our position is about half a klick
north of Checkpoint Four.

1219
01:32:50,384 --> 01:32:54,081
Believe possible strong enemy forces
occupying buildings in front of us.

1220
01:32:54,254 --> 01:32:57,746
Request immediate tank support. Over.

1221
01:32:58,258 --> 01:32:59,657
Roger. Understand.

1222
01:32:59,826 --> 01:33:02,317
I'll see what I can do. Over.

1223
01:33:02,496 --> 01:33:04,862
Roger. Over and out.

1224
01:33:05,032 --> 01:33:07,330
-Stay close.
-Got it.

1225
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:11,995
Okay, listen up.
I think we're being set up for an ambush.

1226
01:33:12,172 --> 01:33:15,733
I think there may be strong enemy forces
in those buildings over there.

1227
01:33:15,909 --> 01:33:17,774
I've requested tank support.

1228
01:33:17,945 --> 01:33:21,210
We're gonna sit tight till it comes,
but keep your eyes open.

1229
01:33:21,381 --> 01:33:25,408
If they decide to hit us,
we'll have to pull back fast.

1230
01:33:26,453 --> 01:33:29,183
Goddamn it. Halt.
Cease your fire, Mother.

1231
01:33:29,356 --> 01:33:31,244
-Cease your fucking fire.
-Cowboy.

1232
01:33:31,425 --> 01:33:33,188
-What?
-We can't leave him out there.

1233
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:36,124
We're not leaving him,
we'll get him when the tank comes up.

1234
01:33:36,296 --> 01:33:38,958
He's hit three fucking times.
He can't wait that long.

1235
01:33:39,132 --> 01:33:41,157
I seen this before.

1236
01:33:41,335 --> 01:33:44,566
That sniper's just trying to suck us in,
one at a time.

1237
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:49,603
Goddamn it. No.

1238
01:33:49,776 --> 01:33:52,700
-Goddamn it, cease fire. Cease fire.
-Man, fuck this--

1239
01:33:52,879 --> 01:33:54,972
Fuck this shit.
I'm going in to bring him out.

1240
01:33:55,148 --> 01:33:58,709
-No, you sit the fuck down, goddamn it.
-Cover me.

1241
01:34:14,635 --> 01:34:19,129
Cease fire, he's there.
Cease fire, he's there.

1242
01:34:19,306 --> 01:34:21,570
Cease fire.

1243
01:34:32,953 --> 01:34:34,250
Hold your fire.

1244
01:34:34,421 --> 01:34:36,446
Hold your fire.

1245
01:34:36,623 --> 01:34:39,114
Cease fire, you can't see the sniper.

1246
01:34:39,292 --> 01:34:43,649
Save the ammo.
Nobody fire till I tell you. Nobody.

1247
01:34:49,102 --> 01:34:50,899
Hold your fire.

1248
01:34:51,605 --> 01:34:54,096
What the fuck do we do now, Cowboy?

1249
01:34:55,342 --> 01:34:57,333
Give me that fucking radio.

1250
01:35:01,548 --> 01:35:04,142
Murph? This is Cowboy. Over.

1251
01:35:04,317 --> 01:35:05,807
This is Murphy. Over.

1252
01:35:05,952 --> 01:35:08,318
Murph, we're in some deep shit.
I got two men down.

1253
01:35:08,522 --> 01:35:11,411
What's the story
on that fucking tank? Over.

1254
01:35:12,492 --> 01:35:15,950
Sorry, Cowboy.
No luck so far with the tank.

1255
01:35:16,129 --> 01:35:18,393
Will advise. Over.

1256
01:35:19,399 --> 01:35:21,355
Roger. Out.

1257
01:35:21,768 --> 01:35:24,066
Numb-nut bastards.

1258
01:35:24,237 --> 01:35:27,331
-Okay, listen up.
-Listen up.

1259
01:35:28,208 --> 01:35:30,267
Can't afford to wait for the tank.

1260
01:35:30,444 --> 01:35:32,366
I think they're gonna hit us any minute.

1261
01:35:32,546 --> 01:35:34,741
When they do,
we won't have time to pull out.

1262
01:35:34,915 --> 01:35:37,873
We gotta do it now.
Let's get ready to move.

1263
01:35:38,051 --> 01:35:40,315
-Ready to pull out.
-Wait a minute. Hold it.

1264
01:35:40,721 --> 01:35:44,509
Hold it, nobody's pulling out.
There's only one sniper there.

1265
01:35:44,691 --> 01:35:45,953
Back off, Mother.

1266
01:35:46,126 --> 01:35:49,084
I'm calling the plays.
I say we're pulling out.

1267
01:35:49,262 --> 01:35:51,059
Well, what about Doc Jay and Eightball?

1268
01:35:51,231 --> 01:35:55,019
I know it's a shitty thing to do,
but we can't refuse to accept the situation.

1269
01:35:55,202 --> 01:35:57,466
We're not leaving
Doc Jay and Eightball out there.

1270
01:35:57,637 --> 01:35:59,468
Doc Jay and Eightball are wasted.

1271
01:35:59,639 --> 01:36:02,369
-You know that.
-Bullshit. Come on, you guys.

1272
01:36:02,542 --> 01:36:05,033
We gotta bring them back.
Let's get them, let's do it.

1273
01:36:05,178 --> 01:36:07,544
Stand down, Mother.
That's a direct order.

1274
01:36:11,752 --> 01:36:15,882
Fuck you, Cowboy.
Fuck all you assholes.

1275
01:36:17,991 --> 01:36:21,017
-Goddamn it.
-Fucking son of a bitch.

1276
01:36:21,194 --> 01:36:23,890
You motherfucker.

1277
01:36:39,546 --> 01:36:42,276
Doc. Doc. Doc.

1278
01:36:44,117 --> 01:36:46,039
Where's the sniper?

1279
01:36:49,022 --> 01:36:52,185
Doc, where's the sniper?

1280
01:37:00,901 --> 01:37:02,630
Shit.

1281
01:37:04,237 --> 01:37:06,762
Shit. Fuck.

1282
01:37:21,087 --> 01:37:22,679
Fuck.

1283
01:37:54,354 --> 01:37:56,481
Hey, Cowboy.

1284
01:37:56,823 --> 01:37:58,586
Yeah?

1285
01:37:59,459 --> 01:38:02,951
Doc Jay and Eightball are wasted.

1286
01:38:03,563 --> 01:38:07,055
There's only one sniper, nothing else.

1287
01:38:07,434 --> 01:38:11,291
Move up the squad,
you're clear up to here.

1288
01:38:12,138 --> 01:38:13,628
Come on.

1289
01:38:16,243 --> 01:38:18,438
Son of a bitch.

1290
01:38:22,215 --> 01:38:24,775
-Okay, listen up.
-Listen up.

1291
01:38:25,819 --> 01:38:30,051
No-Doze, Stutten, Donlon, Rock,
you come with me, we'll take a look.

1292
01:38:30,490 --> 01:38:32,879
The rest of you all stay put
and cover our ass.

1293
01:38:33,059 --> 01:38:35,857
We may be coming back in a big hurry.

1294
01:38:36,730 --> 01:38:39,062
-I'm going with you.
-I'm coming too.

1295
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:41,063
Okay.

1296
01:38:41,234 --> 01:38:42,895
-You all set?
-Yeah.

1297
01:38:43,069 --> 01:38:44,093
Let's move out.

1298
01:38:44,471 --> 01:38:45,529
Let's do it.

1299
01:39:23,743 --> 01:39:25,074
Hey, Cowboy.

1300
01:39:25,245 --> 01:39:27,736
Top of the black building,
around the corner.

1301
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:50,196
Donlon, give me that radio.

1302
01:39:52,739 --> 01:39:54,468
Murphy, this is Cowboy. Over.

1303
01:40:04,985 --> 01:40:07,374
-Cowboy.
-Holy shit. That sniper's got a clean shot.

1304
01:40:07,554 --> 01:40:09,442
Get him the fuck out of here.

1305
01:40:16,162 --> 01:40:18,858
-I ain't got a first aid.
-I don't believe this shit.

1306
01:40:19,032 --> 01:40:21,159
-Give me your hand.
-Shut up.

1307
01:40:21,334 --> 01:40:22,926
-Take it easy, Cowboy.
-Don't move.

1308
01:40:23,103 --> 01:40:24,400
-Shit.
-That son of a bitch.

1309
01:40:24,571 --> 01:40:26,436
-You'll be all right.
-You're going home.

1310
01:40:26,606 --> 01:40:29,439
-Shut up.
-Don't shit me.

1311
01:40:29,609 --> 01:40:33,238
You know I'm not gonna shit you, man.
You're my favorite turd.

1312
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:35,074
Come on. Easy.

1313
01:40:35,482 --> 01:40:36,608
Here you go.

1314
01:40:38,318 --> 01:40:42,209
-Cowboy.
-Hang on, man. Hang on.

1315
01:40:46,059 --> 01:40:49,085
I can hack it. I can hack it.

1316
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:58,592
-I can hack it.
-You can hack it, man.

1317
01:41:54,661 --> 01:41:57,221
Let's go get some payback.

1318
01:42:03,136 --> 01:42:04,728
Okay.

1319
01:42:10,877 --> 01:42:12,606
Okay.

1320
01:42:20,053 --> 01:42:22,146
Watch that fucking hole.

1321
01:42:23,423 --> 01:42:24,651
Throw some smoke.

1322
01:42:41,174 --> 01:42:42,971
Okay, ready?

1323
01:43:23,983 --> 01:43:27,714
Donlon, Rock, that way.
You two, with me.

1324
01:43:32,792 --> 01:43:35,454
Joker, in there. New guy.

1325
01:45:39,452 --> 01:45:42,376
We got the sniper.

1326
01:46:16,089 --> 01:46:17,613
Joker?

1327
01:46:18,157 --> 01:46:19,647
Yo.

1328
01:46:19,992 --> 01:46:21,550
What's up?

1329
01:46:23,029 --> 01:46:25,190
We got the sniper.

1330
01:46:37,744 --> 01:46:39,700
I saved Joker's ass.

1331
01:46:39,879 --> 01:46:41,676
I got the sniper.

1332
01:46:41,848 --> 01:46:44,510
I fucking blew her away.

1333
01:46:45,351 --> 01:46:47,307
Am I bad?

1334
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:51,913
Am I a life-taker? Am I a heartbreaker?

1335
01:47:09,475 --> 01:47:11,636
What's she saying?

1336
01:47:15,281 --> 01:47:17,112
She's praying.

1337
01:47:20,987 --> 01:47:24,286
No more boom-boom for this baby-san.

1338
01:47:27,193 --> 01:47:29,616
There's nothing we can do for her.

1339
01:47:31,197 --> 01:47:33,290
She's dead meat.

1340
01:47:37,770 --> 01:47:39,203
Okay.

1341
01:47:40,506 --> 01:47:42,667
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1342
01:47:47,180 --> 01:47:49,045
What about her?

1343
01:47:52,819 --> 01:47:54,480
Fuck her.

1344
01:47:55,822 --> 01:47:57,517
Let her rot.

1345
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:16,172
We can't just leave her here.

1346
01:48:19,378 --> 01:48:21,266
Hey, asshole.

1347
01:48:21,747 --> 01:48:23,977
Cowboy's wasted.

1348
01:48:24,450 --> 01:48:27,010
You're fresh out of friends.

1349
01:48:28,120 --> 01:48:29,951
I'm running this squad now...

1350
01:48:30,122 --> 01:48:34,388
... and I say we leave the gook
for the mother-loving rats.

1351
01:48:38,231 --> 01:48:41,291
I'm not trying to run this squad.

1352
01:48:43,135 --> 01:48:47,094
I'm just saying
we can't leave her like this.

1353
01:48:56,616 --> 01:48:59,574
Shoot me.

1354
01:49:01,521 --> 01:49:03,546
Shoot...

1355
01:49:04,056 --> 01:49:05,648
... me.

1356
01:49:06,225 --> 01:49:08,318
Shoot...

1357
01:49:08,828 --> 01:49:10,420
... me.

1358
01:49:10,897 --> 01:49:12,888
Shoot.

1359
01:49:14,567 --> 01:49:16,262
Shoot.

1360
01:49:17,470 --> 01:49:20,769
If you wanna waste her, go on...

1361
01:49:22,642 --> 01:49:24,735
... waste her.

1362
01:49:24,911 --> 01:49:26,538
Shoot...

1363
01:49:28,714 --> 01:49:30,147
... me.

1364
01:49:34,253 --> 01:49:37,017
Shoot me.

1365
01:49:38,958 --> 01:49:40,186
Shoot...

1366
01:49:41,460 --> 01:49:43,189
... me.

1367
01:49:43,563 --> 01:49:45,656
Shoot...

1368
01:49:46,365 --> 01:49:47,798
... me.

1369
01:49:48,401 --> 01:49:50,596
Shoot.

1370
01:49:52,238 --> 01:49:54,263
Shoot.

1371
01:49:57,910 --> 01:49:59,434
Shoot.

1372
01:50:00,446 --> 01:50:02,038
Shoot.

1373
01:50:39,352 --> 01:50:41,183
Joker...

1374
01:50:41,354 --> 01:50:46,109
... we're gonna have to put you up
for the Congressional Medal of Ugly.

1375
01:50:49,895 --> 01:50:52,022
Hard-core, man.

1376
01:50:54,033 --> 01:50:56,558
Fucking hard-core.

1377
01:51:13,552 --> 01:51:18,615
We have nailed our names
in the pages of history enough for today.

1378
01:51:19,225 --> 01:51:23,889
We hump down to the Perfume River
to set in for the night.

1379
01:52:02,435 --> 01:52:06,633
My thoughts drift back
to erect-nipple wet dreams...

1380
01:52:06,806 --> 01:52:12,938
... about Mary Jane Rottencrotch
and the great homecoming-fuck fantasy.

1381
01:52:13,579 --> 01:52:16,275
I am so happy that I am alive...

1382
01:52:16,449 --> 01:52:19,976
... in one piece and short.

1383
01:52:20,653 --> 01:52:23,952
I am in a world of shit, yes...

1384
01:52:24,123 --> 01:52:26,079
... but I am alive.

1385
01:52:26,492 --> 01:52:28,483
And I am not afraid.
