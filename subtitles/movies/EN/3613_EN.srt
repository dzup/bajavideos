1
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,313
Honey, I need to piss.
Can you help me?

2
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,953
I can't carry heavy objects.

3
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,918
Shit!

4
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,479
Friends of yours?

5
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,955
You're right, yeah...

6
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,108
May I get in?

7
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,879
I warn you,
if you don't leave your cock. .

8
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,868
. . you'll get your knuckles rapped.
Don't worry, it's too cold.

9
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,069
Where are we going?

10
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,953
I don't know.
But I'm going towards the sun.

11
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,549
Straight on until
my CDs get finished.

12
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,749
I come from there.

13
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,793
And I'm going down there.

14
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,794
Is there a problem?

15
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,992
Where are you from? 80s?

16
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,589
Tell me. .

17
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,028
. . your story.

18
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,800
I love other people's problems,
it's dope to me.

19
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,955
- Oh yeah?
- Hmm...

20
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,272
- Me, is when a guy my age
loses his hair.

21
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,559
Bah, damn!

22
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,875
You know the story of the masochist. .

23
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,638
. . the sodomite, the sadist. .

24
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,479
. . the murderer, the necrophiliac
and the arsonist?

25
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,430
No.

26
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,950
- In a mental asylum,
a masochist, a sodomite. .

27
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,994
... a sadist, a murderer, a necrophiliac
and an arsonist are bored.

28
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,030
What?

29
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,798
They are bored.

30
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,430
The sodomite said:
And "if we fucked the cat?"

31
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:41,158
Then the sadist replies:"Oh yeah.
let's rape and torture the cat. "

32
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,998
The assassin adds:

33
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,079
"Cool! Let's rape, torture
and kill the cat. "

34
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,511
Then the necrophiliac says, "Oh yeah...

35
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,669
"We'll rape, torture and kill the cat,
and then rape her again. "

36
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,156
Then the arsonist said: "Cool!

37
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,989
- Let's rape, torture and kill,
rape again and burn the cat. "

38
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,112
Silence. They all look at
the masochist and ask him:

39
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,709
Hey, and you? You say nothing?

40
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,514
Masochist answers: "Miaow. "

41
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,589
- Yeah, not bad.
I knew it with a caribou.

42
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,398
6 hours of bullshit.

43
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,913
I don't want to bother. .

44
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,396
. . but my dick wants
the butt of a girl.

45
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,239
I don't like to let him wait.

46
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,950
I'm Bazooka Joe.

47
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,869
And those two, it's John Grizzly
and Jordan Minnesota.

48
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,437
May we join you?

49
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,196
Wanna dance, sweetie?

50
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,193
- Your breath
would curdle the yogurt, honey.

51
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,312
And besides, I don't like the music.

52
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,714
Don't worry.
I just want to feel your ass.

53
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,989
Get lost!

54
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,148
I'm gonna kiss you.

55
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,236
Try, asshole!

56
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,711
Let me go, shit sack!

57
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,114
Asshole!

58
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,670
Let me go!

59
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,869
I prefer him.

60
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,275
He has a smaller asshole.

61
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,032
Yeah!

62
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,152
- I'll fuck him in the ass
in the mouth. .

63
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,588
. . and under the arms.

64
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,835
You'll crash!

65
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,916
Go!

66
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,799
No mess at my place.

67
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,439
Get the fuck out!

68
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,759
Otherwise... ?

69
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,988
Otherwise, I'll paint my lino
with the juice of your balls.

70
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,188
Funny, right?

71
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,473
Let's go, guys.

72
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,716
You're OK?

73
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,388
Go ahead. I'll make you collapse.

74
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,796
Damn!

75
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,797
Shit, I'm in my underwear!

76
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,349
Come on...

77
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,316
Jump!

78
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,197
Are you lost or what?

79
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,069
Damn!

80
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,788
Shit!

81
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,759
Have you seen a guy in the bathroom?
What?

82
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,714
- A guy with long hair,
in the toilet?

83
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,830
No.

84
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,233
Sure you haven't seen him?

85
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,190
I didn't see anybody.

86
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,517
You're here?

87
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,272
Are you there?

88
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,030
Jean Jean!

89
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,990
- For once I find someone
who isn't too dumb...

90
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,995
Hey you!

91
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,679
John John?

92
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,996
He isn't really gone, is he!

93
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,749
- You wouldn't be the first
a guy abandons.

94
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,317
- I saw your very nice
photo wall in the toilet.

95
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,112
What's that door for?

96
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,356
Oh! It's been locked for years.

97
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,755
- It's not to open?
- No chance.

98
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,749
It's closed!

99
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,079
Damn!

100
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,118
Is Jean Jean there?

101
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,116
No.

102
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,039
- We had an appointment.
It's "La Spack" here, right?

103
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,390
Yes.
But now "La Spack" is closed.

104
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,830
She' cleaning. Get lost!

105
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,359
Please!

106
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,117
- You're cleaning for a reason.
- Not your business!

107
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,198
Oh, what a jewel...

108
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,910
Is there a problem, Miss?

109
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,395
Can I help you?

110
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,511
At first glance, not much.

111
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,312
You're the sheriff?

112
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,192
Yes. Well, not really.

113
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,476
Now I'm retired.

114
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,911
But if you want a guide,
you are right.

115
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,394
Cool.

116
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,239
Call me Chinaski,
like everyone else.

117
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,749
So what happens?

118
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,951
Well, I lost a friend. Finally...

119
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,470
I haven't really lost him.
He's not really a friend.

120
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,796
He went to the toilet. .

121
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,718
. . and puff, he disappeared.

122
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,036
You have a relationship?

123
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,390
No.
I just gave him a lift.

124
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,033
It's not so clever. .

125
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,118
. . for a girl
to take hitchhikers.

126
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,436
People are nasty nowadays.

127
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,313
They rape everything that moves.
Large, small. .

128
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,239
. . elderly, children,
skinny ones, tall ones...

129
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,316
Fat ones?

130
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,317
Yeah. The fat ones too, yeah...

131
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,193
They rape even corpses
hanging from the ceiling.

132
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,392
The range of possibilities is vast,
miss.

133
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,318
I know, yeah...

134
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,398
Is the... is he an adult?

135
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,352
Of course he's adult.

136
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,075
Well, I can't do anything for you.

137
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,474
I'm surprised.

138
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,591
When an adult disappears. .

139
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,233
. . you can't do anything.

140
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,953
<i>That Is The Law!</i>

141
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,991
Great laws we have.

142
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,395
And if his corps reappears
on the surface of a channel?

143
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,910
- You over-react.
Give me your name and phone.

144
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,793
- Charlotte Massot. MAS...
- Wait, wait.

145
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,189
MASSOT Charlotte.

146
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,276
Charlotte...

147
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,879
Char-lot-te.

148
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,035
Phone?

149
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,835
06-1 4-81-1000.

150
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,069
1000...

151
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,279
OK.

152
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,279
Goodbye, miss.

153
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,391
Oh la la, what a jewel!

154
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,348
Shit!

155
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:38,753
- I can spot small cuties
like her from miles away.

156
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,509
Here. You take my place
in the shed with the rest.

157
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,752
So, my little darling?

158
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,599
Too bad you came back!

159
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,119
That's my boy?

160
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,799
Huh?

161
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,391
Do you like my boy, huh?

162
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,510
Hmm... ?

163
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,639
Here.

164
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,273
John Wayne, John Wayne...

165
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,799
- You should eat
my little heart.

166
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,592
It's not appetizing. .

167
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,119
. . but it's rich on iron.

168
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,115
Here...

169
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,278
. . you'll need it.

170
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,277
A good yum yum!

171
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,470
He wasn't well prepared,
that one!

172
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,678
OK then?

173
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,678
Go...

174
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,956
Well, anyway!

175
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,029
Go...

176
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,391
"John Wayne"

177
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,679
Hey, you!

178
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,389
Ho!

179
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,672
Hey, you! Untie me!

180
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,758
John Wayne will not!
Idiot, untie me!

181
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,029
Look!

182
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,429
Come on!

183
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,153
Hurry!

184
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,152
Shit!

185
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,437
Hey, John Wayne,
let's see what you can do.

186
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,393
John Wayne! John Wayne!

187
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,397
C'mon...

188
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,755
Go!

189
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,519
Yes... Yes!

190
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,994
Go ahead. Shoot!

191
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,475
Shhh.

192
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,035
You take care of the stuff...

193
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,389
Shit!

194
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,869
Go ahead.

195
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,151
- I practiced catching
in my younger years.

196
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,318
You must be pretty
good to beat me.

197
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,794
Move!

198
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,433
Hello?

199
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,596
Hello...

200
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,831
- You won't make this blow twice.
Tomorrow's your time for the chair.

201
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,437
John Wayne, John Wayne...

202
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,238
- Is there a problem
with the toilet?

203
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,236
Yeah.

204
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,318
There was a brawl
with a couple of bikers.

205
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,318
- So if we want to...
Go outside?

206
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,590
Well, yeah. No choice.

207
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,276
Yeah...

208
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,157
Until tomorrow, John John.
I fucked your score.

209
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,394
Uh...

210
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:35,912
I talked with a Miss
Charlotte Massot.

211
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,714
She reported
the disappearance of a friend.

212
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,875
Really?

213
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,950
Yes. She came from your place.

214
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,036
When?

215
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,915
Last Saturday.

216
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,315
In the weekend
my mother is here.

217
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,555
Ah...

218
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,115
You must ask her self.

219
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,072
- Is she here?
- No.

220
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,956
She takes care of the farm.

221
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,755
He doesn't look very well.

222
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,191
There was a cop in the bar.

223
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,750
He asked lots of questions.

224
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,118
Who cares of this old fart!

225
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,469
Go and take care of the new ones.

226
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,473
They won't be long now.

227
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,749
I like the little girl.

228
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,110
She's nice.

229
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:44,073
It's really petty for her.

230
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,709
I'm talking to you!

231
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,110
- She hasn't always been like that,
you know.

232
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:05,199
When my brothers died,
she became crazy.

233
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:09,674
The authorities preferred
to let them die in the mine. .

234
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,599
. . rather than risk
a gas blast.

235
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,271
We can't do anything against them.

236
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,352
The village people
talked about creatures. .

237
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,358
. . born of the mud and blood of the dead.

238
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:38,632
Miners were killed underground.

239
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,992
We laughed a lot about that,
I can tell you.

240
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:47,589
It's really weird
whom they chose, you know.

241
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,477
We dug too deep, I think.

242
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,913
My mother says that
the earth wants blood.

243
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,793
And we have no right
to refuse.

244
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,748
Bonjour, Madame!

245
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,712
Oh, my God!

246
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,434
Pardon.
I did not want to scare you.

247
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,949
- It's OK.
Is only so few visits. .

248
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,675
. . these times.
What can I do for you?

249
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:54,476
- I want you to tell me
about Charlotte Massot.

250
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,589
Don't know anything.

251
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,676
But if...

252
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:01,759
I met her in your yard,
and it's not long ago.

253
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,279
I remember it well. .

254
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:06,790
. . pretty little things like her,
don't come here so often.

255
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,560
Oh yes...

256
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,750
A small dark-haired?
Yes.

257
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,918
- Pretty girl.
- Yes.

258
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:20,359
It may have happened
something to her.

259
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,869
What makes you say that?

260
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,671
how about coming in for 5 minutes?

261
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:32,155
You're standing there lost
and I forget my manners.

262
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,512
Sit down.

263
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,150
Thank you.

264
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,828
I'll make a coffee for you.

265
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:42,072
Although my road. .

266
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,317
. . they're just out there, huh.

267
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,192
All right, all right.

268
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,434
You took me for a coward, eh?

269
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:10,037
But frankly,
I don't blame you.

270
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,797
OK. Come here.

271
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:20,869
Come here...

272
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:25,759
I told you it wasn't safe
to give a lift to a hitchhikers.

273
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,113
Come.

274
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,918
Give me a good reason
to not shoot you.

275
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,032
I don't know one.

276
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,389
You.

277
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,872
I'll kill them. All!

278
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,712
What are you looking for?
-We have a chance maybe.

279
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:41,673
They are lower
when the moon is decreasing.

280
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,431
We must return to the heap.

281
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:06,712
They can live
in the land of the tips.

282
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,835
Well La Spack?

283
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,389
Laughing less now?

284
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,998
You fat slut!

285
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,671
This isn't the day to quit smoking.

286
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:06,637
Chinaski? Chinaski!

287
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:09,912
- Forget it.
We gotta be there before nightfall.

288
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,758
Chinaski!

289
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:11,914
Ha!

290
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,758
Look what I found!

291
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,318
Perfect timing.

292
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,158
We're lucky.

293
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,315
We're what?

294
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,431
I wanted to fuck this little slut.

295
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:41,755
That's right!

296
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:44,030
- It's a mania!
- Yeah, but I like it.

297
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,479
The old Spack!

298
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,148
Oh, damn!

299
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,353
- She sucks!
Why did she throw this head?

300
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,075
- Were going to fuck her
or shall we start with you?

301
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,117
What's this crap?

302
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:08,117
We must barricade.

303
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,673
Must barricade ourselves!

304
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:14,517
Tonight, she'll let them out,
and they'll kill us all.

305
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,153
Out? Whom?

306
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,952
Believe me,
you better don't wanna know.

307
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:19,229
You gonna believe?

308
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,716
We'll have to break out guys.
do you hear me, you bitches?

309
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,272
You, shut up!

310
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:29,837
The old one is kidding us and we're
stumbling like empty cans.

311
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:48,593
What's that?

312
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:52,429
- It was my father.
He did shooting competitions.

313
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,515
- You're well equipped!
- Should be enough until dawn.

314
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:18,591
- She never takes off
her coat of mail, yeah.

315
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:05,954
Hey!

316
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:11,756
Max!

317
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:13,518
Get out of there!

318
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,519
The girl has confused your head, huh?

319
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,153
It's a 50", granny. You like it?

320
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:51,869
You really have a problem, you know.

321
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:54,469
When I shoot you,
you have to yell!

322
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,116
Come on, once more!

323
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:07,197
Even on this side of the barrel...

324
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,153
. . you're still the same. .

325
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:11,839
. . jerk mouth!

326
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:18,153
You've got a large mouth
for a crazy old bitch!

327
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:37,635
You're so crazy that you don't
know when you're fucked!

328
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:47,550
It's you who's fucked!

329
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,516
What's that crap?

330
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,233
She wants blood...

331
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,509
. . the earth?

332
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,438
I'll give it to her myself.

333
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:15,389
Holy shit!

334
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:36,635
Damn!

335
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,479
That son of a bitch!

336
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,194
- Yes.
- Yeah?

337
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,756
Do you know the story of
the masochist, the sodomite. .

338
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:11,111
. . the necrophiliac, the sadist
the arsonist and the murderer?

339
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:13,356
- No.
- No?

340
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:15,074
It's really funny.

341
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:17,510
I'm going to pee, and then I'll tell you.

342
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:29,278
