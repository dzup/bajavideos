1
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:00,091
God, she`s beautiful.
She`s got the prettiest eyes.

2
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,497
She looks so sexy in that sweater.

3
00:02:03,837 --> 00:02:07,068
I just want to be alone
with her and kiss her...

4
00:02:07,274 --> 00:02:11,335
...and tell her how much I love her.

5
00:02:11,545 --> 00:02:14,343
Stop it, idiot.
She`s your wife`s sister.

6
00:02:14,548 --> 00:02:18,040
But I can`t help it.
I`m consumed by her.

7
00:02:18,251 --> 00:02:20,719
It`s been months now.
I dream about her.

8
00:02:20,921 --> 00:02:24,288
I think about her at the office.

9
00:02:24,491 --> 00:02:25,981
Oh, Lee...

10
00:02:26,226 --> 00:02:27,853
...what am I gonna do?

11
00:02:28,528 --> 00:02:32,862
I hear myself mooning over you
and it`s disgusting.

12
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:36,431
Before, when she squeezed
past me...

13
00:02:36,636 --> 00:02:39,161
...and I smelled
that perfume on her....

14
00:02:39,372 --> 00:02:42,864
Jesus, I thought
I was gonna swoon.

15
00:02:43,076 --> 00:02:46,637
Easy. You`re a dignified
financial adviser.

16
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:49,281
It doesn`t look good to swoon.

17
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,484
Elliot, have you tried these?
These are wonderful.

18
00:02:54,688 --> 00:02:56,815
Holly and her friend made them.

19
00:02:57,023 --> 00:03:00,220
Fantastic. Your sister
is an unbelievable cook.

20
00:03:00,427 --> 00:03:03,157
l know.
She has all the cooking charm.

21
00:03:03,363 --> 00:03:06,161
-No, you`ve got talent.
-l`ve eaten five.

22
00:03:06,366 --> 00:03:08,664
Holly, open a restaurant.

23
00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:10,097
We practically are.

24
00:03:10,303 --> 00:03:15,263
Not a restaurant, but April
and l are gonna do some catering.

25
00:03:15,475 --> 00:03:17,841
-You`re kidding!
-No, we decided.

26
00:03:18,044 --> 00:03:19,477
Perfect.

27
00:03:19,846 --> 00:03:21,643
We like to cook for friends.

28
00:03:21,848 --> 00:03:25,477
Until an acting job comes
we could do parties.

29
00:03:25,685 --> 00:03:29,712
-Great. That`s where your talent lies.
-l know.

30
00:03:29,923 --> 00:03:32,153
Can l speak to you privately?

31
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:34,520
l`m her husband.
She tells me anything.

32
00:03:35,695 --> 00:03:38,027
l have to borrow more.
Don`t get upset.

33
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:42,190
-l never get upset.
-This is the last time, l promise.

34
00:03:42,402 --> 00:03:45,166
-Don`t insult me.
-l`ll pay it all back.

35
00:03:45,372 --> 00:03:49,001
-l know. How much do you need?
-Two thousand dollars.

36
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:53,270
April and l have this catering idea.
lt`ll be great.

37
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,175
You admit we`re great cooks.

38
00:03:55,382 --> 00:03:59,409
There`s things l have to buy
and some old debts.

39
00:03:59,619 --> 00:04:02,281
Are we talking about cocaine again?

40
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:06,323
l swear. We`ve already got
requests to do a few parties.

41
00:04:06,526 --> 00:04:09,495
Obviously l`m not gonna
be a caterer forever.

42
00:04:09,696 --> 00:04:13,132
We still audition.
Something could come up.

43
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:18,293
My days are free for my class.
l haven`t done drugs in a year.

44
00:04:28,048 --> 00:04:31,575
Mom and Dad are floating down
memory lane again.

45
00:04:31,785 --> 00:04:35,346
Have you tried the shrimp?
You`ve outdone yourself.

46
00:04:35,555 --> 00:04:40,151
l need an antihistamine for Mom`s
asthma. She`s turning into ``Camille.``

47
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,352
-She`s always Camille.
-At least she isn`t drinking.

48
00:04:43,563 --> 00:04:48,023
-Doesn`t she look great?
-She knows it too. She`s flirting.

49
00:04:48,234 --> 00:04:52,762
Maybe when she`s 80, she`ll stop
straightening her garter belt.

50
00:04:52,973 --> 00:04:57,000
-Where`s the antihistamine?
-Ask Elliot. He`s got them.

51
00:04:58,311 --> 00:05:00,905
-Frederick didn`t come.
-Does he ever?

52
00:05:01,114 --> 00:05:04,550
He`s such an angry--
Such a depressive--

53
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:06,946
l thought she was moving out.

54
00:05:21,534 --> 00:05:25,527
-Watch out, you guys.
-The kids are so adorable.

55
00:05:25,739 --> 00:05:27,604
lt gets so lonely on holidays.

56
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:31,140
Oh, gosh.
That`s why l invited Phil Gamisch.

57
00:05:31,344 --> 00:05:34,404
-Hannah, he`s such a loser!
-He`s not a loser.

58
00:05:34,614 --> 00:05:38,106
-He`s a headmaster.
-He reminds me of lchabod Crane.

59
00:05:38,318 --> 00:05:40,912
His Adam`s apple jumps
when he`s excited.

60
00:05:41,121 --> 00:05:43,351
He`s better than your ex-husband.

61
00:05:43,556 --> 00:05:46,354
-He`s not a dope addict.
-Give me a break.

62
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:49,153
Am l interrupting any sister talk?

63
00:05:49,362 --> 00:05:52,593
There are no interesting
single men here.

64
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:54,232
lt`s terrible!

65
00:05:54,434 --> 00:05:57,835
Maybe April would like Phil.
Phil, tall guy.

66
00:05:58,038 --> 00:06:01,030
l met Phil.
He looks like lchabod Crane?

67
00:06:01,241 --> 00:06:05,644
-l love that. That`s my type.
-l don`t believe it.

68
00:06:05,845 --> 00:06:07,676
We mustn`t get discouraged.

69
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:12,215
Hannah will invite some men over
who don`t look like lchabod.

70
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:14,979
Maybe at Christmas or New Year`s.

71
00:06:15,188 --> 00:06:18,715
lf not this New Year`s,
maybe next New Year`s. Ouch!

72
00:06:18,925 --> 00:06:20,483
Must be here someplace.

73
00:06:20,694 --> 00:06:23,527
l love that book, The Easter Parade.

74
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:26,426
You were right.
lt had meaning for me.

75
00:06:26,633 --> 00:06:30,399
-How`s Frederick? He didn`t come.
-One of his moods.

76
00:06:30,603 --> 00:06:33,970
Although it wasn`t a bad week.
He sold a picture.

77
00:06:34,174 --> 00:06:37,473
One of his better drawings,
a beautiful nude study.

78
00:06:37,677 --> 00:06:40,908
lt was of me.
lt`s a funny feeling to know...

79
00:06:41,114 --> 00:06:43,776
...you`re hung naked
in a stranger`s home.

80
00:06:43,983 --> 00:06:47,783
But you can`t tell it`s me--
You`re turning all red.

81
00:06:48,655 --> 00:06:49,986
Really?

82
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:54,820
-What else? What are you up to?
-My unemployment`s running out.

83
00:06:55,028 --> 00:06:57,963
l thought of taking
some courses at Columbia.

84
00:06:58,164 --> 00:07:00,189
-Like...?
-l don`t know exactly.

85
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,803
Sociology, psychology.
l might like to work with children.

86
00:07:05,004 --> 00:07:08,167
l always have clients
who are furnishing places.

87
00:07:08,374 --> 00:07:12,606
Some might be interested
in buying art. Shall l call you?

88
00:07:12,812 --> 00:07:16,009
Frederick would be
grateful for a sale.

89
00:07:16,216 --> 00:07:17,945
Guys? Dinner`s ready.

90
00:07:18,151 --> 00:07:20,210
Doesn`t she look pretty?

91
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:24,186
l bumped into your ex-husband.
He`s crazy as ever.

92
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,051
He was getting a blood test.

93
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:30,127
Mickey, the hypochondriac.
Could he handle real illness?

94
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,957
Let`s go have dinner.

95
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:37,160
-Ladies and gentlemen....
-Dad.

96
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,930
-Dad!
-No, now--

97
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,132
-We`re starving.
-This is a toast.

98
00:07:43,343 --> 00:07:44,935
This is a toast.

99
00:07:45,145 --> 00:07:48,273
You know, this beautiful
Thanksgiving dinner...

100
00:07:48,481 --> 00:07:51,746
...was all prepared by Hannah.

101
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:55,318
A little help from Mary,
also Holly and April.

102
00:07:56,022 --> 00:07:58,047
No, you did it.

103
00:07:59,192 --> 00:08:03,185
And we drink to her,
and we all congratulate her...

104
00:08:03,396 --> 00:08:07,196
...on her wonderful accomplishment
during this last year:

105
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,369
Her great success
in A Doll`s House.

106
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:14,062
-Hooray!
-Bravo!

107
00:08:14,274 --> 00:08:19,041
l played Nora, l hate to tell you
what year, and it`s difficult...

108
00:08:19,245 --> 00:08:21,736
...to behave like Torvald`s
``little chipmunk``...

109
00:08:21,948 --> 00:08:25,384
...without making a perfect ass
out of yourself.

110
00:08:25,852 --> 00:08:29,982
l think that lbsen would`ve
been damn proud of our Hannah.

111
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,384
Speech!

112
00:08:32,091 --> 00:08:34,685
No, l`ve been very, very lucky.

113
00:08:34,894 --> 00:08:37,556
When l had the kids,
l stopped working...

114
00:08:37,764 --> 00:08:41,393
...and devoted myself to the family.

115
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:45,059
But l`ve always hoped
that some little gem...

116
00:08:45,271 --> 00:08:48,399
...would tempt me back on the stage.

117
00:08:48,608 --> 00:08:50,235
l got that out of my system...

118
00:08:50,443 --> 00:08:53,776
...and l can go back to
what makes me happiest.

119
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:54,969
Bravo!

120
00:09:08,928 --> 00:09:12,830
Is it my imagination,
or does Elliot have a crush on me?

121
00:09:13,032 --> 00:09:16,263
It`s funny.
I`ve had that thought before.

122
00:09:16,469 --> 00:09:18,869
He pays a lot of attention to me.

123
00:09:19,072 --> 00:09:22,371
And he blushed tonight
when we were alone.

124
00:09:22,575 --> 00:09:24,839
I wonder if he and Hannah are happy.

125
00:09:25,511 --> 00:09:30,448
It`s funny. I still feel
a little buzz from his flirting.

126
00:09:35,855 --> 00:09:37,550
Want some coffee or tea?

127
00:09:37,757 --> 00:09:38,815
No, thank you.

128
00:09:39,025 --> 00:09:42,051
-How about something to eat?
-No, nothing.

129
00:09:42,262 --> 00:09:44,492
-Are you sure?
-Absolutely.

130
00:09:44,697 --> 00:09:48,497
What am l gonna do with you?
God....

131
00:09:48,701 --> 00:09:53,468
And why didn`t you come?
We all had a terrific time.

132
00:09:53,673 --> 00:09:58,007
l`m going through a period
where l can`t be around people.

133
00:09:58,211 --> 00:10:02,705
-l didn`t want to abuse anyone.
-You wouldn`t. They`re so sweet.

134
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:05,942
You`re the only person
l can be with...

135
00:10:06,152 --> 00:10:08,552
...who l look forward to being with.

136
00:10:08,755 --> 00:10:12,088
You`re too harsh with everyone,
you know that.

137
00:10:14,027 --> 00:10:18,020
-lsn`t it enough that l can love you?
-You`re a puzzle.

138
00:10:18,231 --> 00:10:22,224
So sweet with me and so
contemptuous of everyone else.

139
00:10:22,435 --> 00:10:25,734
There was a time when you were happy
to be only with me.

140
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:29,602
You wanted to learn
about poetry, about music.

141
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:34,075
Have l taught you everything
l can give? l don`t think so.

142
00:10:38,618 --> 00:10:41,849
Elliot might have
a couple of clients for you.

143
00:10:42,488 --> 00:10:45,616
l`m sure those morons
have deep feelings for art.

144
00:10:45,825 --> 00:10:49,625
You never know. He`s just trying
to do the nice thing.

145
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:51,797
-Because he likes you.
-Me?

146
00:10:51,998 --> 00:10:54,694
Yeah, Elliot lusts after you.

147
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:57,096
Based on what? You never see him.

148
00:10:57,303 --> 00:10:58,292
Based on...

149
00:10:58,504 --> 00:11:03,237
...whenever you see him you come
home with books he`s recommended.

150
00:11:03,443 --> 00:11:05,809
No, he`s my sister`s husband.

151
00:11:06,012 --> 00:11:10,210
lf you gave him half a chance,
you`d like him.

152
00:11:10,516 --> 00:11:13,952
He`s a glorified accountant,
and he`s after you.

153
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,750
And l prefer to sell my work
to people who appreciate it.

154
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,127
You understand?

155
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,806
-They won`t let us do the sketch?
-lt`s too dirty.

156
00:11:35,008 --> 00:11:38,034
But we showed it to them
in rehearsal.

157
00:11:38,244 --> 00:11:39,836
Mickey, half-hour to air.

158
00:11:40,046 --> 00:11:44,244
-The show`s five minutes short.
-How can it be short?

159
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:48,409
Now we`ll be 1 0 minutes short.
They can`t do that.

160
00:11:48,621 --> 00:11:52,079
-Our ratings are low.
-l have such a migraine.

161
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,759
We better go
to Ronnie`s dressing room.

162
00:11:54,961 --> 00:11:58,260
He must`ve taken Quaaludes.
He can`t do the show.

163
00:11:58,464 --> 00:12:02,298
Why me, Lord? What did l--?
Standards and practices?

164
00:12:02,502 --> 00:12:06,529
-Why is the sketch dirty?
-Child molestation is touchy.

165
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:08,468
Half the country`s doing it.

166
00:12:08,674 --> 00:12:11,768
-But you name names.
-No, we say ``The pope.``

167
00:12:11,978 --> 00:12:14,572
That sketch cannot go on the air.

168
00:12:14,781 --> 00:12:17,579
Who changed my sketch about the PLO?

169
00:12:17,917 --> 00:12:21,614
-l had to cut four lines.
-The premise is ruined.

170
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:24,449
You`re crazy. lt`s not so delicate.

171
00:12:24,657 --> 00:12:28,320
l don`t want anyone tampering
without telling me.

172
00:12:28,528 --> 00:12:30,826
You want them cut,
l`ll cut them myself.

173
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:35,831
Listen, instead of the molestation
sketch, why don`t we repeat...

174
00:12:36,035 --> 00:12:38,469
...the Reagan homosexual dance number?

175
00:12:38,671 --> 00:12:40,002
l don`t feel good.

176
00:12:40,206 --> 00:12:42,800
What did you do, swallow a drugstore?

177
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:44,271
l lost my voice.

178
00:12:44,477 --> 00:12:48,470
Ronnie, you have to go on
in 25 minutes.

179
00:12:48,681 --> 00:12:51,582
Does anybody got a Tagamet?
My ulcer.

180
00:12:51,784 --> 00:12:53,752
You want a Quaalude?

181
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,120
This show`s ruining my health.

182
00:12:57,323 --> 00:12:59,587
My ex-partner moves to California.

183
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:03,626
Every stupid show he produces
turns into a big hit.

184
00:13:03,896 --> 00:13:06,558
What am I gonna do with my life?

185
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:10,828
I gotta remember to see
my ex-wife tomorrow.

186
00:13:14,774 --> 00:13:17,937
Hi! Glad you could
put in an appearance.

187
00:13:18,144 --> 00:13:19,873
l got two minutes.

188
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,913
The show`s killing me.
l got a million appointments.

189
00:13:24,117 --> 00:13:27,575
-l gotta see--
-Two minutes on your sons` birthday.

190
00:13:27,787 --> 00:13:29,914
Happy birthday, fellas.

191
00:13:30,123 --> 00:13:32,717
Guys, look. Daddy brought presents.

192
00:13:32,925 --> 00:13:34,825
A little hug? What is this?

193
00:13:35,027 --> 00:13:37,587
How about some action?
How is everything?

194
00:13:37,797 --> 00:13:39,389
Everything`s good.

195
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:42,864
Open the presents.
Let me get some reaction.

196
00:13:43,069 --> 00:13:44,627
-How`s Elliot?
-He`s fine.

197
00:13:44,837 --> 00:13:48,068
l`m trying to convince him
to produce a play.

198
00:13:48,274 --> 00:13:49,673
That`ll be terrific.

199
00:13:49,876 --> 00:13:53,403
l like him, he`s a sweet guy.
lsn`t that a great mitt?

200
00:13:53,613 --> 00:13:57,344
Because he`s a loser.
He`s awkward and clumsy like me.

201
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:00,280
l always like
an under-confident person.

202
00:14:00,486 --> 00:14:01,680
He wanted a mitt.

203
00:14:01,888 --> 00:14:06,791
-You`ve had good taste in husbands.
-Thanks. That`s a beauty.

204
00:14:06,993 --> 00:14:08,688
Go over there. Come on, hurry.

205
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,921
Go out by the Sung vase
and catch this.

206
00:14:12,131 --> 00:14:13,530
Watch the picture!

207
00:14:14,233 --> 00:14:18,863
Hannah`s sweet. Although sometimes
I still do get angry.

208
00:14:19,071 --> 00:14:22,472
At least I`m not paying
child support.

209
00:14:22,675 --> 00:14:25,735
I hope there`s nothing
physically wrong with me.

210
00:14:25,945 --> 00:14:27,742
What`s the problem this time?

211
00:14:27,947 --> 00:14:31,314
This time l really think
l have something.

212
00:14:31,517 --> 00:14:36,284
lt`s not like that adenoidal thing,
where l`d had them out.

213
00:14:36,489 --> 00:14:40,619
l saw your father.
He complained of chest pains.

214
00:14:40,826 --> 00:14:44,091
This guy`s the real
hypochondriac of the family.

215
00:14:44,297 --> 00:14:48,791
-You mentioned you`d had dizziness.
-Yes, and l`m developing...

216
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:51,492
...a hearing loss in my right--
Left ear.

217
00:14:51,704 --> 00:14:55,196
Sorry, my right--
Right or left. l can`t remember.

218
00:14:55,408 --> 00:14:56,568
Let`s take a look.

219
00:15:17,697 --> 00:15:22,498
You have had a significant drop
in the high decibel range.

220
00:15:22,702 --> 00:15:23,964
Really?

221
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:27,367
You been exposed to a loud noise
or a virus?

222
00:15:27,573 --> 00:15:31,976
l`ve been perfectly healthy.
l always imagine l have things.

223
00:15:32,178 --> 00:15:34,339
When did you first notice this?

224
00:15:34,547 --> 00:15:37,038
About a month ago. What do l have?

225
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:41,584
You`ve had dizzy spells.
What about ringing and buzzing?

226
00:15:41,787 --> 00:15:46,747
Yes, now that you mention it,
l have buzzing and also ringing.

227
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,123
-Ringing and buzzing. Am l going deaf?
-lt`s just one ear.

228
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:54,925
ls it healthier
to have problems in both ears?

229
00:15:56,302 --> 00:16:00,500
Make an appointment at the
hospital to run some tests.

230
00:16:00,706 --> 00:16:03,072
The hospital? What kind of tests?

231
00:16:03,276 --> 00:16:05,244
Don`t get alarmed.

232
00:16:05,444 --> 00:16:10,006
These are just more sophisticated
tests. lt`s nothing.

233
00:16:10,216 --> 00:16:13,777
Then why go to the hospital?
l hear fine.

234
00:16:13,986 --> 00:16:17,046
So l`m weak in the high decibels.

235
00:16:17,256 --> 00:16:20,521
Don`t panic.
l just wanna rule out some things.

236
00:16:20,726 --> 00:16:24,526
-Like what?
-lt`s nothing. Will you trust me?

237
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:27,961
Hello, Dr. Wilkes?
This is Mickey Saxe.

238
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:29,998
l wanna ask you a question.

239
00:16:30,603 --> 00:16:31,865
Sure. What`s up?

240
00:16:32,071 --> 00:16:34,767
lf you have a hearing loss
in one ear...

241
00:16:34,974 --> 00:16:38,501
...and it`s not from a virus
or a loud noise...

242
00:16:38,711 --> 00:16:40,508
...what are the possibilities?

243
00:16:40,713 --> 00:16:43,511
Anything. Often it`s hereditary.

244
00:16:43,716 --> 00:16:46,514
Flu, even a small noise will do it.

245
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:48,380
Right, but nothing worse?

246
00:16:49,021 --> 00:16:53,458
l guess the dark side
of the spectrum is a brain tumor.

247
00:16:55,227 --> 00:16:57,024
Really?

248
00:16:57,296 --> 00:17:00,493
-Here`s the new pages.
-Did Cards get these?

249
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,930
-Not yet.
-Let`s hope it`s good.

250
00:17:03,135 --> 00:17:07,367
Yeah, really.
We`ll be down in a minute, okay?

251
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,308
Mickey, what`s the matter with you?

252
00:17:10,509 --> 00:17:13,342
l feel dizzy. l don`t feel well.

253
00:17:13,546 --> 00:17:16,208
Do you hear a ringing?
ls there a ringing?

254
00:17:16,415 --> 00:17:19,612
-Yeah, l hear it. Hello?
-Not that.

255
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:24,347
Yeah, we`re gonna be working late.
No, we`ll order out.

256
00:17:24,557 --> 00:17:27,526
lf l have a tumor,
l don`t know what l`ll do.

257
00:17:27,727 --> 00:17:30,093
He didn`t say you had a tumor.

258
00:17:30,296 --> 00:17:34,528
They don`t tell you.
Sometimes the weaker ones will panic.

259
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:38,795
-But not you.
-Oh, God. You hear a buzzing?

260
00:17:39,004 --> 00:17:41,302
Come on, we got a show to do.

261
00:17:41,507 --> 00:17:44,704
-l can`t focus.
-But there`s nothing wrong.

262
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:48,175
Then why does he want more tests?

263
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:50,008
He has to rule out things.

264
00:17:50,216 --> 00:17:53,014
-Like what?
-l don`t know. Cancer.

265
00:17:53,219 --> 00:17:56,711
Don`t say that.
l don`t wanna hear that word.

266
00:17:56,922 --> 00:17:58,719
But you don`t have symptoms.

267
00:17:58,924 --> 00:18:01,722
l got the classic symptoms
of a brain tumor.

268
00:18:01,927 --> 00:18:04,828
Two months ago
it was a malignant melanoma.

269
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:08,898
The sudden appearance
of a black spot on my back.

270
00:18:09,101 --> 00:18:13,162
-lt was on your shirt.
-How was l to know?

271
00:18:13,372 --> 00:18:15,567
We`ve got to make decisions.

272
00:18:15,775 --> 00:18:19,142
l can`t think.
This morning l was so happy.

273
00:18:19,345 --> 00:18:23,281
-l don`t know what went wrong.
-You were miserable.

274
00:18:23,482 --> 00:18:27,145
We got bad reviews.
The sponsors are furious.

275
00:18:27,353 --> 00:18:30,686
l was happy,
but l just didn`t realize l was.

276
00:18:35,161 --> 00:18:37,459
These are delicious! What are they?

277
00:18:37,663 --> 00:18:40,689
Those are quail eggs.
Aren`t they good?

278
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,358
My friend April makes those.
Try a shrimp puff.

279
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:47,266
-That looks good.
-l make those.

280
00:18:48,073 --> 00:18:51,167
Excuse me. Thank you.

281
00:18:52,445 --> 00:18:55,414
-The stroganoff is ready.
-We`re a hit!

282
00:18:55,614 --> 00:18:57,741
ln this. Yesterday, l auditioned.

283
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:01,909
-That wasn`t a hit.
-You`ll get five jobs next week.

284
00:19:02,121 --> 00:19:05,682
-Are there any more clams?
-A few. You like them?

285
00:19:05,891 --> 00:19:08,291
-l can`t resist.
-How flattering.

286
00:19:08,494 --> 00:19:13,022
-Did you try the shrimp?
-You`re too attractive to be caterers.

287
00:19:13,232 --> 00:19:15,530
-We`re actresses.
-Your first job?

288
00:19:15,734 --> 00:19:18,396
-ls the food that bad?
-Not at all.

289
00:19:18,604 --> 00:19:21,835
We need more sauce
for the lasagna. Hi.

290
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:24,635
You`re an actress
with a flair for shrimp.

291
00:19:24,844 --> 00:19:28,905
The shrimp puffs are Holly`s.
l do the crepes caviar.

292
00:19:29,114 --> 00:19:31,912
And the quail`s responsible
for the eggs.

293
00:19:32,117 --> 00:19:34,881
l stole you a couple of extra clams.

294
00:19:35,087 --> 00:19:38,488
-lncidentally, l`m David Tolchin.
-April Knox, hi.

295
00:19:38,858 --> 00:19:39,847
You`re Holly.

296
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:42,687
We`re the Stanislavski
Catering Company.

297
00:19:42,895 --> 00:19:47,298
l`ll tell you the truth.
l was bored stiff by the party.

298
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,365
We`re more interesting?

299
00:19:49,568 --> 00:19:52,662
l`ll listen to Aida,
if l`m not in your way.

300
00:19:52,872 --> 00:19:54,032
Not at all.

301
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,643
We saw Pavarotti in Ernani
at the Met, and l cried.

302
00:19:58,844 --> 00:19:59,902
l cry at the opera.

303
00:20:00,112 --> 00:20:03,275
l go limp in the last scene
in La Traviata.

304
00:20:03,482 --> 00:20:06,212
Me too.
l have a private box at the Met.

305
00:20:06,418 --> 00:20:10,548
l bring my bottle of wine,
l watch and l cry. Disgusting.

306
00:20:10,756 --> 00:20:13,156
-What do you do?
-l`m an architect.

307
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:15,122
What do you build?

308
00:20:15,327 --> 00:20:17,659
-Are you really interested?
-Yeah.

309
00:20:18,631 --> 00:20:20,098
What time do you get off?

310
00:20:22,635 --> 00:20:25,195
-lt`s the red one?
-lt`s magnificent.

311
00:20:25,404 --> 00:20:27,395
The design`s noncontextual.

312
00:20:27,606 --> 00:20:30,541
l wanted to keep
the street atmosphere...

313
00:20:30,743 --> 00:20:33,371
...on the proportions
and the material.

314
00:20:33,579 --> 00:20:36,810
-That`s unpolished red granite.
-ls it?

315
00:20:37,016 --> 00:20:40,383
-lt has an organic quality.
-Right.

316
00:20:40,586 --> 00:20:44,078
Entirely interdependent,
if you know what l mean.

317
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:48,920
l can`t put it into words.
The important thing is, it breathes.

318
00:20:49,128 --> 00:20:52,655
April, people pass by vital
structures all the time.

319
00:20:52,865 --> 00:20:54,924
They never appreciate them.

320
00:20:55,134 --> 00:20:57,466
You tune into your environment.

321
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:01,071
-lt`s important.
-What are your favorite buildings?

322
00:21:01,273 --> 00:21:02,467
You wanna see some?

323
00:21:02,675 --> 00:21:04,199
Well, let`s do it.

324
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:53,321
lt`s just so romantic.
l wanna open the French doors--

325
00:21:53,525 --> 00:21:56,585
-lt`s French.
-lt is. lt`s romantic.

326
00:21:56,795 --> 00:22:01,198
And it`s got a handsome partner
sitting right beside it.

327
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,336
Your eye goes along,
lulled into complacency, and then--

328
00:22:05,537 --> 00:22:07,903
-That`s just....
-Look at this.

329
00:22:08,107 --> 00:22:10,166
That`s really terrible.

330
00:22:10,376 --> 00:22:13,004
-And it ruins everything else.
-lt does.

331
00:22:13,212 --> 00:22:15,840
-We`ve seen a lot of stuff today.
-Yeah.

332
00:22:16,048 --> 00:22:18,175
We should think about going home.

333
00:22:18,384 --> 00:22:19,874
-Yeah.
-Okay.

334
00:22:20,085 --> 00:22:24,146
-Who gets dropped first?
-Gee, l don`t know.

335
00:22:24,356 --> 00:22:29,487
-l live downtown.
-We both live downtown.

336
00:22:29,695 --> 00:22:32,129
lt depends on what way you wanna go.

337
00:22:32,331 --> 00:22:37,098
l know. lf we took Fifth,
then we`d get to your house first.

338
00:22:37,302 --> 00:22:39,862
-We could do that.
-But Fifth is jammed.

339
00:22:40,072 --> 00:22:43,041
-l mean....
-Well, sometimes.

340
00:22:43,242 --> 00:22:45,437
You live in Chelsea, don`t you?

341
00:22:45,644 --> 00:22:48,977
lf you live in Chelsea,
that`s probably first.

342
00:22:49,181 --> 00:22:51,206
-Okay.
-And then April.

343
00:22:51,417 --> 00:22:52,475
Great.

344
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:01,782
Naturally, I get taken home first.

345
00:23:01,994 --> 00:23:04,019
Obviously, he prefers April.

346
00:23:04,229 --> 00:23:06,959
Of course, I was so tongue-tied
all night.

347
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:09,691
I can`t believe I said that.

348
00:23:09,902 --> 00:23:13,998
My stupid roller-skating joke.
I should never tell jokes.

349
00:23:14,206 --> 00:23:17,175
Mom can tell them, and Hannah,
but I kill them.

350
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:23,012
Where did April come up
with terms like ``organic form``?

351
00:23:23,282 --> 00:23:26,615
Well, naturally. She went to Brandeis.

352
00:23:27,052 --> 00:23:29,782
She doesn`t know
what she`s talking about.

353
00:23:29,988 --> 00:23:33,480
Could you believe the way
she was calling him David?

354
00:23:33,692 --> 00:23:37,355
``I feel that way too, David.
Marvelous space, David. ``

355
00:23:37,563 --> 00:23:40,123
I hate April. She`s pushy.

356
00:23:40,632 --> 00:23:44,693
They`ll dump me, and she`ll
invite him up. I blew it.

357
00:23:45,738 --> 00:23:48,036
And I really like him a lot.

358
00:23:48,741 --> 00:23:50,868
Screw it. I`m not gonna get upset.

359
00:23:51,076 --> 00:23:54,876
I`ve got reading to do.
I`ll get into bed early...

360
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,945
...and take an extra Seconal.

361
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:24,124
-My goodness.
-Elliot! What are you doing here?

362
00:25:24,336 --> 00:25:27,794
-l`m looking for a bookstore.
-ln this section?

363
00:25:28,006 --> 00:25:31,100
l`m killing time.
l have a client near here.

364
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:34,643
-How about you?
-Well, l live--

365
00:25:34,847 --> 00:25:36,610
-You live near here.
-l do.

366
00:25:36,815 --> 00:25:40,080
-Where are you headed?
-To my AA meeting.

367
00:25:40,285 --> 00:25:43,311
Why do you still go?
You never touch alcohol.

368
00:25:43,522 --> 00:25:48,789
You didn`t know me before Frederick.
l`d start with a beer at 1 0 a.m.

369
00:25:48,994 --> 00:25:52,953
-You must`ve been very unhappy.
-Unhappy and fat.

370
00:25:53,165 --> 00:25:55,929
l still find the meetings comforting.

371
00:25:56,134 --> 00:26:00,434
l`ll never understand it.
You`re so bright and beautiful.

372
00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:03,836
l think: ``What problems
could she have?``

373
00:26:04,042 --> 00:26:07,011
Don`t let me get started
on my childhood.

374
00:26:07,212 --> 00:26:10,807
You know what? There is
a bookstore near here.

375
00:26:11,016 --> 00:26:12,847
You`d really love it.

376
00:26:13,051 --> 00:26:14,245
-Yes?
-You would.

377
00:26:14,453 --> 00:26:16,785
-lf you have some free time....
-Sure.

378
00:26:16,989 --> 00:26:18,286
Thank you.

379
00:26:20,058 --> 00:26:22,618
lsn`t this great?
They have everything.

380
00:26:22,828 --> 00:26:25,353
-Wonderful.
-What book did you want?

381
00:26:25,564 --> 00:26:27,293
-What?
-You wanted a book?

382
00:26:27,499 --> 00:26:31,196
No, l`m killing time.
l just want to browse.

383
00:26:31,403 --> 00:26:33,064
You picked the right place.

384
00:26:33,272 --> 00:26:36,173
You can stay all afternoon
and just read.

385
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:39,970
Unless you have time.
We could get some coffee.

386
00:26:40,178 --> 00:26:43,045
-l don`t have time.
-l understand.

387
00:26:43,248 --> 00:26:45,808
No problem. You`re busy. l....

388
00:26:46,018 --> 00:26:49,215
You seem tense.
Everything all right? No?

389
00:26:49,421 --> 00:26:51,389
-Yes.
-Everything`s okay?

390
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,785
Yeah. How are you?

391
00:26:53,992 --> 00:26:55,687
l`m all right.

392
00:26:55,894 --> 00:26:57,919
-How`s Frederick?
-Fine.

393
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:00,963
We went to the Caravaggio exhibition.

394
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:05,865
lt`s such a treat to go
with Frederick. You learn so much.

395
00:27:06,071 --> 00:27:10,007
-Do you like Caravaggio?
-Yes, who doesn`t?

396
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,368
Look.

397
00:27:13,178 --> 00:27:16,409
e.e. cummings.
l`d like to get you this.

398
00:27:16,615 --> 00:27:18,310
l can`t let you get me that.

399
00:27:18,517 --> 00:27:21,509
-l`d like to very much.
-l don`t think so.

400
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,655
l read a poem of you
and thought of his--

401
00:27:24,856 --> 00:27:28,314
A poem of his and thought of you.

402
00:27:29,027 --> 00:27:30,016
You`ll be fine.

403
00:27:30,228 --> 00:27:32,856
This is great. l love e.e. cummings.

404
00:27:33,065 --> 00:27:34,828
l`d love to get you this.

405
00:27:35,033 --> 00:27:38,935
And maybe we could
discuss it sometime.

406
00:27:44,076 --> 00:27:47,842
-Thanks a lot.
-Thanks for showing me the bookstore.

407
00:27:48,046 --> 00:27:51,038
You could take me
to an AA meeting sometime.

408
00:27:51,249 --> 00:27:53,740
-l`d love to see it.
-You`d love it.

409
00:27:53,952 --> 00:27:57,285
lt`s really entertaining.
You`d have a good time.

410
00:27:57,489 --> 00:28:00,822
And don`t forget the poem on page 1 1 2.

411
00:28:01,026 --> 00:28:03,756
-lt reminded me of you.
-Really?

412
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,093
Page 1 1 2.

413
00:28:10,302 --> 00:28:11,826
-Bye.
-Bye!

414
00:28:19,444 --> 00:28:23,210
``Your slightest look
Easily will unclose me

415
00:28:23,415 --> 00:28:25,975
Though I have closed myself
As fingers

416
00:28:26,184 --> 00:28:29,017
You open always
Petal by petal myself

417
00:28:29,221 --> 00:28:33,180
As spring opens
Touching skillfully, mysteriously

418
00:28:33,392 --> 00:28:35,223
Her first rose

419
00:28:36,762 --> 00:28:41,165
I do not know what it is about you
That closes and opens

420
00:28:41,366 --> 00:28:43,891
Only something in me understands

421
00:28:44,102 --> 00:28:49,005
The voice of your eyes
Is deeper than all roses

422
00:28:49,207 --> 00:28:52,734
Nobody, not even the rain

423
00:28:52,944 --> 00:28:55,310
Has such small hands``

424
00:29:50,502 --> 00:29:55,530
l wasn`t too happy with your ENG
results, or your BSER either.

425
00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:00,871
That`s why l sent you to Tomography,
all that stuff rolling around.

426
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:02,910
See this gray area here?

427
00:30:03,715 --> 00:30:07,446
That area`s what l had
hoped we wouldn`t run into.

428
00:30:07,752 --> 00:30:11,518
l`d like you to come in Monday
for a CAT scan.

429
00:30:12,591 --> 00:30:16,186
-A brain scan?
-Let`s take one step at a time.

430
00:30:16,394 --> 00:30:21,297
We won`t make any decisions
until we have all the information.

431
00:30:24,469 --> 00:30:27,233
Okay, take it easy.

432
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:29,771
He didn`t say you had anything.

433
00:30:30,542 --> 00:30:33,636
He just doesn`t like
the spot on your x-ray.

434
00:30:33,845 --> 00:30:37,906
Doesn`t mean you have anything.
Don`t jump to conclusions.

435
00:30:38,216 --> 00:30:40,081
Nothing`s gonna happen to you.

436
00:30:40,285 --> 00:30:42,947
You`re in New York City.
This is your town.

437
00:30:43,155 --> 00:30:46,215
You`re surrounded by traffic
and restaurants.

438
00:30:46,424 --> 00:30:50,793
God! How can you just,
one day, vanish?

439
00:30:51,463 --> 00:30:54,660
Keep calm. You`re gonna be okay.

440
00:30:54,866 --> 00:30:56,891
Don`t panic.

441
00:30:57,502 --> 00:31:02,530
I`m dying! I know it!
There`s a spot on my lungs!

442
00:31:02,741 --> 00:31:06,734
Take it easy. It`s not on
your lungs. It`s on your ear.

443
00:31:06,945 --> 00:31:10,642
It`s the same thing, isn`t it?
I can`t sleep.

444
00:31:10,849 --> 00:31:14,410
God, there`s a tumor in my head
the size of a basketball.

445
00:31:14,619 --> 00:31:18,020
I keep thinking I can feel
it every time I blink.

446
00:31:18,223 --> 00:31:21,556
Jesus! He wants me
to do a brain scan...

447
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,251
... to confirm what he
already suspects.

448
00:31:24,462 --> 00:31:27,693
I`ll make a deal with God.
Let it just be my ear.

449
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:30,367
I`ll go deaf and blind in one eye.

450
00:31:30,569 --> 00:31:32,230
I don`t want a brain operation.

451
00:31:32,437 --> 00:31:35,929
I`ll wind up like the guy
with the wool cap...

452
00:31:36,141 --> 00:31:38,473
...who delivers for the florist.

453
00:31:38,677 --> 00:31:42,977
Your whole life you run to doctors.
The news is always fine.

454
00:31:43,181 --> 00:31:46,082
That`s not true.
What about years ago?

455
00:31:46,284 --> 00:31:49,685
l`m sorry to say
that you cannot have children.

456
00:31:52,057 --> 00:31:55,754
-Gee.
-ls there no chance?

457
00:31:55,961 --> 00:31:58,862
You can have a normal sex life...

458
00:31:59,064 --> 00:32:02,158
...but his tests indicate
that he is infertile.

459
00:32:02,367 --> 00:32:05,029
Small sperm volume and infertile.

460
00:32:05,237 --> 00:32:07,364
Anything l can do? Pushups?

461
00:32:07,572 --> 00:32:10,302
-l`m afraid not.
-l need a second opinion.

462
00:32:10,508 --> 00:32:13,068
-This is the second opinion.
-A third.

463
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:15,337
l realize this is a blow.

464
00:32:15,547 --> 00:32:18,277
ln my experience,
many fine marriages...

465
00:32:18,483 --> 00:32:21,350
...become unstable
and are destroyed...

466
00:32:21,553 --> 00:32:24,351
...by an inability to deal with this.

467
00:32:24,556 --> 00:32:28,356
l hope you won`t make too much of it.
One can adopt...

468
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:32,257
...and there are artificial
methods of fertilization.

469
00:32:32,697 --> 00:32:34,358
l`m so humiliated. l don`t--

470
00:32:34,566 --> 00:32:36,295
Did you ruin yourself?

471
00:32:36,501 --> 00:32:40,528
-How could l ruin myself?
-Excessive masturbation?

472
00:32:40,739 --> 00:32:45,335
You gonna knock my hobbies? Jesus.
Maybe we can adopt a child.

473
00:32:45,543 --> 00:32:48,774
-What about artificial insemination?
-What?

474
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:51,642
-l`d get implanted from--
-A stranger?

475
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:54,785
They have banks where they
keep them frozen.

476
00:32:54,986 --> 00:32:58,683
-A defrosted kid?
-l want to experience childbirth.

477
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:02,621
-With a stranger?
-Think about it. That`s all l ask.

478
00:33:02,827 --> 00:33:06,456
l think that`s the best show
you two ever wrote.

479
00:33:06,665 --> 00:33:10,931
The funniest show we did
was the one we won the Emmy for.

480
00:33:11,136 --> 00:33:13,070
l think as far as laughs...

481
00:33:13,271 --> 00:33:16,604
...that was probably
the best thing we ever did.

482
00:33:16,808 --> 00:33:21,142
But the show about the Frenchmen,
that was funny and warm.

483
00:33:21,346 --> 00:33:23,576
We got that idea on that Paris trip.

484
00:33:23,782 --> 00:33:27,445
Remember that?
Hannah had jet lag for six weeks.

485
00:33:27,652 --> 00:33:31,213
But it was-- l guess we had fun
when we were there.

486
00:33:31,423 --> 00:33:33,482
Sorry. Coffee?

487
00:33:33,692 --> 00:33:36,422
Listen, you guys, we-- Want some more?

488
00:33:36,628 --> 00:33:41,463
We had something we really
wanted to discuss with you.

489
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:44,191
Jesus, this is very delicate...

490
00:33:44,402 --> 00:33:47,235
...and l only bring this up
amongst friends.

491
00:33:47,439 --> 00:33:50,101
l mean, this is....

492
00:33:50,308 --> 00:33:53,038
This shouldn`t go
further than this room.

493
00:33:53,244 --> 00:33:54,643
l`m all ears.

494
00:33:56,948 --> 00:33:59,940
Hannah and l can`t have any children.

495
00:34:00,151 --> 00:34:04,144
l don`t want to get into whose fault
it is-- lt`s my fault.

496
00:34:04,356 --> 00:34:07,291
And the details are
too embarrassing to--

497
00:34:07,492 --> 00:34:10,359
We decided after
a lot of discussion...

498
00:34:10,562 --> 00:34:13,463
...that we`d try
artificial insemination.

499
00:34:13,665 --> 00:34:16,259
l`m not so sure
l like that idea myself.

500
00:34:16,468 --> 00:34:20,097
l didn`t really want
to go to a sperm bank...

501
00:34:20,305 --> 00:34:23,763
...have some anonymous donor.
l wouldn`t want that.

502
00:34:23,975 --> 00:34:27,843
lf we were gonna do it,
we`d like somebody we know...

503
00:34:28,046 --> 00:34:30,640
...and was warm and bright.

504
00:34:30,849 --> 00:34:35,809
You can say no. We realize it has
all kinds of implications.

505
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:39,547
The point we`re making
is that we need some sperm.

506
00:34:42,894 --> 00:34:44,259
Gee.

507
00:34:45,063 --> 00:34:48,794
Well, my first reaction
after the initial shock...

508
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,230
...is flattered that you`d ask.

509
00:34:51,436 --> 00:34:55,463
l`d be the father.
You`d just masturbate into a cup.

510
00:34:55,673 --> 00:34:56,662
l can handle that.

511
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:59,776
Obviously, we wouldn`t
have intercourse.

512
00:35:00,712 --> 00:35:04,739
Gosh, l`ve gotta tell you the truth.
l`m uneasy about this.

513
00:35:04,949 --> 00:35:06,280
lt`s a lot to ask.

514
00:35:06,484 --> 00:35:10,250
l feel for you, l do. l`m gonna cry.

515
00:35:10,455 --> 00:35:13,447
You want my husband
to have a child with you?

516
00:35:13,658 --> 00:35:15,216
Don`t answer now.

517
00:35:15,427 --> 00:35:19,056
Just take it home
and think about it for a while.

518
00:35:19,798 --> 00:35:24,497
l gave blood before,
and clothing to the poor.

519
00:35:24,702 --> 00:35:27,398
l wanna talk about this at home.

520
00:35:27,605 --> 00:35:31,097
l think it`s a matter
for your analyst and mine.

521
00:35:31,309 --> 00:35:32,901
And maybe my lawyer.

522
00:35:33,111 --> 00:35:35,477
We understand completely...

523
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,945
...if you feel you`d rather not.

524
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:43,610
l didn`t mean to spoil the evening.
Let`s move on.

525
00:35:44,522 --> 00:35:48,288
So you had my ex-partner`s baby.
Twins.

526
00:35:48,493 --> 00:35:53,021
Maybe that caused trouble,
but we were drifting apart anyhow.

527
00:35:53,231 --> 00:35:56,291
Instead of man and wife
we`re good friends.

528
00:35:56,501 --> 00:36:00,028
Boy, love is really unpredictable.

529
00:36:53,091 --> 00:36:56,083
Lee, Frederick,
say hello to Dusty Fry.

530
00:36:56,294 --> 00:36:57,659
-Hi, Dusty.
-Hi.

531
00:36:57,862 --> 00:37:01,696
He`s bought a house in Southampton.
He`s decorating it.

532
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,390
lt`s a weird place.

533
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:06,434
A lot of wall space.
How you doing, man?

534
00:37:06,638 --> 00:37:09,471
l told him about your work.
He`s excited.

535
00:37:09,674 --> 00:37:12,609
l got an Andy Warhol
and a Frank Stella.

536
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:16,268
lt`s very beautiful.
Big, weird, you know.

537
00:37:16,481 --> 00:37:20,611
lf you stare at that Stella,
the colors seem to float.

538
00:37:20,818 --> 00:37:23,218
You decided to become a collector?

539
00:37:23,421 --> 00:37:27,824
Yeah, l got a lot to learn, though.
l wasn`t into art as a kid.

540
00:37:28,026 --> 00:37:31,928
-Do you appreciate drawings?
-Yeah.

541
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:36,157
Oh, hey. Wow, she`s beautiful.

542
00:37:37,068 --> 00:37:41,368
But, really, l need something--
l`m looking for something big.

543
00:37:41,573 --> 00:37:44,508
-Show him the oils.
-They`re in the basement.

544
00:37:44,709 --> 00:37:47,735
Frederick`s done this
new series you`d love.

545
00:37:47,946 --> 00:37:50,414
-Are they big?
-Some of them, yeah.

546
00:37:50,615 --> 00:37:52,606
l got a lot of wall space.

547
00:37:52,817 --> 00:37:57,880
-l don`t sell my work by the yard.
-Oh, Frederick.

548
00:38:03,561 --> 00:38:04,994
How`s everything?

549
00:38:05,196 --> 00:38:08,825
Oh, you know.
l talked to Hannah this morning.

550
00:38:09,033 --> 00:38:11,558
You two might be going to the country.

551
00:38:11,769 --> 00:38:14,067
She loves to go out in the woods.

552
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,933
But l go nuts.

553
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,630
lt`s a conflict.

554
00:38:19,477 --> 00:38:23,277
-l have to get my teeth cleaned.
-That`s nice.

555
00:38:25,883 --> 00:38:29,751
-l figured l`d get them together.
-That`s really nice.

556
00:38:29,954 --> 00:38:34,721
This kid`s earned a trillion dollars.
He`s got six gold records.

557
00:38:34,926 --> 00:38:38,987
Oh, l bought that Mozart trio
you recommended.

558
00:38:39,197 --> 00:38:42,166
The man showed me another one
you`d love.

559
00:38:42,367 --> 00:38:45,768
lt`s another Bach, Second Movement.

560
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:47,232
-You have that one?
-Yeah.

561
00:38:47,438 --> 00:38:49,235
l would love to hear it.

562
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,002
Holly met a wonderful man
who loves opera, an architect.

563
00:38:54,212 --> 00:38:57,909
That`s nice. l`d love to see her
wind up settled.

564
00:38:58,116 --> 00:39:00,050
She`s a tense one.

565
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,460
lsn`t that beautiful?

566
00:39:11,663 --> 00:39:12,960
l know this.

567
00:39:13,431 --> 00:39:17,595
Bach F Minor Concerto.
lt`s one of my favorites.

568
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,900
Did you ever get around
to e.e. cummings?

569
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:28,772
Yes, he`s just adorable.

570
00:39:29,814 --> 00:39:34,114
They have a large gay clientele
where l get my teeth cleaned.

571
00:39:34,318 --> 00:39:38,414
All the hygienists now wear gloves.
They`re afraid of AlDS.

572
00:39:38,623 --> 00:39:39,715
Right.

573
00:39:43,127 --> 00:39:47,325
Did you ever get around
to the poem on page 1 1 2?

574
00:39:47,532 --> 00:39:51,969
Yes, it made me cry.
lt was so beautiful, so romantic.

575
00:39:53,638 --> 00:39:55,936
I want so badly to kiss her.

576
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:59,632
Not here. You`ve got to get
her alone someplace.

577
00:39:59,844 --> 00:40:04,975
But I`ve got to proceed cautiously.
This is a delicate situation.

578
00:40:05,183 --> 00:40:10,086
Ask her if you can see her
for lunch or a drink tomorrow.

579
00:40:10,288 --> 00:40:14,088
Make light of the offer
if she`s unresponsive.

580
00:40:14,292 --> 00:40:17,955
This has to be done
skillfully and diplomatically.

581
00:40:19,063 --> 00:40:21,224
Did you ever read this one?

582
00:40:22,734 --> 00:40:25,760
-Elliot, don`t!
-Lee, l`m in love with you!

583
00:40:27,705 --> 00:40:32,108
-What are you doing?
-l`m sorry, l have to talk to you.

584
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:34,938
l`ve been in love with you so long--

585
00:40:37,115 --> 00:40:39,345
l don`t have an interest
in selling it.

586
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:43,042
l ask for some puce,
you fly off the handle!

587
00:40:43,254 --> 00:40:46,417
l`m not interested in what
your decorator thinks.

588
00:40:46,624 --> 00:40:51,061
l can`t commit to anything
without consulting her first.

589
00:40:51,262 --> 00:40:55,323
You don`t buy paintings
to blend in with the sofa.

590
00:40:55,533 --> 00:40:58,502
lt`s not a sofa. lt`s an ottoman!

591
00:40:58,703 --> 00:41:02,298
God, forget it.
Let`s just get out of here.

592
00:41:03,241 --> 00:41:06,733
What a weirdo that guy is. Paranoid.

593
00:41:07,879 --> 00:41:10,313
-What`s the matter?
-l`ll be okay.

594
00:41:10,515 --> 00:41:14,042
-Not that big a deal.
-You go on ahead.

595
00:41:14,252 --> 00:41:15,651
You`re sweating.

596
00:41:15,853 --> 00:41:18,549
l just need fresh air.
Something l ate.

597
00:41:18,756 --> 00:41:22,192
l`ll walk, you go ahead. You go.

598
00:41:40,511 --> 00:41:43,378
Hello. Hello?

599
00:41:44,115 --> 00:41:45,343
Hello!

600
00:41:54,225 --> 00:41:55,920
l was looking for you.

601
00:41:56,127 --> 00:41:59,153
l must apologize. l`m so mixed-up.

602
00:41:59,363 --> 00:42:03,925
-How do you expect me to react?
-But l`m in love with you.

603
00:42:04,135 --> 00:42:07,195
-Don`t say those words.
-l know it`s terrible.

604
00:42:07,405 --> 00:42:10,431
-You know the situation.
-l know. l realize.

605
00:42:10,641 --> 00:42:14,543
-What do you expect?
-Hannah and l are in the last stages.

606
00:42:14,745 --> 00:42:17,714
She`s never said anything,
and we`re very close.

607
00:42:17,915 --> 00:42:21,681
She`s crazy about me,
but somewhere along the line...

608
00:42:21,886 --> 00:42:23,410
...l fell out of love.

609
00:42:23,621 --> 00:42:25,748
-Not because of me?
-No.

610
00:42:25,957 --> 00:42:27,049
Yes, l love you!

611
00:42:27,258 --> 00:42:30,250
l can`t be the cause
of anything between you--

612
00:42:30,461 --> 00:42:32,088
lt was inevitable.

613
00:42:32,296 --> 00:42:34,321
-Why?
-For a million reasons.

614
00:42:34,532 --> 00:42:35,556
But not over me?

615
00:42:35,766 --> 00:42:38,599
We were both going
in different directions.

616
00:42:38,803 --> 00:42:40,532
-Poor Hannah.
-How about you?

617
00:42:40,738 --> 00:42:44,765
Do you share any of my feelings,
or is this unpleasant?

618
00:42:44,976 --> 00:42:46,102
l can`t say.

619
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:48,870
Be candid.
l don`t want you to feel bad.

620
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:53,517
Yes, l have certain feelings for you.
Don`t make me say more.

621
00:42:53,718 --> 00:42:57,984
Okay, you`ve said enough.
l will work things out.

622
00:42:58,189 --> 00:43:01,818
Don`t do anything on my behalf.
Hannah and l are close.

623
00:43:02,026 --> 00:43:04,392
But you do care about me?

624
00:43:04,595 --> 00:43:09,623
l can`t be a party to this.
l`m racked with guilt talking to you.

625
00:43:09,834 --> 00:43:12,860
Your guilt is because
you feel the same.

626
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:16,198
l have to go.
l have to get my teeth cleaned.

627
00:43:17,141 --> 00:43:21,202
l have my answer. l have my answer.

628
00:43:21,412 --> 00:43:23,437
l`m walking on air.

629
00:43:41,132 --> 00:43:43,157
Hi. How`s she doing?

630
00:43:43,367 --> 00:43:46,461
She`s in the kitchen.
lt`s the same thing.

631
00:43:46,671 --> 00:43:49,640
She promises. lt`s all lies.

632
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:53,503
Don`t make it worse, Dad.
Hi, Mom. How you doing?

633
00:43:53,711 --> 00:43:57,477
Let me get you some coffee.
What triggered it?

634
00:43:57,682 --> 00:44:01,846
We were making a commercial.
There was this young salesman.

635
00:44:02,053 --> 00:44:06,581
Your mother was throwing herself
at him in a disgusting way.

636
00:44:06,791 --> 00:44:11,785
When she found she was too old
to seduce, that he was embarrassed--

637
00:44:11,996 --> 00:44:13,395
Liar!

638
00:44:13,597 --> 00:44:16,623
And at lunch she got
drunker and drunker.

639
00:44:16,834 --> 00:44:18,825
Finally, she became Joan Collins!

640
00:44:19,036 --> 00:44:23,132
All my life l`ve put up with insults
from this nonperson.

641
00:44:23,341 --> 00:44:26,902
This haircut that passes for a man.

642
00:44:27,111 --> 00:44:28,942
He could never support us.

643
00:44:29,146 --> 00:44:31,614
l`m glad we had a talented daughter.

644
00:44:31,816 --> 00:44:34,341
l can only hope that she was mine.

645
00:44:34,552 --> 00:44:38,318
With you as her mother,
her father could be any actor!

646
00:44:38,522 --> 00:44:41,082
She`s talented.
lt`s unlikely she`s yours.

647
00:44:41,292 --> 00:44:44,784
Dad, could you please stay
in the other room?

648
00:44:44,996 --> 00:44:49,990
You never know when she`s
gonna fall off the wagon.

649
00:44:50,201 --> 00:44:52,761
Here, Mom. Drink this.

650
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:56,030
You`re awful.
You probably were flirting.

651
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,641
No, l like to joke around
and have fun.

652
00:44:59,844 --> 00:45:02,438
He gets angry because
l get the attention.

653
00:45:02,646 --> 00:45:07,515
He`s gotten sour, and l`ve tried
to stay young at heart.

654
00:45:07,718 --> 00:45:09,845
You promised to stay on the wagon.

655
00:45:10,054 --> 00:45:12,284
The sacrifices l`ve made.

656
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:15,823
He`s ruined me with his ego,
his philandering...

657
00:45:16,027 --> 00:45:19,963
-...his mediocrity.
-Okay, stop being so dramatic.

658
00:45:20,164 --> 00:45:23,759
He`s the one that`s laid
every ingnue in stock!

659
00:45:24,769 --> 00:45:28,728
They wanted me for a screen test,
but he`d get up there...

660
00:45:28,939 --> 00:45:32,875
...and he`d flounder around
with his expensive haircuts...

661
00:45:33,077 --> 00:45:34,544
...and clothes.

662
00:45:34,745 --> 00:45:36,736
He`s all show!

663
00:45:36,947 --> 00:45:41,281
How could you act when there`s
nothing inside to come out?

664
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:57,129
She was so beautiful at one time,
and he was so dashing.

665
00:45:57,334 --> 00:46:02,567
Both of them just full of promise
and hopes that never materialized.

666
00:46:03,407 --> 00:46:06,535
And the fights
and the infidelities...

667
00:46:06,744 --> 00:46:11,772
... to prove themselves and blaming
each other. It`s so sad.

668
00:46:11,982 --> 00:46:16,749
They loved the idea of having us.
Raising us didn`t interest them.

669
00:46:16,954 --> 00:46:22,119
But it`s impossible to hold it
against them. They didn`t know.

670
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,528
Of all of us in the family...

671
00:46:25,729 --> 00:46:28,630
...you`re the one blessed
with the true gift.

672
00:46:28,833 --> 00:46:32,064
My true gift is luck.
l`ve had a lot of luck.

673
00:46:32,269 --> 00:46:36,763
From my first show. l thought Lee
was destined for great things.

674
00:46:36,974 --> 00:46:40,535
She`s lovely,
but she doesn`t have your spark.

675
00:46:40,744 --> 00:46:45,443
She knows it. She worships you.
She wouldn`t dare get up on stage.

676
00:46:45,649 --> 00:46:47,844
Now, Holly`s not shy.

677
00:46:48,052 --> 00:46:50,111
Holly`s game for anything.

678
00:46:50,321 --> 00:46:52,186
-Holly takes after me.
-True.

679
00:46:52,389 --> 00:46:54,755
l`d have been a great dope addict.

680
00:46:56,327 --> 00:46:58,124
Remember this, Hannah?

681
00:48:22,046 --> 00:48:25,482
Mr. Saxe, l`m afraid
the news is not good.

682
00:48:27,518 --> 00:48:30,316
lf l can show you
where the tumor is...

683
00:48:30,521 --> 00:48:34,218
...and why we feel that surgery
would be of no use.

684
00:48:35,226 --> 00:48:38,559
-See....
-It`s over.

685
00:48:38,762 --> 00:48:42,027
I`m face to face with eternity.

686
00:48:42,233 --> 00:48:45,134
Not later, but now.

687
00:48:45,336 --> 00:48:50,364
I`m so frightened, I can`t move
or speak or breathe.

688
00:48:52,543 --> 00:48:56,104
You`re just fine.
There`s nothing here at all.

689
00:48:56,313 --> 00:48:58,247
And your tests are all fine.

690
00:48:59,783 --> 00:49:03,776
l admit, l was concerned,
given your symptoms.

691
00:49:03,988 --> 00:49:07,048
What caused this hearing loss,
we`ll never know.

692
00:49:07,258 --> 00:49:10,455
But whatever it was,
it`s not anything serious.

693
00:49:10,661 --> 00:49:12,128
l`m very relieved.

694
00:49:29,513 --> 00:49:34,109
What do you mean, you`re quitting?
Why? The news is good.

695
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:36,980
You don`t have cancer-- The thing.

696
00:49:37,187 --> 00:49:40,452
Do you realize what a thread
we`re hanging by?

697
00:49:40,658 --> 00:49:43,149
You`re off the hook.
Celebrate!

698
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:47,228
Can you understand
how meaningless everything is?

699
00:49:47,431 --> 00:49:50,264
Our lives, the show, the whole world.

700
00:49:50,467 --> 00:49:52,128
But you`re not dying.

701
00:49:52,336 --> 00:49:55,669
l`m not now.
When l ran out of the hospital...

702
00:49:55,873 --> 00:50:00,367
...l was so thrilled. l`m
running down the street and then...

703
00:50:00,577 --> 00:50:05,412
...it hit me. So l`m not gonna
go today, not tomorrow...

704
00:50:05,616 --> 00:50:08,084
...but eventually l`m going to.

705
00:50:08,285 --> 00:50:10,253
You`re realizing this now?

706
00:50:10,454 --> 00:50:14,857
l know it all the time,
but stick it in the back of my mind.

707
00:50:15,059 --> 00:50:20,190
lt`s a horrible thing to think about.
Can l tell you something?

708
00:50:20,397 --> 00:50:23,423
-Yes, please.
-A week ago l bought a rifle.

709
00:50:23,634 --> 00:50:27,365
lf l had a tumor,
l was gonna kill myself.

710
00:50:27,571 --> 00:50:29,562
The thing that might`ve stopped me:

711
00:50:29,773 --> 00:50:31,968
My parents would be devastated.

712
00:50:32,176 --> 00:50:36,806
l would`ve had to shoot them also.
And my aunt and uncle.

713
00:50:37,014 --> 00:50:41,280
Well, eventually, it is going
to happen to all of us.

714
00:50:41,485 --> 00:50:44,249
But doesn`t that ruin
everything for you?

715
00:50:44,455 --> 00:50:47,618
lt takes the pleasure away.
You`ll die...

716
00:50:47,825 --> 00:50:50,760
...l`ll die, the audience,
the network--

717
00:50:50,961 --> 00:50:53,088
-l know, and your hamster.
-Yes.

718
00:50:53,297 --> 00:50:56,562
Listen, kid,
l think you snapped your cap.

719
00:50:56,767 --> 00:51:01,136
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda.
Or go to a whorehouse.

720
00:51:01,338 --> 00:51:03,306
l can`t stay on. l need answers.

721
00:51:03,507 --> 00:51:07,375
Otherwise, l`m gonna
do something drastic.

722
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:29,891
-l thought you weren`t coming.
-l almost didn`t.

723
00:51:31,034 --> 00:51:34,595
-l didn`t sleep all night.
-No, l`m sure.

724
00:51:35,372 --> 00:51:38,535
What`re we doing in a hotel room?
lt`s terrible.

725
00:51:38,742 --> 00:51:41,677
l couldn`t think where to invite you.

726
00:51:41,879 --> 00:51:45,679
l didn`t want this to happen
till you were living alone.

727
00:51:45,883 --> 00:51:47,612
l was so torn when you called.

728
00:51:47,818 --> 00:51:52,016
l wanted to call every day
since l told you how l felt.

729
00:51:52,222 --> 00:51:54,713
l resisted so many times.

730
00:51:57,261 --> 00:51:59,320
Don`t think badly of me.

731
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:04,067
This is not an easy situation.

732
00:52:04,268 --> 00:52:06,099
l know it isn`t.

733
00:52:23,353 --> 00:52:25,753
That was just perfect.

734
00:52:26,557 --> 00:52:28,855
You`ve ruined me for anyone else.

735
00:52:29,059 --> 00:52:31,721
l don`t want anyone else to have you.

736
00:52:33,263 --> 00:52:35,891
l worried l wouldn`t
compare with Hannah.

737
00:52:36,099 --> 00:52:37,498
Oh, my God!

738
00:52:37,701 --> 00:52:42,138
-You really do have those thoughts?
-All the time.

739
00:52:42,339 --> 00:52:44,773
She must be a passionate person.

740
00:52:44,975 --> 00:52:47,273
Yes, she`s very warm and giving.

741
00:52:47,478 --> 00:52:50,038
But l want to be giving to you.

742
00:52:50,247 --> 00:52:52,738
l wanna do things for you.

743
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:55,316
Hannah doesn`t need me as much.

744
00:52:56,487 --> 00:52:59,888
l`m being presumptuous.
Not that you need me.

745
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:02,820
l want you to take care of me.

746
00:53:03,794 --> 00:53:06,729
And l love when you do things to me.

747
00:53:35,993 --> 00:53:37,324
You`re late.

748
00:53:37,528 --> 00:53:40,895
l didn`t realize how late
it had gotten.

749
00:53:42,165 --> 00:53:45,999
You missed a very dull TV show
about Auschwitz.

750
00:53:46,203 --> 00:53:47,898
More gruesome film clips.

751
00:53:48,105 --> 00:53:51,973
And more intellectuals
declaring their mystification...

752
00:53:52,175 --> 00:53:54,973
...over the systematic murder
of millions.

753
00:53:55,178 --> 00:53:57,578
They can never answer the question:

754
00:53:57,781 --> 00:54:01,217
``How could it happen?``
lt`s the wrong question.

755
00:54:01,418 --> 00:54:05,445
The question is: ``Why doesn`t
it happen more often?``

756
00:54:05,656 --> 00:54:07,521
Of course, it does.

757
00:54:07,724 --> 00:54:10,022
l have a headache from this weather.

758
00:54:14,131 --> 00:54:17,259
lt`s been ages since l sat
in front of the TV...

759
00:54:17,467 --> 00:54:20,197
...changing channels
to find something.

760
00:54:20,404 --> 00:54:22,372
You see the whole culture:

761
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:23,897
Nazis...

762
00:54:24,107 --> 00:54:25,972
...deodorant salesmen...

763
00:54:26,176 --> 00:54:27,438
...wrestlers...

764
00:54:27,644 --> 00:54:29,839
...beauty contests, the talk show.

765
00:54:30,147 --> 00:54:33,913
Can you imagine the mind
that watches wrestling?

766
00:54:34,117 --> 00:54:37,416
But the worst are
the fundamentalist preachers.

767
00:54:37,621 --> 00:54:39,145
Third-rate con men...

768
00:54:39,356 --> 00:54:42,848
...telling the suckers
that they speak for Jesus...

769
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:46,359
...and to please send in money.
Money, money.

770
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:50,962
lf Jesus came back and saw
what`s going on in his name...

771
00:54:51,168 --> 00:54:52,499
...he`d throw up.

772
00:54:52,703 --> 00:54:55,263
Frederick, could you please
lighten up?

773
00:54:55,472 --> 00:54:59,966
l`m not in the mood to hear
a review of contemporary society.

774
00:55:01,178 --> 00:55:02,805
You`ve been nervous lately.

775
00:55:03,013 --> 00:55:04,742
l can`t take this anymore.

776
00:55:04,948 --> 00:55:08,076
l`m only completing
an education l started.

777
00:55:08,285 --> 00:55:10,617
l`m not your pupil. l was.

778
00:55:10,821 --> 00:55:14,348
When you leave the nest,
l want you to be ready.

779
00:55:14,558 --> 00:55:17,721
-We have to make some changes.
-Like what?

780
00:55:17,928 --> 00:55:21,523
-You know. l`m suffocating.
-This conversation again?

781
00:55:21,732 --> 00:55:26,669
Yes, this conversation again.
l have to leave, l have to move out.

782
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:29,270
-Why?
-Because l have to.

783
00:55:29,473 --> 00:55:31,373
What`ll you use for money?

784
00:55:31,575 --> 00:55:35,033
l thought maybe l`d move
in with my parents.

785
00:55:35,245 --> 00:55:37,907
l always told you you would leave me.

786
00:55:38,115 --> 00:55:40,083
Does it have to be now?

787
00:55:40,283 --> 00:55:43,411
Maybe it`ll be temporary.
But l have to try.

788
00:55:44,554 --> 00:55:47,489
Lee, you`re my whole world.

789
00:55:50,394 --> 00:55:53,886
Good God.
Have you been kissed tonight?

790
00:55:54,665 --> 00:55:57,395
Yes, you have.
You`ve been with someone!

791
00:55:57,601 --> 00:55:59,068
Stop accusing me!

792
00:55:59,269 --> 00:56:01,533
l`m too smart. You can`t fool me!

793
00:56:01,738 --> 00:56:03,399
-You`re turning red!
-Leave me!

794
00:56:03,607 --> 00:56:06,474
Oh, Christ! What`s wrong with you?

795
00:56:09,112 --> 00:56:10,409
l`m sorry.

796
00:56:10,614 --> 00:56:13,276
Couldn`t you say something?
You slither--

797
00:56:13,483 --> 00:56:15,451
l`m saying it now!

798
00:56:15,652 --> 00:56:17,517
So you met somebody else?

799
00:56:18,722 --> 00:56:22,249
Yeah. You knew that was going
to happen sooner or later.

800
00:56:22,459 --> 00:56:25,292
-l can`t live like this.
-Who is it?

801
00:56:25,495 --> 00:56:28,953
-lt`s just somebody l met.
-Where did you meet him?

802
00:56:29,166 --> 00:56:31,862
lt doesn`t matter. l have to move out.

803
00:56:32,069 --> 00:56:34,503
You`re my connection to the world.

804
00:56:34,705 --> 00:56:38,573
That`s too much responsibility for me.
lt`s not fair.

805
00:56:38,775 --> 00:56:40,743
l want a less complicated life.

806
00:56:40,944 --> 00:56:43,640
l want a child, before it`s too late.

807
00:56:43,847 --> 00:56:45,974
Jesus. Jesus!

808
00:56:46,183 --> 00:56:48,913
Oh, God, l don`t even
know what l want.

809
00:56:51,722 --> 00:56:55,089
What do you get out of me, anyway?
l mean....

810
00:56:56,593 --> 00:56:59,255
lt`s not sexual anymore.

811
00:56:59,930 --> 00:57:04,060
lt`s certainly not intellectual.
You`re so superior to me.

812
00:57:04,267 --> 00:57:06,235
Don`t patronize me!

813
00:57:07,404 --> 00:57:12,740
God! l should have married you
years ago when you wanted to.

814
00:57:12,943 --> 00:57:13,967
l should`ve agreed.

815
00:57:14,177 --> 00:57:17,271
Don`t you know?
lt never would`ve worked.

816
00:57:18,882 --> 00:57:22,409
l told you one day you`d leave
me for a younger man.

817
00:57:33,864 --> 00:57:36,196
What passion today with Lee!

818
00:57:36,399 --> 00:57:38,526
She`s a volcano.

819
00:57:38,735 --> 00:57:41,067
It was totally fulfilling...

820
00:57:41,271 --> 00:57:43,068
...just as I`d dreamed it`d be.

821
00:57:43,273 --> 00:57:44,535
That`s what it was.

822
00:57:44,741 --> 00:57:48,438
It was like living out a dream,
a great dream.

823
00:57:49,112 --> 00:57:52,707
Now I feel very good and cozy
next to Hannah.

824
00:57:52,916 --> 00:57:55,407
Hannah is very real and lovely.

825
00:57:55,619 --> 00:57:59,953
She gives me a very deep feeling
of being part of something.

826
00:58:00,157 --> 00:58:04,184
She`s a wonderful woman,
and I betrayed her.

827
00:58:04,394 --> 00:58:06,885
She changed my empty life...

828
00:58:07,097 --> 00:58:10,828
...and I paid her back
by banging her sister.

829
00:58:11,034 --> 00:58:14,868
God, I`m despicable!
What a cruel and shallow act.

830
00:58:15,071 --> 00:58:17,665
I have to tell her
what we did was crazy.

831
00:58:17,874 --> 00:58:21,935
It can`t ever happen again.
I value Hannah too much.

832
00:58:22,145 --> 00:58:25,945
I love my wife. Now I betrayed her.
Oh, God!

833
00:58:26,216 --> 00:58:27,444
Where are you going?

834
00:58:27,651 --> 00:58:31,951
l`ve gotta get a phone number.
l forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.

835
00:58:32,155 --> 00:58:34,953
-lt`s late.
-Yes, l can`t believe l forgot.

836
00:58:35,859 --> 00:58:37,326
What if he answers?

837
00:58:37,527 --> 00:58:38,824
l`ll hang up.

838
00:58:39,029 --> 00:58:42,328
l`ll say we can`t communicate
until l`m divorced.

839
00:58:42,532 --> 00:58:45,057
lt`s immoral. Then time will pass...

840
00:58:45,268 --> 00:58:47,668
...l won`t call,
and she`ll understand.

841
00:58:47,871 --> 00:58:50,931
l`ve gotta stop
before l get in too deep.

842
00:58:51,208 --> 00:58:54,666
l`d rather hurt Lee a little
than destroy Hannah.

843
00:58:54,878 --> 00:58:55,902
lt`s 1 :30.

844
00:58:56,112 --> 00:58:59,912
She can`t have a conversation
with me, with him around.

845
00:59:00,116 --> 00:59:01,879
l`m getting hysterical.

846
00:59:02,085 --> 00:59:04,417
l`ll call her in the morning.

847
00:59:04,688 --> 00:59:06,246
l`ll call her at 6:00.

848
00:59:06,456 --> 00:59:08,856
Frederick goes jogging at 6:00.

849
00:59:09,059 --> 00:59:12,392
She`ll be alone. l`ll call
and nip it in the bud.

850
00:59:12,662 --> 00:59:14,823
l`ve got it! l`ve got it!

851
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:18,790
Mel!

852
00:59:19,035 --> 00:59:22,402
l`d have hung up
if you hadn`t answered...

853
00:59:22,606 --> 00:59:24,574
...but l had to tell you...

854
00:59:24,774 --> 00:59:28,642
...l feel very close to you
tonight. Very, very close.

855
00:59:28,845 --> 00:59:30,506
Good night.

856
00:59:44,194 --> 00:59:48,096
Millions of books written
on every conceivable subject...

857
00:59:48,298 --> 00:59:49,925
...by all these great minds...

858
00:59:50,133 --> 00:59:52,931
...but none of them
knows anything more...

859
00:59:53,136 --> 00:59:56,071
...about the big questions
of life than I do.

860
00:59:56,273 --> 00:59:58,104
I read Socrates.

861
00:59:58,308 --> 01:00:01,334
He used to knock off
little Greek boys.

862
01:00:01,544 --> 01:00:03,978
What the hell`s
he got to teach me?

863
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:07,946
And Nietzsche, with his theory
of eternal recurrence.

864
01:00:08,151 --> 01:00:11,848
He said the life we live,
we`ll live over and over...

865
01:00:12,055 --> 01:00:14,216
... the same way for eternity.

866
01:00:14,424 --> 01:00:18,155
Great. I`ll have to sit
through the lce-Capades again.

867
01:00:18,361 --> 01:00:19,988
It`s not worth it.

868
01:00:20,196 --> 01:00:22,630
And Freud, another great pessimist.

869
01:00:22,832 --> 01:00:26,199
I was in analysis for years.
Nothing happened.

870
01:00:26,403 --> 01:00:28,633
My poor analyst
got so frustrated...

871
01:00:28,838 --> 01:00:31,636
... the guy finally put in
a salad bar.

872
01:00:31,841 --> 01:00:33,638
Look at these people jogging...

873
01:00:33,843 --> 01:00:37,643
... trying to stave off
the inevitable decay of the body.

874
01:00:37,847 --> 01:00:40,315
It`s so sad
what people go through...

875
01:00:40,517 --> 01:00:43,611
...with their stationary bike
and their exercise--

876
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:46,846
Oh, look at this one. Poor thing.

877
01:00:47,057 --> 01:00:49,525
She has to tote all that fat around.

878
01:00:49,726 --> 01:00:52,490
She should pull it on a dolly.

879
01:00:52,696 --> 01:00:56,359
Maybe the poets are right.
Maybe love is the answer.

880
01:00:56,566 --> 01:00:59,865
I was in love with Hannah.
That didn`t work out.

881
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:02,368
I even took her sister out. Remember?

882
01:01:02,572 --> 01:01:05,370
Years ago when
Hannah and I got divorced...

883
01:01:05,575 --> 01:01:08,237
...and she fixed me up
with her sister?

884
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:41,707
-Why are you making those faces?
-l can`t hear anything.

885
01:01:41,911 --> 01:01:45,278
-l`m gonna lose hearing.
-You`re witnessing genius.

886
01:01:45,482 --> 01:01:49,350
My ears are in a meltdown.
l can`t hear anything.

887
01:01:49,552 --> 01:01:52,350
Can`t you feel the tangible energy?

888
01:01:52,555 --> 01:01:55,683
-The positive vibrations!
-l`m frightened.

889
01:01:55,892 --> 01:01:58,190
They`re gonna take hostages.

890
01:01:58,395 --> 01:02:01,296
Let`s-- Don`t-- No, please.

891
01:02:01,498 --> 01:02:05,298
-You want some? Come on.
-You`ve been doing that all night.

892
01:02:05,502 --> 01:02:08,335
You`re gonna develop a third nostril.

893
01:02:08,538 --> 01:02:09,664
Don`t. Please.

894
01:02:09,873 --> 01:02:12,433
-Can we go?
-No.

895
01:02:18,081 --> 01:02:21,278
Don`t you love songs
about extraterrestrials?

896
01:02:21,484 --> 01:02:23,509
Not when they`re sung by them.

897
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:27,952
We can`t communicate. l never
knew you were such a tight-ass.

898
01:02:28,158 --> 01:02:31,685
Your sisters have good taste.
Where`d you go wrong?

899
01:02:31,895 --> 01:02:33,795
l`m my own person.

900
01:02:33,997 --> 01:02:37,489
-Can we go hear something nice?
-lt`s getting late.

901
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:38,997
You`re being angry.

902
01:02:39,202 --> 01:02:44,162
l`m not angry, but you don`t like
rock music, you won`t get high....

903
01:02:44,374 --> 01:02:46,342
lt`s like dating Cardinal Cooke.

904
01:03:53,143 --> 01:03:54,269
What a swell time.

905
01:03:54,477 --> 01:03:57,776
You didn`t have to talk
while he was singing.

906
01:03:57,981 --> 01:04:01,144
-l was so bored.
-You don`t deserve Cole Porter.

907
01:04:01,351 --> 01:04:03,876
Stay with groups
that`d stab their moms.

908
01:04:04,087 --> 01:04:08,786
-l`m open to new concepts.
-And you snort so much cocaine!

909
01:04:08,992 --> 01:04:13,793
-Do you carry a kilo around?
-This crowd was too embalmed to know.

910
01:04:13,997 --> 01:04:18,161
l`m glad Hannah got us together.
She`s got great instincts.

911
01:04:18,368 --> 01:04:20,859
l`m sorry. lt`s probably my fault.

912
01:04:21,070 --> 01:04:22,503
l`ve been depressed.

913
01:04:22,705 --> 01:04:25,868
l had fun. lt was like
the Nuremberg Trials.

914
01:04:26,075 --> 01:04:28,509
l`ll see myself home!

915
01:04:30,413 --> 01:04:32,779
Yep, it was quite an evening.

916
01:04:32,982 --> 01:04:34,643
Holly with her cocaine.

917
01:04:34,851 --> 01:04:38,981
She should`ve been wearing
a gold shovel around her neck.

918
01:04:39,189 --> 01:04:43,125
She was polymorphously
insensitive, I think.

919
01:04:43,326 --> 01:04:44,918
Too bad too.

920
01:04:45,695 --> 01:04:48,858
I always had a little crush on her.

921
01:05:22,599 --> 01:05:26,467
Read the instructions.
You set one of these and you can...

922
01:05:26,669 --> 01:05:28,330
...take pictures underwater.

923
01:05:28,538 --> 01:05:30,972
We`ll try it in the lake.

924
01:05:31,174 --> 01:05:34,143
-Can l try?
-Yeah. Okay.

925
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:44,950
Are you in a bad mood?

926
01:05:45,188 --> 01:05:47,850
l don`t know. l`m just antsy.

927
01:05:48,057 --> 01:05:51,117
The last few weeks,
you haven`t been yourself.

928
01:05:51,327 --> 01:05:54,490
And tonight at dinner,
you were curt with me.

929
01:05:54,697 --> 01:05:56,665
-Was l?
-Yes, you were.

930
01:05:56,866 --> 01:05:59,699
When l brought up the idea
of having a baby...

931
01:05:59,902 --> 01:06:01,392
...you jumped down my throat.

932
01:06:01,604 --> 01:06:04,596
-l don`t think it`s a good idea.
-Why not?

933
01:06:04,807 --> 01:06:07,401
lt`s the last thing we need right now.

934
01:06:08,244 --> 01:06:10,439
Why? ls there something wrong?

935
01:06:10,647 --> 01:06:13,514
-l don`t know.
-Should l be worried?

936
01:06:13,716 --> 01:06:15,775
Well, you got four children.

937
01:06:15,985 --> 01:06:17,680
l want one with you.

938
01:06:17,887 --> 01:06:21,880
l think we should wait
till things settle.

939
01:06:22,091 --> 01:06:24,184
What does that mean?

940
01:06:24,394 --> 01:06:27,852
We`ve been married four years.
How settled can it get?

941
01:06:28,064 --> 01:06:31,898
You have set plans on how
your life should be structured:

942
01:06:32,101 --> 01:06:35,730
A house, kids, certain schools,
a home in Connecticut.

943
01:06:35,938 --> 01:06:38,236
lt`s all very preconceived.

944
01:06:38,441 --> 01:06:41,740
Yeah, but l--
l thought you needed that.

945
01:06:41,944 --> 01:06:44,310
You said your life was chaos.

946
01:06:44,514 --> 01:06:47,745
But there`s got to be
some give and take.

947
01:06:47,950 --> 01:06:51,386
l don`t know what the hell
l`m talking about.

948
01:06:52,121 --> 01:06:54,453
-Are you angry with me?
-No.

949
01:06:54,657 --> 01:06:58,218
Do you feel--? Are you disenchanted
with our marriage?

950
01:06:58,428 --> 01:06:59,486
l didn`t say that.

951
01:06:59,696 --> 01:07:01,254
ls there someone else?

952
01:07:01,464 --> 01:07:04,160
What is this? The Gestapo? No.

953
01:07:04,867 --> 01:07:06,664
What are you not telling me?

954
01:07:06,869 --> 01:07:07,995
What kind of--?

955
01:07:08,204 --> 01:07:10,798
Supposing l said l am disenchanted.

956
01:07:11,007 --> 01:07:13,669
-l am in love with someone else.
-Are you?

957
01:07:13,910 --> 01:07:15,104
No.

958
01:07:15,311 --> 01:07:20,214
You keep asking these questions.
lt`s like you want me to say yes.

959
01:07:20,416 --> 01:07:24,147
What are you saying?
Of course not. l`d be destroyed.

960
01:07:24,354 --> 01:07:27,221
For chrissake,
stop torturing her.

961
01:07:27,423 --> 01:07:30,153
Say you want out
and get it over with.

962
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:31,827
You love her sister.

963
01:07:32,028 --> 01:07:34,155
You didn`t do it on purpose.

964
01:07:34,364 --> 01:07:37,265
Be honest. It`s always the best way.

965
01:07:37,467 --> 01:07:39,935
Can l help you?

966
01:07:40,169 --> 01:07:43,900
lf you`re suffering over something,
share it with me.

967
01:07:46,409 --> 01:07:48,502
You know how much l love you.

968
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:54,309
l should have my head examined.
l don`t deserve you.

969
01:08:01,724 --> 01:08:06,252
l wanna look good, but l don`t
want to be overdressed.

970
01:08:06,462 --> 01:08:11,195
-How about this?
-l think it`s a pretty color on you.

971
01:08:11,401 --> 01:08:14,666
Ever think you`d see me
going to the opera?

972
01:08:14,871 --> 01:08:16,998
lt`s great. l want to meet him.

973
01:08:17,206 --> 01:08:21,540
He`s married. And
his wife`s schizophrenic.

974
01:08:21,744 --> 01:08:24,542
Sometimes she just breaks down.

975
01:08:24,747 --> 01:08:27,739
When his daughter
goes to college next year...

976
01:08:27,950 --> 01:08:29,747
...he`ll split permanently.

977
01:08:29,952 --> 01:08:33,410
His wife helped put him through
architecture school.

978
01:08:33,623 --> 01:08:35,887
You found all this out on one date?

979
01:08:36,092 --> 01:08:39,357
l think he was dying to open up.
lt`s so sad.

980
01:08:39,562 --> 01:08:42,531
Now, what should l wear
to my audition?

981
01:08:42,732 --> 01:08:45,462
l`ve got an audition
for a Broadway musical.

982
01:08:45,668 --> 01:08:46,794
l`ll never get it.

983
01:08:47,003 --> 01:08:49,801
-Singing?
-Can you believe it?

984
01:08:50,206 --> 01:08:53,573
l mean, why not?
What have l got to lose?

985
01:08:53,776 --> 01:08:55,107
No, l just--

986
01:08:55,311 --> 01:08:58,405
No, l didn`t know you sang.

987
01:08:58,848 --> 01:09:02,011
You think everybody in musicals
sings well?

988
01:09:02,218 --> 01:09:05,244
No, it`s just that they sing.

989
01:09:05,455 --> 01:09:07,480
Well, you know.

990
01:09:08,791 --> 01:09:11,282
l sing a little. l mean, you know.

991
01:09:11,494 --> 01:09:13,519
l know. No, l know.

992
01:09:14,163 --> 01:09:16,188
Don`t say it that way.

993
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:19,960
-Confidence isn`t my strong point.
-l didn`t mean that.

994
01:09:20,169 --> 01:09:23,935
l think l can fake my way
through a song. Easily.

995
01:09:26,309 --> 01:09:29,836
-Why? You don`t think it`s realistic?
-No, l didn`t-- No.

996
01:09:30,046 --> 01:09:34,449
No, l just hate to see you
put yourself in a position...

997
01:09:34,650 --> 01:09:35,912
...where you get hurt.

998
01:09:36,118 --> 01:09:38,348
You take every single rejection...

999
01:09:38,554 --> 01:09:42,081
...as confirmation
that you have no talent.

1000
01:09:42,291 --> 01:09:44,816
-Well, maybe l`ll get it.
-l hope.

1001
01:09:45,027 --> 01:09:46,460
Boy...

1002
01:09:46,662 --> 01:09:49,130
-...you know how to cut me down.
-What?

1003
01:09:49,332 --> 01:09:51,266
Can`t l say anything?

1004
01:09:51,467 --> 01:09:54,834
l sing. For chrissake,
you heard me sing!

1005
01:09:55,037 --> 01:09:56,402
Okay, l--

1006
01:09:56,606 --> 01:09:59,905
What happened?
We were having a nice time...

1007
01:10:00,109 --> 01:10:03,237
...and suddenly everything
went to bad feeling.

1008
01:10:03,446 --> 01:10:05,971
Nobody but you can do that to me.

1009
01:10:06,182 --> 01:10:09,310
Look, everything`s going your way.

1010
01:10:10,253 --> 01:10:11,686
You`re right.

1011
01:10:11,988 --> 01:10:13,580
l`m happy.

1012
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:18,390
Why must l let my insecurities
spoil everything?

1013
01:11:02,238 --> 01:11:04,138
-Thank you very much.
-Thanks.

1014
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:06,331
-Very nice.
-Terrific.

1015
01:11:07,009 --> 01:11:08,704
April Knox.

1016
01:11:39,075 --> 01:11:41,771
You sounded great.
You may be surprised.

1017
01:11:41,978 --> 01:11:45,243
l`m just glad we have
a catering job this week.

1018
01:11:45,448 --> 01:11:49,316
We have Mr. Levine`s 80th
birthday on Riverside Drive.

1019
01:11:49,518 --> 01:11:52,487
Or the chapel,
depending on his health.

1020
01:11:52,688 --> 01:11:55,179
Listen. David called me up.

1021
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:58,417
-What?
-David called me last night.

1022
01:11:58,628 --> 01:12:00,994
He wants to take me
to the opera.

1023
01:12:01,197 --> 01:12:02,789
l didn`t know what to say.

1024
01:12:02,999 --> 01:12:04,023
You`re joking.

1025
01:12:04,233 --> 01:12:06,428
No, he called late last night.

1026
01:12:08,871 --> 01:12:10,498
l`m very surprised.

1027
01:12:10,706 --> 01:12:13,300
He wants to take me
to see Rigoletto.

1028
01:12:13,509 --> 01:12:15,374
And you`re going.

1029
01:12:15,578 --> 01:12:18,911
l didn`t know what to say.
At first l said no.

1030
01:12:19,215 --> 01:12:23,652
He said he`d taken you once,
and he really wanted to invite me.

1031
01:12:25,021 --> 01:12:28,286
-But l`m seeing him.
-l know. l said that...

1032
01:12:28,491 --> 01:12:31,892
...but he said he really
wanted to do it.

1033
01:12:35,498 --> 01:12:37,363
l don`t know what to say.

1034
01:12:37,633 --> 01:12:42,570
lt`s just an evening at the opera.
Did l do wrong in accepting?

1035
01:12:49,612 --> 01:12:53,514
Why would you like to
convert to Catholicism?

1036
01:12:53,716 --> 01:12:58,244
l have to believe in something
or else life is just meaningless.

1037
01:12:58,454 --> 01:13:00,752
But why did you make
the decision...

1038
01:13:00,956 --> 01:13:03,254
...to choose the Catholic faith?

1039
01:13:03,793 --> 01:13:07,456
First of all, because it`s
a very beautiful religion.

1040
01:13:07,663 --> 01:13:09,893
lt`s strong and well-structured.

1041
01:13:10,099 --> 01:13:14,399
l`m talking about the against
school prayer, pro-abortion wing.

1042
01:13:14,603 --> 01:13:16,730
So you don`t believe in God?

1043
01:13:16,939 --> 01:13:18,770
No, and l want to.

1044
01:13:18,974 --> 01:13:21,966
l`ll do anything.
l`ll dye Easter eggs.

1045
01:13:22,178 --> 01:13:25,341
l need some evidence.
l gotta have proof.

1046
01:13:25,548 --> 01:13:28,517
lf l can`t believe,
life isn`t worth living.

1047
01:13:28,718 --> 01:13:30,515
lt`s a very big leap.

1048
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:32,847
Yes, well, can you help me?

1049
01:13:35,624 --> 01:13:38,593
l don`t understand.
l thought you`d be happy.

1050
01:13:38,794 --> 01:13:40,284
How can we be happy?

1051
01:13:40,496 --> 01:13:43,590
Because l`m giving God
serious thought.

1052
01:13:43,799 --> 01:13:49,135
-Catholicism? Why not your own people?
-l got off on the wrong foot there.

1053
01:13:49,338 --> 01:13:51,033
l need a dramatic change.

1054
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:55,040
-You`ll believe in Jesus Christ?
-l`m gonna try.

1055
01:13:55,244 --> 01:13:58,645
-We raised you as a Jew.
-l was born that way--

1056
01:13:58,848 --> 01:14:01,874
-l`m older now.
-But why Jesus Christ?

1057
01:14:02,084 --> 01:14:04,109
Why not become a Buddhist?

1058
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:06,220
That`s totally alien to me.

1059
01:14:06,422 --> 01:14:08,652
Aren`t you afraid of dying?

1060
01:14:08,858 --> 01:14:10,155
Why be afraid?

1061
01:14:10,359 --> 01:14:11,917
-You won`t exist.
-So?

1062
01:14:12,128 --> 01:14:16,531
-That doesn`t terrify you?
-l`m alive. When l`m dead, l`m dead.

1063
01:14:16,732 --> 01:14:18,359
Aren`t you frightened?

1064
01:14:18,567 --> 01:14:21,764
-l`ll be unconscious.
-But never to exist again?

1065
01:14:21,971 --> 01:14:24,804
-How do you know?
-lt doesn`t look promising.

1066
01:14:25,007 --> 01:14:26,497
Who knows what`ll be?

1067
01:14:26,709 --> 01:14:29,269
l`ll either be unconscious,
or l won`t.

1068
01:14:29,478 --> 01:14:32,743
lf not, l`ll deal with it then.
l won`t worry now.

1069
01:14:32,948 --> 01:14:34,074
Mom, come out.

1070
01:14:34,283 --> 01:14:38,481
Of course there`s a God, you idiot.
You don`t believe in God?

1071
01:14:38,687 --> 01:14:41,622
Then why is there so much evil
in the world?

1072
01:14:41,824 --> 01:14:44,486
On a simple level,
why were there Nazis?

1073
01:14:44,693 --> 01:14:45,853
Tell him, Max.

1074
01:14:46,061 --> 01:14:50,430
How the hell do l know?
l don`t know how the can opener works.

1075
01:16:14,717 --> 01:16:19,177
-Hi. Where`s Holly?
-She`s auditioning for a commercial.

1076
01:16:19,388 --> 01:16:23,722
-How`s she doing?
-You know Holly when she`s depressed.

1077
01:16:23,926 --> 01:16:26,258
lt`s good that we
invited her to lunch.

1078
01:16:26,462 --> 01:16:28,157
Tell her it was your idea.

1079
01:16:28,364 --> 01:16:31,458
When l try to help,
she gets defensive.

1080
01:16:31,667 --> 01:16:34,693
She`s just embarrassed
in front of you.

1081
01:16:34,904 --> 01:16:36,735
-So how are you?
-l`m okay.

1082
01:16:36,939 --> 01:16:38,531
Do you miss Frederick?

1083
01:16:38,741 --> 01:16:41,608
Elliot and l must know
someone for you.

1084
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:45,541
How are you?
How`s Frederick--? l mean Elliot?

1085
01:16:45,748 --> 01:16:47,807
He`s fine. l guess he`s fine.

1086
01:16:48,017 --> 01:16:52,920
He`s been moody the last few months.
l don`t know what it is.

1087
01:16:53,122 --> 01:16:54,419
He`s kind of distant.

1088
01:16:54,623 --> 01:16:57,319
l try talking--
He says everything`s fine.

1089
01:16:57,526 --> 01:17:00,290
Automatically, l think the worst.

1090
01:17:00,496 --> 01:17:03,954
-He`s seeing someone else.
-No, everyone thinks that.

1091
01:17:04,166 --> 01:17:08,899
l just came from an audition which
l did not get. So what`s new?

1092
01:17:09,104 --> 01:17:13,063
They said l was too offbeat-looking,
whatever that means.

1093
01:17:13,409 --> 01:17:16,139
-But guess who`s auditioning?
-April?

1094
01:17:16,345 --> 01:17:20,907
l was very polite. l maintained
my poise. l said hello.

1095
01:17:21,116 --> 01:17:24,176
l never trusted her.
Eyes in the back of her head.

1096
01:17:24,386 --> 01:17:29,517
She and an architect are now a
definite item, which l can`t believe.

1097
01:17:29,725 --> 01:17:32,990
Though it`s put an end
to the catering company.

1098
01:17:33,195 --> 01:17:38,132
Which is why l have to speak to you.
l have to borrow more money.

1099
01:17:38,334 --> 01:17:41,735
-That`s fine.
-l decided to do some writing.

1100
01:17:41,937 --> 01:17:43,598
l`ve had it with acting.

1101
01:17:43,806 --> 01:17:48,140
These meaningless auditions.
l can`t handle another rejection.

1102
01:17:48,344 --> 01:17:52,804
Let`s face it. l have to
latch on to something in my life...

1103
01:17:53,015 --> 01:17:56,507
...something with a future.
l`m not 1 6 anymore.

1104
01:17:56,752 --> 01:17:58,276
lt`s just crazy...

1105
01:17:58,487 --> 01:18:03,356
...but l`ve got an idea for a story,
more than one...

1106
01:18:03,559 --> 01:18:07,154
...and l just need a few months
or a year even.

1107
01:18:07,363 --> 01:18:10,924
l learned about dramatic
structure from acting class.

1108
01:18:11,133 --> 01:18:16,332
That`s good. lt just seems to me
that six months or a year...

1109
01:18:16,538 --> 01:18:20,304
-...if you spend it more productively--
-Like what?

1110
01:18:20,509 --> 01:18:22,306
Well, l don`t know.

1111
01:18:22,511 --> 01:18:26,675
Didn`t mom mention something
at the Museum of Broadcasting?

1112
01:18:26,882 --> 01:18:31,410
-That`s clerical.
-Didn`t she say it`s in publicity?

1113
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:34,817
-lt can lead to other things.
-You`re discouraging.

1114
01:18:35,024 --> 01:18:37,151
No, l`m trying to be helpful.

1115
01:18:37,359 --> 01:18:39,122
A person doesn`t say:

1116
01:18:39,328 --> 01:18:42,297
``l`m done as an actress.
Now l`m a writer.``

1117
01:18:42,498 --> 01:18:45,092
-Not at my age.
-Please. Let`s have lunch.

1118
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:48,133
Right. Forget it.

1119
01:18:48,904 --> 01:18:52,431
l just want a salad.
You really think l`m a loser.

1120
01:18:52,641 --> 01:18:54,939
-You`re being ridiculous.
-You are.

1121
01:18:55,144 --> 01:18:57,374
-You treat me like a loser.
-How?

1122
01:18:57,579 --> 01:19:00,707
You have no faith.
You undercut my enthusiasm.

1123
01:19:00,916 --> 01:19:03,612
Not so. l`ve been very supportive.

1124
01:19:03,819 --> 01:19:08,620
l give you honest, constructive
advice. l help you financially.

1125
01:19:08,824 --> 01:19:12,419
l introduce you
to interesting, single men.

1126
01:19:12,628 --> 01:19:15,062
-All losers.
-You`re too demanding.

1127
01:19:15,264 --> 01:19:18,631
Who you fix me up with
says what you think of me.

1128
01:19:18,834 --> 01:19:21,064
-That`s not true.
-l`m mediocre.

1129
01:19:21,270 --> 01:19:24,569
Stop attacking Hannah.
She`s going through a lot.

1130
01:19:24,773 --> 01:19:28,265
-Why are you so upset?
-You keep picking on her.

1131
01:19:28,477 --> 01:19:30,707
Leave her alone. l`m suffocating.

1132
01:19:30,913 --> 01:19:34,007
Why are you so sensitive
all of a sudden?

1133
01:19:34,216 --> 01:19:36,377
Look, you wanna write, write.

1134
01:19:36,585 --> 01:19:38,780
Let`s just drop it.

1135
01:19:38,987 --> 01:19:42,514
Take a year. Take six months,
whatever you want.

1136
01:19:42,724 --> 01:19:46,353
Who knows? Maybe you`ll be
sitting with a good play.

1137
01:19:46,728 --> 01:19:50,289
What`s the matter?
You look pale. Are you okay?

1138
01:19:50,499 --> 01:19:54,765
Yeah. You know, l just got
dizzy all of a sudden.

1139
01:19:54,970 --> 01:19:57,370
l think we need to eat.

1140
01:20:13,622 --> 01:20:16,022
l can`t seem to take action.

1141
01:20:16,225 --> 01:20:19,422
l`m like Hamlet
unable to kill his uncle.

1142
01:20:19,628 --> 01:20:23,394
l want Lee, but l can`t harm Hannah.

1143
01:20:23,599 --> 01:20:26,932
And in no other area
am l a procrastinator.

1144
01:20:28,837 --> 01:20:31,067
Meanwhile, Lee has no direction.

1145
01:20:31,273 --> 01:20:34,800
She`s taking courses
at Columbia, but just randomly.

1146
01:20:35,010 --> 01:20:40,312
I try not to call her, but then
she calls me, and then I call...

1147
01:20:40,516 --> 01:20:44,384
...and we try to resist meeting,
but sometimes we meet.

1148
01:20:44,586 --> 01:20:48,147
Sometimes we argue because
I can`t split my marriage.

1149
01:20:48,357 --> 01:20:53,192
Sometimes we wind up making love,
and we both feel terrible.

1150
01:20:53,395 --> 01:20:55,454
But it`s my fault.

1151
01:20:56,999 --> 01:21:01,299
For all my education, accomplishments,
and so-called wisdom...

1152
01:21:01,503 --> 01:21:04,301
...l can`t fathom my own heart.

1153
01:21:09,411 --> 01:21:11,709
You`d like to become a Hare Krishna?

1154
01:21:11,914 --> 01:21:13,973
l`m not saying l wanna join...

1155
01:21:14,183 --> 01:21:17,584
...but you believe in reincarnation
so l`m interested.

1156
01:21:17,786 --> 01:21:19,219
What`s your religion?

1157
01:21:19,421 --> 01:21:23,357
l was born Jewish, but last winter
l tried Catholicism.

1158
01:21:23,559 --> 01:21:28,496
lt didn`t work for me. l studied
and tried, but for me it was:

1159
01:21:28,697 --> 01:21:30,187
``Die now, pay later.``

1160
01:21:30,399 --> 01:21:34,233
-l just couldn`t get with it.
-You`re afraid of dying?

1161
01:21:34,436 --> 01:21:37,234
Yeah, naturally. ln reincarnation...

1162
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:40,272
...does my soul
pass to another human?

1163
01:21:40,475 --> 01:21:43,137
Or would l come back
as an aardvark?

1164
01:21:43,345 --> 01:21:47,509
Take our literature, read it over,
and think about it.

1165
01:21:47,716 --> 01:21:51,379
-Thank you very much.
-You`re welcome. Hare Krishna.

1166
01:21:54,423 --> 01:21:57,586
Who are you kidding?
You`re gonna be a Krishna?

1167
01:21:57,793 --> 01:22:01,661
You`re gonna shave your head
and dance around at airports?

1168
01:22:01,863 --> 01:22:03,956
You`d look like Jerry Lewis.

1169
01:22:04,733 --> 01:22:07,463
Oh, God, I`m so depressed.

1170
01:22:16,878 --> 01:22:19,574
The nights are really getting cooler.

1171
01:22:19,781 --> 01:22:22,147
Summer went so quickly.

1172
01:22:22,551 --> 01:22:24,485
Soon it`ll be fall.

1173
01:22:25,854 --> 01:22:28,482
My literature professor
really likes me.

1174
01:22:28,690 --> 01:22:31,352
It was fun being out with him
last night.

1175
01:22:31,660 --> 01:22:35,858
I feel like I`m betraying
Elliot, but that`s ridiculous.

1176
01:22:36,064 --> 01:22:39,591
Why shouldn`t I see Doug?
Elliot`s not free.

1177
01:22:40,736 --> 01:22:43,330
Just go one step at a time.

1178
01:22:43,805 --> 01:22:46,706
Let`s see what the next
few months bring.

1179
01:22:49,845 --> 01:22:54,509
You`ll be happy to know that
your money hasn`t gone to waste.

1180
01:22:54,716 --> 01:22:59,050
l have an actual first rough draft
of something l wrote.

1181
01:23:00,789 --> 01:23:03,849
l showed it to Lee.
She gave me some pointers.

1182
01:23:04,059 --> 01:23:08,120
l`m pretty near where you live.
Could l just drop it off?

1183
01:23:08,330 --> 01:23:10,594
And when you have time, read it...

1184
01:23:10,799 --> 01:23:12,994
...and we`ll talk over Thanksgiving.

1185
01:23:13,201 --> 01:23:16,967
Okay? All right. Wait. Listen!

1186
01:23:17,172 --> 01:23:19,902
Lee met an interesting guy
at Columbia.

1187
01:23:20,108 --> 01:23:23,544
Yeah, yeah.
Well, he sounds really nice.

1188
01:23:23,745 --> 01:23:26,543
All right. We`ll talk at Thanksgiving.

1189
01:23:26,748 --> 01:23:28,113
Bye-bye.

1190
01:23:29,785 --> 01:23:33,186
Here`s a song that Norma sang...

1191
01:23:33,388 --> 01:23:36,380
...on that trip we made
to the show in Buffalo.

1192
01:23:36,591 --> 01:23:39,219
Oh, was she beautiful that night!

1193
01:23:39,428 --> 01:23:40,417
Come on.

1194
01:23:40,629 --> 01:23:43,359
You were.
Don`t you remember that night?

1195
01:23:43,565 --> 01:23:46,193
She was so beautiful...

1196
01:23:46,401 --> 01:23:48,699
...that when men saw her walking...

1197
01:23:48,904 --> 01:23:52,067
...they`d drive their cars
up on the sidewalk.

1198
01:23:52,808 --> 01:23:53,968
That right, honey?

1199
01:23:54,176 --> 01:23:57,577
A slight exaggeration,
but only slight.

1200
01:24:24,406 --> 01:24:28,069
-You`ve been very cold to me tonight.
-No!

1201
01:24:28,310 --> 01:24:30,335
ls something wrong?

1202
01:24:30,846 --> 01:24:33,940
Not here. There are too many
people around.

1203
01:24:37,753 --> 01:24:40,950
l think Lee`s serious
about her new boyfriend.

1204
01:24:41,156 --> 01:24:43,488
He sounds really nice.

1205
01:24:43,692 --> 01:24:46,320
l`m happy for her.
l think she`s in love.

1206
01:24:46,728 --> 01:24:47,888
What`s wrong?

1207
01:24:48,096 --> 01:24:50,462
l`m upset about what you wrote.

1208
01:24:50,665 --> 01:24:51,689
My script?

1209
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:54,391
-lt`s based on Elliot and me.
-Loosely.

1210
01:24:54,603 --> 01:24:58,334
Not loosely. Real specifically.
ls that how you see us?

1211
01:24:58,540 --> 01:25:02,032
Can l not accept gestures
and feelings from people?

1212
01:25:02,244 --> 01:25:03,871
Do l put people off?

1213
01:25:04,079 --> 01:25:06,445
-lt`s a made-up story.
-No, it`s exact.

1214
01:25:06,648 --> 01:25:09,276
The situations, the dialogue,
everything.

1215
01:25:09,484 --> 01:25:12,112
lt`s full of details
about Elliot and me...

1216
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:15,551
...which l don`t see how
you could know about.

1217
01:25:15,757 --> 01:25:17,884
Our conversation about adoption?

1218
01:25:18,093 --> 01:25:19,424
Lee mentioned that to me.

1219
01:25:19,628 --> 01:25:24,122
Obviously, you told her.
l just blew it up into drama.

1220
01:25:24,332 --> 01:25:27,859
How would Lee know?
We don`t talk about everything.

1221
01:25:28,069 --> 01:25:29,866
l guess l hit a nerve.

1222
01:25:30,071 --> 01:25:34,565
You make it out like l have no needs.
Am l too self-sufficient?

1223
01:25:34,776 --> 01:25:37,244
That`s not what l meant.

1224
01:25:37,446 --> 01:25:41,314
Everybody relies on you for so much.
lt`s not a criticism.

1225
01:25:41,516 --> 01:25:44,781
-We`re grateful.
-Grateful, but you resent me.

1226
01:25:44,986 --> 01:25:47,580
l don`t wanna have this conversation.

1227
01:25:47,789 --> 01:25:51,953
l didn`t do anything wrong.
You said you were having problems.

1228
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:54,720
Problems that are my business...

1229
01:25:54,930 --> 01:25:57,330
...which l don`t see how you know.

1230
01:25:57,532 --> 01:26:01,127
How does Lee know about these things?
They`re private.

1231
01:26:01,336 --> 01:26:03,497
Why don`t you share them with us?

1232
01:26:03,705 --> 01:26:07,835
-l don`t want to bother everyone.
-l`d like to be bothered.

1233
01:26:08,043 --> 01:26:11,740
l don`t see how you could know
unless Elliot told you.

1234
01:26:11,947 --> 01:26:13,642
No, he hasn`t.

1235
01:26:13,849 --> 01:26:16,215
lf l offended you, l`m sorry.

1236
01:26:18,753 --> 01:26:21,722
lt`s over, Elliot.
l can`t be any clearer.

1237
01:26:21,923 --> 01:26:24,551
-l deserve this--
-l`m at fault too.

1238
01:26:24,759 --> 01:26:26,659
l have such feelings--

1239
01:26:26,862 --> 01:26:29,330
To be honest, l`ve met someone else.

1240
01:26:29,531 --> 01:26:34,059
-What do you mean?
-l said l wasn`t gonna wait forever.

1241
01:26:34,269 --> 01:26:35,998
lt hasn`t been forever.

1242
01:26:36,204 --> 01:26:39,970
lt`s been a year and you`re
still married to my sister.

1243
01:26:40,175 --> 01:26:43,440
And l`m sure you`re more
in love than you know.

1244
01:26:43,645 --> 01:26:47,479
-But we made so many plans.
-ln a way, you led me on.

1245
01:26:47,682 --> 01:26:50,446
l believed you were
unhappy with Hannah.

1246
01:26:50,652 --> 01:26:53,177
l would never have
let myself be drawn in.

1247
01:26:53,388 --> 01:26:56,915
l was weak. So were you.
Now l`ve met someone else.

1248
01:26:59,561 --> 01:27:00,721
Dinner soon?

1249
01:27:00,929 --> 01:27:03,557
-About 1 5 minutes.
-Good.

1250
01:27:04,733 --> 01:27:08,191
-You`re in love overnight?
-l care a lot about him.

1251
01:27:08,403 --> 01:27:11,167
lt`s over, Elliot.
l mean it. lt`s over.

1252
01:27:15,176 --> 01:27:18,907
Sweetheart, l loved your script.
lt was so clever.

1253
01:27:19,114 --> 01:27:21,947
You`re my mother.
Not everybody`s a sucker.

1254
01:27:22,150 --> 01:27:25,085
l really liked the character
of the mother.

1255
01:27:25,287 --> 01:27:28,120
A boozy old flirt
with a filthy mouth.

1256
01:27:28,323 --> 01:27:31,349
-l`m so proud.
-Oh, Mom. Thanks.

1257
01:27:31,927 --> 01:27:33,827
A toast to Thanksgiving!

1258
01:27:34,029 --> 01:27:36,589
Are we supposed
to have beer? Yeah!

1259
01:27:36,798 --> 01:27:37,787
Let me hear it!

1260
01:27:37,999 --> 01:27:39,762
How`s that, Fletcher?

1261
01:27:39,968 --> 01:27:43,062
Now to Thanksgiving.
Here`s a little toast.

1262
01:27:43,271 --> 01:27:44,203
Bottoms up!

1263
01:27:44,606 --> 01:27:48,838
Have you been talking to Holly
or Lee about our personal life?

1264
01:27:49,044 --> 01:27:50,636
Me? Of course not.

1265
01:27:50,845 --> 01:27:52,904
There`s things in Holly`s script...

1266
01:27:53,114 --> 01:27:55,912
...that could only have come from you.

1267
01:27:56,117 --> 01:27:58,779
Look, l don`t like being accused.

1268
01:27:58,987 --> 01:28:03,287
l`m not accusing. l`m asking.
Do you find me too giving?

1269
01:28:03,491 --> 01:28:05,118
Too competent?

1270
01:28:05,327 --> 01:28:08,296
Too disgustingly perfect or something?

1271
01:28:08,496 --> 01:28:11,761
What`s come between us?
How have l alienated you?

1272
01:28:11,967 --> 01:28:15,459
-My head is throbbing.
-You never want to talk about it.

1273
01:28:15,670 --> 01:28:19,197
When l bring it up,
you change the subject.

1274
01:28:19,407 --> 01:28:22,376
We communicate less.
You sleep with me less.

1275
01:28:22,577 --> 01:28:25,478
Hannah, l am very mixed-up!
Please!

1276
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:29,116
Do you talk to Holly or Lee
behind my back?

1277
01:28:29,317 --> 01:28:31,308
They seem to know so much.

1278
01:28:31,519 --> 01:28:34,454
Maybe l`ve asked advice
or made a joke.

1279
01:28:34,656 --> 01:28:38,387
Do you talk to Holly? Lee?
Or what? Do you phone them?

1280
01:28:38,593 --> 01:28:40,493
Leave me alone, can you?

1281
01:28:40,695 --> 01:28:43,755
Jesus, l told you.
l need someone l can matter to.

1282
01:28:43,965 --> 01:28:46,263
You matter to me. Completely.

1283
01:28:46,468 --> 01:28:50,564
l can`t be around someone who
gives so much yet needs so little.

1284
01:28:50,772 --> 01:28:52,296
l have enormous needs.

1285
01:28:52,507 --> 01:28:55,670
l can`t see them,
neither can Lee or Holly.

1286
01:29:56,604 --> 01:29:59,368
So pitch-black tonight.

1287
01:30:01,309 --> 01:30:03,368
l feel lost.

1288
01:30:04,746 --> 01:30:06,270
You`re not lost.

1289
01:30:16,424 --> 01:30:18,324
l love you so much.

1290
01:31:08,476 --> 01:31:10,034
You may not remember...

1291
01:31:10,245 --> 01:31:12,941
...but we shared the worst
night of my life.

1292
01:31:13,148 --> 01:31:14,581
l remember you.

1293
01:31:14,783 --> 01:31:17,115
You recall? l saw you in here.

1294
01:31:17,318 --> 01:31:20,754
-l thought we could replay--
-We didn`t hit it off.

1295
01:31:20,955 --> 01:31:23,651
We did everything but
exchange gunshots.

1296
01:31:23,858 --> 01:31:26,793
-How are you?
-Good. You look wonderful.

1297
01:31:26,995 --> 01:31:29,589
You do. lt was a terrible evening.

1298
01:31:29,798 --> 01:31:32,665
Remember slamming
the cab door in my face?

1299
01:31:32,867 --> 01:31:37,770
You came very dangerously close
to emasculating my nose.

1300
01:31:37,972 --> 01:31:40,770
That was a long time ago.
People change.

1301
01:31:40,975 --> 01:31:43,375
-l hope you`ve changed.
-You too.

1302
01:31:43,578 --> 01:31:46,638
Your personality left something
to be desired--

1303
01:31:46,848 --> 01:31:48,839
Namely a personality.

1304
01:31:49,284 --> 01:31:51,548
How are you? What are you doing?

1305
01:31:51,753 --> 01:31:55,587
Nothing much. A little of this,
a little of that.

1306
01:31:55,790 --> 01:31:59,385
Was that an embarrassing question?
You`re out of work?

1307
01:31:59,594 --> 01:32:02,188
-l`ve been trying to write.
-Have you?

1308
01:32:02,397 --> 01:32:04,490
-Yeah.
-What kind of stuff?

1309
01:32:04,699 --> 01:32:08,601
-You`re not interested in this.
-You can tell me. l am.

1310
01:32:08,803 --> 01:32:11,636
You must always hear,
``l wrote something.``

1311
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:13,808
-Nobody ever said it.
-Really?

1312
01:32:14,008 --> 01:32:17,273
Would you be willing
to read something l wrote?

1313
01:32:17,478 --> 01:32:21,574
lf it would mean anything to you.
l don`t know why it would.

1314
01:32:21,783 --> 01:32:25,514
-You`ve always hated my taste.
-No, l haven`t.

1315
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:28,917
l think it might be
a great television script...

1316
01:32:29,123 --> 01:32:31,284
...and since you`re so active--

1317
01:32:31,492 --> 01:32:33,983
l haven`t been
in television for a year.

1318
01:32:34,195 --> 01:32:35,787
You`re kidding me.

1319
01:32:35,997 --> 01:32:38,488
l may have to get back into it.

1320
01:32:38,700 --> 01:32:41,100
l`m running out of dollars.

1321
01:32:41,302 --> 01:32:45,261
But l dropped out for a year,
which is a long, dull story.

1322
01:32:45,473 --> 01:32:46,337
You okay?

1323
01:32:46,541 --> 01:32:47,974
l`m fine.

1324
01:32:48,176 --> 01:32:49,404
-How are you?
-Fine.

1325
01:32:49,611 --> 01:32:50,839
So, your script?

1326
01:32:51,045 --> 01:32:54,208
lf you`d read it,
l`d value your opinion.

1327
01:32:54,415 --> 01:32:58,181
But remember while you`re reading
and cursing my name...

1328
01:32:58,386 --> 01:33:01,321
...it`s my first script.
Well, not really.

1329
01:33:01,522 --> 01:33:04,389
My first was about
Hannah and her husband.

1330
01:33:04,592 --> 01:33:07,425
But Hannah read it
and got really angry.

1331
01:33:07,629 --> 01:33:09,688
Can`t imagine what you wrote.

1332
01:33:09,898 --> 01:33:12,958
lt wasn`t anything bad.
She-- l don`t know.

1333
01:33:13,167 --> 01:33:16,159
So l threw it out,
but l have this other one.

1334
01:33:16,371 --> 01:33:19,602
lf you want me to, l`ll read it.

1335
01:33:19,807 --> 01:33:22,708
Could l come over and read it to you?

1336
01:33:22,911 --> 01:33:26,711
Come over and read it to me?
You must be joking.

1337
01:33:26,915 --> 01:33:29,941
l`ve done my own reading
since l was 40.

1338
01:33:30,151 --> 01:33:33,143
l think it`s lucky
l ran into you. Maybe.

1339
01:33:33,354 --> 01:33:34,912
What about me?

1340
01:33:35,123 --> 01:33:38,388
l have this sensation
that l should have...

1341
01:33:38,593 --> 01:33:41,790
...kept walking and not begun
this conversation.

1342
01:33:43,064 --> 01:33:45,692
``We all play with the hand
we`re dealt.``

1343
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:49,063
``Craig: And what hand were you dealt?``

1344
01:33:49,270 --> 01:33:51,738
``Emily: l`m two high pair.

1345
01:33:51,940 --> 01:33:53,805
Maybe even aces up.

1346
01:33:54,008 --> 01:33:57,136
The problem is,
you`ve got three deuces.``

1347
01:33:58,479 --> 01:33:59,946
That`s the end.

1348
01:34:01,416 --> 01:34:04,214
No, you can tell me straight.
lt`s okay.

1349
01:34:04,419 --> 01:34:06,546
Just tell me what you think.

1350
01:34:06,754 --> 01:34:08,312
lt`s great.

1351
01:34:08,523 --> 01:34:09,956
l-- l`m--

1352
01:34:10,158 --> 01:34:12,922
l`m speechless. l was--

1353
01:34:13,127 --> 01:34:16,961
l was not in the mood
to listen to this thing now.

1354
01:34:17,165 --> 01:34:20,794
l don`t know what to say.
l`m moved. l laughed.

1355
01:34:21,002 --> 01:34:24,438
l was on the edge of my seat.
l think it`s wonderful.

1356
01:34:24,639 --> 01:34:26,106
l`m totally stunned.

1357
01:34:26,307 --> 01:34:29,367
This is not an insult.
l`m amazed you can--

1358
01:34:29,577 --> 01:34:31,670
l just thought it was great.

1359
01:34:31,879 --> 01:34:33,904
-Really?
-Yes, l was--

1360
01:34:34,115 --> 01:34:37,107
What made you think
of that climax scene...

1361
01:34:37,318 --> 01:34:41,152
...where the architect is with
his actress girlfriend...

1362
01:34:41,356 --> 01:34:44,917
...and the schizophrenic ex-wife
stabs him to death?

1363
01:34:45,126 --> 01:34:48,892
-lt just came to me one day.
-Well, it was fabulous.

1364
01:34:49,097 --> 01:34:50,928
You really think l can write?

1365
01:34:51,132 --> 01:34:54,431
There`s maybe one or two things
l`d do differently...

1366
01:34:54,635 --> 01:34:55,932
...but who cares?

1367
01:34:56,137 --> 01:34:58,435
lt was fabulous.

1368
01:34:58,639 --> 01:35:00,766
l mean it. l`m so impressed.

1369
01:35:00,975 --> 01:35:02,966
l am. You made my day.

1370
01:35:03,478 --> 01:35:04,467
lt was great.

1371
01:35:04,679 --> 01:35:06,977
l was set to be bored stiff.

1372
01:35:07,181 --> 01:35:09,308
Would you like to have lunch?

1373
01:35:09,517 --> 01:35:12,008
l`d love to talk about that script.

1374
01:35:12,220 --> 01:35:14,381
We could do something with it.

1375
01:35:14,589 --> 01:35:18,616
And l`d like to hear what made
you suddenly drop out of life.

1376
01:35:18,826 --> 01:35:21,192
-Who cares?
-No. l care.

1377
01:35:21,396 --> 01:35:23,990
You used to be so ambitious, and....

1378
01:35:24,198 --> 01:35:26,666
God, you really liked it?

1379
01:35:48,823 --> 01:35:51,656
Gosh, you really went
through a crisis.

1380
01:35:51,859 --> 01:35:53,486
How did you get over it?

1381
01:35:53,694 --> 01:35:56,959
When l ran into you,
you seemed perfectly fine.

1382
01:35:57,165 --> 01:35:58,996
You seem fine now.

1383
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:00,497
Well, l`ll tell you.

1384
01:36:00,935 --> 01:36:03,301
One day, a month ago, l really...

1385
01:36:03,504 --> 01:36:06,803
...hit bottom. I just felt
that in a godless universe...

1386
01:36:07,008 --> 01:36:08,976
...I didn`t want to go on living.

1387
01:36:09,177 --> 01:36:12,203
I happen to own this rifle
which I loaded...

1388
01:36:12,413 --> 01:36:14,472
...and pressed to my forehead.

1389
01:36:14,682 --> 01:36:16,980
I thought, ``I`m gonna kill myself. ``

1390
01:36:17,185 --> 01:36:19,881
Then I thought,
``What if I`m wrong?

1391
01:36:20,088 --> 01:36:23,353
What if there is a God?
Nobody really knows. ``

1392
01:36:23,558 --> 01:36:26,959
Then I thought,
``No. Maybe is not good enough.

1393
01:36:27,161 --> 01:36:29,391
I want certainty or nothing. ``

1394
01:36:29,597 --> 01:36:32,691
I remember clearly,
the clock was ticking...

1395
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:36,097
...and I was sitting there frozen...

1396
01:36:36,304 --> 01:36:38,772
...debating whether to shoot.

1397
01:36:40,741 --> 01:36:42,368
All of a sudden,
the gun went off.

1398
01:36:42,577 --> 01:36:46,274
I was so tense I inadvertently
squeezed the trigger.

1399
01:36:46,481 --> 01:36:48,278
But I was perspiring so much...

1400
01:36:48,483 --> 01:36:51,577
... the gun slid off
my forehead and missed me.

1401
01:36:51,786 --> 01:36:54,983
Suddenly, neighbors
were pounding on the door...

1402
01:36:55,189 --> 01:36:58,716
...and the whole scene
was just pandemonium.

1403
01:36:58,926 --> 01:37:00,416
I ran to the door.

1404
01:37:00,628 --> 01:37:04,462
I didn`t know what to say.
I was embarrassed and confused.

1405
01:37:04,665 --> 01:37:07,156
My mind was racing a mile a minute.

1406
01:37:07,368 --> 01:37:11,327
I just knew one thing--
I had to get out of that house.

1407
01:37:11,539 --> 01:37:15,202
I had to get out in
the fresh air and clear my head.

1408
01:37:15,409 --> 01:37:18,207
And I remember,
I walked the streets.

1409
01:37:18,412 --> 01:37:21,609
I didn`t know what
was going through my mind.

1410
01:37:21,816 --> 01:37:25,479
It all seemed so violent
and unreal to me.

1411
01:37:25,686 --> 01:37:28,416
I wandered on the Upper West Side.

1412
01:37:28,623 --> 01:37:30,250
It must have been hours.

1413
01:37:30,458 --> 01:37:33,723
My feet hurt,
my head was pounding.

1414
01:37:33,928 --> 01:37:37,261
I went into a movie.
Didn`t know what was playing.

1415
01:37:37,465 --> 01:37:41,663
I just needed a moment to gather
my thoughts and be logical...

1416
01:37:41,869 --> 01:37:45,396
...and put the world back
into rational perspective.

1417
01:37:54,148 --> 01:37:56,173
I went up to the balcony...

1418
01:37:56,384 --> 01:37:57,874
...and I sat down.

1419
01:37:58,085 --> 01:38:01,646
The movie was one I`d seen
many times in my life...

1420
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:05,189
...since I was a kid,
and I always loved it.

1421
01:38:05,393 --> 01:38:07,793
I`m watching the screen...

1422
01:38:07,995 --> 01:38:11,089
...and I started getting
hooked on the film.

1423
01:38:11,299 --> 01:38:13,233
And I started to feel.

1424
01:38:13,434 --> 01:38:16,301
``How can you think
of killing yourself?

1425
01:38:16,504 --> 01:38:17,766
Isn`t it stupid?

1426
01:38:17,972 --> 01:38:20,338
Look at all the people on-screen.

1427
01:38:20,541 --> 01:38:23,806
They`re funny, and what if
the worst is true?

1428
01:38:24,011 --> 01:38:27,606
There`s no God, you only
go around once, that`s it.

1429
01:38:27,815 --> 01:38:31,410
Don`t you want to be
part of the experience?

1430
01:38:31,619 --> 01:38:33,246
It`s not all a drag. ``

1431
01:38:33,454 --> 01:38:37,254
And I`m thinking,
``I should stop ruining my life...

1432
01:38:37,458 --> 01:38:39,722
...searching for answers...

1433
01:38:39,927 --> 01:38:42,896
...and just enjoy it while it lasts. ``

1434
01:38:43,497 --> 01:38:44,987
And after, who knows?

1435
01:38:45,199 --> 01:38:47,133
Maybe there is something.

1436
01:38:47,335 --> 01:38:51,237
I know ``maybe`` is a slim reed
to hang your life on...

1437
01:38:51,439 --> 01:38:53,430
...but that`s the best we have.

1438
01:38:53,641 --> 01:38:56,109
And then I started to sit back...

1439
01:38:56,310 --> 01:38:58,904
...and I actually began
to enjoy myself.

1440
01:39:07,455 --> 01:39:10,720
There`s something that`s
been bothering me...

1441
01:39:10,925 --> 01:39:13,723
...and l thought l`d tell you
what it was...

1442
01:39:13,928 --> 01:39:16,522
...and clear the deck,
and that`s this:

1443
01:39:16,731 --> 01:39:21,395
l`ve always regretted the way
l behaved that evening we went out.

1444
01:39:21,602 --> 01:39:24,628
l really made a fool out of myself.

1445
01:39:24,839 --> 01:39:27,205
No, don`t be ridiculous. l was--

1446
01:39:27,408 --> 01:39:29,376
You know, it was my fault.

1447
01:39:30,378 --> 01:39:33,575
So you want to go out
to dinner again?

1448
01:39:33,781 --> 01:39:36,215
-You have any interest?
-Sure.

1449
01:39:36,417 --> 01:39:39,011
-Are you free this evening?
-Yeah.

1450
01:39:47,028 --> 01:39:50,828
-l want ice. Who`s got some--
-lt`s on the table, Dad.

1451
01:39:51,032 --> 01:39:52,499
Where`s Holly? She`s late.

1452
01:39:52,700 --> 01:39:55,999
Did you read the last thing
Holly wrote? lt`s great.

1453
01:39:56,203 --> 01:39:58,194
She writes good dialogue.

1454
01:39:58,406 --> 01:40:00,897
Can l say that you`re
playing Desdemona?

1455
01:40:01,108 --> 01:40:04,475
-Mom, it`s only television.
-lt`s public television.

1456
01:40:04,679 --> 01:40:07,671
Shakespeare doesn`t get
better than Othello.

1457
01:40:07,882 --> 01:40:10,680
You with some big black stud.
l love it.

1458
01:40:10,885 --> 01:40:12,079
Oh, honey!

1459
01:40:37,978 --> 01:40:41,038
Oh, Lee, you are something.

1460
01:40:42,116 --> 01:40:44,016
You look very beautiful.

1461
01:40:45,019 --> 01:40:46,919
Marriage agrees with you.

1462
01:40:48,522 --> 01:40:50,717
Everything that happened between us...

1463
01:40:50,925 --> 01:40:53,917
...seems more and more hazy.

1464
01:40:54,795 --> 01:40:56,922
I acted like such a fool.

1465
01:40:57,131 --> 01:40:59,361
I don`t know what came over me.

1466
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:03,593
The complete conviction that
I couldn`t live without you.

1467
01:41:04,238 --> 01:41:06,399
What I put us both through.

1468
01:41:06,774 --> 01:41:09,675
And Hannah, who, as you once said...

1469
01:41:09,877 --> 01:41:12,744
...I love much more than I realized.

1470
01:41:17,785 --> 01:41:20,117
Happy Thanksgiving!

1471
01:41:21,455 --> 01:41:24,447
Daisy. l didn`t miss dinner, did l?

1472
01:41:24,658 --> 01:41:26,990
Hi, Marge. Happy Thanksgiving.

1473
01:41:27,194 --> 01:41:28,923
-Hello.
-Happy Thanksgiving.

1474
01:41:29,130 --> 01:41:30,358
Thank you.

1475
01:42:32,326 --> 01:42:34,260
Looks beautiful.

1476
01:42:37,598 --> 01:42:39,828
lt`s just your husband.

1477
01:42:40,034 --> 01:42:44,437
-Hi. When did you get here?
-Just a few minutes ago.

1478
01:42:44,638 --> 01:42:46,799
-You look so beautiful.
-Thanks.

1479
01:42:47,007 --> 01:42:50,568
l was telling your father
that it`s ironic--

1480
01:42:50,778 --> 01:42:54,077
l used to always have
Thanksgiving with Hannah...

1481
01:42:54,281 --> 01:42:57,648
...and l never thought
l could love anybody else.

1482
01:42:57,852 --> 01:42:59,513
Here it is years later.

1483
01:42:59,720 --> 01:43:03,383
l`m married to you and
completely in love with you.

1484
01:43:03,591 --> 01:43:07,118
The heart is a very,
very resilient little muscle.

1485
01:43:07,328 --> 01:43:09,353
lt really is.

1486
01:43:09,730 --> 01:43:13,222
Make a great story:
Guy marries one sister.

1487
01:43:13,434 --> 01:43:14,696
Doesn`t work out.

1488
01:43:14,902 --> 01:43:19,168
Then years later, he winds up
married to the other sister.

1489
01:43:19,373 --> 01:43:22,308
How are you gonna top that?

1490
01:43:24,078 --> 01:43:26,546
-Mickey?
-What?

1491
01:43:27,648 --> 01:43:29,206
l`m pregnant.
