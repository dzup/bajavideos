1
00:01:39,197 --> 00:01:40,835
Listen to me.

2
00:01:41,517 --> 00:01:43,667
OK, you win.

3
00:01:44,357 --> 00:01:48,555
At least you could stop that song.
You know I hate it.

4
00:01:50,757 --> 00:01:52,110
Why are you so quiet?

5
00:01:55,797 --> 00:01:57,833
Say something!

6
00:03:12,477 --> 00:03:14,911
You're there.

7
00:03:15,077 --> 00:03:16,749
And you're looking at me.

8
00:03:16,917 --> 00:03:19,989
Do you think you can fool me?

9
00:03:20,157 --> 00:03:23,149
No, no, you can't fool me,

10
00:03:23,317 --> 00:03:25,956
because I can feel your presence.

11
00:03:27,077 --> 00:03:28,988
And your movements.

12
00:03:29,157 --> 00:03:31,148
I can even smell you.

13
00:03:31,397 --> 00:03:33,069
If you think...

14
00:03:33,237 --> 00:03:35,592
If you think, son of a bitch,

15
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,271
that I'll hang myself
while you watch, you...

16
00:04:00,597 --> 00:04:02,269
- What's wrong?
- What happened?

17
00:04:02,437 --> 00:04:04,473
Julia, what's wrong?

18
00:04:04,637 --> 00:04:07,549
Julia, can you hear me?
Bring some water.

19
00:04:07,717 --> 00:04:09,389
Take it easy, Julia.

20
00:04:10,997 --> 00:04:12,191
Julia, are you OK?

21
00:04:12,357 --> 00:04:13,585
- What happened?
- She fell.

22
00:04:13,757 --> 00:04:16,829
- Call a doctor, quick!
- No, I'm OK.

23
00:04:16,997 --> 00:04:19,033
I'm OK.

24
00:04:24,557 --> 00:04:27,674
This is Sara. I can't take your call
at the moment. Please...

25
00:04:30,957 --> 00:04:33,391
Do you think it's a good idea
to show up after six months?

26
00:04:33,557 --> 00:04:35,866
I just need to know
that she is all right.

27
00:04:37,437 --> 00:04:39,234
Sara?

28
00:04:41,477 --> 00:04:43,149
Sara?

29
00:04:45,437 --> 00:04:47,348
Maybe they have gone out.

30
00:04:47,517 --> 00:04:48,745
No...

31
00:04:48,917 --> 00:04:51,033
I know something's happened to her.

32
00:05:02,237 --> 00:05:03,306
The power is out.

33
00:05:05,677 --> 00:05:09,226
- The fuses seem to be OK.
- I'll look upstairs.

34
00:05:14,237 --> 00:05:15,226
Sara?

35
00:05:23,517 --> 00:05:25,189
Sara?

36
00:05:47,717 --> 00:05:50,868
Isaac, she's nowhere to be found.
We'll ask the neighbours.

37
00:05:51,037 --> 00:05:53,267
- Don't come down.
- Why?

38
00:05:56,077 --> 00:05:57,749
What's wrong?

39
00:06:00,917 --> 00:06:03,192
Isaac, tell me what's wrong.

40
00:06:04,437 --> 00:06:06,155
- What's wrong?
- Julia...

41
00:06:06,317 --> 00:06:08,547
- What's wrong?
- Come with me.

42
00:06:20,157 --> 00:06:21,988
Inspector...

43
00:06:22,157 --> 00:06:24,512
I'm sorry about what happened.

44
00:06:25,077 --> 00:06:26,351
No, thanks.

45
00:06:26,517 --> 00:06:30,954
The forensics say Sara took her own
life last night, during the blackout.

46
00:06:31,117 --> 00:06:33,108
But we need to find out why.

47
00:06:33,277 --> 00:06:36,553
I have been informed that she suffered
a degenerative disease.

48
00:06:36,717 --> 00:06:41,233
Yes, a progressive vision loss,
the same as my wife.

49
00:06:41,397 --> 00:06:44,594
But Sara went blind a year ago.

50
00:06:44,757 --> 00:06:46,827
And how did she cope with that?

51
00:06:47,597 --> 00:06:50,873
My sister wasn't depressed,
if that's what you mean.

52
00:06:51,037 --> 00:06:53,073
In fact, she was...

53
00:06:53,237 --> 00:06:55,797
She was going to have surgery, right?

54
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:59,916
She was waiting for a donor,
but she hoped to get her vision back.

55
00:07:06,557 --> 00:07:09,151
Maybe she got tired of waiting.

56
00:07:40,237 --> 00:07:41,226
All right.

57
00:07:43,357 --> 00:07:45,666
Yes, thank you.

58
00:07:49,957 --> 00:07:53,074
Dr. Roman can't come to the funeral,
and he sends his condolences.

59
00:07:53,237 --> 00:07:56,707
He also wants to check your eyes
before you go back home.

60
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:59,789
Isaac, the power is back.

61
00:08:01,077 --> 00:08:04,149
Darling, are you listening?

62
00:08:04,757 --> 00:08:07,112
And the CD started playing.
Did you hear it?

63
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:11,115
- Yes.
- Don't you think it's strange

64
00:08:11,277 --> 00:08:14,235
that Sara was listening
to music before...?

65
00:08:14,397 --> 00:08:16,592
Besides, she hated that song.

66
00:08:16,757 --> 00:08:19,191
- Julia...
- What if she wasn't alone?

67
00:08:19,357 --> 00:08:21,996
- What if she was with somebody?
- Julia, please.

68
00:08:22,157 --> 00:08:26,196
We may never find out her reasons.
We hadn't heard from her in months.

69
00:08:26,357 --> 00:08:28,746
It's strange.
I need to know what happened.

70
00:08:28,917 --> 00:08:32,273
- It's not good for you to get upset.
- I'm not worried about myself.

71
00:08:32,437 --> 00:08:36,635
Well, I am.
Stress can turn you blind.

72
00:08:36,797 --> 00:08:39,516
It's only happened to me
twice in five years.

73
00:08:39,677 --> 00:08:42,430
And you've lost 20% of your vision.

74
00:08:52,037 --> 00:08:54,392
Oh, no... Again.

75
00:09:10,157 --> 00:09:11,795
Did you find anything?

76
00:09:11,957 --> 00:09:14,630
Nothing, not even a candle.

77
00:09:15,677 --> 00:09:18,555
- It's time to meet the neighbours.
- OK, hurry up.

78
00:09:41,397 --> 00:09:43,035
Isaac?

79
00:10:04,717 --> 00:10:06,469
Julia.

80
00:10:37,757 --> 00:10:39,873
Excuse me.

81
00:10:41,277 --> 00:10:43,074
Excuse me.

82
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:50,948
I'm sorry for your loss.
I'm Blasco, her next-door neighbour.

83
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,756
I didn't know your sister very well,

84
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:58,752
but Lia loved her very much
and she wanted me to bring you this.

85
00:10:59,557 --> 00:11:00,546
Lia?

86
00:11:00,717 --> 00:11:04,551
My daughter.
Sara used to lend her books.

87
00:11:04,717 --> 00:11:09,632
The poor girl is so upset she didn't
want to come out of the car.

88
00:11:11,357 --> 00:11:12,631
Anyway...

89
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:18,110
Sorry... Lia would like to know
if Sara left any note.

90
00:11:19,837 --> 00:11:22,954
- We don't know.
- I understand.

91
00:11:23,117 --> 00:11:26,553
Anyway, I won't bother you any longer.

92
00:11:32,437 --> 00:11:34,189
Shall we continue?

93
00:11:34,357 --> 00:11:36,552
Only a neighbour and his daughter?

94
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:41,270
I didn't know she was so lonely.

95
00:11:51,917 --> 00:11:54,112
But I forgave her.

96
00:11:57,037 --> 00:11:59,505
And I also forgave you.

97
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:07,866
Now I only need to forgive myself
for not being by her side.

98
00:12:16,797 --> 00:12:19,630
But I did everything I could,
didn't I, Isaac?

99
00:12:35,877 --> 00:12:38,027
The autopsy doesn't reveal
anything strange.

100
00:12:38,197 --> 00:12:42,713
- Have you searched for fingerprints?
- We only found ours and hers.

101
00:12:42,877 --> 00:12:44,629
OK, but...

102
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,674
That song...

103
00:12:46,837 --> 00:12:49,112
And what about what happened
in the cemetery?

104
00:12:49,277 --> 00:12:53,873
Julia, there's no evidence
of anyone being with your sister.

105
00:12:54,037 --> 00:12:57,268
And nobody has seen or heard
anything suspicious.

106
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:02,386
You can speak with Soledad if you wish.

107
00:13:02,557 --> 00:13:05,515
- With whom?
- An old lady who lives nearby.

108
00:13:05,677 --> 00:13:09,670
Apparently, she helped your sister
when she went blind.

109
00:13:10,637 --> 00:13:12,229
Don't be long.

110
00:13:17,237 --> 00:13:19,546
Where does she live?

111
00:13:19,717 --> 00:13:22,629
Follow the rope in the yard.

112
00:13:22,797 --> 00:13:24,025
What rope?

113
00:13:35,797 --> 00:13:38,106
I'm sure the old woman
doesn't know anything.

114
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:41,269
Nobody else knew apart from you.

115
00:13:41,437 --> 00:13:46,067
But you have to speak with your wife.
She'll find out sooner or later.

116
00:13:46,957 --> 00:13:49,596
I'll wait for the right moment.

117
00:14:17,597 --> 00:14:19,633
Mrs Soledad?

118
00:14:25,957 --> 00:14:27,515
Hello?

119
00:14:30,557 --> 00:14:32,070
Who is it?

120
00:14:32,237 --> 00:14:34,068
It's Julia, Sara's sister.

121
00:14:34,237 --> 00:14:35,829
I'll be right out.

122
00:14:39,597 --> 00:14:45,229
Sorry about the mess.
The house must be quite disgusting.

123
00:14:48,077 --> 00:14:49,635
Hello...

124
00:14:50,477 --> 00:14:54,675
- Are you there?
- Yes. Sorry, I didn't know you were...

125
00:14:54,837 --> 00:14:59,592
I am sorry too. I wanted to come
to your sister's funeral, but...

126
00:14:59,757 --> 00:15:02,715
it took me an hour to find
a pair of matching shoes.

127
00:15:02,877 --> 00:15:04,276
It's OK.

128
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:07,190
Were you a good friend of Sara?

129
00:15:07,357 --> 00:15:10,986
Well, when she started
losing her eyesight,

130
00:15:11,157 --> 00:15:15,833
a year ago,
we used to have long conversations.

131
00:15:17,797 --> 00:15:21,153
But lately she hardly spoke with me.

132
00:15:21,317 --> 00:15:23,592
She had made new friends.

133
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:27,955
- What new friends?
- You know, younger people.

134
00:15:28,117 --> 00:15:32,156
- From the Baumann Centre.
- Baumann Centre. What's that?

135
00:15:32,317 --> 00:15:34,877
A centre for blind people,
not far from here.

136
00:15:35,037 --> 00:15:40,987
One of those places where they make you
believe you can live a normal life.

137
00:15:41,717 --> 00:15:45,630
If you can't hear, you are deaf.
If you lost an arm, you are a cripple.

138
00:15:45,797 --> 00:15:48,470
And if you can't see, you are blind.

139
00:15:48,637 --> 00:15:51,435
And nothing can ever be
how it used to be.

140
00:15:52,517 --> 00:15:55,589
Mrs Soledad, where can I take a taxi?

141
00:15:55,757 --> 00:15:57,315
Thank you.

142
00:16:01,677 --> 00:16:05,306
Go straight ahead,
down the stairs and turn right.

143
00:16:26,397 --> 00:16:27,625
Poor Sara.

144
00:16:27,797 --> 00:16:30,994
- Why would she hang herself?
- Stop thinking about it.

145
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,830
- Shall we have a moment of silence?
- Don't be cruel.

146
00:16:33,997 --> 00:16:36,557
None of us could stand her.

147
00:16:36,717 --> 00:16:39,185
Don't you find it strange?

148
00:16:39,357 --> 00:16:40,676
No.

149
00:16:40,837 --> 00:16:42,793
We've all thought
of doing it at some time.

150
00:16:42,957 --> 00:16:45,835
Dela...

151
00:16:45,997 --> 00:16:49,273
Nora is right. I once thought
of slitting my wrists.

152
00:16:49,437 --> 00:16:52,713
With candles and opera music.

153
00:16:52,877 --> 00:16:55,345
Me too, I thought ofjumping
out of the window.

154
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:58,429
Well, we thought about it
but didn't do it.

155
00:16:58,597 --> 00:17:01,475
There's a reason to live.

156
00:17:01,957 --> 00:17:04,312
Maybe Sara didn't find any.

157
00:17:04,477 --> 00:17:08,709
And a boyfriend doesn't seem like
a good reason?

158
00:17:09,397 --> 00:17:10,989
Sara had a boyfriend?

159
00:17:11,157 --> 00:17:13,068
She told me she met a boy.

160
00:17:13,237 --> 00:17:15,148
- Who?
- No idea.

161
00:17:15,717 --> 00:17:18,709
They had been going out together
for a couple of months.

162
00:17:18,877 --> 00:17:21,994
They even went to Bellavista
together for a week.

163
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:26,996
- What's in Bellavista?
- Rooms for sex.

164
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:30,589
Quiet!

165
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:41,351
How weird! Shit!

166
00:17:41,517 --> 00:17:43,109
What is it?

167
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:45,669
There's someone here.

168
00:17:45,837 --> 00:17:49,307
- I would say it's Sara.
- That's not funny!

169
00:17:49,757 --> 00:17:53,830
- I can smell her too.
- Something is moving.

170
00:17:53,997 --> 00:17:58,195
- I've got her! Call security!
- I'm Sara's sister.

171
00:17:58,357 --> 00:17:59,915
Julia?

172
00:18:00,757 --> 00:18:01,826
Yes.

173
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:05,876
- Why were you spying on us?
- I just didn't want to interrupt.

174
00:18:07,117 --> 00:18:08,755
- And who is he?
- Who?

175
00:18:08,917 --> 00:18:11,067
- The man who came with you.
- I came alone.

176
00:18:12,477 --> 00:18:14,274
There's someone else here.

177
00:18:14,437 --> 00:18:17,110
A man, and he's right behind you.

178
00:18:36,557 --> 00:18:37,672
Wait!

179
00:20:02,877 --> 00:20:04,629
Who are you?

180
00:20:06,197 --> 00:20:07,266
Turn around.

181
00:20:08,277 --> 00:20:10,074
Turn around.

182
00:20:10,277 --> 00:20:11,710
I said turn around!

183
00:20:46,357 --> 00:20:49,076
No, no!

184
00:21:08,797 --> 00:21:10,469
Isaac?

185
00:21:16,277 --> 00:21:17,995
Isaac?

186
00:21:33,437 --> 00:21:36,349
Hotel Romeo, Bellavista.

187
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,394
What happened to you?

188
00:21:40,557 --> 00:21:42,866
You are soaking wet.

189
00:21:43,037 --> 00:21:45,710
It started raining
when I left Soledad's house.

190
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:48,747
Have you been with her all this time?

191
00:21:49,757 --> 00:21:53,147
She invited me for tea.
I couldn't say no.

192
00:21:53,317 --> 00:21:58,311
Julia, I went to look for you.
You left her place an hour ago.

193
00:21:58,877 --> 00:22:00,868
Where have you been?

194
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,114
Why are you so controlling?

195
00:22:03,277 --> 00:22:05,871
I could also ask you
what you're looking for.

196
00:22:08,957 --> 00:22:10,436
Fine.

197
00:22:11,437 --> 00:22:13,189
Fine.

198
00:22:13,357 --> 00:22:16,872
Now I'm certain there was
something strange in Sara's suicide.

199
00:22:17,037 --> 00:22:21,508
- There's someone watching us.
- Julia, Julia, please.

200
00:22:21,677 --> 00:22:22,871
Who?

201
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,827
Her boyfriend.

202
00:22:27,997 --> 00:22:29,953
- Sara had a boyfriend?
- Yes.

203
00:22:30,117 --> 00:22:31,106
Who told you?

204
00:22:31,277 --> 00:22:33,552
A group of blind girls told me
at the Baumann Centre

205
00:22:33,717 --> 00:22:35,389
and someone was spying on us.

206
00:22:35,557 --> 00:22:38,071
- How do you know?
- Because I ran after him.

207
00:22:38,237 --> 00:22:41,149
- You ran after him?
- Yes, I did.

208
00:22:41,477 --> 00:22:42,876
Isaac.

209
00:22:43,197 --> 00:22:46,792
- Isaac! What are you doing?
- We're leaving this house.

210
00:22:47,437 --> 00:22:50,349
Listen to me. If I have to be
a controlling husband, I will be.

211
00:22:50,517 --> 00:22:52,633
And if I have to drag you out of here,
I will too.

212
00:22:52,797 --> 00:22:55,470
But I won't let you have a seizure.

213
00:22:55,637 --> 00:22:58,390
You know I would never
forgive myself.

214
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:01,397
Your sister's death has hurt us enough.

215
00:23:09,117 --> 00:23:10,835
You're right.

216
00:23:12,237 --> 00:23:14,228
But I don't feel like
going back home.

217
00:23:14,397 --> 00:23:18,436
Why don't we go somewhere,
you and me, alone?

218
00:23:28,237 --> 00:23:30,671
Where would you like to go?

219
00:23:54,037 --> 00:23:58,349
- Are you sure you want to stay there?
- The guide says it's the cosiest hotel.

220
00:24:06,877 --> 00:24:09,027
Nice view, isn't it?

221
00:24:10,517 --> 00:24:13,475
- Julia.
- Yes, yes. It's beautiful.

222
00:24:13,637 --> 00:24:14,990
Thank you.

223
00:24:16,197 --> 00:24:17,425
Julia...

224
00:24:17,597 --> 00:24:20,669
- I'll park the car.
- Yes, OK.

225
00:24:24,197 --> 00:24:26,665
You don't remember my sister,
a blind woman?

226
00:24:26,837 --> 00:24:29,351
Yes, a colleague talked to me about her.

227
00:24:29,517 --> 00:24:31,030
This may sound weird,

228
00:24:31,197 --> 00:24:34,234
but could you find out
the name of the man who was with her?

229
00:24:34,397 --> 00:24:38,948
- There's no name on the receipt.
- Sorry, but I don't remember any man.

230
00:24:39,117 --> 00:24:40,186
The thing is...

231
00:24:40,357 --> 00:24:43,190
my sister is dead,
and I need to find this man.

232
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:46,190
Let me see... I don't understand.

233
00:24:46,357 --> 00:24:48,791
Her booking is not registered.

234
00:24:49,797 --> 00:24:52,357
It's as if all the information
was deleted.

235
00:24:52,517 --> 00:24:56,795
- Are you sure?
- Sorry. It must be a computer problem.

236
00:24:57,597 --> 00:25:02,227
You could try El Arlequin. It's the
restaurant we recommend to our guests.

237
00:25:02,397 --> 00:25:03,830
Thank you.

238
00:25:03,997 --> 00:25:04,986
Thank you.

239
00:25:11,997 --> 00:25:13,191
Thank you.

240
00:25:13,357 --> 00:25:16,667
I don't understand how they can
recommend this restaurant.

241
00:25:16,837 --> 00:25:18,668
I like it.

242
00:25:21,077 --> 00:25:23,511
It's not your style at all.

243
00:25:26,997 --> 00:25:30,353
And that waiter
won't stop staring at you.

244
00:25:30,517 --> 00:25:32,155
Really?

245
00:25:38,077 --> 00:25:40,637
- It's your imagination.
- Maybe.

246
00:25:44,757 --> 00:25:48,636
- My reading glasses...
- In your coat? How weird.

247
00:25:49,637 --> 00:25:53,107
I'll go and get them,
and I'll go to the toilet too.

248
00:25:54,917 --> 00:25:57,636
If he hits on you, just yell.

249
00:26:07,997 --> 00:26:09,874
What a change!

250
00:26:10,197 --> 00:26:14,827
I like it. It highlights your eyes.
By the way, I knew they were green.

251
00:26:15,637 --> 00:26:19,152
You're confusing me with my twin sister.
She was here last week.

252
00:26:19,317 --> 00:26:21,194
With her boyfriend.

253
00:26:21,717 --> 00:26:22,706
Her boyfriend?

254
00:26:22,877 --> 00:26:25,152
She came with a man, didn't she?

255
00:26:25,957 --> 00:26:28,107
Yes, I think so.

256
00:26:29,357 --> 00:26:32,190
- Do you remember his name?
- No, no idea.

257
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:35,155
He was very quiet, very sad.

258
00:26:36,077 --> 00:26:39,353
- Could you describe him?
- Sure, he was...

259
00:26:41,037 --> 00:26:42,914
He was very plain,
like any other man.

260
00:26:43,077 --> 00:26:46,114
But was he tall, short,
blond hair, dark hair?

261
00:26:49,437 --> 00:26:51,155
I can't remember right now.

262
00:26:51,317 --> 00:26:54,036
How can you remember my sister
but nothing about the man?

263
00:26:54,197 --> 00:26:58,190
She drew a bit of attention
with that blindfold.

264
00:27:00,357 --> 00:27:01,346
Blindfold?

265
00:27:01,517 --> 00:27:04,475
She was bandaged after the operation.

266
00:27:08,437 --> 00:27:10,905
- Did she have an operation?
- Of course.

267
00:27:11,077 --> 00:27:12,988
Hence the bet over her eye colour.

268
00:27:13,157 --> 00:27:15,193
She said she'd come
once she'd recovered,

269
00:27:15,357 --> 00:27:17,427
and if I guessed her eye colour,
I could...

270
00:27:17,597 --> 00:27:20,191
- Pablo, can you come for a second?
- Yes, sure.

271
00:27:20,357 --> 00:27:22,552
Excuse me.
My greetings to her.

272
00:27:29,477 --> 00:27:31,672
I couldn't find them.

273
00:27:33,597 --> 00:27:35,713
Let's see how I manage.

274
00:27:41,157 --> 00:27:43,068
Is something wrong?

275
00:27:48,637 --> 00:27:50,787
Sara was here last week.

276
00:27:55,077 --> 00:27:57,637
Julia... what are we doing here?

277
00:27:57,797 --> 00:28:01,949
Isaac, the waiter told me
she had her eyes bandaged.

278
00:28:02,117 --> 00:28:03,345
Do you realise?

279
00:28:04,957 --> 00:28:08,506
If she had the operation and had
a chance to regain her sight,

280
00:28:08,677 --> 00:28:11,635
why would she commit suicide?

281
00:28:11,997 --> 00:28:14,465
Tell me why.

282
00:28:22,357 --> 00:28:24,234
Because the operation didn't work.

283
00:28:26,197 --> 00:28:27,789
What?

284
00:28:28,637 --> 00:28:30,389
It didn't work.

285
00:28:31,917 --> 00:28:35,034
Dr. Roman told me yesterday.

286
00:28:40,957 --> 00:28:43,835
I was waiting for the right moment
to tell you.

287
00:29:03,797 --> 00:29:05,515
That man exists.

288
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:08,237
Julia, Julia.

289
00:29:08,397 --> 00:29:11,195
- Anything else I should know?
- I was only trying to protect you.

290
00:29:11,357 --> 00:29:14,076
- From what?
- From the truth.

291
00:29:14,237 --> 00:29:15,750
What's the truth?

292
00:29:16,677 --> 00:29:20,795
Sara committed suicide because
she couldn't stand being blind.

293
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:30,794
Julia.

294
00:29:32,037 --> 00:29:33,072
Julia.

295
00:29:36,157 --> 00:29:38,671
Did you know she came here
with her boyfriend?

296
00:29:38,837 --> 00:29:40,395
That doesn't prove anything.

297
00:29:40,557 --> 00:29:45,836
And why is he hiding?
Why didn't he show up at the funeral?

298
00:29:46,597 --> 00:29:48,588
Maybe he wasn't with her by then.

299
00:29:49,597 --> 00:29:54,307
Maybe he left her when he found out
she'd never recover her sight.

300
00:29:56,957 --> 00:29:58,993
That easy?

301
00:29:59,557 --> 00:30:00,785
That easy, right?

302
00:30:00,957 --> 00:30:03,266
- Well...
- I can't believe you're a psychologist.

303
00:30:03,437 --> 00:30:05,428
Julia!

304
00:30:07,677 --> 00:30:09,156
God!

305
00:30:12,077 --> 00:30:14,796
What are you doing?

306
00:30:14,957 --> 00:30:16,231
Julia, Julia.

307
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:18,069
Didn't you see the car?

308
00:30:23,637 --> 00:30:26,470
You didn't see it, did you?

309
00:30:32,277 --> 00:30:34,347
How many seizures have you had?

310
00:30:34,517 --> 00:30:35,552
Two.

311
00:30:35,717 --> 00:30:37,753
Shit!

312
00:30:38,877 --> 00:30:40,708
Shit.

313
00:30:47,837 --> 00:30:49,668
lf...

314
00:30:49,837 --> 00:30:54,991
- If I go blind... When I go blind...
- No, no. That won't happen.

315
00:30:56,477 --> 00:30:59,947
Not wanting it
doesn't mean it won't happen.

316
00:31:06,317 --> 00:31:08,035
Isaac...

317
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:13,591
One time you told me that...

318
00:31:15,677 --> 00:31:19,352
...when you looked into my eyes,
you could see the entire universe.

319
00:31:21,597 --> 00:31:25,306
- I still can.
- What if the universe shuts down?

320
00:31:30,277 --> 00:31:32,586
Close your eyes.

321
00:31:33,317 --> 00:31:35,308
What?

322
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:37,433
Close your eyes.

323
00:31:44,717 --> 00:31:46,036
Can you see me?

324
00:31:47,677 --> 00:31:49,508
Of course I can't.

325
00:31:51,437 --> 00:31:53,951
Then how do you know
I'm still here with you?

326
00:31:54,117 --> 00:31:56,551
Because I can hear you.

327
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:01,077
What if I remain silent?

328
00:32:01,237 --> 00:32:03,831
How do you know I'm still here?

329
00:32:17,997 --> 00:32:20,033
I can touch you.

330
00:32:22,757 --> 00:32:25,112
And you can smell me.

331
00:32:27,877 --> 00:32:29,674
And kiss you.

332
00:32:51,917 --> 00:32:55,671
Promise me that when the day comes,
we will go back to the desert.

333
00:32:56,277 --> 00:32:58,233
What?

334
00:32:58,397 --> 00:33:00,308
You know?

335
00:33:01,037 --> 00:33:04,632
The last thing I'd like to see
is that sky, with you.

336
00:33:05,557 --> 00:33:08,549
- Julia...
- Promise me.

337
00:33:09,397 --> 00:33:11,149
Promise me.

338
00:33:12,397 --> 00:33:14,433
I promise you.

339
00:33:16,837 --> 00:33:18,065
But...

340
00:33:18,237 --> 00:33:20,705
But you have to promise me...

341
00:33:22,117 --> 00:33:25,075
...that you will stop chasing ghosts.

342
00:33:25,757 --> 00:33:28,749
And that we will go and see Dr. Roman.

343
00:33:29,637 --> 00:33:31,389
Tomorrow.

344
00:33:33,317 --> 00:33:34,875
OK.

345
00:33:51,157 --> 00:33:55,230
I'll bring the luggage to the car.
I'll wait for you outside.

346
00:33:55,397 --> 00:33:56,716
In 15 minutes.

347
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:07,027
Ms. Levin.

348
00:34:09,197 --> 00:34:11,427
Ms. Levin.

349
00:34:11,957 --> 00:34:14,915
I'm really sorry for your loss.

350
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:18,514
My name is Orespulo.

351
00:34:18,677 --> 00:34:22,033
I read about your sister
in the obituaries section of the newspaper.

352
00:34:22,197 --> 00:34:23,676
Thank you.

353
00:34:24,237 --> 00:34:25,989
I have something of hers.

354
00:34:27,837 --> 00:34:31,147
A few hours after your sister left,

355
00:34:31,317 --> 00:34:36,596
I found a key in her room,
under the bed.

356
00:34:37,477 --> 00:34:40,389
I think I put it here somewhere.

357
00:34:49,117 --> 00:34:50,789
Thank you.

358
00:35:02,837 --> 00:35:04,395
Mr. Orespulo.

359
00:35:04,557 --> 00:35:06,468
I'm sorry.

360
00:35:08,197 --> 00:35:10,313
Mr. Orespulo...

361
00:35:10,477 --> 00:35:12,786
My sister came here with a man,
didn't she?

362
00:35:12,957 --> 00:35:15,266
The invisible man.

363
00:35:18,117 --> 00:35:19,755
I beg your pardon?

364
00:35:21,677 --> 00:35:26,034
Nobody remembers the man
who came with your sister, right?

365
00:35:29,077 --> 00:35:30,590
Well...

366
00:35:30,877 --> 00:35:32,947
That doesn't mean he is invisible.

367
00:35:33,117 --> 00:35:35,677
There are people with no light.

368
00:35:35,837 --> 00:35:39,955
Do you know what it's like to walk in
somewhere and not be noticed?

369
00:35:41,197 --> 00:35:46,032
Or to walk on the street
and have people stumble against you?

370
00:35:48,397 --> 00:35:53,027
Or to ask something for the third time
and have no one answer your question?

371
00:35:53,197 --> 00:35:55,586
That's the man you're looking for.

372
00:35:55,757 --> 00:35:59,033
A pause, a vacuum.

373
00:36:00,237 --> 00:36:01,829
An absence.

374
00:36:02,677 --> 00:36:05,475
That's why nobody remembers him.

375
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,227
Nobody except you.

376
00:36:11,197 --> 00:36:14,234
In a way, I am also invisible.

377
00:36:15,677 --> 00:36:19,386
It's been many years since the last time
someone remembered me.

378
00:36:21,197 --> 00:36:23,108
This man...

379
00:36:23,277 --> 00:36:25,996
do you know where I can find him?

380
00:36:29,197 --> 00:36:31,267
What are you afraid of?

381
00:36:32,277 --> 00:36:36,953
He parked his van in a car park
two blocks down the street.

382
00:36:38,517 --> 00:36:42,749
There's a CCTV camera
recording 24 hours a day.

383
00:36:44,677 --> 00:36:45,951
Thank you.

384
00:36:46,197 --> 00:36:47,789
Wait!

385
00:36:47,957 --> 00:36:49,276
Be careful.

386
00:36:49,437 --> 00:36:54,670
The man who was with your sister
had very angry eyes.

387
00:36:55,197 --> 00:36:57,427
He knows how to be a shadow.

388
00:36:57,597 --> 00:37:01,829
If someone feels invisible
and is angry at the world,

389
00:37:01,997 --> 00:37:03,874
he can be dangerous.

390
00:37:04,037 --> 00:37:06,392
He has no light.
Nobody looks at him.

391
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:09,867
He could sneak up on you and...

392
00:37:34,277 --> 00:37:36,472
- Where have you been?
- Did you see anyone?

393
00:37:36,637 --> 00:37:40,186
- I've been waiting for 10 minutes.
- Wait a moment.

394
00:37:40,357 --> 00:37:43,315
He's here.
And I know how to find him.

395
00:37:48,037 --> 00:37:49,436
- No!
- What are you doing?

396
00:37:49,597 --> 00:37:52,157
- Let me talk to the guard.
- Will you calm down?

397
00:37:52,317 --> 00:37:54,672
- Calm down!
- Wait here.

398
00:37:54,837 --> 00:37:56,828
Don't be so rude!

399
00:37:56,997 --> 00:38:00,034
I remind you
that you made a promise last night.

400
00:38:00,197 --> 00:38:01,710
- Enough.
- I can't take it any more!

401
00:38:01,877 --> 00:38:04,107
- I said don't yell at me!
- I've had it!

402
00:38:04,277 --> 00:38:06,268
There's no mystery in Sara's death!

403
00:38:06,437 --> 00:38:09,588
Do you want the footage?
You'll have it.

404
00:38:09,757 --> 00:38:13,272
But this shit ends
right here, right now, all right?

405
00:38:35,517 --> 00:38:36,870
You've reached...

406
00:39:01,677 --> 00:39:02,666
Excuse me.

407
00:39:02,837 --> 00:39:06,193
Has anyone been here
asking about security videos?

408
00:39:06,957 --> 00:39:09,425
Look... I don't want any trouble, OK?

409
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:12,589
That guy came, gave me some money
and I promised to keep my mouth shut.

410
00:39:12,757 --> 00:39:15,715
He is my husband.
I've been waiting for a while.

411
00:39:15,877 --> 00:39:18,345
Do you know which way he went out?

412
00:39:18,917 --> 00:39:23,433
He left as soon as my little friend
made the copies he wanted.

413
00:39:23,597 --> 00:39:25,189
And...

414
00:39:25,357 --> 00:39:27,234
Was there anyone else here?

415
00:39:27,397 --> 00:39:29,274
- Are you sure?
- Nobody.

416
00:39:29,437 --> 00:39:33,066
We can check the monitors
in case we see something.

417
00:39:33,677 --> 00:39:35,554
What the hell?

418
00:39:42,197 --> 00:39:43,266
I'll be right back.

419
00:39:47,877 --> 00:39:49,754
Goddammit!

420
00:39:50,797 --> 00:39:52,389
What's wrong?

421
00:39:59,197 --> 00:40:00,755
Calm down. It's me.

422
00:40:00,917 --> 00:40:02,908
Someone has switched off the power.

423
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,875
It's impossible.

424
00:40:08,957 --> 00:40:10,629
It's impossible.

425
00:40:35,357 --> 00:40:37,587
My husband has been kidnapped.
He's in danger.

426
00:40:37,757 --> 00:40:41,306
OK, the only thing we know is that
someone stole some CCTV footage.

427
00:40:41,477 --> 00:40:46,505
No, I've already told you.
It was the man who was with my sister.

428
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:49,475
You have to find him
before it's too late.

429
00:40:49,637 --> 00:40:54,506
How can we find someone
that nobody has seen, not even you?

430
00:40:59,797 --> 00:41:00,786
Orespulo.

431
00:41:46,957 --> 00:41:49,869
- He killed him because he was...
- No evidence of violence.

432
00:41:50,037 --> 00:41:52,756
...the only who could recognise
the invisible man.

433
00:41:52,917 --> 00:41:55,670
- He's erasing his tracks.
- What do you mean?

434
00:41:55,837 --> 00:41:58,067
My husband is in danger!

435
00:41:58,237 --> 00:42:00,546
- Calm down, madam!
- Isaac!

436
00:42:01,197 --> 00:42:02,949
Call a doctor, quick.

437
00:42:03,117 --> 00:42:05,836
We need a doctor down here.

438
00:42:09,757 --> 00:42:10,746
Isaac.

439
00:42:26,637 --> 00:42:28,673
The process is irreversible.

440
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:30,509
How long do I have?

441
00:42:30,677 --> 00:42:34,670
I don't know...
Perhaps a few hours, days.

442
00:42:34,837 --> 00:42:37,670
Maybe a few weeks.
Definitely less than a month.

443
00:42:37,837 --> 00:42:40,590
We have to find a donor
and operate as soon as possible.

444
00:42:40,757 --> 00:42:42,475
Did you know Sara's boyfriend?

445
00:42:44,957 --> 00:42:46,993
No, I didn't know him.

446
00:42:47,997 --> 00:42:51,706
Julia, I know you're going through
a hard time,

447
00:42:51,877 --> 00:42:54,710
but you have to think about yourself.

448
00:42:54,877 --> 00:42:58,756
So, please,
try to avoid emotional stress.

449
00:42:58,917 --> 00:43:02,193
And don't force your eyes. OK?

450
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,146
Ivan. Ivan.

451
00:43:30,317 --> 00:43:32,035
A boyfriend?

452
00:43:32,197 --> 00:43:35,394
Sara never told me
about any boyfriends.

453
00:43:35,557 --> 00:43:38,025
She didn't trust men.

454
00:43:38,197 --> 00:43:40,188
Unlike me.

455
00:43:40,357 --> 00:43:43,030
- Or you.
- Isaac hasn't left me, I'm sure.

456
00:43:43,877 --> 00:43:46,027
That's what all women think.

457
00:43:46,877 --> 00:43:50,267
I also came up with a story
when my husband left me.

458
00:43:50,997 --> 00:43:54,228
He couldn't stand my son Angel.

459
00:43:54,397 --> 00:43:57,673
And my son was more important
than anything else.

460
00:43:58,397 --> 00:44:03,027
Then my eyes started to degenerate
and I went blind.

461
00:44:03,517 --> 00:44:06,509
Luckily, Angel looked after me
for 10 years,

462
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:10,386
until I woke up one morning...

463
00:44:10,557 --> 00:44:12,468
and he was gone.

464
00:44:12,637 --> 00:44:14,628
My son was gone.

465
00:44:15,717 --> 00:44:19,232
What kind of son abandons
a blind mother?

466
00:44:20,277 --> 00:44:22,472
I had to come up with a story.

467
00:44:22,637 --> 00:44:25,197
And I still keep to it.

468
00:44:27,437 --> 00:44:29,234
Such humiliation!
I'm sorry.

469
00:44:38,837 --> 00:44:39,872
Hello?

470
00:44:40,037 --> 00:44:43,234
The hotel is fully automated.
There are no staff.

471
00:44:43,397 --> 00:44:45,991
Guests check in through a machine.

472
00:44:46,157 --> 00:44:49,513
They called from the bank this morning
to inform me about a transaction

473
00:44:49,677 --> 00:44:51,747
with your husband's credit card.

474
00:44:51,917 --> 00:44:56,513
I searched the room
and found this on the bedside table.

475
00:44:57,397 --> 00:45:00,707
Julia, there's things about your husband
you don't know.

476
00:45:01,877 --> 00:45:05,950
- He kept Sara's surgery from you.
- To protect me. The doctor told me...

477
00:45:06,117 --> 00:45:09,712
The doctor didn't talk to anybody
about the surgery.

478
00:45:10,757 --> 00:45:13,669
How did your husband know?

479
00:45:13,837 --> 00:45:19,673
Inspector, a patrol just drove by
Sara's house and saw light inside.

480
00:45:25,117 --> 00:45:26,914
Isaac?

481
00:45:28,317 --> 00:45:30,831
Wait here. Don't move.

482
00:46:01,837 --> 00:46:03,270
Isaac?

483
00:46:22,917 --> 00:46:24,350
Hello?

484
00:46:26,677 --> 00:46:28,429
Isaac?

485
00:46:33,997 --> 00:46:35,112
Isaac?

486
00:46:46,597 --> 00:46:48,076
Julia!

487
00:46:49,157 --> 00:46:51,990
Shit! I have to get out of here.

488
00:46:52,157 --> 00:46:55,035
Where is it? Stay calm.

489
00:46:55,757 --> 00:46:58,954
Where is the door? Stay calm.

490
00:47:00,197 --> 00:47:02,711
Julia? Julia?

491
00:47:06,037 --> 00:47:09,632
Inspector! There's somebody
down here. Inspector!

492
00:47:13,317 --> 00:47:15,035
Julia, calm down. It's me.

493
00:47:17,957 --> 00:47:20,346
There's somebody here.

494
00:47:22,037 --> 00:47:23,755
There's somebody here.

495
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,633
What's wrong?

496
00:47:35,797 --> 00:47:37,196
What's wrong?

497
00:47:38,797 --> 00:47:41,789
Turn on the torch.
I hate darkness.

498
00:47:42,517 --> 00:47:46,396
Please, say something.
Why aren't you saying anything?

499
00:48:01,757 --> 00:48:03,395
Thank you.

500
00:48:06,477 --> 00:48:07,876
Hi.

501
00:48:11,757 --> 00:48:14,510
There's something
you should know, Julia.

502
00:48:15,157 --> 00:48:17,796
Your husband left a letter.

503
00:48:18,277 --> 00:48:22,634
We checked the handwriting
and there is no doubt it's his.

504
00:48:23,677 --> 00:48:25,315
Listen...

505
00:48:26,317 --> 00:48:30,026
Sara and Isaac
had been lovers for six months.

506
00:48:30,597 --> 00:48:33,350
He apologises in the letter.

507
00:48:34,157 --> 00:48:39,550
That explains the numerous calls to her
we found on his mobile phone.

508
00:48:41,597 --> 00:48:44,475
Did you know
they were in touch lately?

509
00:48:54,397 --> 00:48:56,149
Think, Julia.

510
00:48:56,317 --> 00:49:00,230
Did Isaac insist on getting the video?

511
00:49:00,397 --> 00:49:04,709
Probably because he didn't want you
to see him on it.

512
00:49:05,877 --> 00:49:11,429
Then he went back to the motel and
decided he couldn't live without Sara.

513
00:49:14,197 --> 00:49:17,507
I'm sorry, but everything makes sense.

514
00:49:31,157 --> 00:49:33,751
We found a donor.
We can operate tomorrow.

515
00:49:33,917 --> 00:49:36,147
You just have to sign here.

516
00:49:42,877 --> 00:49:44,469
Thank you.

517
00:50:04,317 --> 00:50:06,387
Calm down, Julia!

518
00:50:06,957 --> 00:50:10,711
Calm down. Sleep a bit more.

519
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:16,987
OK, Julia... Everything went well.

520
00:50:17,997 --> 00:50:20,386
But we have to be careful now.

521
00:50:20,557 --> 00:50:24,630
You eyes must be protected
from the light for two weeks.

522
00:50:25,077 --> 00:50:27,272
And don't manipulate
the bandages yourself.

523
00:50:27,437 --> 00:50:31,350
If you remove them too soon,
there won't be a solution.

524
00:50:31,517 --> 00:50:34,907
But don't worry,
you will be taken care of.

525
00:50:35,397 --> 00:50:36,750
No.

526
00:50:36,917 --> 00:50:39,750
I'd rather go home.
I hate hospitals.

527
00:50:39,917 --> 00:50:42,556
I know,
but I'm afraid that's impossible.

528
00:50:42,717 --> 00:50:47,393
- You need supervision.
- I could... go to my sister's house.

529
00:50:47,557 --> 00:50:50,117
I know my way around it very well.

530
00:50:51,917 --> 00:50:54,750
Julia, honestly,
I don't think it's a good idea.

531
00:50:54,917 --> 00:50:58,592
Right, but if I can't see, I can't feel.

532
00:51:01,237 --> 00:51:05,435
All right, let's do this.
You can go to your sister's house.

533
00:51:05,597 --> 00:51:09,590
But a care worker will visit you
every day, OK?

534
00:51:14,917 --> 00:51:18,193
Julia, there's something else.

535
00:51:19,917 --> 00:51:23,227
Your husband's body is still here.
I can take care of it if you want.

536
00:51:23,397 --> 00:51:25,149
No.

537
00:51:26,877 --> 00:51:29,675
I'd rather do it myself.

538
00:51:30,477 --> 00:51:33,833
Could you keep the body
until I can see again?

539
00:51:33,997 --> 00:51:36,716
I need to say goodbye to him.

540
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:49,346
Let's sit on the sofa. Slowly.

541
00:51:49,517 --> 00:51:51,348
Keep walking...

542
00:51:51,717 --> 00:51:54,390
- Here are your things.
- Thank you.

543
00:51:55,757 --> 00:51:58,908
- Careful. Don't worry.
- No problem.

544
00:52:02,757 --> 00:52:05,590
Shall we wait here
until the care worker arrives?

545
00:52:05,757 --> 00:52:08,430
- Can you do me a favour?
- Sure. What is it?

546
00:52:08,597 --> 00:52:10,986
I'd like to know what this key opens.

547
00:52:21,997 --> 00:52:24,636
Whatever it is this key opens,
it's not here.

548
00:52:24,797 --> 00:52:27,869
- Did you try every lock?
- I did.

549
00:52:28,037 --> 00:52:30,312
Do you need anything else?

550
00:52:30,477 --> 00:52:32,115
No, thank you.

551
00:52:32,277 --> 00:52:34,791
- You can go.
- All right.

552
00:53:41,677 --> 00:53:43,554
- Hello?
- Hi.

553
00:53:43,717 --> 00:53:46,834
You must be Julia.
I'm Ivan, the care worker.

554
00:53:46,997 --> 00:53:50,785
Sorry I'm late. The traffic was bad.
I phoned you, but it got cut off.

555
00:53:53,917 --> 00:53:56,351
I would have preferred a woman.

556
00:53:58,717 --> 00:54:01,231
If you want to call Dr. Roman...
What happened to your hand?

557
00:54:04,997 --> 00:54:09,593
It's just a scratch. You won't
feel anything tomorrow morning.

558
00:54:10,597 --> 00:54:14,749
I will make you dinner
and clean up a bit. You stay here.

559
00:54:15,797 --> 00:54:17,276
By the way...

560
00:54:18,677 --> 00:54:21,555
What should I do with the glasses?

561
00:54:21,717 --> 00:54:23,230
Throw them out.

562
00:54:26,797 --> 00:54:30,676
While you ate,
I familiarised myself with the house.

563
00:54:31,557 --> 00:54:33,036
Julia.

564
00:54:36,037 --> 00:54:38,756
- What are you doing?
- Sorry. I have to go.

565
00:54:38,917 --> 00:54:40,635
What time is it?

566
00:54:40,797 --> 00:54:42,788
It's nine o'clock.

567
00:54:42,957 --> 00:54:45,266
On the first days,
we lose track of time.

568
00:54:46,477 --> 00:54:49,833
I'll give you a couple
of sleeping pills, just in case.

569
00:54:49,997 --> 00:54:52,750
And also a pager.

570
00:54:52,917 --> 00:54:56,546
If you want to contact me,
press this button. Give me your hand.

571
00:54:56,957 --> 00:54:59,676
Look, here's the button.

572
00:55:07,957 --> 00:55:09,072
Let's go.

573
00:55:09,237 --> 00:55:11,876
- What are you doing?
- I have to put you to bed.

574
00:55:12,437 --> 00:55:16,146
- Sorry, but I can do it myself.
- Are you sure?

575
00:55:24,797 --> 00:55:26,469
Are you OK?

576
00:55:27,477 --> 00:55:29,786
OK, you win.

577
00:55:29,957 --> 00:55:31,993
Put me to bed and then you can go.

578
00:55:57,117 --> 00:55:58,675
Who's there?

579
00:56:02,957 --> 00:56:06,074
Calm down.
Calm down, darling.

580
00:56:07,117 --> 00:56:08,630
It's me.

581
00:56:08,797 --> 00:56:10,515
Isaac?

582
00:56:12,317 --> 00:56:13,466
Isaac?

583
00:56:14,477 --> 00:56:16,627
How can this be?

584
00:56:21,917 --> 00:56:24,351
Don't say anything.

585
00:56:25,677 --> 00:56:27,315
Thank you.

586
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:33,705
- What are you doing?
- Taking this dirty bandage off.

587
00:56:34,317 --> 00:56:37,229
- So you can see me better.
- No!

588
00:56:39,317 --> 00:56:40,909
That's it, that's it.

589
00:56:41,597 --> 00:56:44,873
Leave me alone.
Get off me! Get off me!

590
00:56:45,597 --> 00:56:50,876
Don't resist, little sister.
We're two against one.

591
00:56:55,517 --> 00:56:57,109
Don't move.

592
00:56:57,277 --> 00:56:59,188
No, stop!

593
00:57:01,397 --> 00:57:02,625
Get off me!

594
00:57:37,997 --> 00:57:39,715
Ivan. Ivan.

595
00:57:39,877 --> 00:57:41,993
Julia, is everything OK?

596
00:57:42,157 --> 00:57:45,672
- I think there's someone in the house.
- What?

597
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:47,987
In the room next door.

598
00:57:48,397 --> 00:57:52,185
- Don't move. I'II call the police.
- No, Ivan, Ivan.

599
00:58:05,637 --> 00:58:07,673
Are you still there?

600
00:58:09,757 --> 00:58:12,555
You have to get me out of here
right now.

601
00:58:12,717 --> 00:58:15,914
- Where are you?
- In the guest room.

602
00:58:16,077 --> 00:58:18,716
That's good.
Find the door and get out of the room.

603
00:58:20,517 --> 00:58:22,985
Find the door to your right.

604
00:58:24,997 --> 00:58:26,510
- He's there.
- Calm down.

605
00:58:26,677 --> 00:58:29,396
The handrail is in front of you.
Look for it.

606
00:58:29,557 --> 00:58:30,990
OK, yes.

607
00:58:31,157 --> 00:58:33,352
Hold onto the handrail.

608
00:58:33,517 --> 00:58:36,395
Go down the six steps
to the first Ianding.

609
00:58:40,317 --> 00:58:42,512
Then there's nine more.

610
00:58:44,877 --> 00:58:46,356
Julia...

611
00:58:47,437 --> 00:58:52,386
- I'm downstairs. What now?
- Follow the wall to the door.

612
00:58:59,397 --> 00:59:01,228
Who are you?
Who are you?

613
00:59:01,397 --> 00:59:03,115
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

614
00:59:03,277 --> 00:59:05,837
Get out of the housel QuickI

615
00:59:21,717 --> 00:59:24,993
There is no indication
that someone entered the house.

616
00:59:25,157 --> 00:59:28,706
There was someone there.
And he was looking for something.

617
00:59:28,877 --> 00:59:32,187
Sorry, but there's nothing else
I can do.

618
00:59:35,917 --> 00:59:38,067
- Do you want me to call the hospital?
- Why?

619
00:59:38,237 --> 00:59:41,832
Maybe you shouldn't recover here,
considering what you've been through.

620
00:59:41,997 --> 00:59:43,749
You don't believe me either.

621
00:59:43,917 --> 00:59:49,150
I'm just saying that in your situation,
it's normal if your senses deceive you.

622
00:59:49,317 --> 00:59:52,389
Don't open your eyes now.

623
00:59:54,197 --> 00:59:56,153
You can let go now.

624
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,429
What's the matter?

625
01:00:01,237 --> 01:00:03,148
My eyes could get damaged, right?

626
01:00:03,317 --> 01:00:07,913
No, I only want to change the bandage,
and I took precautions.

627
01:00:08,077 --> 01:00:11,035
I've done this a hundred times.
Don't worry.

628
01:00:15,237 --> 01:00:17,910
You know, when I was 20 years old,

629
01:00:18,077 --> 01:00:21,035
I had a car accident
and I was blind for two months.

630
01:00:22,957 --> 01:00:28,714
And like you now,
I imagined things and had nightmares.

631
01:00:28,877 --> 01:00:31,232
And I rejected the care worker's help.

632
01:00:33,917 --> 01:00:36,351
I couldn't stand the idea
of going blind.

633
01:00:42,357 --> 01:00:44,712
In the end, I recovered my sight.

634
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,991
But during those months...

635
01:00:51,197 --> 01:00:54,348
...I understood what it was like
to live in the dark.

636
01:00:58,077 --> 01:01:00,511
That's why I became a care worker.

637
01:01:01,677 --> 01:01:03,952
You made that up
to make me feel better.

638
01:01:04,117 --> 01:01:07,507
No, no. Call the hospital
if you don't believe me.

639
01:01:08,037 --> 01:01:13,430
Julia, I know you're scared,
but the only way to lose that fear

640
01:01:13,597 --> 01:01:15,394
is to fight it.

641
01:01:21,837 --> 01:01:23,668
What do you say?

642
01:01:26,037 --> 01:01:27,868
Will you let me help you?

643
01:01:36,997 --> 01:01:38,669
- What happened?
- You spilled it.

644
01:01:38,837 --> 01:01:42,386
Try to get to the door.
Follow the wall with your hand...

645
01:01:45,877 --> 01:01:47,913
And after the glass cabinet...

646
01:02:10,557 --> 01:02:13,993
Well, I have my ups and downs.

647
01:02:14,157 --> 01:02:16,307
But I slept very well
the last few nights.

648
01:02:16,477 --> 01:02:19,594
Ivan has been
very patient with me all week.

649
01:02:19,757 --> 01:02:21,713
Yes, he takes good care of me.

650
01:02:21,877 --> 01:02:24,869
I will. I will, yes.

651
01:02:25,037 --> 01:02:27,028
Thanks a lot for calling. Bye.

652
01:02:28,757 --> 01:02:32,193
- Are you leaving?
- Yes. It's a little late.

653
01:02:32,357 --> 01:02:34,313
Why don't stay a bit longer?

654
01:02:36,117 --> 01:02:37,470
A little while.

655
01:02:37,637 --> 01:02:39,832
- Are you still afraid?
- No.

656
01:02:39,997 --> 01:02:41,669
No, it's not that.

657
01:02:42,517 --> 01:02:44,189
Never mind.

658
01:02:46,357 --> 01:02:48,587
OK, should I make
a special dinner for two?

659
01:02:50,317 --> 01:02:53,593
- Go and watch TV. I'll cook.
- That's a little difficult.

660
01:03:15,317 --> 01:03:17,273
Aren't you drinking too much?

661
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,913
I'm celebrating.

662
01:03:20,077 --> 01:03:21,510
What?

663
01:03:21,677 --> 01:03:25,192
That in four days,

664
01:03:25,357 --> 01:03:28,474
I will have the bandages removed
and I will see again.

665
01:03:29,957 --> 01:03:32,073
Everything will be all right, Julia.

666
01:03:33,357 --> 01:03:35,348
You know,

667
01:03:35,517 --> 01:03:39,510
if the operation doesn't work,
I couldn't complain.

668
01:03:40,237 --> 01:03:43,115
I have seen everything I wanted to see.

669
01:03:44,517 --> 01:03:47,748
What's the most beautiful thing
you've ever seen?

670
01:03:49,077 --> 01:03:50,715
Funny!

671
01:03:50,877 --> 01:03:53,232
How ironic that you ask me that.

672
01:03:53,397 --> 01:03:54,989
Why?

673
01:03:56,797 --> 01:04:01,234
Because I spent my whole life
looking for invisible planets.

674
01:04:01,397 --> 01:04:04,469
My eyes have seen amazing things.

675
01:04:05,157 --> 01:04:10,948
But nothing can compare
to the sky in the Sahara.

676
01:04:13,597 --> 01:04:16,236
That's where I met Isaac.

677
01:04:16,397 --> 01:04:21,425
We were on the same excursion
and we spent the whole night...

678
01:04:22,477 --> 01:04:24,945
...staring at the sky.

679
01:04:25,877 --> 01:04:30,109
I asked him, ''Is that not the most
beautiful thing you've ever seen?''

680
01:04:30,837 --> 01:04:33,146
And he said, ''Yes.''

681
01:04:38,677 --> 01:04:40,872
When I turned my head,

682
01:04:41,037 --> 01:04:45,428
I realised that he'd been watching me
for a while and I got nervous.

683
01:04:46,517 --> 01:04:48,428
And I asked him...

684
01:04:50,917 --> 01:04:53,829
...''Why aren't you watching
the universe?''

685
01:04:54,477 --> 01:04:59,392
And he said,
''I don't have to look up to do it.''

686
01:05:00,677 --> 01:05:03,874
''I can see the universe in your eyes.''

687
01:05:05,997 --> 01:05:07,828
And what happened?

688
01:05:10,517 --> 01:05:12,348
I came close.

689
01:05:13,557 --> 01:05:15,115
I touched him.

690
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:19,234
And I realised that he was nervous too.

691
01:05:19,757 --> 01:05:23,796
In that moment it was as if
we became one person.

692
01:05:23,957 --> 01:05:26,710
And I wanted to know
if he felt the same.

693
01:05:27,037 --> 01:05:29,073
What did he say?

694
01:05:30,037 --> 01:05:31,629
Nothing.

695
01:05:33,237 --> 01:05:35,671
He replied with his gaze.

696
01:05:35,837 --> 01:05:37,395
Why?

697
01:05:37,557 --> 01:05:41,072
Why did he look at me that way? Why?

698
01:05:42,477 --> 01:05:46,311
- Do you prefer I hadn't done it?
- I don't know.

699
01:05:47,037 --> 01:05:52,236
When you had the affair with Sara,
I thought it was just an indiscretion,

700
01:05:52,397 --> 01:05:55,548
but I swear I don't know
what to think any more.

701
01:05:56,437 --> 01:05:58,507
I don't know what to think.

702
01:06:01,757 --> 01:06:04,351
Everything will be all right, Julia.

703
01:06:06,437 --> 01:06:08,189
You promise?

704
01:06:09,837 --> 01:06:11,748
I promise.

705
01:06:29,237 --> 01:06:30,750
No, I can't.

706
01:06:30,917 --> 01:06:32,908
I can't do it.

707
01:06:33,437 --> 01:06:35,428
It's not right.

708
01:06:41,397 --> 01:06:43,308
- Ivan.
- Don't say anything.

709
01:06:43,477 --> 01:06:46,753
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be. Don't say anything.

710
01:06:46,917 --> 01:06:49,192
I'll call the hospital
and ask to be replaced.

711
01:06:49,357 --> 01:06:51,029
Is that what you want?

712
01:06:52,677 --> 01:06:54,315
And you?

713
01:07:01,757 --> 01:07:04,794
OK, I'll come back tomorrow and...

714
01:07:05,637 --> 01:07:08,470
If not, just contact me on my pager.

715
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:37,632
Help! Help!

716
01:08:39,917 --> 01:08:41,316
Help!

717
01:08:42,957 --> 01:08:46,950
Calm down!
I'm Blasco, the neighbour! Lia's father!

718
01:08:47,117 --> 01:08:49,472
Call the police, please!

719
01:08:50,517 --> 01:08:53,077
Calm down!
You need a drink.

720
01:08:53,237 --> 01:08:56,752
No, no.
Call the police, please.

721
01:08:56,917 --> 01:09:00,796
Why do you want to call the police?
To tell another one of your nightmares?

722
01:09:00,957 --> 01:09:04,916
- The last time they didn't believe you.
- No. There was someone by my bed.

723
01:09:05,077 --> 01:09:06,829
I swear, this time it's true.

724
01:09:06,997 --> 01:09:09,636
And what did he want?
To rape you?

725
01:09:11,077 --> 01:09:13,147
It's my daughter.
Don't be afraid.

726
01:09:13,317 --> 01:09:15,387
I told you not to sneak up on people!

727
01:09:15,557 --> 01:09:17,513
Go back to your bed!

728
01:09:17,917 --> 01:09:20,272
And close the door!

729
01:09:20,437 --> 01:09:22,473
Mr. Blasco...

730
01:09:23,557 --> 01:09:25,673
Can you call now, please?

731
01:09:28,917 --> 01:09:32,273
Of course, of course.
Don't worry.

732
01:09:34,397 --> 01:09:37,195
How strange.
There's no line.

733
01:09:39,637 --> 01:09:41,514
Calm down.

734
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:43,713
I'll get the mobile phone.

735
01:10:18,517 --> 01:10:23,591
The mobile is out of battery.
It will take a few minutes to charge.

736
01:10:25,597 --> 01:10:29,590
Sit down, sit down.

737
01:10:29,997 --> 01:10:31,874
Sit down.

738
01:10:32,717 --> 01:10:33,866
What do you say?

739
01:10:34,037 --> 01:10:39,634
Do you want something to drink
while we wait?

740
01:10:40,357 --> 01:10:43,554
- What do you say?
- Could I have a glass of water?

741
01:10:43,717 --> 01:10:48,472
- Water?
- Yes, my throat is a bit dry.

742
01:11:04,997 --> 01:11:08,034
Julia, where are you going?

743
01:11:08,917 --> 01:11:10,396
Hey!

744
01:11:11,117 --> 01:11:12,630
Hey!

745
01:11:13,077 --> 01:11:16,353
Madam!
Where are you, madam?

746
01:11:16,597 --> 01:11:18,269
Madam!

747
01:11:19,557 --> 01:11:21,991
Please, pick up.

748
01:11:22,757 --> 01:11:24,349
Ivan.

749
01:11:24,637 --> 01:11:26,355
Pick up, please.

750
01:11:26,517 --> 01:11:27,506
Julia, what's wrong?

751
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:42,230
- Julia!
- Ivan!

752
01:11:42,397 --> 01:11:45,628
- Let's go to your house.
- Not my house.

753
01:11:45,797 --> 01:11:48,027
- Julia, calm down.
- No, my house is not safe.

754
01:11:48,197 --> 01:11:50,757
Please. Take me to your place.

755
01:11:52,437 --> 01:11:54,029
OK.

756
01:11:54,197 --> 01:11:57,314
OK, thanks. Bye.

757
01:11:59,477 --> 01:12:01,229
What did they say?

758
01:12:02,317 --> 01:12:05,275
Inspector Dimas
won't be on duty until seven.

759
01:12:06,397 --> 01:12:10,754
You should get some rest
and I'll go with you tomorrow morning.

760
01:12:10,917 --> 01:12:14,705
Julia, I won't let anyone hurt you.

761
01:12:16,397 --> 01:12:17,750
You can sleep in my bed.

762
01:12:17,917 --> 01:12:20,590
- And you?
- I have a mattress. I'll be right back.

763
01:12:20,757 --> 01:12:24,830
- No, no.
- I'll be right back. You're safe here.

764
01:12:24,997 --> 01:12:26,669
I'll be back in a minute.

765
01:12:41,877 --> 01:12:43,390
Ivan?

766
01:13:22,597 --> 01:13:24,235
- Who are you?
- I'm Lia.

767
01:13:24,397 --> 01:13:25,910
- Who are you?
- Lia Blasco.

768
01:13:26,077 --> 01:13:27,874
Don't get close.
How did you find me?

769
01:13:28,037 --> 01:13:31,188
- I followed you. I was Sara's friend.
- I said don't come close.

770
01:13:31,357 --> 01:13:34,986
Listen, my father
has nothing to do with all this.

771
01:13:35,157 --> 01:13:38,866
- Your father lied to me.
- My father is lonely, and you're hot.

772
01:13:39,037 --> 01:13:40,231
I don't believe you.

773
01:13:40,397 --> 01:13:43,833
I was the one who took the key
and have been spying on you.

774
01:13:43,997 --> 01:13:45,794
- You?
- Do you have nightmares?

775
01:13:45,957 --> 01:13:48,630
- What?
- Sara also had them.

776
01:13:48,797 --> 01:13:53,234
She dreamt of someone taking the bandage
off and piercing her eyes with needles.

777
01:13:53,397 --> 01:13:54,796
There's a monster on the street,

778
01:13:54,957 --> 01:13:57,425
but no one can see him
because he hides in the darkness.

779
01:13:57,597 --> 01:13:59,713
He made Sara go blind
and will do the same with you.

780
01:13:59,877 --> 01:14:01,356
- Stop!
- It's him.

781
01:14:01,517 --> 01:14:05,032
I followed him and tried the key.
And today I saw the needles again.

782
01:14:05,197 --> 01:14:08,234
- It's him, Julia. It's the care worker.
- No.

783
01:14:09,677 --> 01:14:11,952
Listen to me!

784
01:14:13,317 --> 01:14:16,354
Do you really think Isaac
killed himself? He loved you.

785
01:14:16,517 --> 01:14:20,715
- He loved Sara more.
- They didn't want to worry you.

786
01:14:20,877 --> 01:14:23,391
That's why they kept you in the dark.
Sara told me.

787
01:14:23,557 --> 01:14:25,946
Isaac wrote a suicide note.
Leave me alone.

788
01:14:26,117 --> 01:14:29,905
- The monster forced him to write it.
- Monsters don't exist. Enough!

789
01:14:30,077 --> 01:14:31,795
This one does.

790
01:14:33,357 --> 01:14:35,427
He collects pictures.

791
01:14:35,837 --> 01:14:39,830
His wall is covered
with pictures of you and Sara.

792
01:14:40,517 --> 01:14:43,987
- He removed your eyes.
- Lia, that's enough!

793
01:14:44,157 --> 01:14:45,476
Leave me alone!

794
01:14:47,717 --> 01:14:49,230
What are you doing?

795
01:14:51,957 --> 01:14:54,232
Use the key if you don't believe me.

796
01:14:55,917 --> 01:14:58,272
The key. Where's the key?

797
01:14:58,437 --> 01:15:00,507
- He took it.
- No, you took it.

798
01:15:00,677 --> 01:15:04,306
- Why me?
- I don't know. To protect your father.

799
01:15:04,477 --> 01:15:07,867
- It's him. Don't tell him I'm here.
- Lia. Lia.

800
01:15:11,677 --> 01:15:12,826
Ivan?

801
01:15:12,997 --> 01:15:15,511
Julia, what are you doing?

802
01:15:15,677 --> 01:15:17,872
I'm really nervous.

803
01:15:18,877 --> 01:15:21,232
I'll make you a cup of tea.

804
01:15:21,397 --> 01:15:23,115
It will help you relax.

805
01:15:23,877 --> 01:15:26,311
- Ivan...
- Yes?

806
01:15:27,317 --> 01:15:31,833
I can't find the key. It's the only
evidence to incriminate Blasco.

807
01:15:32,477 --> 01:15:34,627
Did you take it?

808
01:15:46,917 --> 01:15:49,590
- You must have dropped it.
- Please, give it to me.

809
01:15:49,757 --> 01:15:51,873
I'll keep it for you.
You are very nervous.

810
01:15:52,037 --> 01:15:55,473
I'll make you a cup of tea.
You sit down and relax.

811
01:16:03,917 --> 01:16:06,556
He's lying. He had the key.

812
01:16:06,717 --> 01:16:09,106
- We have to get out of here.
- I don't want to.

813
01:16:09,277 --> 01:16:12,713
- You don't believe me now?
- It's impossible. He is a care worker.

814
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:17,876
Shit! It's locked.

815
01:16:19,197 --> 01:16:20,949
- Julia!
- Yes?

816
01:16:22,037 --> 01:16:24,631
- Do you want sugar?
- Two teaspoons, thanks.

817
01:16:28,637 --> 01:16:30,628
He wants to drug you and make you blind.

818
01:16:30,797 --> 01:16:31,866
What are you saying?

819
01:16:32,037 --> 01:16:34,267
- Can you take this off?
- No. Why?

820
01:16:34,437 --> 01:16:38,794
Then we can't get out of the window.
I need to get the key.

821
01:16:38,957 --> 01:16:42,029
Get rid of him
and wait for me in the bathroom.

822
01:16:44,317 --> 01:16:46,308
Here you go.

823
01:16:47,117 --> 01:16:50,632
I'll take you to bed
and wait until you fall asleep.

824
01:16:55,837 --> 01:16:57,953
I need to go to the bathroom.

825
01:16:59,477 --> 01:17:00,956
OK.

826
01:17:04,997 --> 01:17:06,225
Thank you.

827
01:17:42,077 --> 01:17:45,592
- Julia, is everything all right?
- Yes. What was that noise?

828
01:17:45,757 --> 01:17:47,748
I don't know. I heard it too.

829
01:17:47,917 --> 01:17:50,226
I thought something had happened to you.

830
01:17:50,397 --> 01:17:54,231
- Hurry up, or your tea will get cold.
- I'll be right out.

831
01:17:58,717 --> 01:18:01,868
Lia, please.

832
01:18:04,277 --> 01:18:06,632
Four days left. Only four days.

833
01:18:08,797 --> 01:18:11,072
Four days, four days.

834
01:18:24,917 --> 01:18:27,590
Julia, I have to go down again.
Are you OK?

835
01:18:27,757 --> 01:18:30,191
Yes, I'll be right out.

836
01:19:47,477 --> 01:19:49,115
Lia.

837
01:19:50,517 --> 01:19:51,632
Lia.

838
01:20:22,597 --> 01:20:24,667
What are you doing here?

839
01:20:27,677 --> 01:20:29,713
Why are you crying?

840
01:20:32,237 --> 01:20:34,228
Please, answer me.

841
01:20:35,957 --> 01:20:39,711
A girl called Lia came to see me.

842
01:20:39,877 --> 01:20:42,027
Blasco's daughter.

843
01:20:42,197 --> 01:20:44,188
And she made me very nervous.

844
01:20:44,357 --> 01:20:48,145
- Why did you take the bandage off?
- I couldn't see anything.

845
01:20:48,317 --> 01:20:52,674
She told me horrible things about you
and I was afraid.

846
01:20:53,117 --> 01:20:54,869
About me?

847
01:20:55,757 --> 01:20:58,396
You would never hurt me, would you?

848
01:20:59,597 --> 01:21:01,030
No.

849
01:21:01,597 --> 01:21:03,428
I had to...

850
01:21:03,597 --> 01:21:06,669
I had to see your face to know it.

851
01:21:08,037 --> 01:21:10,153
And what did you see?

852
01:21:15,597 --> 01:21:18,634
Nothing. I can't see anything.

853
01:21:42,477 --> 01:21:44,195
Are you sure you can't see anything?

854
01:21:53,357 --> 01:21:55,587
Sometimes the eyes
take time to adjust.

855
01:22:08,517 --> 01:22:10,985
The operation didn't work.

856
01:22:18,237 --> 01:22:20,546
I'm really sorry, Julia.

857
01:22:24,517 --> 01:22:28,032
Probably the girl lied to you
in order to protect her father.

858
01:22:30,117 --> 01:22:33,826
Tomorrow... we'll speak with
the inspector and all this will be over.

859
01:22:33,997 --> 01:22:36,875
No. No.

860
01:22:37,637 --> 01:22:40,026
No, please.
Take me to the hospital now.

861
01:22:40,197 --> 01:22:43,633
- Now, please.
- We'll call Dr. Roman.

862
01:22:44,157 --> 01:22:47,627
- Now.
- Julia, listen to me.

863
01:22:49,757 --> 01:22:51,429
Dr. Roman?

864
01:22:51,597 --> 01:22:55,385
It's Ivan. Sorry to wake you
at this time of night.

865
01:22:55,557 --> 01:22:58,151
I have a problem with Julia Levin.

866
01:22:59,917 --> 01:23:02,829
She took the bandage off by accident.

867
01:23:10,677 --> 01:23:15,671
I understand. I will tell her right now.
Thanks, and sorry to bother you.

868
01:23:17,037 --> 01:23:18,026
What did he say?

869
01:23:18,197 --> 01:23:20,995
He's at a conference.
We can't do anything until next week.

870
01:23:21,157 --> 01:23:25,196
- Then take me to a different hospital.
- No. Roman said you have to rest.

871
01:23:25,357 --> 01:23:30,556
- I need a second opinion.
- Julia, the damage is done.

872
01:23:30,717 --> 01:23:33,595
But if you don't do as I say,
it will be irreversible.

873
01:23:41,677 --> 01:23:42,951
OK.

874
01:24:14,357 --> 01:24:15,995
Why did you get up?

875
01:24:16,157 --> 01:24:20,833
- The kettle was whistling.
- I'll do it. You sit down.

876
01:24:21,597 --> 01:24:23,155
Be careful.

877
01:24:25,717 --> 01:24:27,275
Very good.

878
01:24:37,917 --> 01:24:39,270
This is nearly ready.

879
01:24:55,077 --> 01:24:56,874
Here you are.

880
01:24:57,637 --> 01:24:59,150
Thank you.

881
01:25:15,277 --> 01:25:16,630
What's the matter?

882
01:25:21,797 --> 01:25:23,549
Why are you doing all this, Ivan?

883
01:25:30,277 --> 01:25:31,869
What do you mean?

884
01:25:32,037 --> 01:25:34,346
Why all this attention?

885
01:25:37,557 --> 01:25:39,354
What do you want from me?

886
01:25:41,197 --> 01:25:43,233
Well, Julia...

887
01:25:46,997 --> 01:25:48,828
When...

888
01:25:49,637 --> 01:25:51,070
When you kissed me...

889
01:25:53,957 --> 01:25:56,551
I didn't expect it.

890
01:25:56,717 --> 01:26:01,313
I didn't expect it, but don't think
I don't like you because...

891
01:26:01,477 --> 01:26:02,705
because that's not true.

892
01:26:05,557 --> 01:26:09,266
I only wanted to give you some time.
You've suffered a lot.

893
01:26:09,437 --> 01:26:13,146
And some wounds need to heal.

894
01:26:15,037 --> 01:26:17,426
What I'm trying to say is...

895
01:26:18,957 --> 01:26:20,948
...I want to be with you.

896
01:26:26,357 --> 01:26:28,154
Drink your tea.

897
01:26:44,597 --> 01:26:46,349
Did you put sugar in it?

898
01:26:50,477 --> 01:26:52,433
I'll bring some.

899
01:27:19,077 --> 01:27:20,669
Two teaspoons, right?

900
01:27:21,837 --> 01:27:23,316
As usual.

901
01:27:30,397 --> 01:27:31,386
Done?

902
01:27:45,557 --> 01:27:47,548
Can you come with me, please?

903
01:27:50,837 --> 01:27:54,113
- Why?
- I need your help with the freezer.

904
01:27:55,037 --> 01:27:58,507
Come. Let's go. Leave this here.

905
01:28:23,357 --> 01:28:25,075
Open the freezer.

906
01:28:25,237 --> 01:28:26,750
Why?

907
01:28:26,917 --> 01:28:28,908
Just do it.

908
01:28:30,997 --> 01:28:33,511
Open the freezer, I said.

909
01:29:02,677 --> 01:29:04,269
Liar.

910
01:29:25,477 --> 01:29:27,388
Are you afraid?

911
01:29:37,237 --> 01:29:41,355
You don't know what fear is!

912
01:29:43,557 --> 01:29:47,436
You have no idea what fear is!

913
01:29:47,597 --> 01:29:48,825
Real fear.

914
01:29:48,997 --> 01:29:51,192
Fear of being ignored and rejected.

915
01:29:51,357 --> 01:29:54,190
Look at me. Look at me!

916
01:29:54,357 --> 01:29:57,713
You don't know what it's like to live
in the dark and hide in another world.

917
01:29:57,877 --> 01:30:03,668
A world full of silence,
getting used to measuring your steps.

918
01:30:04,397 --> 01:30:07,355
Always wearing
the appropriate clothes.

919
01:30:07,517 --> 01:30:10,589
Making your voice one voice and none.

920
01:30:10,757 --> 01:30:14,352
And your eyes, two eyes and none.

921
01:30:14,517 --> 01:30:18,396
It takes so long that eventually
you become a shadow.

922
01:30:18,557 --> 01:30:22,709
But one day you find out that
blind girls realise that you're there,

923
01:30:22,877 --> 01:30:26,756
that you're breathing,
that you are still alive.

924
01:30:26,917 --> 01:30:32,230
That you can offer them your eyes
for theirs, your hands for theirs...

925
01:30:32,677 --> 01:30:35,555
That's why our relationship
is so perfect.

926
01:30:36,437 --> 01:30:37,426
That's why...

927
01:30:38,597 --> 01:30:40,633
...we have to continue this way.

928
01:30:45,917 --> 01:30:48,351
If you are not Ivan, who are you?

929
01:30:49,157 --> 01:30:51,068
Where are you taking me?

930
01:30:52,077 --> 01:30:54,545
My eyes hurt.
Something is wrong.

931
01:30:55,157 --> 01:30:57,751
Take the bandage off, please.

932
01:30:58,517 --> 01:31:00,235
Please.

933
01:31:01,157 --> 01:31:02,954
Please, take it off.

934
01:31:03,117 --> 01:31:06,268
Please, my eyes hurt.
Take the bandage off.

935
01:31:06,437 --> 01:31:08,234
Shut up!

936
01:31:10,477 --> 01:31:12,229
I beg you.

937
01:31:26,517 --> 01:31:27,870
Let me see.

938
01:31:29,077 --> 01:31:31,113
Let me see.

939
01:31:34,517 --> 01:31:37,350
It's started again, right?

940
01:31:43,397 --> 01:31:45,308
This time...

941
01:31:46,077 --> 01:31:48,386
...it will be more intense.

942
01:32:02,597 --> 01:32:05,509
Get out of the car.
You have to pack your bags.

943
01:32:07,557 --> 01:32:08,876
Open the door, Julia.

944
01:32:13,677 --> 01:32:17,465
Open the fucking door!
Open the door!

945
01:32:18,277 --> 01:32:20,472
Open the fucking door!

946
01:32:20,917 --> 01:32:22,430
Julia!

947
01:32:22,597 --> 01:32:24,155
Julia!

948
01:32:24,317 --> 01:32:25,989
Julia!

949
01:32:29,757 --> 01:32:31,554
Julia!

950
01:33:46,197 --> 01:33:48,267
Who's there?

951
01:33:48,437 --> 01:33:50,632
Is the main door locked?

952
01:33:50,797 --> 01:33:53,709
- Is that you, Julia? You scared me.
- Is it locked?

953
01:33:53,877 --> 01:33:56,471
Yes, of course.
What's wrong?

954
01:33:56,637 --> 01:33:59,197
- There's a murderer in the area.
- A murderer?

955
01:33:59,357 --> 01:34:01,507
We have to call the police.
Where's the phone?

956
01:34:01,677 --> 01:34:05,829
There, in the corner.
Under the painting.

957
01:34:05,997 --> 01:34:07,874
Don't move.

958
01:34:08,037 --> 01:34:09,789
Be quiet.

959
01:34:10,277 --> 01:34:11,995
- What's wrong?
- Don't move.

960
01:34:18,717 --> 01:34:21,515
- It's him. He's here.
- Who?

961
01:34:22,197 --> 01:34:24,552
Don't come any closer,
you son of a bitch.

962
01:34:24,717 --> 01:34:28,312
- Who are you talking to?
- To a man who thinks he's invisible.

963
01:34:28,477 --> 01:34:31,469
He made Sara go blind
and he wants to do the same to me.

964
01:34:31,957 --> 01:34:35,074
- You're scaring me.
- Stay away.

965
01:34:35,237 --> 01:34:37,148
Soledad, call the police.

966
01:34:37,317 --> 01:34:40,070
- Call the police, quick!
- Don't do it, Mum.

967
01:34:41,557 --> 01:34:43,195
Angel...

968
01:34:43,877 --> 01:34:45,629
Is that you, son?

969
01:34:48,677 --> 01:34:50,156
Yes.

970
01:34:50,317 --> 01:34:51,875
I'm back home.

971
01:34:52,557 --> 01:34:55,196
This woman says you're chasing her.

972
01:34:55,357 --> 01:34:57,188
This woman is crazy.

973
01:34:59,357 --> 01:35:02,394
- Your son is a murderer.
- Shut up. Don't listen to her, Mum.

974
01:35:02,557 --> 01:35:04,275
- He killed my husband.
- She's lying.

975
01:35:04,437 --> 01:35:07,031
- He killed my husband and Sara too.
- Shut up.

976
01:35:07,197 --> 01:35:10,872
- It must have been easy to hang her.
- I loved Sara.

977
01:35:11,637 --> 01:35:14,549
She killed herself because she wasn't
capable of living in darkness.

978
01:35:14,717 --> 01:35:16,435
Capable?

979
01:35:16,597 --> 01:35:20,431
No one is capable of getting used to it.
You made her go blind.

980
01:35:20,597 --> 01:35:21,666
You killed her.

981
01:35:21,837 --> 01:35:26,035
- Is that true, son?
- Mum, mum. You know me.

982
01:35:26,197 --> 01:35:28,916
I said don't move.

983
01:35:29,077 --> 01:35:32,194
Make the call. Make it.

984
01:35:57,757 --> 01:36:00,066
I knew you'd come back.

985
01:36:01,517 --> 01:36:05,510
I knew you'd realise
that you can only be happy here.

986
01:36:06,077 --> 01:36:09,069
I told you that without me,
you'd be nothing.

987
01:36:09,237 --> 01:36:11,432
Less than nothing.

988
01:36:11,597 --> 01:36:13,588
Invisible.

989
01:36:20,877 --> 01:36:22,549
Since when can you see, Mum?

990
01:36:22,717 --> 01:36:27,586
But you're still my son, and I won't let
anybody take you away from me.

991
01:36:27,757 --> 01:36:30,555
Mum, I asked you a question.

992
01:36:31,837 --> 01:36:35,352
Since when can you see?

993
01:36:35,517 --> 01:36:38,987
Angel, what are you doing, son?

994
01:36:39,277 --> 01:36:42,872
What are you doing, son? No, no.

995
01:36:43,397 --> 01:36:45,592
No, no.

996
01:36:46,797 --> 01:36:48,025
Calm down, Mum.

997
01:36:52,037 --> 01:36:53,993
- It's me.
- Mum, calm down.

998
01:36:54,877 --> 01:37:00,873
Look, Mum, this liquid attacks the optic
nerve without causing any pain.

999
01:37:01,037 --> 01:37:05,747
Don't worry.
And these needles are very useful too.

1000
01:37:05,917 --> 01:37:09,830
- Don't do it, please.
- Mum, I have to do it.

1001
01:37:10,317 --> 01:37:12,706
- Oh, my boy!
- Don't worry.

1002
01:37:43,197 --> 01:37:44,550
What are we doing here?

1003
01:37:47,877 --> 01:37:50,072
I won't use it on you.

1004
01:37:54,877 --> 01:37:59,667
Your optic nerve must be very damaged
by now. It won't take long.

1005
01:37:59,837 --> 01:38:05,195
- This can't end like this.
- Don't worry. Don't worry.

1006
01:38:05,357 --> 01:38:11,193
Don't worry. When the darkness comes,
I'll be by your side.

1007
01:38:12,077 --> 01:38:14,272
I've packed your bags.

1008
01:38:14,437 --> 01:38:18,555
We will go far away
and nobody will find us.

1009
01:38:19,357 --> 01:38:20,870
We will start from scratch.

1010
01:38:21,037 --> 01:38:22,550
Don't touch me!

1011
01:38:23,397 --> 01:38:25,194
Don't touch me, son of a bitch.

1012
01:38:26,477 --> 01:38:28,832
I will never love you. Never.

1013
01:38:28,997 --> 01:38:30,635
I would die first.

1014
01:38:31,717 --> 01:38:33,355
- Don't touch me!
- Is that what you want?

1015
01:38:33,517 --> 01:38:36,315
Don't touch me!

1016
01:38:37,357 --> 01:38:39,791
Let go of me!

1017
01:38:39,957 --> 01:38:43,108
- Let go of me!
- Come on, do it!

1018
01:38:45,557 --> 01:38:47,275
Stay with me.

1019
01:39:17,517 --> 01:39:20,236
Do it. Do it.

1020
01:39:20,797 --> 01:39:23,470
Do it! Do it!

1021
01:39:23,637 --> 01:39:26,515
- Do it.
- I can't! I can't!

1022
01:39:31,557 --> 01:39:32,956
Of course you can't.

1023
01:39:33,117 --> 01:39:36,553
Although you don't know it...
you love me.

1024
01:39:37,157 --> 01:39:40,672
Because you know that without me,
you are nothing.

1025
01:39:40,837 --> 01:39:43,226
And I am only a shadow without you.

1026
01:40:55,517 --> 01:40:57,951
Julia, why did you lock the door?

1027
01:41:01,957 --> 01:41:03,834
- Hello?
- Inspector. It's Julia.

1028
01:41:03,997 --> 01:41:04,986
Julia, it's you.

1029
01:41:05,157 --> 01:41:08,706
Listen to me, because this is
the last time I'll call you.

1030
01:41:08,877 --> 01:41:12,392
- Calm down.
- He's locked me in my house.

1031
01:41:12,557 --> 01:41:14,673
- Calm down, Julia.
- He's going to kill me.

1032
01:41:14,837 --> 01:41:19,035
If you don't come, it will be too late.
You have to believe me. Please.

1033
01:41:19,197 --> 01:41:21,506
- Julia, please, calm down.
- Are you listening to me?

1034
01:41:23,557 --> 01:41:24,990
Inspector?

1035
01:41:31,637 --> 01:41:32,911
Julia!

1036
01:43:32,917 --> 01:43:35,750
Julia, police!
Cover the stairs and the hallway.

1037
01:43:35,917 --> 01:43:37,669
Julia, are you there?

1038
01:43:37,837 --> 01:43:40,590
It's Dimas. Can you hear me?

1039
01:43:41,237 --> 01:43:43,193
- Julia, what are you doing?
- Shut up!

1040
01:43:43,357 --> 01:43:46,155
- What's going on?
- I said shut up!

1041
01:43:56,717 --> 01:43:59,151
Can you see him?
Can you see him, inspector?

1042
01:43:59,317 --> 01:44:02,832
Police! Put the knife down!
Put your hands above your head!

1043
01:44:16,037 --> 01:44:17,993
Don't look at me.

1044
01:44:20,597 --> 01:44:23,634
Don't look at me, please.

1045
01:44:25,397 --> 01:44:28,946
- Don't look at me!
- Put the knife down!

1046
01:44:31,597 --> 01:44:33,349
Put it down!

1047
01:44:33,997 --> 01:44:37,353
What are you doing?
Put the knife down!

1048
01:45:17,117 --> 01:45:19,312
I will go blind, won't l?

1049
01:45:24,317 --> 01:45:26,308
How long do I have?

1050
01:45:28,197 --> 01:45:30,427
You'll go blind before dawn.

1051
01:45:38,717 --> 01:45:41,106
I need you to do me a favour.

1052
01:46:12,077 --> 01:46:13,874
Can we have a moment?

1053
01:46:23,317 --> 01:46:24,796
What happened to his eyes?

1054
01:46:27,237 --> 01:46:29,193
He donated them.

1055
01:46:35,477 --> 01:46:36,910
And where are they?

1056
01:46:37,637 --> 01:46:39,867
Where he would have wanted.

1057
01:46:48,117 --> 01:46:50,551
Isaac, why?

1058
01:46:52,317 --> 01:46:55,468
My God, I miss you so much.

1059
01:47:00,197 --> 01:47:02,631
You promised me.

1060
01:47:02,797 --> 01:47:05,789
You promised me.

1061
01:47:47,197 --> 01:47:50,667
You told me
that when you looked into my eyes...

1062
01:47:51,477 --> 01:47:53,468
...you could see the entire universe.

1063
01:47:54,517 --> 01:47:56,428
I still can.

1064
01:48:50,197 --> 01:48:53,587
JULlA'S EYES
