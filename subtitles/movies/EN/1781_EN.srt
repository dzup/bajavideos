1
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:58,202
I don't understand why
they took a night flight.

2
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:01,277
They should have taken
the one I told them.

3
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,912
I hope Meme is ready
or we'll be late.

4
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:12,516
Don't forget. Tell Olguita
to make meat pie.

5
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:16,853
With the mad cow matter, they
haven't had meat in months.

6
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:29,604
Ana called yesterday. I told her:
Our kids are arriving.

7
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:35,978
- Good morning.
- Hello.

8
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:56,968
Look at Silvina Chediek's house.
Lovely! This is so fun.

9
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:01,729
Mona told me they are not
their houses.

10
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:04,604
They borrow them
for the photos.

11
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:08,941
They look so comfortable.
They seem to be at home.

12
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:12,683
In their dressing gowns.

13
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,848
I hope Montse will not wear
again...

14
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:20,824
...that horrible dress
from Barcelona

15
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:28,161
I just remembered
when I pinched Vilas' ass.

16
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:35,103
I had not met you yet.
I couldn't resist.

17
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:06,094
Yes, yes.
No, no, no.

18
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:09,063
Okay, I'll tell her.
I won't forget.

19
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,938
Yes. Bye. See you.

20
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,279
- Who was it?
- Ana.

21
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:22,612
She wouldn't stop talking about
designs she's making with Mom.

22
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,886
What are you watching?

23
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:31,229
A documentary about
pandas born in captivity.

24
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:36,725
It's strange.

25
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:41,801
As the mother can't handle two
cubs, she ignores one until...

26
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:45,172
...it dies, but first, she goes
crazy trying to handle two.

27
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,016
I don't know if she can't raise
them as a consequence of...

28
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:58,586
...captivity or because
that is her nature.

29
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:01,891
Captivity, for sure.

30
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:06,526
A big animal can handle
two cubs.

31
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:16,533
It's over.

32
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,105
- Let's go to my room.
- Okay.

33
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:25,082
I bought Bowie's record.

34
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:30,288
- You queer!
- You're prettier every day.

35
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:33,652
- My baby!
- Hi, Olguita!

36
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:37,119
Hello. We missed you here!

37
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:42,225
- Children, we're home.
- Olguita!

38
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,586
It's so nice to see you!

39
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,994
- Olguita, Montse, my wife.
- How do you do? - Hi.

40
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:50,330
- Montse, she's Olga. - Pleased to
meet you. - Come in, Montse.

41
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,366
- I'm coming.
- Come on.

42
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:55,273
Let me help you, Dad.

43
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,808
- Let me take it, Olguita.
- No, my boy.

44
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,605
Let me do it, Olga.

45
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:01,804
Hi. You must be Meme.

46
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,708
Hello.

47
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,517
Hi!

48
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:13,554
How are you?

49
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,057
Hi!

50
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,654
- Hi! How are you?
- Fine.

51
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:20,698
- She is Montse, my wife.
- Yes, we met.

52
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:25,134
My baby! Olguita made
meat pie for you.

53
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:29,537
His favorite. Leave your
luggage and wash your hands.

54
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,802
Dinner is served.

55
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:34,606
Wash up! Come eat!

56
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:50,862
I'll tell him to call you
after lunch.

57
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:55,065
Yes, mother.
He'll call you after lunch!

58
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:59,261
He looks great, as usual.

59
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,199
Thinner than when
he got married.

60
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:07,607
I'll tell you later. They're
upstairs. They're leaving...

61
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,271
...their luggage and...

62
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:13,707
Lunch, mother.
Well, not much.

63
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,819
They told me about Julio,
Daniel's brother.

64
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,556
The one I think
is an asshole.

65
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,854
They're all assholes, yes.

66
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,956
A wedding suite?

67
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:31,135
- My mother. Everything okay?
- Yes.

68
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:35,272
A little shaken but fine.

69
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:42,780
I'm exhausted.
I could not sleep.

70
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:46,646
You're so stubborn. I told you
to take something.

71
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:48,549
But you didn't.

72
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,724
Thanks, Olguita.

73
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:04,335
What's wrong with her?

74
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:09,506
She doesn't like cigarettes.
No smoking when she's around.

75
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:12,941
- Not even Lucía nor me.
- I didn't know.

76
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:16,742
- She never liked it.
- I didn't remember.

77
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:23,220
- Eze, call Granny.
- I'll call her later.

78
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:24,846
I'm going to Ariel's.

79
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:28,119
No, call her now. She's been
calling all morning.

80
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,058
We have a busy day today.

81
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:34,257
Okay. I'll see Ariel tomorrow.

82
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:39,195
Invite him to dinner.
Everyone's coming. Granny...

83
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:44,105
...Grandpa, Inés,
all your cousins. - Alright.

84
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,839
Jere, you and Meme
go get groceries...

85
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,882
...for tonight.
- I don't want to!

86
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:56,814
Meme, what are you doing
there? Don't make a scene.

87
00:10:56,956 --> 00:11:00,653
- This is no time for your moods.
- Leave me alone.

88
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,626
Meme, don't answer back.
Come here.

89
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:06,323
Let's have a minute of peace!

90
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,693
Not if you'll always
be nagging us.

91
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,861
You make me sick.
You're so selfish!

92
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,701
- You're exaggerating.
- Am I?

93
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,900
You've been away too long.

94
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:21,036
- Excuse us, Montserrat.
- Don't worry.

95
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,080
Families argue.

96
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,285
They make a scandal every
time I ask them something.

97
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,885
That's enough, Mom.

98
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,024
- Cold drinks are bad for you.
- Their attitude...

99
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,823
...is bad for me. Jeremías,
we must talk things over.

100
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:40,022
I won't listen to you.

101
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:44,329
You two are unbelievable!

102
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:47,003
Always fighting.

103
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:51,166
If it's not one, it's the other.
But if it's against me...

104
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,278
...they come together.

105
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:58,246
- Your kidneys maybe.
- Yes?

106
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:02,316
- Yes, what else?
- I don't know, it hurts.

107
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:10,618
Your girlfriend from Escobar,
Vanina Cohen is here.

108
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:15,523
- So? - Nothing.
I'm having some memories.

109
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:20,531
She's fatter. I haven't seen her
in a long time.

110
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,659
- And you?
- What?

111
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:28,203
- Are you dumb? - Sometimes
you're impossible, you know?

112
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:08,603
How was it?

113
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:10,612
- Lucía...
- What, Mom?

114
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:13,843
Horrible wedding invitations!

115
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:16,546
They are the ones they chose.

116
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:20,781
You shouldn't have left
them up to them!

117
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:24,453
The letter is not subtle
and the watermark is huge.

118
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:27,498
- They look cheap!
- They like them.

119
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:32,627
What's this? "Santa María's
ranch. 25 de mayo county.

120
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:36,537
- Province of Buenos Aires."
- What's wrong with that?

121
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,168
That one.

122
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:45,673
No, that's a plane.

123
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:25,921
They're two males.
Meme might feel left out.

124
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:28,549
We, women, are very jealous,
you know?

125
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:30,821
But they fight like cats
and dogs.

126
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:33,295
They haven't helped me a bit
with the wedding party.

127
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:37,467
We would scratch our eyes out
when we were kids.

128
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,163
This is different. We fought
over boyfriends, clothing...

129
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,171
...normal stuff because
we lived together.

130
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:46,301
They fight too much.
Really. But I can understand...

131
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:50,480
...Jere because she's too
intolerant. That girl!

132
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:54,143
Always, since she was a kid.
So delicate. Yes.

133
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,620
- Now she's not only vegetarian,
she's "vegan". - "Vegan"?

134
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:01,783
- Yes. - "Vegan"? - It's very
weird. She eats nothing.

135
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:04,259
Olguita has to cook
very special food.

136
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:09,593
Hold on, Inés, tell Mom
to wait for me.

137
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:11,726
I have to pee.

138
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,640
I'm sorry!

139
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,772
What are you doing
locked up in the bathroom?

140
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:26,651
- We're talking.
- Finally you made up.

141
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:31,848
Now get out. I have to pee.

142
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:36,824
You should talk in your room
not in the bathroom.

143
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,628
Lucio, come on.

144
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:44,127
- You're fatter.
- Don't tell me.

145
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:47,266
- Bye.
- See you at the ranch.

146
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,530
I'll see you to the door.

147
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:53,577
- Bye, auntie.
- Bye, Power.

148
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:56,272
- Bye.
- You're so mean.

149
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:59,574
- Bye, aunt.
- Say hi to the children.

150
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:02,551
- Let's go, Mom.
- Bye, bye.

151
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:08,990
Bye.

152
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:05,576
Stop that, Ezequiel.
We have enough noise.

153
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,122
Come in.

154
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:23,800
Let's go.

155
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:28,566
There we go.

156
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,299
Occupied!

157
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,011
Sorry.

158
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:17,215
- Good morning.
- Hello.

159
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:25,322
Good morning.
Did you sleep well?

160
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:28,065
No, the jet lag
and the noise from outside...

161
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,929
...made it impossible
for me to sleep.

162
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:32,764
We'll have only ladies
for breakfast.

163
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:36,033
Ezequiel is sleeping like a log.

164
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,167
No, they're both awake.
I heard them talking...

165
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:42,838
...at Jere's room.
- Eavesdropping?

166
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:46,815
No, it was an accident.
Meme, how can you think that?

167
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:48,647
I went up and overheard them.

168
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:51,756
I didn't want to interrupt them.

169
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,994
Hand me a piece.

170
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:13,210
It's a pity your parents
couldn't make it.

171
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:21,076
They must have sad memories
from that time. Poor them!

172
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:26,554
- We interrumpt anything?
- Only your daughter's moods.

173
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:30,023
What did I do?
I didn't open my mouth.

174
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:32,730
I know your silence.

175
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:36,095
I'm looking for
my wedding dress...

176
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:41,798
...to show it to Montse. Here.
The bride's veil...

177
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,808
...my Mom made me, remember?
You look very pale.

178
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:46,968
Are you alright?

179
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:50,647
I overdid it last night.

180
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:55,181
- Mom, why keep all this?
- For my grandchildren.

181
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,224
Look, Mom.
Remember my fencing?

182
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,320
Careful with that!

183
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:06,323
- Stop it!
- I found it! Here it is!

184
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,998
Look! Unbelievable!

185
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:12,501
This is great! Fantastic.

186
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,999
The wreath must be here
somewhere. Yes!

187
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,166
Here!

188
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:24,506
Oh my God! It's okay,
it's wonderful. Look.

189
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:29,016
Yes, yes. We can tidy this up.
The flowers.

190
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:31,622
Great! I found it.

191
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:35,187
Let's go out to dinner
to celebrate, okay?

192
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,859
Lucía, we have other plans.

193
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:41,898
Don't stay out late.
We leave early...

194
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,127
...for the country tomorrow.

195
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:46,937
We won't go to bed.

196
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:50,530
And your sister's moods?

197
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:53,167
Mom, Montse wants
to see Buenos Aires.

198
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:56,737
What are you doing?
Mom!

199
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:58,815
Try it on.

200
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:14,829
Here!

201
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:20,135
- How much is it?
- Dad gave me money.

202
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:30,105
Let's go, come with me.

203
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:36,845
- You don't drink alcohol?
- No.

204
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:42,187
How can you stand up a whole
night drinking only water?

205
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:50,967
I've been with girls too.
There's no problem.

206
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:56,604
- What?! - I have many
dyke friends. I don't care.

207
00:22:57,275 --> 00:23:01,871
- What?
- Dykes! Lesbians!

208
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:04,773
So?

209
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:11,516
Sorry. I thought
you were gay.

210
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:19,086
Ecstasy?

211
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:23,531
- What?
- Ecstasy, for fun.

212
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:27,961
- I'm having fun!
- Try it.

213
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:32,668
Try just a quarter!
Ezequiel is making Jere try it!

214
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:34,802
Go ahead! Tune up!

215
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,656
Do I leave first?

216
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:38,757
Magdalena.

217
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:43,860
What?

218
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:49,871
Nothing. I like to say your name.

219
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:29,603
- Watch out!
- Stop it! Let me go, asshole!

220
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,828
Wed...

221
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:32,665
...ding. 3 points.
I'm brilliant.

222
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:36,936
- I'm starving, Mom.
- Hold on a moment.

223
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:40,567
Your sister isn't back yet.
What's keeping her?

224
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:42,270
She hates the village.

225
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:48,347
- Who's winning?
- Me, of course.

226
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:50,780
- Proper names don't count, so...
- They count!

227
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:53,117
- No, they don't. That's cheating.
- Don't fight!

228
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:54,782
- That's cheating, Mom!
- Says who?

229
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:58,919
- It has always been like that.
Smart ass! - That's enough.

230
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:01,759
This isn't a competition.
It's for fun, isn't it?

231
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,061
- Always on his side.
- I'm not!

232
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:07,171
Don't fight over
a lousy Scrabble game!

233
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:10,206
- Jere is right.
- That's none of your business.

234
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:13,504
You're always cheating!
You can't play without cheating!

235
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:16,273
- You don't like losing.
Chicken-shit! - Stop it!

236
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,641
Stop that noise, please!

237
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:21,980
- You won cheating. - That's okay.
I'll remove that word.

238
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,180
- Leave it! - Stop it! - Leave it!
- Don't fight!

239
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,951
- Cheater!
- Chicken-shit!

240
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,888
That's enough!

241
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,987
- What are you doing?
- Your brothers are fighting...

242
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:36,293
...like 8 year-old brats.

243
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:40,200
What took you so long?
Jeremías, come here, please.

244
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:43,102
- The car ran out of gas. It's
Ezequiel's fault. - Fuck off!

245
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:45,766
- Ezequiel!
- All of you against me.

246
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:48,504
- Stop it!
- You always fuck me!

247
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:51,114
I ran out of gas, sucker.

248
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:52,841
- Enough!
- Stop yelling!

249
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:55,976
I yell all I want!
This is my house!

250
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:59,321
It's unbelievable!
Always the same!

251
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:03,989
Our family has
more serious problems...

252
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:06,187
...than running out of gas...

253
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:09,696
...or a Scrabble game.
- What problems?

254
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:14,299
- Olguita.
- What is it?

255
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:18,069
Close the door.
Jere, come.

256
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:29,815
Jessica, Olga's daughter,
is pregnant again.

257
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:33,685
- How old is she? - 15.
It's her second pregnancy.

258
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:38,285
- I have a theory.
- Leave the kids out of this.

259
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:39,757
You're not sure.

260
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,732
They're old enough. They should
get in touch with real life.

261
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:47,804
I think Olga's husband
sleeps with his daughters.

262
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:50,669
- That's impossible, Mom.
- Olga works at home...

263
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:53,299
...from Monday to Saturday.
Her husband...

264
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:57,605
...is alone with the girls
all week long.

265
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,684
Olga never mentions
any boyfriends.

266
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:05,687
- You make things up. - I don't.
I think about these things.

267
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:10,057
Susy's maid has
the same problem.

268
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:14,261
The lower classes in this
country have that problem.

269
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:18,559
In Spain, women die fighting
with their husbands.

270
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:21,263
You can't compare.
They're two grown-ups.

271
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:26,568
Poor Olguita. She has
a hard life, hasn't she?

272
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:31,605
How does she manage
to go on?

273
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:40,885
A car.

274
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:43,785
They must be bringing
the car.

275
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:46,624
I had to leave it at La Rábida.

276
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:50,758
No. It's only one car.

277
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:54,127
Poldo must have found it,
put some gas on...

278
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:58,766
...and brought it here.
- No, Mom, it's a city cab.

279
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:03,341
This far in a cab?
Who might be?

280
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:04,911
A cab?

281
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:09,184
- It's your mother.
- My mother?

282
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:12,684
Jeremías, Granny is here.
Get Olguita.

283
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:15,554
- They must have luggage. Let's
help them. - Let them get out.

284
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:17,752
- Hold on.
- Get under the eaves.

285
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:21,626
- Hold on a minute.
- They'll get wet. Dad!

286
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,094
Olga!

287
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:36,303
How can you not trust me?

288
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:39,871
How can you think that
about me?

289
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:49,645
Who else could have been?
Tell me.

290
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:53,516
- Ana Luisa.
- I don't believe it.

291
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:57,150
- What are you watching, Olga?
- The soap opera.

292
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:02,164
- It's too early.
- No. It's a foreign channel...

293
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,234
...from Caracas.

294
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:09,904
You don't drop by anymore.

295
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:13,673
I'm a little crazy.

296
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:15,244
Why, Male?

297
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:20,144
That woman is upsetting you.
You can't think clearly.

298
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:23,185
- You should stop seeing her.
- Who's that?

299
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,724
The twin sister.

300
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:32,028
That's the evil sister.
The other is the good one.

301
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:36,893
Carlos Alberto,
Ana Luisa and you...

302
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:39,594
Ana Luisa and me what?

303
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:42,197
Ana Luisa and you...

304
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:46,774
...are brother and sister.

305
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:05,093
- What were you doing?
- Nothing.

306
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,883
I can't sleep.

307
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,587
Me neither.

308
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:51,885
Jere, turn off the fan.

309
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:02,284
What are you doing here,
Ezequiel?

310
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:06,156
- What the fuck are you doing?!
- Get out!

311
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:08,291
Are you crazy?

312
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:11,228
- Get out!
- Look at me!

313
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,066
Look at me!

314
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:16,168
- Get out!
- Look at me!

315
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:19,173
Get out!

316
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:23,575
Mom must never know.
Next time I see you, I'll kill you!

317
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:26,615
- She wouldn't believe you,
shit-head! - I'll kill you!

318
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:28,215
Asshole!

319
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:03,250
Look, they're here.

320
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:07,153
Hello. Hello, everybody.

321
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:14,197
Uncle, the mare!
I'll take it today.

322
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:17,966
- Hi.
- Take it!

323
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:20,236
Nodody's here yet?

324
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:22,561
Girls!

325
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:25,800
- You'll slander me?
- Hi.

326
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:30,471
- How are you? - Olguita,
be careful with the clothing.

327
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:32,582
Mom, leave Olga alone.

328
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,741
You won't find anything.

329
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:40,147
- Your kids? - Sleeping.
They're making me upset.

330
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:43,260
They're acting like
brats since they got here.

331
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,290
Javier and María do the same.

332
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:48,293
They fight like cats and dogs.

333
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:53,195
Now that María's married, a little
less. Everything looks great.

334
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:58,634
- How nice! How did you do it?
- I don't like those clouds.

335
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:02,576
It rained yesterday.
My sandals are ruined.

336
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:08,118
- The bride's dress?
- Simple.

337
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,584
Well, you know her.

338
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,649
Mom, stop looking at the sky.

339
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:16,817
Everyone must get ready.

340
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:19,794
The time will come
and we won't be ready.

341
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:22,665
Are those children
still sleeping?

342
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,166
- Hi!
- Where are you going?

343
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:28,032
- Horseriding.
- You wanna drive me crazy?

344
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:30,834
Go and get ready.
What happened to you?

345
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:35,002
- How did you get that?
- I bumped into the door.

346
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:40,110
You're so careless, son!

347
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:42,514
He'll look terrible
in the photos.

348
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:22,847
- Just a little.
- Let me see.

349
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:28,082
- This is an old lace.
- It's beautiful!

350
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:30,856
Stand up straight.

351
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:39,531
The best man looks
really handsome.

352
00:46:58,348 --> 00:47:00,748
What is it?
Come here.

353
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:04,217
Do you remember the twin
sister that was kidnapped?

354
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:08,290
The old man rescued her.
But she remained hidden...

355
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,584
...to expose her sister.

356
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:14,661
- Her boyfriend never returned.
- No, poor guy.

357
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:18,791
They told her he died
in an accident abroad.

358
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:22,296
The waltz!

359
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,973
- You won't waltz?
- No, I don't feel like it.

360
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:31,137
Like on your 15th birthday.
You looked so beautiful.

361
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:34,911
- Remember? - Yes. But I can't
dance. I get confused.

362
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:37,748
- It's really easy. I'll teach you.
- I don't want to dance.

363
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:42,325
- I'll make a fool of myself.
- At your brother's wedding?

364
00:47:42,726 --> 00:47:45,889
He married in Spain.
This was all mother's idea.

365
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:48,589
But you have to go.
Your granny will say...

366
00:47:48,732 --> 00:47:51,929
I hold you back here and that's
why you're not on the photos.

367
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:54,128
Nobody will miss me.

368
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:57,173
Your brother will.

369
00:47:58,141 --> 00:48:00,075
Your mother for sure.

370
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:16,711
Poldo, get the mare
for a photo!

371
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:22,215
What are you doing here?
They'll drive me crazy.

372
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:27,081
Look at you. You're all dirty.
Your suit is ruined.

373
00:50:27,592 --> 00:50:29,184
That black eye.
Stay out...

374
00:50:29,327 --> 00:50:33,195
...of the photos.
You're so stubborn!

375
00:50:34,098 --> 00:50:37,590
- Vanina Cohen is looking
for you. - Vanina Cohen?

376
00:50:37,735 --> 00:50:39,896
Someone invited her.
She's looking for you.

377
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:43,200
Vanina?
I can't remember her.

378
00:50:44,075 --> 00:50:46,908
I don't want to ride.
I'm scared.

379
00:50:47,245 --> 00:50:50,009
- Is it necessary?
- Stop fucking around.

380
00:50:50,148 --> 00:50:53,743
Why can't you please my Mom?
Is it so hard?

381
00:51:06,864 --> 00:51:10,561
Take a good picture
of the mare.

382
00:51:17,008 --> 00:51:20,000
I have a good joke. What's
worse? To be Jew or gay?

383
00:51:20,144 --> 00:51:22,203
- Jew.
- No, gay, because...

384
00:51:22,346 --> 00:51:24,576
...you have to tell
your parents.

385
00:51:26,317 --> 00:51:29,775
- Smile at the camera.
- Relax.

386
00:51:31,155 --> 00:51:32,747
Smile, smile.

387
00:51:32,957 --> 00:51:37,257
- So tense!
- It's just a mare.

388
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,757
Oh God!

389
00:51:41,165 --> 00:51:42,530
Criticizing me?

390
00:51:42,667 --> 00:51:46,660
We were remembering
when that horse...

391
00:51:46,804 --> 00:51:49,170
...threw that servant.

392
00:51:50,908 --> 00:51:53,570
A sack of potatoes.

393
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:59,242
You don't remember?
He died the next day.

394
00:51:59,383 --> 00:52:04,116
No, that was another who
was kicked in the head.

395
00:52:04,255 --> 00:52:07,554
- Don't you remember?
- You ruined my party!

396
00:52:07,692 --> 00:52:10,286
- I have a knot in my stomach.
- Really.

397
00:52:10,561 --> 00:52:13,997
Let's change the subject.
Oh God!

398
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:17,066
- She does it on purpose.
- Don't pay attention to her.

399
00:52:17,201 --> 00:52:20,796
Don't worry about it, please.

400
00:52:25,042 --> 00:52:26,202
What?

401
00:52:26,744 --> 00:52:28,974
- I remembered something.
- What?

402
00:52:30,081 --> 00:52:33,676
When I pinched Vilas' ass.
Remember?

403
00:52:34,051 --> 00:52:36,645
- That wasn't you.
- What do you mean?

404
00:52:36,787 --> 00:52:39,722
- I pinched Vilas' ass.
- No, it was...

405
00:52:39,857 --> 00:52:44,055
...when we went to the races.
- We weren't at the races.

406
00:52:44,195 --> 00:52:47,323
We were at the Lawn Tennis.
I was the one who pinched...

407
00:52:47,598 --> 00:52:50,533
...Vilas' ass.
- Let's not fight over it.

408
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:54,502
No, but Mom tried to ruin
the party all day long...

409
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:56,539
...my children drive me crazy...

410
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:59,142
...that Spanish girl makes
a scandal with the mare...

411
00:52:59,277 --> 00:53:01,802
...and now you pinched
Vilas' ass!

412
00:53:01,946 --> 00:53:03,538
- No, no.
- Cheers!

413
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:06,343
It was you, my mistake.

414
00:54:32,336 --> 00:54:35,066
What is it?
Can't I look at you?

415
00:54:38,976 --> 00:54:41,206
You're crazy.

416
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:44,110
Get out, Ezequiel!

417
00:54:45,116 --> 00:54:47,277
You shouldn't mind.

418
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:03,892
- No, that's a plane.
- And Spanish girls?

419
00:55:04,035 --> 00:55:06,970
- No, they're uglier. - Uglier?
I thought they were nicer.

420
00:55:07,104 --> 00:55:09,231
- They're over us.
- They're slutter.

421
00:55:09,507 --> 00:55:12,840
- Some don't depilate.
- And their tits?

422
00:55:12,977 --> 00:55:16,936
Lucía fell!
Daniel, Jorge, come!

423
00:55:17,081 --> 00:55:19,242
- Come! Lucía fell!
- What do you mean?

424
00:55:19,517 --> 00:55:23,749
We were arguing over some
nonsense. You know her.

425
00:55:23,888 --> 00:55:25,480
- She tripped.
- What a fool!

426
00:55:25,623 --> 00:55:29,286
- Over the walnuts.
- Lucía! What a fool!

427
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,951
- Lucía!
- Mom!

428
00:56:03,828 --> 00:56:06,524
Your sister told me you
were fighting like two kids.

429
00:56:06,597 --> 00:56:09,896
We weren't arguing
anymore.

430
00:56:10,034 --> 00:56:13,094
- Are you okay? Don't move.
- I can't lie here...

431
00:56:13,237 --> 00:56:15,967
...all night, can I?
- Jorge, bring the truck.

432
00:56:16,107 --> 00:56:17,836
- Let's take her to the hospital.
- I'm coming, Mom.

433
00:56:17,975 --> 00:56:20,136
We'll go back to Buenos Aires
right now. All the guests...

434
00:56:20,277 --> 00:56:24,907
...have left.
Get the kids.

435
00:56:25,049 --> 00:56:27,540
Slowly, Mom, there's no hurry.

436
00:56:29,587 --> 00:56:30,986
Careful.

437
00:56:31,755 --> 00:56:34,849
Where's Meme? She'll be late
for my funeral.

438
00:56:35,993 --> 00:56:38,291
Let her drive.
She doesn't drink.

439
00:56:39,597 --> 00:56:42,532
- Mind that you don't levy...
- Lavish, Lucía.

440
00:56:42,666 --> 00:56:46,295
It's the same. Get her to drive.

441
00:56:46,604 --> 00:56:48,799
- Be careful.
- Okay.

442
00:56:50,808 --> 00:56:52,708
Careful, walk slowly.

443
00:57:47,031 --> 00:57:51,331
You're up. Olga is not
coming today. She's dealing...

444
00:57:51,602 --> 00:57:56,699
...with her daughter's
trouble. I'll be out all day.

445
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,968
I have to go to Ana's to work
on that design...

446
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:02,977
...I put off due to the wedding.

447
00:58:03,113 --> 00:58:05,081
The wedding was
just an excuse.

448
00:58:05,416 --> 00:58:10,149
I've never seen such bad taste
in a house.

449
00:58:11,589 --> 00:58:13,955
You look awful. What is it?
Are you okay?

450
00:58:14,091 --> 00:58:17,527
- I just got up.
- Close your eyes.

451
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:23,129
Don't dry it. I'm leaving.
I'm in a hurry.

452
00:58:28,806 --> 00:58:32,902
It's impossible to look
elegant...

453
00:58:33,244 --> 00:58:35,269
...in this boot.

454
00:58:36,714 --> 00:58:37,874
Bye.

455
00:58:46,924 --> 00:58:51,088
I can't stand this boot anymore.

456
00:58:51,228 --> 00:58:54,891
As I can't drive, I took
a cab. The driver...

457
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:58,832
...drove me all over the town.
The house looks gorgeous.

458
00:58:58,969 --> 00:59:01,665
Yes, I changed some things.

459
00:59:01,939 --> 00:59:05,875
Tell me about you
and then we'll get to work.

460
00:59:08,112 --> 00:59:11,206
- How are you with all these
changes. - Coffee?

461
00:59:11,348 --> 00:59:15,682
- Yes.
- I do what I can.

462
00:59:16,654 --> 00:59:22,217
- You heard about my husband
and his student? - Awful! I knew...

463
00:59:22,359 --> 00:59:24,793
something was wrong when you
didn't show up at the wedding.

464
00:59:24,928 --> 00:59:29,524
Then I heard. But I'd rather
you called me.

465
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:33,563
- Did you sue him?
- No. How could I?

466
00:59:33,704 --> 00:59:36,104
Lucía, I just started
the divorce.

467
00:59:37,341 --> 00:59:39,741
At your own home!

468
00:59:42,146 --> 00:59:44,876
We should cut men's...
I won't say it.

469
00:59:45,015 --> 00:59:46,277
Justina!

470
00:59:46,817 --> 00:59:50,685
- Coffee or tea?
- Coffee. Light.

471
00:59:50,821 --> 00:59:53,619
- Two coffees, please.
- Yes, Madam.

472
00:59:54,224 --> 00:59:58,183
This maid is an angel.
How long have you had her?

473
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:03,957
My upstairs maid has
her husband sick.

474
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:06,035
I don't know what's wrong
with him. And Olguita...

475
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:08,730
...can't cope with everything.

476
01:00:10,341 --> 01:00:12,639
The drawings?

477
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:20,577
I forgot them.
I forgot them!

478
01:00:31,729 --> 01:00:33,697
Cover yourself, Jeremías.

479
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:37,763
You're too old for this.

480
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:44,202
Mom's gone.
Let's jacuzzi.

481
01:00:59,223 --> 01:01:01,282
Answer the phone!

482
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:06,227
Oh God! They're home.

483
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:09,731
But they won't answer.
Unbelievable!

484
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:13,069
I'll drive you over.

485
01:01:13,303 --> 01:01:15,669
But they're home.

486
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:34,316
- You know where they are?
- Of course.

487
01:01:40,764 --> 01:01:42,891
- Careful!
- Yes.

488
01:01:53,143 --> 01:01:54,667
Let me see.

489
01:01:55,345 --> 01:01:56,676
No.

490
01:01:58,148 --> 01:02:00,139
Where are they?

491
01:02:05,355 --> 01:02:06,788
Meme!

492
01:02:08,225 --> 01:02:09,886
Jere!

493
01:02:11,528 --> 01:02:13,928
Where are they?
Anybody home?

494
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:12,272
No! No! No!

495
01:05:13,877 --> 01:05:15,742
Let her go!

496
01:05:18,181 --> 01:05:22,174
Let her go, for God's sake!

497
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:54,542
Mom! Mom!
Forgive me, Mom!

498
01:05:54,685 --> 01:05:56,243
Forgive me!

499
01:06:39,796 --> 01:06:42,162
Mom!

500
01:07:26,143 --> 01:07:27,940
Lucía!

501
01:08:03,713 --> 01:08:05,146
Lucía!

502
01:08:09,586 --> 01:08:11,144
Lucía!

503
01:08:16,927 --> 01:08:18,758
Lucía!

504
01:08:35,745 --> 01:08:37,576
What are you doing, Mom?

505
01:08:37,714 --> 01:08:42,083
Bring champagne.
Let's make a toast.

506
01:08:42,752 --> 01:08:44,720
What are you saying, Mom?

507
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:09,504
What did you do, Mom?!

508
01:09:10,747 --> 01:09:12,214
I don't know.

509
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:42,111
Bravo! Bravo!

510
01:09:45,115 --> 01:09:47,675
Long live the groom
and the bride!

511
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,192
Need help, Daniel?

512
01:10:07,804 --> 01:10:09,829
No, thank you.

513
01:10:15,145 --> 01:10:17,613
Long live the groom
and the bride!

514
01:10:23,687 --> 01:10:28,522
- I don't get it. - These things
happen all the time.

515
01:10:31,895 --> 01:10:35,797
- I can't understand.
- I told you a thousand times.

516
01:10:37,067 --> 01:10:39,558
I was in my room
and Meme was in hers.

517
01:10:40,837 --> 01:10:43,203
I heard some noises in the
kitchen. I went down and found...

518
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:45,740
Mom pointing a gun at her head.

519
01:10:48,345 --> 01:10:52,782
I struggled with her
and got hurt.

520
01:11:00,023 --> 01:11:03,186
Can't have a gun in the house.

521
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:09,596
This fucked-up country.

522
01:11:29,219 --> 01:11:33,087
- Olguita, dinner at 9.
- Yes, Madam.

523
01:11:58,581 --> 01:12:00,572
It stopped raining.

524
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:04,882
I love rain.

525
01:12:06,856 --> 01:12:11,054
- The kids?
- Downstairs with their father.

526
01:12:12,962 --> 01:12:17,558
- And Ezequiel? - He lives
in Barcelona, remember?

527
01:12:17,767 --> 01:12:19,792
Yes, sure.

528
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:25,034
Daniel hates the rain.

529
01:12:26,643 --> 01:12:30,511
When the kids were little,
we went every weekend...

530
01:12:30,647 --> 01:12:32,171
...to the country.

531
01:12:33,683 --> 01:12:37,278
He got furious when it rained
because he couldn't...

532
01:12:37,554 --> 01:12:39,181
...ride his mare.

533
01:12:41,324 --> 01:12:44,054
He loved that mare.

534
01:12:47,897 --> 01:12:50,923
I don't know if the kids
liked to go to the country.

535
01:12:53,970 --> 01:12:55,995
I didn't.

536
01:12:58,241 --> 01:13:00,766
I hate horses.

537
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:04,846
They scare me.

538
01:13:06,983 --> 01:13:11,886
But I learned how to ride.
I got used to it.

539
01:13:14,824 --> 01:13:19,989
But when I grew old,
I quit.

540
01:13:24,334 --> 01:13:26,859
Do you have children?

541
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:29,237
No.

542
01:15:06,869 --> 01:15:11,067
Touch me slowly

543
01:15:14,978 --> 01:15:18,072
Kiss my mouth

544
01:15:27,156 --> 01:15:31,889
Touch me slowly

545
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:35,691
...almost indifferently

546
01:15:39,669 --> 01:15:43,696
Kiss my mouth...

547
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:48,577
Caress me

548
01:15:51,848 --> 01:15:56,842
Why is it so easy
to love you?

549
01:16:10,133 --> 01:16:15,264
Life will be reckless

550
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:21,734
Desire. Live.
Touch you, lose myself

551
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:28,646
How can I know you
without having you?

552
01:16:34,857 --> 01:16:39,988
Life will be reckless

553
01:16:40,763 --> 01:16:46,258
Suffer. Cry till you break

554
01:16:47,570 --> 01:16:54,976
How can I love you
without fearing you?

555
01:17:00,116 --> 01:17:05,748
How can I know you
without having you?

556
01:17:06,823 --> 01:17:10,224
How can I love you?

557
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:23,534
Life will be reckless

558
01:18:04,247 --> 01:18:06,010
Touch me...

559
01:18:06,949 --> 01:18:09,577
...slowly

560
01:18:16,826 --> 01:18:18,316
Kiss...

561
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:21,856
...my mouth

562
01:19:00,765 --> 01:19:05,393
