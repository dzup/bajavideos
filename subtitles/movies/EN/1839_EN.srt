1
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:46,609
I'm going to the market, Idella.

2
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:48,236
Yes, ma'am.

3
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:55,585
<i>Pepsodent's new improved formula
cleans teeth whiter than ever.</i>

4
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,151
Are you all right, Miss Daisy?

5
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:28,578
That's good!

6
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,039
You two get back to work.

7
00:02:58,078 --> 00:02:59,067
Yes, ma'am.

8
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:35,374
-Mama.
-No.

9
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,241
-Mama?
-No!

10
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:44,046
It's a miracle you're not lying
at Emory Hospital or at the funeral parlor.

11
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,385
Cucumbers are pretty this summer.

12
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:50,993
You didn't even break your glasses.

13
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,062
It was the car's fault!

14
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,496
-You had the car in the wrong gear.
-I did not!

15
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,734
Idella, want a pickle with lunch?

16
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,165
Not me.

17
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:03,237
I'm putting up a jar
for you to take home to William.

18
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:04,298
Yes, ma'am.

19
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,905
You backed the car into the Pollack’s' yard.

20
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:12,345
You should have let me keep my LaSalle.
It wouldn’t have behaved this way.

21
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:16,018
Mama, cars don't behave.
They are behaved upon.

22
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,688
You demolished that Chrysler by yourself.

23
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,916
Think what you want. I know the truth.

24
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:24,694
The truth is you just cost
the insurance company $2,700.

25
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,692
You're a terrible risk.

26
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,924
Nobody will issue you a policy now.

27
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,434
You're just saying that to be hateful.

28
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:35,530
Okay. Yes, I am. I am making it all up.

29
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,701
Look out on the driveway!

30
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:41,040
Every insurance company in America
is out there...

31
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,772
...waving their pens
trying to get you to sign up.

32
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:48,714
If you're going to stand in my pantry
and lie like a rug, go somewhere else.

33
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,111
Okay.

34
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:53,549
I better get back to the office.

35
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,793
Florine will have a fit
if I don't get home on time tonight.

36
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,895
You all must have plans tonight.

37
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,794
The Ansleys' dinner party.

38
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,400
This is her idea of heaven on earth.

39
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:05,635
What?

40
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:08,396
Socializing with Episcopalians.

41
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,473
You are a doodle, Mama!

42
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,642
I'll stop by tomorrow evening.

43
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,316
How do you know I'll be here?

44
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:21,417
I'm not dependent on you for company.

45
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:23,745
Fine, I'll call first.

46
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,490
But you know, we have got
some real serious talking to do.

47
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,749
No!

48
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:30,184
Mama.

49
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:10,800
I need you now. I have to be
at the beauty shop in half an hour.

50
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:17,540
No, I most certainly did not know you
had to call a minimum of two hours ahead.

51
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:22,371
Why call yourself a taxicab company
if you can't provide taxicabs?

52
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:26,543
Why don't you call your son?
He'd send someone to carry you.

53
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,480
That won't be necessary.

54
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,813
I'll cancel the appointment
and fix my own hair.

55
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:36,492
Sometimes I think you ain't got
the sense God gave a lemon.

56
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,230
Two dots. I want that!

57
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,559
And a five bamboo.

58
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:47,829
Well, this is not my day for mah-jongg.

59
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,063
Nine bam!

60
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:53,906
Thank you all for coming here again.
I am a real pariah without my car.

61
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,171
-Oh, nonsense!
-Three bam.

62
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,739
When do you get the new one?

63
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:01,080
I don't know!
Boolie's being real pokey about it.

64
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,754
I'll come after you for temple tomorrow.

65
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:06,014
That's sweet of you, honey.

66
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,093
Mama, you there?

67
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:13,195
It's just us!

68
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:14,856
Why didn't you call?

69
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,193
We can't stay.

70
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,767
So I gather.

71
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:19,868
The Millers are giving a hayride.

72
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:23,372
I had these made.
Doesn't your baby look cute?

73
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:26,442
Well, it's not exactly the word I'd pick.

74
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:30,880
New Graham Greene?
I been wanting to read that.

75
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:34,380
Sorry, but it's due back
at the library tomorrow.

76
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,781
-Want me to return it for you?
-No, thank you.

77
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:39,718
I'll go to the library on the streetcar.

78
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,954
Damn it, Mama! Quit being so stubborn.
You know perfectly well--

79
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:48,299
Go on! Don't keep the horses waiting.

80
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,228
'Bye!

81
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,574
Is that door making contact?

82
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:12,646
Oscar?

83
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:13,814
I'm here.

84
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,655
-Are you all right?
-No, sir, I'm stuck.

85
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:19,090
I know. Fiddle with the lever.

86
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,825
It fiddled out. I done all I know how.

87
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,599
Call Bell Elevator.

88
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:29,171
I already did.
They're backed up until around 1 :00.

89
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,170
Did you tell them it's an emergency?

90
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,844
You don't have to holler, Mr. Werthan.

91
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:36,343
I didn't break the elevator.

92
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,274
Got that stuff for Davis & Paxon?

93
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,180
Wrapped and ready to go!

94
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,016
I told them they'd have it yesterday.
Call Bell again.

95
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,694
I hear you.

96
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:56,959
Look up where the gate
is supposed to close. See a doohickey?

97
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:58,467
Wait a minute.

98
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:00,861
Right here!

99
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,305
Reach up and mash it up until it catches.

100
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,210
I done it. Now what?

101
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,138
Operate the lever.

102
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,726
Do you work here?

103
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,557
No, sir. This here Hoke.

104
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:27,163
Hoke Colburn, sir.

105
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,831
How'd you know about the elevator?

106
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:31,333
I used to drive for a dairy, sir.

107
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,399
Their elevator was worse than this one.

108
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,734
Hoke's the one I told you about.

109
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,067
Of course.

110
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,520
Excuse me, sir.

111
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:53,849
Y'all people's Jewish, ain't you?

112
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:55,425
Yeah, we are. Why?

113
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,856
I'd rather work for Jews.

114
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,927
I know folks say they stingy and cheap.

115
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,430
But don't say none of that around me!

116
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,364
Good to know you feel that way.

117
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,993
What was your last job?

118
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:33,394
I worked for Judge Harold Stone,
a Jewish gentleman.

119
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:34,898
You drove for Judge Stone?

120
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:39,161
Seven years. I'd still be there
if he didn't up and die.

121
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:42,338
Mrs. Stone asked me
to move to Savannah with her.

122
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,009
Of course, my wife was dead by then.

123
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:47,405
But I said, ''No, thank you, ma'am.''

124
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,342
I didn't want to be too far
from my grandbabies.

125
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:52,177
Judge Stone was my father's friend.

126
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:53,749
You don't say?

127
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,578
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

128
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,746
Later, Miss McClatchey.

129
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:04,090
Oscar said you needed somebody
to drive for your family.

130
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:06,923
Will I be taking your children to school...

131
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,191
...and your wife to the beauty parlor?

132
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:12,197
I don't have any children. What I need--

133
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:15,864
You're still a young man.
Don't worry too much.

134
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,370
Thank you. I won't.

135
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:21,779
Hoke, I need somebody
to drive my mother around.

136
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,041
Your mother?

137
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:27,050
Yes. Well, if you don't mind asking, sir...

138
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,877
...why ain't she hiring for herself?.

139
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,382
It's a difficult situation.

140
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:37,719
She done gone around the bend a little.

141
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:40,125
That will happen as they get on.

142
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,889
No, she's all there!

143
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,232
Too much there is the problem!

144
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:49,467
I want you to understand something.

145
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,810
My mother is a Little high-strung.

146
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:57,405
The fact is, you would be working for me.

147
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,982
She can say anything she likes...

148
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:03,245
...but she can't fire you. Understand?

149
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:05,588
Yes, sir.

150
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:08,754
Yes, sir, I sure do.

151
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:10,758
Don't worry, Mr. Werthan.

152
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:13,825
I'll hold on no matter
which way she run me.

153
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,264
When I was a Little boy back on the farm
above Macon, where I come from...

154
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:21,437
...I wrestled hogs to the ground
during killing time.

155
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:25,266
Well, sir, there ain't a hog that's got away
from me yet!

156
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,053
How are you, Idella?

157
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:16,488
Living.

158
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,992
-Where's the new vacuum cleaner?
-In the closet.

159
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:21,392
She won't touch it.

160
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,329
It gives me a shock every time I'm near it.

161
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:25,834
It works for me.

162
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:29,998
Good! Then you clean
and I'll go down and run your office.

163
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,074
Where's Mama?

164
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:33,676
Up yonder.

165
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:35,844
I guess you know who this is.

166
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:39,676
I'll be right back.

167
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,081
I wouldn’t be in your shoes...

168
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:50,254
...if the sweet Lord Jesus came down
and asked me Himself.

169
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:01,134
'Morning, Mama.

170
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,447
Just come down and say hello.

171
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,209
You listen here.

172
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:19,288
Unless they rewrote the Constitution
and didn't tell me, I still have rights!

173
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:20,547
Of course.

174
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:25,389
What I do not want,
and absolutely will not have, is...

175
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:29,963
...some chauffeur sitting in my kitchen,
gobbling up my food, using my phone.

176
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,897
I'd hate that in my house.

177
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:33,230
You have Idella.

178
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:36,466
Idella's different!
She's been coming to me for years.

179
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:38,972
We stay out of each other's way.

180
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:42,578
Even so,
there are chips in my wedding china.

181
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:46,148
You think Idella has a vendetta
against your wedding china?

182
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:47,750
Don't be sassy.

183
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:51,146
When we couldn’t afford them,
we did for ourselves.

184
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:52,984
That's still the best way.

185
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:57,423
''Them?'' ''Afford them?''
You sound Like Governor Talmadge.

186
00:14:57,663 --> 00:15:00,655
What a thing to say! I'm not prejudiced!

187
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,661
Aren't you ashamed?

188
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,999
You might as well make the best of it.

189
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:11,225
I knew a Miss Idella once,
back down in Macon.

190
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:12,994
You don't say?

191
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:14,661
She could sing!

192
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,168
What are you talking about?

193
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,741
I'm talking about
this woman had some lungs!

194
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:23,004
She'd be a whole church choir by herself!

195
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:24,409
I declare!

196
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,012
Fat, too!

197
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,016
She was as big as that stove!

198
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:34,119
Don't talk to Idella! She has work to do.

199
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,700
What are you doing?

200
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,373
Dusting the bulbs, Miss Daisy.

201
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:54,035
That's the silliest thing I ever saw.

202
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,441
Who cares if lamp bulbs are dusty?

203
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,105
Get down from there!

204
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,780
Put that ladder away
before somebody trips on it.

205
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,226
I'm going, Miss Daisy.

206
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,792
All right, Idella. See you tomorrow.

207
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:14,727
-I'm going too, Miss Daisy.
-Good.

208
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,913
Good morning, Miss Daisy.
Thought I'd see after your zinnias.

209
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:37,418
You leave my flower bed alone.

210
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:43,421
You got a nice piece of ground
behind the garage that ain't doing nothing.

211
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,789
I could put in tomatoes, butter beans--

212
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:49,661
If I want a vegetable garden,
I'll plant it myself.

213
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:24,529
What are you doing?

214
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:29,630
I just love a house with pictures,
Miss Daisy.

215
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,365
It do make a home.

216
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:34,807
I don't want you nosing
through my things.

217
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:49,317
-Good morning, Miss Daisy.
-Good morning.

218
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:51,727
It was right cold in the night.

219
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:54,329
I wouldn’t know. I was asleep.

220
00:18:58,404 --> 00:19:00,964
Idella says we're running short on coffee...

221
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,506
...and Dutch cleanser.

222
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:04,164
We are?

223
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,399
Yes, ma'am.

224
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:07,909
We're low on silver polish, too.

225
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,571
I know.

226
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,842
I'm fixing to go to the Piggly Wiggly
on the trolley.

227
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:18,850
On the trolley!
Why don't you Let me carry you?

228
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,251
No, thank you.

229
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,620
Ain't that why Mr. Werthan hired me?

230
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:24,456
That's his problem.

231
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,864
All right. But I'm going to find
something to do here.

232
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,865
You Leave my things alone!

233
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,369
I'm going to the market, Idella.

234
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,702
Miss Daisy, it's a shame.

235
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:41,706
You have this fine Hudson automobile
out there in the garage.

236
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:45,940
It hasn't moved an inch
from when Mr. Werthan drove it here.

237
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:49,946
That insurance company
gave you a brand new car for nothing.

238
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:51,484
That's your opinion.

239
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:57,225
My other opinion is that
a fine, rich, Jewish lady Like yourself...

240
00:19:57,463 --> 00:20:02,298
...has no business dragging herself
onto a trolley carrying grocery bags.

241
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:04,462
I'll carry them for you.

242
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:06,068
I don't need you!

243
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:09,499
I don't want you! And don't say I'm rich!

244
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,608
-I won't say it no more.
-Is that what you and Idella talk about?

245
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:16,806
I hate being discussed behind my back
in my own house!

246
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,311
I was born on Forsyth Street.

247
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,747
Believe me, I know the value of a penny!

248
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:25,420
My brother brought home
a white cat once.

249
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:28,751
We couldn’t keep it
because we couldn’t afford to feed it!

250
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,753
My sister saved up money...

251
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:34,162
...so I could become a teacher!
We had nothing!

252
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,599
But you're doing all right now.

253
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,850
What are you doing?

254
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:05,619
I'm trying to drive you to the store!

255
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:15,035
Where are you off to this morning,
Miss Werthan?

256
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:16,968
Just a Little shopping.

257
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:21,476
Go away! I've ridden the trolley
with groceries plenty of times!

258
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:26,548
But I can't keep taking
Mr. Werthan's money for doing nothing.

259
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:28,546
How much does he pay you?

260
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:31,649
Miss Daisy, that's between him and me.

261
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:36,224
Anything over $7 a week
is highway robbery!

262
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,554
You sure are right about that!

263
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:40,765
Especially since I don't do nothing...

264
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,960
...but sit on a stool all day.

265
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,230
All right.

266
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:48,837
Piggly Wiggly...

267
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:52,070
...then home. Nowhere else.

268
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:10,689
Oh, I just Love the smell of a new car.

269
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,760
Don't you, Miss Daisy?

270
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:18,426
I am nobody's fool, Hoke.

271
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:20,035
I know!

272
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:22,706
My husband taught me to run a car.

273
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,874
I remember everything he said.

274
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:28,773
So don't think even for a second you....

275
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:30,947
Wait. You're speeding.

276
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,447
I can see it!

277
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:35,275
We're only going 19 miles an hour.

278
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:37,886
I Like to go under the speed limit.

279
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,381
But the speed Limit is 35 here.

280
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:43,288
The slower you go the more gas you save.

281
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:45,723
My husband taught me that!

282
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:50,463
Ain't hardly moving. Might as well walk...

283
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:52,292
...to the Piggly Wiggly.

284
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:54,532
Is this your car?

285
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:57,067
No.

286
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:58,901
Do you pay for the gas?

287
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:02,913
-No.
-All right, then!

288
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:05,580
My son thinks I'm losing my abilities...

289
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:09,150
...but I am still in control
of what goes on in my car!

290
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:14,248
Where are you going?

291
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,251
To the store, Like you said.

292
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:19,487
Why didn't you turn on Highland?

293
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,756
Piggly Wiggly ain't on Highland.

294
00:23:21,934 --> 00:23:25,267
I know where it is!
Now take Highland Avenue.

295
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:28,338
-That's three blocks out of the way.
-Go back this minute!

296
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:31,405
-I can't turn around now.
-I've been driving to Piggly Wiggly...

297
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:35,273
...since it opened for business.
This isn't the way!

298
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:37,171
Go back this minute!

299
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:40,841
Miss Daisy, look.
Yonder is the Piggly Wiggly. See?

300
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:45,183
Get ready to turn.

301
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:54,529
Careful. There's a Little girl.

302
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,427
Yes, I see her.

303
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:58,192
Pull in here.

304
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:08,205
Wait a minute.

305
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:10,147
Give me the keys.

306
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:18,382
Stay right here by the car.

307
00:24:18,724 --> 00:24:21,386
And don't tell everyone my business.

308
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:47,349
Mr. Werthan?

309
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:52,350
Yes, sir, it's me! Guess where I'm at.

310
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:55,682
I just drove your mama to the store!

311
00:24:56,361 --> 00:25:01,196
You know, she flapped around some,
but she's all right. She's in the store.

312
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:06,529
Oh, Lord, she just looked out the window
and seen me.

313
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:10,264
She'll probably throw a fit
right there at the check-out counter.

314
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:15,610
Yes, sir. You are right about that.
It only took me six days.

315
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:18,873
Same time it took the Lord
to make the world.

316
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:21,716
Yes, sir. All right. 'Bye.

317
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:36,231
Hey, Oscar, Junior.
How're you old boys doing today?

318
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,400
How's the Lady been treating you?

319
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:42,400
I'll tell you one thing:
she knows how to throw a fit.

320
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:44,902
What's so funny?

321
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:50,080
Nothing, Miss Daisy. We just carrying on.

322
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:54,479
Oscar and Junior been doing cleaning here
for 15 years. Never carried on before!

323
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:57,421
-Leave them alone.
-Yes, ma'am.

324
00:25:57,622 --> 00:26:00,216
-Put your coat on. We're late.
-I'll be right there.

325
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:03,425
Idella, I'm going now.

326
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:06,420
I'm right behind her.

327
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:18,603
Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God,
the Lord is one.

328
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:07,481
Such a nice man. And such a good,
short sermon, wasn't it?

329
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:17,562
I can get myself in!

330
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,326
Hurry out of here!

331
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:38,518
-Is something wrong, Miss Daisy?
-No.

332
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:42,516
-Something I've done?
-No.

333
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:45,756
Yes.

334
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:48,021
I ain't done anything.

335
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:53,101
You parked the car right in front of the
temple, Like I was the Queen of Romania.

336
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:55,032
Everybody saw you!

337
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,271
I said to wait for me in the back.

338
00:27:57,542 --> 00:28:00,534
<i>Yes, ma'am, but l was just trying to....</i>

339
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:03,370
<i>There were two chauffeurs
right behind me.</i>

340
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:06,775
You made me Look Like a fool. A g.d. fool!

341
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:11,216
Oh, Miss Daisy,
Lord knows you ain't a fool!

342
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:12,954
Slow down!

343
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:19,227
Miriam and Beulah, I could see what
they were thinking when we came out.

344
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:20,795
What's that?

345
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:23,727
That I was pretending to be rich!

346
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:26,134
-You is rich.
-No, I'm not!

347
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:28,565
Nobody can say I put on airs.

348
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:32,402
<i>On Forsyth Street we made many meals
out of grits and gravy.</i>

349
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:34,805
I have done without plenty of times.

350
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:39,073
Miss Daisy, if I was to ever
get my hands on what you got...

351
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:43,577
...shoot, I'd shake it around
for everyone in the world to see.

352
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:46,484
That is vulgar! Don't talk to me!

353
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,322
Never gonna understand some white folks.

354
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:53,494
What was that? I heard that!

355
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:57,324
Now, Miss Daisy, you need a chauffeur...

356
00:28:58,003 --> 00:28:59,834
...and, Lord knows, I need a job.

357
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:03,097
So why don't we just Leave it at that?

358
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:58,553
Hello.

359
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:01,388
Good morning, Mama. What's the matter?

360
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:06,501
No, I don't always think
something's wrong when you call.

361
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:09,070
Just when you call so early.

362
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:11,634
What?

363
00:30:13,345 --> 00:30:17,338
All right. I'll be there as soon as I can.

364
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:23,847
I better get on over there.

365
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:25,349
'Bye.

366
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:27,180
Come on.

367
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:30,352
It's not healthy to rush Like this.

368
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:32,856
I eat too much, anyway.

369
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:36,366
Besides, it sounds Like she needs me.

370
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:39,866
When doesn't it?
Give Mother Werthan my Love.

371
00:30:46,111 --> 00:30:47,772
Coffee, Katie Bell!

372
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,019
I didn't expect to find you in one piece.

373
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,888
I wanted you to be here when he comes.

374
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:06,520
I wanted you to hear it for yourself.

375
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,359
What is going on?

376
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,761
He's stealing from me.

377
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:13,267
Hoke? Are you sure?

378
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,268
I don't make empty accusations.
I have proof!

379
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:17,506
What proof?.

380
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:22,069
This! I found it hidden in the garbage
under some coffee grounds.

381
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:25,948
-He stole a can of salmon?
-Here it is!

382
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,708
I knew there was something funny.

383
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:32,548
They all take things, you know,
so I counted.

384
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:35,325
-You counted?
-The silverware first.

385
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:38,794
Then the linen napkins.
And then I went into the pantry.

386
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:44,228
And the first thing
that caught my eye was a hole...

387
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:46,130
...behind the lima beans.

388
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:48,564
And I knew right away.

389
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:53,309
There were only eight cans of salmon.
I had nine!

390
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:54,968
Three for $1 on sale.

391
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,907
Very clever, Mama.

392
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,910
I missed my breakfast
and I'm Late to a meeting...

393
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:02,415
...for a 33ç can of salmon?

394
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,745
You want 33ç? Here's $1 !

395
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,915
Here's $10!
Buy yourself a pantry full of salmon!

396
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,753
Why, Boolie, the idea!

397
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,089
Waving money at me Like that!

398
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,764
I don't want money. I want my things!

399
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:18,432
-One can of salmon?
-Well, it was mine!

400
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,932
I Leave him plenty of food every day.

401
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,764
I tell him exactly what it is.

402
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:28,604
They're Like children.
If they want something, they just take it!

403
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,505
He'll never admit this.

404
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:33,845
''No,'' he'll say,
''I don't know nothing about that! ''

405
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:37,952
I don't Like it!
I don't Like living with no privacy.

406
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:43,627
Go ahead, defend him. You always do!

407
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:48,362
I give up! You want to drive again,
arrange your own insurance.

408
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:50,093
Take the trolley.

409
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:53,168
Buy yourself a taxicab!
Anything you want!

410
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:55,666
Just Leave me out of it!

411
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:57,568
Why, Boolie!

412
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:06,172
What do you reckon he's doing here
this time of morning?

413
00:33:06,518 --> 00:33:09,180
Can't be good, I promise you that!

414
00:33:20,632 --> 00:33:22,725
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Miss Daisy.

415
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:25,869
I think it's fixing to clear up out there!

416
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:29,366
Excuse me, Mr. Werthan. Y'all busy?

417
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:32,601
We have to have a Little talk, Hoke.

418
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:37,875
All right, just Let me get out of my coat.

419
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:49,115
Yesterday while you were out,
I ate a can of your salmon.

420
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:53,628
Now I know you said to eat
the leftover pork chops.

421
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:56,296
Well, they were kind of stiff.

422
00:33:56,634 --> 00:34:00,126
So I stopped by
the Piggly Wiggly and got you another can.

423
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:02,464
Do you want me to put it on the shelf?.

424
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:06,403
Yes, thank you, Hoke.

425
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:08,572
I'll be right with you, Mr. Werthan.

426
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:14,245
Well, I got to get dressed now.

427
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:16,747
Good-bye, Son.

428
00:35:56,587 --> 00:36:00,250
You know, Miss Daisy, I was just thinking.

429
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:04,425
We been out to this cemetery
three times this month already.

430
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:06,187
It ain't even the 20th yet.

431
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:08,092
It's good to come in nice weather.

432
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:11,858
Yes, ma'am. You sure right about that.
Sure is.

433
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:17,438
Mr. Sig's grave is mighty well tended.

434
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:21,367
I think you're the best widow
in the State of Georgia.

435
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:25,706
Boolie's always pestering me
to have the staff here tend to this plot.

436
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,382
''Perpetual care,'' they call it.

437
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:30,777
Well, don't you do it!

438
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:34,785
It's right to have a member of the family
Looking after you.

439
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:39,723
I'll never have that! Boolie will have me
in perpetual care before I'm cold.

440
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:44,724
Miss Daisy,
you ought to go on away from here!

441
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:49,904
Put that azalea on Leo Bauer's grave.

442
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:54,568
Leo Bauer.
Is that Miss Rose Bauer's husband?

443
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:57,570
She asked me to bring it out here.

444
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:01,912
Where is his grave at, Miss Daisy?

445
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:07,151
I'm not exactly sure.
I know it's two rows over that way.

446
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:10,324
You'll see the headstone, ''Bauer.''

447
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:15,427
What's wrong?

448
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,763
Nothing wrong. Nothing the matter at all.

449
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:27,608
Now, you say--

450
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:32,113
I told you it's two rows over that way.
It says ''Bauer'' on the headstone.

451
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:35,979
What's that Look Like?

452
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:37,853
What are you talking about?

453
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:42,187
I'm talking about I can't read, ma'am.

454
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:44,223
What?

455
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:46,427
I can't read, Miss Daisy.

456
00:37:46,798 --> 00:37:49,028
You Look at the paper all the time.

457
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,963
Well, that's just it. I just be looking!

458
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:55,636
I try to dope out what's going on...

459
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:57,204
...from the pictures.

460
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:58,965
You know your letters?

461
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:02,805
Yes, ma'am. I know my ABC's.
I just can't read.

462
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:05,340
Stop saying that! You're making me mad!

463
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:08,808
If you know your Letters,
then you can read.

464
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,051
You just don't know you can read.

465
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:15,652
I taught some of the stupidest children
God ever put on this earth.

466
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:19,056
And they all could read enough
to find a name on a tombstone.

467
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:21,990
The name is ''Bauer.''

468
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:29,400
''Bauer! '' What does that ''buh'' letter
sound Like?

469
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:33,503
-B?
-Of course!

470
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:39,172
''Er.'' That is the Last part. ''Bauer! ''

471
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:41,078
What Letter sounds Like ''er''?

472
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:44,510
R!

473
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:46,884
-So the first Letter is....
-B!

474
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:48,389
And the Last Letter?

475
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:49,615
R!

476
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:51,858
B-R. ''B''-''er.''

477
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:54,758
It even sounds Like Bauer, doesn't it?

478
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:59,260
It sure do, Miss Daisy! It sure do!

479
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:05,098
-That it?
-That's it.

480
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:09,869
-We won't worry about the middle?
-Not right now.

481
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:13,049
This will be enough for you to find it.
Go on, now.

482
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,071
B at the beginning.

483
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:40,737
R at the end.

484
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:50,080
B...R.

485
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:52,586
That's it.

486
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:55,419
That's all right!

487
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:10,740
-Miss Daisy.
-Yes?

488
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:14,334
I sure do appreciate this!

489
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:16,776
Don't be ridiculous! I didn't do anything!

490
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:21,949
Let's get all this back in the car.
I'm burning up out here.

491
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:25,344
Here we go.

492
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,841
Of course I told you!

493
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:50,837
Of course I told you!

494
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:55,842
How can I be expected to buy it
if you don't write it down?

495
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,951
I'm sorry, Miss Florine.

496
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,951
I need you.

497
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:06,959
I'll be right there.

498
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:11,032
Do you have any idea what it takes
to give a Christmas reception?

499
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:13,360
It takes an eye for detail.

500
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:17,964
I told you a million times,
Katie Bell, write it down!

501
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,300
More I cannot do!

502
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,639
We're out of coconut.

503
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,711
I'm sure we can manage.

504
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:27,976
-I told her.
-But you didn't write it down!

505
00:41:28,386 --> 00:41:32,220
I don't need to stand and listen to excuses
on Christmas.

506
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:37,320
You figure out how to serve ambrosia
to 50 people without coconut. I give up!

507
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:45,602
<i>Don't worry, Katie Bell.
It's not quite the end of the world.</i>

508
00:41:57,815 --> 00:42:01,649
Everybody's giving the Georgia
Power Company a merry Christmas.

509
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:06,722
Bet Miss Florine beat them all,
especially with the new house.

510
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:07,980
Absurd!

511
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:13,060
If I had a nose Like Florine, I wouldn’t say,
''Merry Christmas'' to anybody.

512
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:20,835
I really do enjoy a Christmas
at their house.

513
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:24,001
No wonder. You're the only Christian
in the place.

514
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:26,072
They got that new cook.

515
00:42:26,343 --> 00:42:31,007
Florine never could keep help.
Of course, it's none of my affair.

516
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:35,246
Too much running around:
the Garden Club this...

517
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:38,752
...the Junior League that.
As if they'd give her the time of day.

518
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:43,687
She'd die before she'd fix a glass
of iced tea for the Temple Sisterhood.

519
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:49,596
I hope she doesn't take it
into her head to sing this year.

520
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:57,930
Lord, have mercy!
Look what Miss Florine done.

521
00:42:58,209 --> 00:43:01,872
If her grandfather, old man Frietag,
could see this....

522
00:43:02,213 --> 00:43:03,703
What is it you say?

523
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:08,282
I bet he'd jump out of his grave
and snatch her baldheaded.

524
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:20,223
Jump up and snatch her baldheaded.

525
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:25,132
Oh, Miss Daisy, you go on away from here.

526
00:43:34,145 --> 00:43:35,476
Wait a minute.

527
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,971
This isn't a Christmas present.

528
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:41,574
You know I don't give Christmas presents.

529
00:43:41,886 --> 00:43:43,717
I happened to run across it this morning.

530
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,454
Well, go on, open it.

531
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:55,996
Look at that.

532
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:59,830
Ain't nobody never gave me
no book before.

533
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:04,263
''Zaner Method Writing.''

534
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:07,668
I always taught out of these.
I saved a few.

535
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:11,178
It's faded, but it works.

536
00:44:11,515 --> 00:44:13,847
If you practice, you'll write nicely.

537
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:15,676
But you have to practice.

538
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:20,454
I taught Mayor Hartsfield
out of the same book.

539
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:22,249
I sure do thank you.

540
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:24,120
It's not a Christmas present.

541
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:27,353
Jews have no business
giving Christmas presents.

542
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:31,134
You don't have to go yapping about this
to Boolie or Florine.

543
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:33,199
This is between you and me.

544
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:36,636
Merry Christmas, Mother Werthan.

545
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:39,135
I hope I don't spit up.

546
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:41,467
Merry Christmas, Mama. Hoke.

547
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:27,854
She fought me on this one...

548
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:30,691
...but it is time for a trade.

549
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:34,257
I'll bet you'll miss the old one.

550
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:37,523
No, sir, I don't expect
I'll miss it that much.

551
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:41,531
Come on, you're the only one
who's driven it all this time.

552
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:43,765
Won't you be a Little sorry to see it go?

553
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:46,933
It ain't going nowhere. I done bought it.

554
00:45:47,278 --> 00:45:48,267
You didn't.

555
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:51,878
I sure did. Already made the deal
with Mr. Red Mitchell.

556
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:53,547
How much?

557
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:56,546
That is for him and me to know.

558
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:58,047
Hey, Boolie!

559
00:45:58,255 --> 00:45:59,950
Got a gem here.

560
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:01,521
Got that paper, Hoke?

561
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:03,786
I got it right here.

562
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:05,188
Be right there.

563
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:09,059
Why didn't you buy it from Mama?
You would’ve saved money.

564
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,736
No, sir. Your mama is in my business
enough as it is.

565
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:15,962
I ain't studying about making
monthly payments to her.

566
00:46:17,574 --> 00:46:18,632
She is mine the regular way.

567
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:20,801
The Hudson's a good car.

568
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:23,076
Nobody knows that better than you.

569
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,641
Best that ever come off the line.

570
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:30,250
And this here new one,
if Miss Daisy don't take to it...

571
00:46:30,654 --> 00:46:33,088
...I'll Let her ride in this one.

572
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:34,821
Mighty nice of you.

573
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:37,757
We do what we can.

574
00:47:42,223 --> 00:47:44,054
It is three after seven.

575
00:47:44,392 --> 00:47:48,055
Yes, ma'am. You said we were leaving
at fifteen to eight.

576
00:47:48,329 --> 00:47:50,320
At the latest, I said.

577
00:47:51,999 --> 00:47:56,493
What business you got dragging
this mess out of the house by yourself?.

578
00:47:56,738 --> 00:47:58,399
Who was here to help me?

579
00:47:58,906 --> 00:48:00,498
Lord, have mercy!

580
00:48:00,742 --> 00:48:03,905
It don't take more than five minutes
to load this car.

581
00:48:04,178 --> 00:48:08,672
You're fixing to break your arms and
your legs before we even Leave the manor.

582
00:48:08,916 --> 00:48:10,508
You're taking on too much.

583
00:48:10,685 --> 00:48:12,346
I hate doing things at the Last minute.

584
00:48:12,687 --> 00:48:16,248
What you talking about?
Been ready to go for a week and a half.

585
00:48:16,524 --> 00:48:19,186
-Give me that.
-No, don't touch that.

586
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,523
It sure is pretty.
Is that Mr. Walter's present?

587
00:48:22,764 --> 00:48:25,699
Yes. It's fragile. I'll put it on the seat.

588
00:48:26,234 --> 00:48:27,462
Good morning, Mr. Werthan.

589
00:48:27,535 --> 00:48:29,196
You nearly missed us.

590
00:48:29,437 --> 00:48:30,927
<i>You were Leaving at quarter of.</i>

591
00:48:31,205 --> 00:48:33,605
-She's taking on.
-Be still!

592
00:48:34,609 --> 00:48:36,770
Florine bought this for Uncle Walter.

593
00:48:37,211 --> 00:48:39,042
Mama, it's not a snake!

594
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,872
I think it's notepaper.

595
00:48:41,115 --> 00:48:44,278
How appropriate. Uncle Walter can't see.

596
00:48:44,552 --> 00:48:45,780
Maybe it's soap.

597
00:48:45,953 --> 00:48:49,946
How nice that you take an interest
in your uncle’s 90th birthday.

598
00:48:50,224 --> 00:48:51,521
Don't start up with me, Mama.

599
00:48:51,793 --> 00:48:53,624
I can't go to Mobile with you.

600
00:48:53,761 --> 00:48:55,558
I have to go to New York for a convention.

601
00:48:55,963 --> 00:48:57,794
The convention starts Monday.

602
00:48:58,065 --> 00:49:00,056
And I know what else I know.

603
00:49:00,301 --> 00:49:04,067
Leave Florine out of this.
She ordered the tickets eight months ago.

604
00:49:04,238 --> 00:49:07,571
<i>I'm sure My Fair Lady is more important
than your relatives.</i>

605
00:49:08,075 --> 00:49:10,737
Those Christians will be impressed.

606
00:49:11,078 --> 00:49:13,308
I can't talk to you when you're Like this.

607
00:49:15,483 --> 00:49:18,714
-We're expected in Mobile for supper.
-You'll be there.

608
00:49:20,087 --> 00:49:24,251
-How will you stand her all day?
-They'll fix crab. All that trouble.

609
00:49:25,259 --> 00:49:26,749
She's just worked up.

610
00:49:26,928 --> 00:49:29,419
Here's $50 in case you have trouble.

611
00:49:29,831 --> 00:49:31,492
Don't show it to Mama!

612
00:49:32,166 --> 00:49:35,431
-Have you got a map?
-She's got it in the back seat.

613
00:49:36,671 --> 00:49:38,502
<i>It's 7:16!</i>

614
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:42,275
You should have a job on the radio
announcing the time.

615
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:44,603
-I want to miss rush hour.
-You will.

616
00:49:44,779 --> 00:49:48,340
Congratulate Uncle Walter for me
and kiss everybody in Mobile.

617
00:49:49,684 --> 00:49:51,015
The air conditioning...

618
00:49:51,285 --> 00:49:53,446
...did you check it, Like I said?

619
00:49:54,021 --> 00:49:56,012
I got the air conditioning checked.

620
00:49:56,357 --> 00:49:59,520
I don't know why.
You never Let me turn it on!

621
00:49:59,694 --> 00:50:00,854
Hush up!

622
00:50:03,397 --> 00:50:04,989
Goodbye.

623
00:50:06,367 --> 00:50:07,857
Good Luck!

624
00:50:08,803 --> 00:50:10,293
Good God!

625
00:50:29,891 --> 00:50:31,222
Turn left.

626
00:50:32,393 --> 00:50:34,725
No, right! Turn right!

627
00:51:17,371 --> 00:51:20,704
Did I ever tell you about
the first time I Left Georgia?

628
00:51:20,942 --> 00:51:22,273
When was that?

629
00:51:23,044 --> 00:51:24,443
A few minutes back!

630
00:51:24,712 --> 00:51:26,043
Go on!

631
00:51:27,114 --> 00:51:28,274
My daughter...

632
00:51:28,549 --> 00:51:31,040
...is married to a Pullman porter.

633
00:51:31,552 --> 00:51:33,713
She is always on the go.

634
00:51:34,121 --> 00:51:37,955
New York, Detroit, Saint Louis....

635
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,461
<i>l say, ''That's all well and good,
Tommie Lee...</i>

636
00:51:42,797 --> 00:51:45,288
<i>''...but l don't feel the need for it. ''</i>

637
00:51:46,133 --> 00:51:47,794
So here it is.

638
00:51:48,302 --> 00:51:49,792
The first time.

639
00:51:50,805 --> 00:51:52,796
I might tell you, Miss Daisy...

640
00:51:53,808 --> 00:51:56,572
...Alabama ain't Looking Like much so far!

641
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:32,172
Idella sure does stuff eggs good!

642
00:52:32,446 --> 00:52:34,607
You stuff yourself good.

643
00:52:44,959 --> 00:52:48,292
I was thinking
about the first time I went to Mobile.

644
00:52:48,963 --> 00:52:52,524
It was Walter’s wedding. 1888.

645
00:52:52,867 --> 00:52:57,133
1888! You were nothing
but a Little bitty thing.

646
00:52:57,371 --> 00:52:59,032
I was 12.

647
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,631
We went on the train.

648
00:53:01,976 --> 00:53:04,137
Oh, I was so excited.

649
00:53:05,479 --> 00:53:07,709
I'd never been in a wedding party.

650
00:53:08,049 --> 00:53:10,210
And I'd never seen the ocean.

651
00:53:12,219 --> 00:53:17,054
Papa said it was the Gulf of Mexico, not
the ocean, but it was all the same to me.

652
00:53:19,894 --> 00:53:24,729
I asked Papa if it was all right
for me to dip my hand in the water.

653
00:53:26,067 --> 00:53:29,230
He laughed because I was so timid.

654
00:53:32,406 --> 00:53:36,069
And then I tasted the salt water
on my fingers.

655
00:53:40,748 --> 00:53:43,581
Isn't that a silly thing to remember?

656
00:53:44,418 --> 00:53:46,613
No sillier than what most folks remember.

657
00:53:48,189 --> 00:53:49,349
Boy!

658
00:53:50,458 --> 00:53:51,891
Yes, sir.

659
00:53:52,093 --> 00:53:54,118
What are you doing with this car?

660
00:53:54,195 --> 00:53:55,856
This is my car, Officer.

661
00:53:57,098 --> 00:54:01,694
Can I see your registration,
please, and your license, boy.

662
00:54:13,214 --> 00:54:15,546
What's this name? Wertheran?

663
00:54:15,883 --> 00:54:17,043
Werthan.

664
00:54:17,785 --> 00:54:20,117
Never heard that one before.
What kind of name is it?

665
00:54:20,387 --> 00:54:22,378
It's of German derivation.

666
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:24,951
German derivation.

667
00:54:41,175 --> 00:54:42,403
Thank you, ma'am.

668
00:55:18,512 --> 00:55:22,846
An old nigger and an old Jew woman
riding down the road together.

669
00:55:23,284 --> 00:55:25,377
Now that is one sorry sight.

670
00:55:36,363 --> 00:55:37,523
Oh, my God!

671
00:55:37,865 --> 00:55:40,356
The sign says Phoenix City 30 miles.

672
00:55:40,634 --> 00:55:44,126
We're not supposed to go to Phoenix City!
Oh, my God!

673
00:55:44,371 --> 00:55:45,702
Maybe you read it wrong.

674
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:49,874
I didn't. Stop the car. Stop the car!

675
00:55:50,211 --> 00:55:52,042
Lord, have mercy.

676
00:56:02,056 --> 00:56:05,992
Here. You took the wrong turn at Opelika.

677
00:56:06,227 --> 00:56:09,890
You took it with me, Miss Daisy,
and you got the map.

678
00:56:10,231 --> 00:56:13,223
I was getting the Lunch!
Go on back. My God!

679
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:16,663
It ain't been more than 30 minutes
since we turned.

680
00:56:58,279 --> 00:57:00,440
They fixed crab for me.

681
00:57:00,948 --> 00:57:04,281
Minnie always fixes crab.
They go to so much trouble.

682
00:57:04,551 --> 00:57:06,382
It's all ruined by now.

683
00:57:09,123 --> 00:57:11,114
We going to have to pull over.

684
00:57:11,325 --> 00:57:12,917
What's wrong with the car?

685
00:57:13,294 --> 00:57:15,285
There ain't nothing wrong with the car.

686
00:57:15,562 --> 00:57:17,553
I got to be excused.

687
00:57:19,566 --> 00:57:21,466
I got to go make water.

688
00:57:22,403 --> 00:57:25,133
You should have thought of that
at the service station.

689
00:57:25,406 --> 00:57:30,070
You know colored can't use the toilet
at any service station, Miss Daisy.

690
00:57:30,311 --> 00:57:34,145
There's no time to stop.
We'll be in Mobile soon. You can wait.

691
00:57:40,254 --> 00:57:41,243
No, ma'am.

692
00:57:44,091 --> 00:57:47,254
-I told you to wait!
-I heard what you said.

693
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:53,923
How do you think I feel having to ask you,
''Can I go make water?''

694
00:57:54,101 --> 00:57:55,762
Like I'm some child.

695
00:57:56,437 --> 00:57:57,768
You ought to be ashamed.

696
00:57:58,005 --> 00:58:00,166
I ain't no child, Miss Daisy.

697
00:58:00,674 --> 00:58:05,441
And I ain't just a back of the neck you
Look at while you go where you got to go.

698
00:58:05,846 --> 00:58:10,283
I'm a man, I'm near 70 years old,
and I know when my bladder’s full.

699
00:58:11,952 --> 00:58:14,011
Now I'm going to get out of this car...

700
00:58:14,188 --> 00:58:17,021
...and go over there
and do what I got to do.

701
00:58:17,791 --> 00:58:21,784
I'm taking the key with me, too.
Now that's all there is to it!

702
00:58:48,822 --> 00:58:49,982
Hoke!

703
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,332
Hoke!

704
00:59:06,173 --> 00:59:07,162
Hoke?

705
00:59:21,522 --> 00:59:23,251
You all right, Miss Daisy?

706
00:59:24,258 --> 00:59:25,748
Of course I am.

707
00:59:29,963 --> 00:59:33,956
Is that you, Slick? It's Boolie.
How you doing?

708
00:59:34,201 --> 00:59:36,795
Congratulations on your dad's big day.

709
00:59:37,204 --> 00:59:40,173
Thank you, Boolie.
Thank you. Aunt Daisy!

710
00:59:45,212 --> 00:59:46,804
It's Boolie on the phone.

711
00:59:48,782 --> 00:59:49,771
Hello!

712
00:59:50,484 --> 00:59:51,974
Hey, Son!

713
00:59:52,486 --> 00:59:55,046
Uncle Walter appreciates your call.

714
00:59:55,322 --> 00:59:57,722
I don't think he can come to the phone.

715
00:59:57,991 --> 00:59:59,652
Fine. How's Hoke?

716
00:59:59,827 --> 01:00:01,818
What do you mean? How should he be?

717
01:00:02,896 --> 01:00:04,727
Happy birthday, Uncle Walter.

718
01:00:04,998 --> 01:00:06,829
I got to hang up now, Boolie.

719
01:00:07,334 --> 01:00:08,824
Yeah, I'll tell him.

720
01:00:54,615 --> 01:00:55,946
'Morning, Miss McClatchey.

721
01:00:57,618 --> 01:00:59,609
Well, good morning to you.

722
01:01:01,555 --> 01:01:02,613
Can I see him?

723
01:01:03,457 --> 01:01:05,448
It's Mr. Sinclair Harris, sir.

724
01:01:05,792 --> 01:01:07,384
My cousin Sinclair?

725
01:01:07,628 --> 01:01:11,291
His wife.... The one that talks funny.

726
01:01:11,632 --> 01:01:13,623
She's from Canton, Ohio.

727
01:01:14,968 --> 01:01:16,458
She's trying to hire me.

728
01:01:18,238 --> 01:01:20,729
-What?
-Yes, sir. She said:

729
01:01:20,974 --> 01:01:23,135
''How they treating you
down there, Hoke?''

730
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:26,243
You know how she sounds,
Like her nose is stuffed up.

731
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:29,813
So I said, ''Fine, Mrs. Harris,
just fine, thank you.''

732
01:01:30,083 --> 01:01:34,076
She said, ''Well, you Looking for a change,
you know who to call.''

733
01:01:34,488 --> 01:01:36,149
I'll be damned!

734
01:01:36,490 --> 01:01:38,822
I thought you ought to know about it.

735
01:01:39,426 --> 01:01:41,087
I'll be goddamned.

736
01:01:41,328 --> 01:01:42,989
Ain't she a mess?

737
01:01:43,931 --> 01:01:46,263
Said, ''Name your own salary.''

738
01:01:49,002 --> 01:01:52,335
I see. And did you?

739
01:01:54,174 --> 01:01:55,163
Did I what?

740
01:01:55,442 --> 01:01:59,276
-Name your own salary?
-Go away. What you think I am?

741
01:01:59,513 --> 01:02:03,677
I ain't studying about going to work
for no trashy something Like her.

742
01:02:05,018 --> 01:02:07,680
But she got you thinking, didn't she?

743
01:02:07,955 --> 01:02:10,617
Well, sir, you might say that.

744
01:02:13,126 --> 01:02:14,787
''Name your salary.''

745
01:02:15,462 --> 01:02:17,293
That's exactly what she said.

746
01:02:19,299 --> 01:02:22,791
<i>Well, how does $65 a week sound?</i>

747
01:02:24,304 --> 01:02:26,135
Sounds pretty good, sir.

748
01:02:26,873 --> 01:02:30,365
Course, $75 sounds better.

749
01:02:31,878 --> 01:02:33,470
It sure does!

750
01:02:36,717 --> 01:02:38,207
Beginning this week.

751
01:02:41,221 --> 01:02:43,212
That's mighty nice of you.

752
01:02:43,490 --> 01:02:45,651
I sure appreciate this. Thank you.

753
01:02:50,063 --> 01:02:52,054
You ever have folks fighting over you?

754
01:02:53,333 --> 01:02:54,493
No.

755
01:02:56,003 --> 01:02:57,732
It sure feels good.

756
01:03:05,912 --> 01:03:07,243
One dot.

757
01:03:12,586 --> 01:03:13,917
Nine dot.

758
01:03:16,923 --> 01:03:17,912
Two dot.

759
01:03:18,525 --> 01:03:19,583
Mah-jongg.

760
01:03:19,926 --> 01:03:22,417
You are the luckiest thing, Beulah!

761
01:03:24,865 --> 01:03:25,854
Excuse me.

762
01:03:39,379 --> 01:03:41,870
I don't know how you can Look at that.

763
01:03:44,051 --> 01:03:46,713
See it a few times, you get in it.

764
01:03:47,554 --> 01:03:50,387
Both your brains are fixing to evaporate.

765
01:03:51,625 --> 01:03:53,616
You can bring the cake now, Hoke.

766
01:03:54,394 --> 01:03:56,555
Don't make a mess with those peas.

767
01:03:56,797 --> 01:03:58,458
Do I ever?

768
01:03:59,466 --> 01:04:02,958
Lord, have mercy, Look at that.
Ain't she got a lot of hair?

769
01:04:03,303 --> 01:04:05,066
How she get it so shiny?

770
01:04:05,305 --> 01:04:07,068
Washes it in mayonnaise.

771
01:04:07,908 --> 01:04:10,741
-Go on away from here, Idella!
-Yes, she did.

772
01:04:10,977 --> 01:04:12,968
<i>I read it in Life magazine.</i>

773
01:04:14,648 --> 01:04:16,479
Don't seem human, does it?

774
01:04:17,084 --> 01:04:19,814
<i>He will tear you to shreds!</i>

775
01:04:20,153 --> 01:04:23,816
<i>l am not going into that court,
and I’m not giving in!</i>

776
01:04:24,091 --> 01:04:26,582
<i>You are at the end of your rope.</i>

777
01:04:26,827 --> 01:04:29,318
<i>You murdered Carlson. You'll have to pay!</i>

778
01:04:29,596 --> 01:04:34,431
<i>Either choose the easy way out,
or you go into that courtroom...</i>

779
01:04:34,668 --> 01:04:37,501
<i>...and let them carve you
into pathetic little bits.</i>

780
01:04:37,838 --> 01:04:40,671
<i>You have a minute to make up your mind.</i>

781
01:04:44,511 --> 01:04:47,503
What happened?
She up to something, ain't she?

782
01:06:28,615 --> 01:06:31,448
-You fixing to ruin it.
-What are you talking about?

783
01:06:31,718 --> 01:06:35,552
You got the chicken too close together
and the fire is too high.

784
01:06:35,722 --> 01:06:37,280
Mind your business.

785
01:06:38,124 --> 01:06:40,456
It's your chicken.

786
01:07:02,415 --> 01:07:03,746
Thank you, Hoke.

787
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:06,141
Now you enjoy it.

788
01:07:25,438 --> 01:07:26,769
Amen.

789
01:09:02,602 --> 01:09:03,762
Who is it?

790
01:09:04,037 --> 01:09:05,868
'Morning, Miss Daisy.

791
01:09:08,208 --> 01:09:10,369
What in the world....

792
01:09:12,612 --> 01:09:17,106
I learned how to drive on ice
when I delivered milk for the dairy.

793
01:09:17,717 --> 01:09:19,378
Ain't nothing to it.

794
01:09:20,053 --> 01:09:24,217
Other folks are banging into each other
Like they're in the funny papers.

795
01:09:26,059 --> 01:09:30,393
I figured your stove was out,
so I stopped by the Krispy Kreme.

796
01:09:30,597 --> 01:09:33,430
I know you got to have coffee
in the morning.

797
01:09:34,034 --> 01:09:36,025
How sweet of you, Hoke.

798
01:09:38,605 --> 01:09:42,701
We ain't had any good coffee around here
since Idella passed.

799
01:09:43,443 --> 01:09:45,434
I can fix her biscuits.

800
01:09:45,779 --> 01:09:48,270
We both can make her fried chicken.

801
01:09:48,715 --> 01:09:50,444
But nobody can make Idella's coffee.

802
01:09:50,950 --> 01:09:52,781
Ain't that the truth?

803
01:09:58,625 --> 01:10:00,456
Idella was lucky.

804
01:10:06,466 --> 01:10:08,297
I expect she was.

805
01:10:23,316 --> 01:10:24,806
Where are you going?

806
01:10:25,752 --> 01:10:28,152
I'm just going to take these things off.

807
01:10:28,655 --> 01:10:32,147
I don't know what you can do here today,
except keep me company.

808
01:10:34,494 --> 01:10:36,826
I'll see if I can make us a fire.

809
01:10:38,932 --> 01:10:41,423
Eat anything you want out of the ice box.

810
01:10:41,935 --> 01:10:44,096
It will all spoil, anyway.

811
01:10:45,338 --> 01:10:49,172
And wipe up what you tracked
onto my floor.

812
01:10:49,442 --> 01:10:52,104
What do you think I am? A mess?

813
01:10:54,914 --> 01:10:55,744
Hello.

814
01:10:55,815 --> 01:10:57,282
<i>Mama, I'll be right out...</i>

815
01:10:57,350 --> 01:10:59,784
...when I can get down my own driveway.

816
01:11:00,019 --> 01:11:02,681
<i>Stay home, Boolie. Hoke is here with me.</i>

817
01:11:02,956 --> 01:11:04,446
How'd he manage that?

818
01:11:04,691 --> 01:11:08,855
He's very handy. I'm fine.
I don't need a thing in the world.

819
01:11:09,129 --> 01:11:13,190
Hello? I have the wrong number.
Mama's saying loving things about Hoke.

820
01:11:14,134 --> 01:11:17,297
I didn't say I Love him.
I said he was handy.

821
01:11:17,971 --> 01:11:22,806
Honestly! Are you trying to irritate me
in the middle of an ice storm?

822
01:11:28,381 --> 01:11:29,871
Thank you, Wellborn.

823
01:11:30,550 --> 01:11:31,881
Thank you all.

824
01:11:32,819 --> 01:11:36,812
<i>I am deeply grateful to be chosen
as 1966 Man of the Year...</i>

825
01:11:37,056 --> 01:11:39,217
...by the Atlanta Business Council.

826
01:11:39,559 --> 01:11:42,392
An honor I've seen bestowed
on some mighty fine fellows.

827
01:11:42,662 --> 01:11:45,324
One which I never expected
would come to me.

828
01:11:46,232 --> 01:11:49,224
I'm afraid that my loss up here...

829
01:11:49,569 --> 01:11:51,730
...and my gain down here...

830
01:11:51,905 --> 01:11:55,238
...have given me an air of competence
I don't really possess.

831
01:11:56,176 --> 01:12:00,340
I will tell you that I wish my father
and grandfather could see this.

832
01:12:00,580 --> 01:12:04,914
About 72 years ago, they leased
an old mill up on Decatur Road...

833
01:12:05,251 --> 01:12:07,913
...with, I believe, 25 looms in operation.

834
01:12:08,254 --> 01:12:10,415
They managed to grow with Atlanta.

835
01:12:10,690 --> 01:12:15,354
Till now, Werthan Industries believed
that what we want is what Atlanta wants.

836
01:12:15,762 --> 01:12:19,755
And this award proves that we were right.

837
01:12:20,033 --> 01:12:21,364
I thank you.

838
01:12:51,965 --> 01:12:53,125
Well?

839
01:12:54,467 --> 01:12:57,129
What is it? What took you so long?

840
01:12:57,971 --> 01:13:01,805
I couldn’t help it.
There's a big mess up yonder.

841
01:13:02,075 --> 01:13:06,409
What's the matter? I might as well not go
to the temple at all!

842
01:13:06,646 --> 01:13:11,140
No, ma'am, you won't get to the temple
this morning, Miss Daisy.

843
01:13:11,451 --> 01:13:14,113
Why not? What's the matter with you?

844
01:13:16,155 --> 01:13:18,419
Somebody has bombed the temple.

845
01:13:18,992 --> 01:13:21,984
What? Bombed the temple?

846
01:13:23,162 --> 01:13:25,494
That's how come we're stuck here so Long.

847
01:13:25,765 --> 01:13:27,426
I don't believe it!

848
01:13:27,767 --> 01:13:29,997
That's what the policeman just said.

849
01:13:33,506 --> 01:13:37,499
Oh, my God. Was anybody there?
Were people hurt?

850
01:13:37,777 --> 01:13:40,177
I don't know. He didn't say.

851
01:13:40,513 --> 01:13:42,674
Who would do such a thing?

852
01:13:43,683 --> 01:13:48,518
You know good as me, Miss Daisy,
it'll always be the same ones.

853
01:14:10,376 --> 01:14:13,368
I remember one time
back down there in Macon.

854
01:14:13,713 --> 01:14:18,047
Lord, I couldn’t have been more than
10 or 11 years old, I reckon.

855
01:14:18,551 --> 01:14:20,883
I had this friend named Porter.

856
01:14:21,487 --> 01:14:25,150
One day there his daddy was,
hanging in a tree.

857
01:14:25,391 --> 01:14:29,828
Now just the day before,
we'd all been pitching horseshoes.

858
01:14:30,163 --> 01:14:34,657
He was laughing and carrying on
and talking about how me and Porter...

859
01:14:34,901 --> 01:14:38,234
...was going to have strong right arms,
just Like him.

860
01:14:39,405 --> 01:14:43,341
Lord, there he was,
hanging up yonder in the tree.

861
01:14:43,576 --> 01:14:48,070
Had his hand tied behind him.
Flies was all over him.

862
01:14:48,581 --> 01:14:51,744
I tell you,
I threw up right where I was standing.

863
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:55,512
You go on and cry.

864
01:14:57,357 --> 01:14:58,915
I'm not crying.

865
01:15:01,194 --> 01:15:03,185
Why did you tell me that story?

866
01:15:04,097 --> 01:15:06,429
Lord, I don't know, Miss Daisy.

867
01:15:06,766 --> 01:15:10,099
That mess back there put me in mind of it.

868
01:15:10,370 --> 01:15:13,430
Ridiculous! The temple has nothing to do
with that!

869
01:15:13,706 --> 01:15:15,196
Yes, ma'am, if you say so.

870
01:15:15,441 --> 01:15:19,400
We don't know what happened. Maybe
that policeman wasn't telling the truth.

871
01:15:19,612 --> 01:15:22,945
Why would he go and Lie
about a thing Like that?

872
01:15:23,383 --> 01:15:25,214
You never get things right!

873
01:15:25,385 --> 01:15:29,048
Miss Daisy, somebody bombed
that temple and you know it!

874
01:15:29,255 --> 01:15:31,655
I don't want to hear anymore about it!

875
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:36,952
-You're the boss.
-Don't talk to me!

876
01:15:58,484 --> 01:16:01,146
-Where are you?
-Up here!

877
01:16:10,329 --> 01:16:12,991
Hello, Mama. How are you feeling?

878
01:16:13,332 --> 01:16:16,824
<i>Not a good question
to ask somebody nearly 90!</i>

879
01:16:17,336 --> 01:16:18,997
Well, you Look fine.

880
01:16:19,272 --> 01:16:21,502
It's my ageless appeal.

881
01:16:23,176 --> 01:16:25,269
Miss McClatchey gave me your message.

882
01:16:25,511 --> 01:16:27,502
Florine is invited, too.

883
01:16:27,847 --> 01:16:28,836
Thank you.

884
01:16:29,115 --> 01:16:32,448
I guess Hoke should drive us.
There'll be a crowd.

885
01:16:33,119 --> 01:16:35,349
Mama, we have to talk about this.

886
01:16:35,621 --> 01:16:37,111
Talk about what?

887
01:16:37,356 --> 01:16:39,517
About the feasibility of all this.

888
01:16:39,792 --> 01:16:43,785
I believe Martin Luther King
has done some mighty fine things.

889
01:16:44,130 --> 01:16:47,622
If you don't want to go,
why don't you just say so?

890
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:50,963
I want to go!
You know how I feel about him.

891
01:16:51,137 --> 01:16:52,798
Of course, but Florine....

892
01:16:53,039 --> 01:16:57,032
Florine has nothing to do with it.
I still have to do business here.

893
01:16:57,310 --> 01:17:02,145
I see. Werthan Bag will go out of business
if you attend the King dinner.

894
01:17:02,381 --> 01:17:07,318
Not exactly. But a Lot of men
I do business with wouldn’t Like it.

895
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:09,051
They might...

896
01:17:10,056 --> 01:17:11,717
...snicker a Little.

897
01:17:12,825 --> 01:17:15,988
Call me Martin Luther Werthan
behind my back.

898
01:17:19,332 --> 01:17:22,665
Maybe I wouldn’t hear
about certain meetings at the Club.

899
01:17:23,236 --> 01:17:27,900
Old Jack Raphael at Ideal Mills, he's
a New York Jew instead of a Georgia Jew.

900
01:17:28,341 --> 01:17:31,504
All the really smart ones
come from New York, don't they?

901
01:17:32,078 --> 01:17:36,845
Some might throw their business to Jack
instead of old Martin Luther Werthan.

902
01:17:38,184 --> 01:17:41,585
I don't know. Maybe it wouldn’t happen.

903
01:17:42,188 --> 01:17:44,850
But sometimes
that's the way things work.

904
01:17:46,192 --> 01:17:49,855
Anyway, if we don't use those seats,
somebody else will.

905
01:17:50,263 --> 01:17:54,029
If we don't use those seats?
I'm not supposed to go, either?

906
01:17:54,367 --> 01:17:56,028
You can do whatever you want.

907
01:17:56,269 --> 01:17:58,260
Thanks for your permission.

908
01:17:59,105 --> 01:18:00,697
Can I ask you something?

909
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:05,875
When did you get so fired up about
Martin Luther King? You weren't before.

910
01:18:06,212 --> 01:18:07,372
Why, Boolie!

911
01:18:07,613 --> 01:18:11,105
I've never been prejudiced in my life
and you know it.

912
01:18:12,618 --> 01:18:14,779
Then why don't you ask Hoke
to go with you?

913
01:18:15,621 --> 01:18:17,782
Don't be ridiculous. He wouldn’t go.

914
01:18:19,458 --> 01:18:21,050
Ask him and see.

915
01:18:36,809 --> 01:18:38,140
All right.

916
01:19:20,253 --> 01:19:23,245
Boolie said the silliest thing the other day.

917
01:19:26,325 --> 01:19:27,690
What did he say?

918
01:19:28,194 --> 01:19:30,822
He was talking about Martin Luther King.

919
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:33,489
I guess you know him, don't you?

920
01:19:33,699 --> 01:19:35,997
King? No, ma'am. I don't know him.

921
01:19:36,335 --> 01:19:38,200
I was sure you did.

922
01:19:38,504 --> 01:19:40,199
But you've heard him preach?

923
01:19:40,439 --> 01:19:44,933
Yes, ma'am, same way you have,
on the TV.

924
01:19:45,511 --> 01:19:47,502
I think he's wonderful.

925
01:19:52,852 --> 01:19:55,719
-What you getting at?
-It's so silly.

926
01:19:55,955 --> 01:20:00,517
Boolie says you wanted to go with me
to this dinner. Did you tell him that?

927
01:20:01,294 --> 01:20:02,283
No, I didn't.

928
01:20:02,461 --> 01:20:07,228
I didn't think so. What'd be the point?
You can hear him whenever you want.

929
01:20:08,734 --> 01:20:12,033
I think it's wonderful
the way things are changing.

930
01:20:32,158 --> 01:20:35,321
Now what you think I am, Miss Daisy?

931
01:20:35,494 --> 01:20:36,620
What do you mean?

932
01:20:36,829 --> 01:20:38,660
The invitation to this dinner...

933
01:20:38,764 --> 01:20:40,493
...came in the mail a month ago.

934
01:20:40,833 --> 01:20:44,667
Now, if did be you wanted me to go
with you...

935
01:20:45,004 --> 01:20:48,997
...how come you wait till we in the car
on the way before you asked me?

936
01:20:49,175 --> 01:20:53,168
What? All I said was
Boolie said you wanted to go.

937
01:20:53,913 --> 01:20:57,906
Next time you want me to go somewhere,
you ask me regular.

938
01:20:58,184 --> 01:21:00,175
You don't have to carry on so much.

939
01:21:00,419 --> 01:21:02,683
Let's just Leave it alone.

940
01:21:03,022 --> 01:21:04,182
Honestly!

941
01:21:08,427 --> 01:21:12,420
Talk about things changing.
They ain't changed all that much.

942
01:21:19,805 --> 01:21:21,102
I'll help you to the door.

943
01:21:21,374 --> 01:21:24,366
Thank you, Hoke, I can help myself.

944
01:21:33,619 --> 01:21:36,952
<i>...can see that the South
has marvelous possibilities.</i>

945
01:21:38,124 --> 01:21:40,558
<i>Yet in spite of these assets...</i>

946
01:21:40,893 --> 01:21:43,384
<i>...segregation has placed the South...</i>

947
01:21:43,629 --> 01:21:48,464
<i>...socially, educationally, and economically
behind the rest of the nation.</i>

948
01:21:49,135 --> 01:21:53,834
<i>Yet there are, in the white South,
millions of people of good will...</i>

949
01:21:54,340 --> 01:21:57,138
<i>...whose voices are yet unheard...</i>

950
01:21:57,843 --> 01:22:00,471
<i>...whose course is yet unclear...</i>

951
01:22:01,147 --> 01:22:04,139
<i>...and whose courageous acts
are yet unseen.</i>

952
01:22:04,850 --> 01:22:07,648
<i>These millions are called upon...</i>

953
01:22:08,254 --> 01:22:11,417
<i>...to gird their courage, to speak out...</i>

954
01:22:12,091 --> 01:22:14,924
<i>...to offer leadership that is needed.</i>

955
01:22:14,994 --> 01:22:17,155
<i>History will have to record...</i>

956
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:20,922
<i>...that the greatest tragedy
of this period of social transition...</i>

957
01:22:21,267 --> 01:22:26,102
<i>...was not the vitriolic words
and the violent actions of the bad people...</i>

958
01:22:26,672 --> 01:22:31,166
<i>...but the appalling silence
and indifference of the good people.</i>

959
01:22:31,510 --> 01:22:33,876
<i>And our generation will have to repent...</i>

960
01:22:34,113 --> 01:22:37,605
<i>...not only for the words and acts
of the children of darkness...</i>

961
01:22:37,950 --> 01:22:42,785
<i>...but also for the fears and apathy
of the children of light.</i>

962
01:23:10,916 --> 01:23:12,713
'Morning, Miss Daisy.

963
01:23:43,215 --> 01:23:44,204
Miss Daisy?

964
01:23:49,355 --> 01:23:51,516
Hoke, is that Hoke?

965
01:23:51,957 --> 01:23:54,084
It's me. You all right?

966
01:23:55,094 --> 01:23:58,689
-Hoke, what did you do with my papers?
-What papers?

967
01:23:58,764 --> 01:24:02,256
My papers!
I had them all corrected Last night...

968
01:24:02,701 --> 01:24:06,034
...and I put them where I wouldn’t
forget them on my way to school.

969
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:07,466
What did you do with them?

970
01:24:07,606 --> 01:24:09,471
What are you talking about?

971
01:24:09,542 --> 01:24:13,376
The children will be disappointed
if I don't give them their homework back.

972
01:24:13,612 --> 01:24:16,604
I always give it back the next day.

973
01:24:16,982 --> 01:24:18,609
That's why they Like me.

974
01:24:18,784 --> 01:24:20,274
You talking out your head.

975
01:24:20,486 --> 01:24:22,283
Why aren't you helping me?

976
01:24:22,788 --> 01:24:24,380
What do you want me to do?

977
01:24:24,623 --> 01:24:26,989
Find those papers. I told you!

978
01:24:28,394 --> 01:24:31,557
It's all right if you moved them.
I won't be mad.

979
01:24:31,797 --> 01:24:34,994
But I've got to get to school. I'll be Late.

980
01:24:35,301 --> 01:24:40,000
Who will take care of my class?
They'll be all alone. Oh, God!

981
01:24:40,239 --> 01:24:41,900
I do everything wrong!

982
01:24:42,141 --> 01:24:45,804
Now set down in here.
You're going to fall and hurt yourself.

983
01:24:46,912 --> 01:24:51,406
I'm so sorry. It's all my fault.
I didn't do right.

984
01:24:52,818 --> 01:24:54,308
It's so awful!

985
01:24:54,587 --> 01:24:57,750
Ain't nothing awful
except the way you carrying on.

986
01:24:57,923 --> 01:24:59,584
It's all my fault.

987
01:24:59,825 --> 01:25:02,521
I can't find the papers.
The children are waiting.

988
01:25:02,761 --> 01:25:06,094
There ain't nobody waiting on you.
You ain't a teacher no more.

989
01:25:06,332 --> 01:25:08,323
It doesn't make any difference.

990
01:25:08,667 --> 01:25:11,602
Now Listen,
there ain't nothing wrong with you!

991
01:25:11,837 --> 01:25:13,031
You don't know.

992
01:25:13,606 --> 01:25:15,164
Miss Daisy.

993
01:25:28,187 --> 01:25:31,156
-Hello.
-Mr. Werthan, this Hoke here.

994
01:25:31,824 --> 01:25:32,984
<i>What can l do for you?</i>

995
01:25:33,058 --> 01:25:34,355
It's your mama.

996
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:35,618
What's wrong?

997
01:25:35,861 --> 01:25:37,692
She's taking on something awful.

998
01:25:38,297 --> 01:25:40,561
<i>Why's today different from any other day?</i>

999
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:43,065
No, sir. It ain't the same.

1000
01:25:44,770 --> 01:25:46,260
I'll be right there.

1001
01:25:50,209 --> 01:25:54,202
Miss Daisy, now there ain't nothing wrong
with you!

1002
01:25:54,580 --> 01:25:57,071
Your mind done took a turn this morning.

1003
01:25:57,316 --> 01:25:59,716
You'll snap back if you Let yourself.

1004
01:25:59,985 --> 01:26:02,146
I can't! I can't!

1005
01:26:02,988 --> 01:26:04,888
You're a Lucky old woman.

1006
01:26:05,090 --> 01:26:09,584
No! It's all a mess now,
and I can't do anything about it.

1007
01:26:09,895 --> 01:26:13,888
Now Look at you. You're rich,
you're well for your time....

1008
01:26:14,333 --> 01:26:17,166
You got folks who care about
what happens to you.

1009
01:26:17,403 --> 01:26:20,895
I'm being trouble.
I don't want to be trouble to anybody.

1010
01:26:21,173 --> 01:26:24,506
You want something to cry about,
I'll run you to the state home...

1011
01:26:24,743 --> 01:26:27,109
...Let you see
what's Lying around out there.

1012
01:26:27,413 --> 01:26:31,179
I bet there ain't one of them
carrying on the way you doing.

1013
01:26:31,417 --> 01:26:34,614
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Those poor children.

1014
01:26:35,187 --> 01:26:39,590
You keep this up and Mr. Werthan's
going to call that doctor on you.

1015
01:26:39,658 --> 01:26:44,755
Just as sure as you're born, that doctor
is going to have you out in that asylum.

1016
01:26:45,264 --> 01:26:48,256
Now, is that the way you want it to be?

1017
01:26:52,438 --> 01:26:54,372
-Hoke?
-Yes.

1018
01:26:55,708 --> 01:26:58,040
Do you still have that Hudson?

1019
01:27:00,045 --> 01:27:02,946
You talking about
from when I first come here?

1020
01:27:04,450 --> 01:27:05,781
No, Miss Daisy.

1021
01:27:06,051 --> 01:27:10,715
That thing been in the junkyard now
more than 15 years.

1022
01:27:11,390 --> 01:27:15,224
I'm driving your next-to-Last car now.

1023
01:27:15,728 --> 01:27:18,060
<i>1965 Cadillac.</i>

1024
01:27:18,397 --> 01:27:20,888
It's running fine as wine, too.

1025
01:27:23,068 --> 01:27:27,061
You ought not to be driving anything,
the way you see.

1026
01:27:27,372 --> 01:27:32,207
Now, how you know how I can see
'less'n you can Look out my eyes.

1027
01:27:38,150 --> 01:27:40,175
-Hoke.
-Yes.

1028
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:42,981
You're my best friend.

1029
01:27:43,188 --> 01:27:45,679
-Go on now, Miss Daisy.
-No, really.

1030
01:27:46,425 --> 01:27:47,756
You are.

1031
01:27:52,931 --> 01:27:54,262
You are.

1032
01:28:00,305 --> 01:28:01,670
Yes, ma'am.

1033
01:29:44,243 --> 01:29:47,474
-Mr. Werthan.
-Well, Hoke, good to see you!

1034
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:52,314
-You didn't drive yourself here?
-No, sir. I don't drive now.

1035
01:29:52,551 --> 01:29:54,485
My granddaughter drove me.

1036
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:57,211
My Lord, is she old enough to drive?

1037
01:29:57,556 --> 01:30:00,491
Michelle is around 37 years old now.

1038
01:30:00,993 --> 01:30:05,157
She's teaching biology
at yonder Spelman College.

1039
01:30:05,430 --> 01:30:07,591
-I never knew that.
-Yes, sir.

1040
01:30:12,504 --> 01:30:16,838
Seems mighty funny to sell the house
while Mama's still alive.

1041
01:30:17,342 --> 01:30:19,833
Yes, sir, I imagine it does.

1042
01:30:20,679 --> 01:30:24,171
Course, she hasn't been inside the door
for two years.

1043
01:30:24,583 --> 01:30:25,948
I know.

1044
01:30:26,852 --> 01:30:29,343
I suppose you don't see her too much.

1045
01:30:29,588 --> 01:30:31,579
No, sir, I don't.

1046
01:30:32,257 --> 01:30:35,590
It's hard, not driving, Mr. Werthan.

1047
01:30:36,028 --> 01:30:38,758
There's no bus that goes out yonder.

1048
01:30:39,097 --> 01:30:43,466
Course, I take a taxicab as often as I can.

1049
01:30:44,036 --> 01:30:45,697
I'm sure she appreciates it.

1050
01:30:48,206 --> 01:30:51,539
Some days she's better than others.

1051
01:30:53,378 --> 01:30:55,539
But, then, who ain't?

1052
01:31:24,810 --> 01:31:27,210
How are y'all doing?

1053
01:31:41,093 --> 01:31:42,754
Happy Thanksgiving, Mama!

1054
01:31:44,096 --> 01:31:45,757
Look who I brought!

1055
01:31:46,832 --> 01:31:48,663
'Morning, Miss Daisy.

1056
01:31:50,602 --> 01:31:53,093
You been keeping yourself busy?

1057
01:31:54,773 --> 01:31:58,106
She certainly has.
She goes to jewelry making.

1058
01:31:58,343 --> 01:32:00,038
How many times a week?

1059
01:32:00,846 --> 01:32:03,542
She makes all kinds of things:
pins, bracelets....

1060
01:32:04,449 --> 01:32:05,939
She's a regular Tiffany's.

1061
01:32:06,184 --> 01:32:08,049
Ain't that something?

1062
01:32:13,291 --> 01:32:14,952
All right, Mama?

1063
01:32:19,965 --> 01:32:22,798
Hoke, I thought of you the other day
on the expressway.

1064
01:32:23,969 --> 01:32:26,699
-I saw an Avondale milk truck.
-Is that right?

1065
01:32:26,972 --> 01:32:30,373
<i>A big monster of a thing.
Must've had 16 wheels.</i>

1066
01:32:30,642 --> 01:32:32,132
Go on away from here.

1067
01:32:32,377 --> 01:32:35,574
I wondered how you might Like
driving that thing around.

1068
01:32:36,815 --> 01:32:39,648
Hoke came to see me, not you.

1069
01:32:42,187 --> 01:32:44,348
Looks Like one of her good days.

1070
01:32:45,724 --> 01:32:50,661
Mama, Florine said to wish you a happy
Thanksgiving. She's in Washington.

1071
01:32:51,997 --> 01:32:54,989
She's a Republican National
Committeewoman now.

1072
01:32:55,333 --> 01:32:56,732
Good God!

1073
01:33:03,675 --> 01:33:06,007
Go charm the nurses!

1074
01:33:09,347 --> 01:33:11,508
She wants you all to herself.

1075
01:33:13,018 --> 01:33:14,610
You're a doodle, Mama.

1076
01:33:34,706 --> 01:33:36,697
Is Boolie paying you still?

1077
01:33:38,043 --> 01:33:39,374
Every week.

1078
01:33:39,544 --> 01:33:40,875
How much?

1079
01:33:41,146 --> 01:33:43,944
Now that's between him and me.

1080
01:33:44,549 --> 01:33:46,540
Highway robbery!

1081
01:33:49,387 --> 01:33:51,048
It sure is.

1082
01:33:54,292 --> 01:33:55,953
It sure is.

1083
01:34:00,065 --> 01:34:01,555
How are you?

1084
01:34:04,569 --> 01:34:06,730
I'm doing the best I can.

1085
01:34:09,174 --> 01:34:10,471
Me, too.

1086
01:34:13,178 --> 01:34:16,978
Well, that's about all there is to it then.

1087
01:34:26,424 --> 01:34:27,755
Look here.

1088
01:34:28,593 --> 01:34:31,585
You didn't eat your Thanksgiving pie.

1089
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,331
Go on now.

1090
01:34:39,604 --> 01:34:42,903
Here, Let me help you. I got it.

1091
01:34:57,956 --> 01:34:59,116
Is it good?

1092
01:35:04,796 --> 01:35:06,457
Here comes some more.
