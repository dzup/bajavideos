1
00:00:51,075 --> 00:00:56,445
<i>Everything is fucking
difficult and beautiful.</i>

2
00:02:36,246 --> 00:02:38,146
Are there any sandwiches left?

3
00:02:38,415 --> 00:02:40,873
- What?
- Sandwiches.

4
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,758
Thanks.

5
00:03:19,423 --> 00:03:22,187
The cabins are sort of far
from the lake.

6
00:03:22,626 --> 00:03:24,093
Far?

7
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:26,687
One kilometer.

8
00:03:26,897 --> 00:03:29,559
Right, but that's not far.

9
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,232
No, you're right.

10
00:03:32,803 --> 00:03:34,862
About 20 minutes.

11
00:03:36,774 --> 00:03:38,298
What?

12
00:03:40,477 --> 00:03:43,139
15, not 20... from the lake.

13
00:03:43,347 --> 00:03:46,908
OK 15, 20, it's the same thing.

14
00:03:47,551 --> 00:03:52,289
If you want we can change,
just call and get another one

15
00:03:52,324 --> 00:03:56,282
No, it's fine... to walk 20 minutes.

16
00:03:59,463 --> 00:04:02,455
40 really, to go there and back.

17
00:04:04,701 --> 00:04:07,171
The cabins are great.

18
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:08,399
Really?

19
00:04:08,605 --> 00:04:10,300
They have sauna.

20
00:04:10,507 --> 00:04:11,925
Mud baths.

21
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,343
I love mud.

22
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,970
Wi-Fi

23
00:06:03,854 --> 00:06:05,155
Did you get dizzy?

24
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,144
A bit.

25
00:06:11,128 --> 00:06:13,096
- Do you want me to stop?
- No

26
00:06:20,704 --> 00:06:26,076
Did you get dizzy from reading...
or from the other thing?

27
00:06:26,111 --> 00:06:27,600
From reading.

28
00:06:39,756 --> 00:06:43,760
If you leave the window open the
AC won't ever cool down.

29
00:06:43,795 --> 00:06:45,250
I know.

30
00:06:47,531 --> 00:06:51,635
Or we can open the window
and turn the AC off.

31
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,034
It's fine!

32
00:07:07,784 --> 00:07:13,745
You haven't gotten the...
typical dizziness.. have you?

33
00:07:17,995 --> 00:07:20,327
Or is it too soon for that?

34
00:07:29,573 --> 00:07:32,142
I’m not pregnant any more.

35
00:07:32,177 --> 00:07:33,577
Did you miscarry?

36
00:07:33,612 --> 00:07:34,566
Yes.

37
00:07:35,545 --> 00:07:36,705
No.

38
00:07:38,782 --> 00:07:41,216
I changed my mind.

39
00:07:51,962 --> 00:07:53,987
Without asking me?

40
00:07:57,501 --> 00:08:01,271
It had to be done fast,
there wasn't time for...

41
00:08:01,306 --> 00:08:03,535
You didn't have 5 minutes to call me.

42
00:08:03,707 --> 00:08:07,108
It wasn't 5 minutes, imagine.

43
00:08:07,577 --> 00:08:09,634
It had to be done fast
and it was...

44
00:08:10,335 --> 00:08:14,608
It is something that has
to be solved immediately

45
00:08:15,118 --> 00:08:18,576
It has to do with... with the...

46
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:25,951
It's a practical thing really,
the thing... the vacuum thing.

47
00:08:26,863 --> 00:08:29,559
It’s a procedure, that's what I mean.

48
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:34,518
We were talking about our plans
for the next, what, 15 years?

49
00:08:34,553 --> 00:08:37,928
They weren't plans,
don't start with that.

50
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:39,304
It was an accident.

51
00:08:40,277 --> 00:08:41,294
I didn't want to.

52
00:08:41,329 --> 00:08:42,833
But you said yes.

53
00:08:42,868 --> 00:08:44,337
Fine, I said yes.

54
00:08:45,715 --> 00:08:51,381
But the truth was I didn't want to.
I am not prepared, yet.

55
00:08:51,721 --> 00:08:57,250
Sure, you are only 36...37 years old,
you still need to grow up.

56
00:08:57,527 --> 00:09:00,325
It's not that, it's not the right time.

57
00:09:00,564 --> 00:09:06,059
Well, that’s arguable... what is not
is that you decide without asking me.

58
00:09:06,403 --> 00:09:08,071
Half that baby was mine.

59
00:09:08,106 --> 00:09:09,805
Don't call it baby.

60
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,674
OK... half that morula,
embryo, was mine.

61
00:09:15,712 --> 00:09:18,704
And the plans with that embryo.

62
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,281
Technically, it's less than half.

63
00:09:28,158 --> 00:09:30,285
It was inside of me.

64
00:09:30,494 --> 00:09:34,055
That makes me...

65
00:09:34,297 --> 00:09:38,666
not only co-owner but also the...
landholder.

66
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,302
That’s a joke.

67
00:09:40,337 --> 00:09:44,536
Because it sounds like a joke, let's
tell jokes and kill ourselves laughing.

68
00:09:45,775 --> 00:09:49,233
Joel... damn, at least try...

69
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:06,160
This shit is not good for me like this.

70
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:09,328
What is not good for you?

71
00:10:11,334 --> 00:10:14,963
It's not good for me, damn.

72
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:18,735
Forgive me.

73
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:24,076
You are a coward.

74
00:10:24,147 --> 00:10:26,172
I know I am a coward, forgive me.

75
00:11:23,306 --> 00:11:26,742
Why do you always do things this way?

76
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:32,749
I don't know.
Let's go on holidays, let's not fight.

77
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:37,208
It's self destructive.

78
00:11:39,556 --> 00:11:43,014
You set traps for yourself.

79
00:11:44,761 --> 00:11:46,991
Same thing at work...

80
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:51,294
Don't analyze me please,
you know I don't like that.

81
00:11:51,501 --> 00:11:53,025
But it's weird.

82
00:11:53,236 --> 00:11:54,703
Could be.

83
00:11:55,605 --> 00:11:58,665
Everything is weird.

84
00:12:11,888 --> 00:12:13,719
I have to go pee.

85
00:14:57,153 --> 00:14:59,280
Come on Joel, answer.

86
00:15:00,056 --> 00:15:04,928
I am in a restaurant 600 meters
south from where you left.

87
00:15:04,963 --> 00:15:08,659
I will wait for you 30 more minutes.

88
00:15:09,365 --> 00:15:12,391
If you don't come back
I’ll just take the bus back to Santiago.

89
00:15:14,704 --> 00:15:18,435
Call me at least to know you're fine.

90
00:15:19,108 --> 00:15:21,099
I hope you didn't crash.

91
00:15:21,911 --> 00:15:25,597
I hope you are not bleeding
to death on the pavement,

92
00:15:25,598 --> 00:15:29,283
with you brains all scattered...

93
00:15:29,652 --> 00:15:32,621
That's it. Bye.

94
00:15:53,843 --> 00:15:55,811
Eh, two Italians.

95
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:57,944
What do you want, son?

96
00:15:57,979 --> 00:16:00,010
Two Italian hot dogs.

97
00:16:00,116 --> 00:16:02,243
OK, I’ll take them to your table.

98
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:07,790
Those are the advantages of
super developed countries...

99
00:16:07,825 --> 00:16:09,781
Here it's not like that at all.

100
00:16:12,295 --> 00:16:17,232
...the health insurance doesn't want to
cover the surgery because it's cosmetic

101
00:16:18,701 --> 00:16:21,669
...it's not for vanity

102
00:16:21,704 --> 00:16:25,708
..how will he get a job on TV
all burnt like that...

103
00:16:25,743 --> 00:16:29,269
C'mon aunt! the check for table 5!

104
00:16:31,414 --> 00:16:33,211
Hot dog is good.

105
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,648
Italian.

106
00:16:37,253 --> 00:16:39,881
Got avocado.

107
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,282
Here.

108
00:16:43,026 --> 00:16:47,122
OK stop it.
I’m going to the bathroom.

109
00:17:01,411 --> 00:17:03,345
What happened?

110
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,475
My car broke down.

111
00:17:07,216 --> 00:17:08,513
No gas?

112
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:11,987
Something else.

113
00:17:12,388 --> 00:17:14,691
So you’re going to
spend the night in town?

114
00:17:14,726 --> 00:17:16,921
No I’ll go to Santiago now.

115
00:17:18,294 --> 00:17:20,530
And what will you do with the car?

116
00:17:20,565 --> 00:17:22,589
The tow truck will take it.

117
00:17:25,201 --> 00:17:27,203
Your family is waiting for you.

118
00:17:27,238 --> 00:17:28,568
Sure.

119
00:17:31,774 --> 00:17:35,645
I have two daughters.
And you?

120
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,011
Me too.

121
00:17:37,046 --> 00:17:39,048
You also have two daughters?

122
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,640
Eh, sure.

123
00:17:42,518 --> 00:17:44,543
And how old are they?

124
00:17:45,321 --> 00:17:46,845
Mmm... four.

125
00:17:50,526 --> 00:17:52,118
Are they twins?

126
00:17:52,795 --> 00:17:55,059
Sure, twins.

127
00:17:56,399 --> 00:17:58,765
And are you going to town too?

128
00:17:59,002 --> 00:18:00,970
No. Thanks.

129
00:18:02,605 --> 00:18:06,974
I am going to a park near here.
7 tazas?

130
00:18:07,176 --> 00:18:12,375
- 7 tazas
- This gringo is from Norway.

131
00:18:12,715 --> 00:18:13,815
Ah, nice.

132
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:17,580
Did you know in Norway
the government heats up the water...

133
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:19,311
...and gives it out for free?

134
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:21,256
I had no idea.

135
00:18:21,424 --> 00:18:26,760
That's real money...
warm water for everyone.

136
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,333
Are you all right?

137
00:20:17,373 --> 00:20:18,431
Yes.

138
00:20:39,262 --> 00:20:41,321
So you're from Santiago then?

139
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,628
I don't like Santiago.

140
00:20:49,739 --> 00:20:51,331
I study there.

141
00:20:53,442 --> 00:20:55,774
Medicine I study.

142
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,819
And where do you live in Santiago?

143
00:21:02,854 --> 00:21:04,218
Ñuñoa

144
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,489
Ñuñoa?
My girlfriend lives in Ñuñoa

145
00:21:08,591 --> 00:21:11,225
I don't like Ñuñoa either.

146
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,524
I was crazy there,
that's why I left.

147
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:17,829
She wanted me to be there all the time.

148
00:21:18,234 --> 00:21:20,464
But I said “no fucking way”

149
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:26,770
She says: “Ulrik, if you leave,
I don't know what can happen!”

150
00:21:29,312 --> 00:21:30,745
What's your name?

151
00:21:30,913 --> 00:21:34,474
Ulrik. Ulrik Skakkebaek.
And yours?

152
00:21:36,352 --> 00:21:39,116
Carla, Gutierrez.

153
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:54,466
What do you think she meant?
What do you think could happen?

154
00:21:55,938 --> 00:21:58,441
<i>New message
JOEL</i>

155
00:21:58,476 --> 00:22:00,568
<i>I am fine</i>

156
00:22:04,113 --> 00:22:07,917
Do you think she meant something
that happens to me, to her?

157
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,908
I have no idea Ulrik.

158
00:22:16,525 --> 00:22:18,288
It was a call from Santiago?

159
00:22:19,929 --> 00:22:22,261
- Are they waiting for you there?
- No

160
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,662
No. It seems they are
not waiting for me.

161
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,308
Is that your bus?

162
00:22:32,343 --> 00:22:33,468
Shit!

163
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,678
You can run and catch it!

164
00:22:35,713 --> 00:22:37,063
No, I won't make it

165
00:22:37,098 --> 00:22:38,414
Do you want me to run?

166
00:22:38,449 --> 00:22:40,382
No... it's gone.

167
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:46,087
OK, run!

168
00:22:53,262 --> 00:22:54,528
Sorry.

169
00:22:54,563 --> 00:22:57,532
Don't worry,
it wasn't your fault.

170
00:22:57,833 --> 00:23:01,735
I didn't react on time.
I am sorry.

171
00:23:02,939 --> 00:23:06,306
In a way, you wanted
the bus to leave.

172
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:09,457
Don't analyze me,
I can't stand it.

173
00:23:09,492 --> 00:23:12,239
It's just that I’m clumsy,
that's all.

174
00:23:12,882 --> 00:23:15,908
- What is clumsy?
- Clumsy.

175
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,925
Clumsy...
That I do things wrong, backwards.

176
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,257
That I complicate everything.

177
00:23:28,664 --> 00:23:32,065
Clumsy. I like that word... clumsy

178
00:23:33,869 --> 00:23:36,305
And now you have to stay here waiting
until tomorrow.

179
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,465
Yep.

180
00:23:42,078 --> 00:23:45,014
Are you sure you don't want to
come to the park with me?

181
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:46,106
Sure

182
00:23:50,086 --> 00:23:51,152
Are you going to be all right?

183
00:23:51,187 --> 00:23:56,215
Yes, don't worry,
I’ll go to the hotel.

184
00:24:00,329 --> 00:24:01,387
Well...

185
00:24:02,698 --> 00:24:04,165
Bye Ulrik.

186
00:24:04,367 --> 00:24:05,664
Bye Carla.

187
00:24:06,035 --> 00:24:07,866
Have a goodtime.

188
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:35,096
Hey Ulrik.
I don't know...

189
00:24:35,131 --> 00:24:38,501
You already changed your mind...
clumsy.

190
00:24:38,536 --> 00:24:41,265
No, no... I didn't say that.

191
00:24:41,937 --> 00:24:44,305
Eh... it was, let's see.

192
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:48,560
I just wanted to make clear
that... that...

193
00:24:48,561 --> 00:24:50,780
OK, we are going together...

194
00:24:50,815 --> 00:24:53,749
But I’m married...I mean..

195
00:24:55,484 --> 00:24:58,085
yes... anyway, sure,
I’m married.

196
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,056
You mean that I don't
try to win you over?

197
00:25:01,057 --> 00:25:02,525
Like... flirting?

198
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,323
No, no, no, it's not that either.

199
00:25:06,362 --> 00:25:09,354
No, I mean yes, anyway.

200
00:25:09,999 --> 00:25:15,027
But on the other hand no, because
why would I think that you might want...

201
00:25:15,771 --> 00:25:18,106
But well, yes! that's it.

202
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:20,441
Don't worry, I’m gay.

203
00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:25,542
Homosexual?

204
00:25:25,915 --> 00:25:27,974
And the girlfriend from Ñuñoa?

205
00:25:28,784 --> 00:25:31,185
Actually I think I am gay.

206
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:33,422
that's why I left girlfriend
in Santiago.

207
00:25:33,457 --> 00:25:35,390
You think you're gay.

208
00:25:35,558 --> 00:25:40,496
Well... I think so, but I still haven't
experienced it with anybody.

209
00:25:41,031 --> 00:25:42,115
- Get it?
- Yeah.

210
00:25:43,016 --> 00:25:44,500
Experience, understand?

211
00:25:44,535 --> 00:25:46,331
I got it.

212
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,950
Are we walking all the way there?

213
00:26:02,985 --> 00:26:07,823
No, my trip guide says that further up
there’s a bus stop.

214
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:09,256
How far up?

215
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:11,193
Just a kilometer.

216
00:26:11,228 --> 00:26:13,161
20 minutes.

217
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:28,410
And what do you think?

218
00:26:28,445 --> 00:26:29,743
About what?

219
00:26:29,778 --> 00:26:31,575
You think I’m gay?

220
00:26:32,815 --> 00:26:34,348
What do I know?

221
00:26:34,383 --> 00:26:37,720
I don't know, your intuition.
Do you see me gay?

222
00:26:37,755 --> 00:26:40,314
I’m not very intuitive Ulrik.

223
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,992
I don't know...
could be.

224
00:26:43,027 --> 00:26:44,760
How can you tell?

225
00:26:44,795 --> 00:26:45,926
No idea.

226
00:26:45,961 --> 00:26:47,595
But you said it could be

227
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:50,599
Well, it could be and it could not be.

228
00:26:53,869 --> 00:26:55,666
Can I help you?

229
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:51,186
We have more than 250 bugs here.

230
00:28:51,221 --> 00:28:52,744
Anything dangerous?

231
00:28:53,222 --> 00:28:55,816
Well that depends, right?

232
00:28:56,859 --> 00:28:59,089
On what we understand by danger.

233
00:29:00,929 --> 00:29:03,227
Danger is so relative.

234
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,258
Even a fly could be dangerous
at a given moment.

235
00:29:08,971 --> 00:29:13,635
If you’re walking by the edge of a cliff
for example...

236
00:29:14,677 --> 00:29:17,645
... and a fly gets into your ear...

237
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,613
...you lose balance and you fall...

238
00:29:22,017 --> 00:29:23,746
Down the cliff.

239
00:29:24,787 --> 00:29:26,655
Do you want to see the spiders too?

240
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:28,170
Don't worry.

241
00:29:28,205 --> 00:29:29,650
We want to camp.

242
00:29:29,858 --> 00:29:33,350
Ah... You're in the
right place my friend?

243
00:29:35,297 --> 00:29:37,595
No, Spanish is fine.

244
00:29:49,378 --> 00:29:50,845
Just one.

245
00:30:18,507 --> 00:30:20,498
“The Pollito Spider”

246
00:30:20,876 --> 00:30:23,444
But this is not dangerous.

247
00:30:23,479 --> 00:30:25,646
I bet the “gringo” is afraid of it.

248
00:30:25,681 --> 00:30:30,880
I’m not afraid!.
Can we go now? It'll get dark.

249
00:30:35,991 --> 00:30:37,458
Carla

250
00:30:38,293 --> 00:30:39,760
Gutierrez

251
00:30:41,597 --> 00:30:42,654
Age?

252
00:30:44,266 --> 00:30:45,532
Address?

253
00:30:45,567 --> 00:30:50,197
Estrella Solitaria 340, Ñuñoa

254
00:30:51,006 --> 00:30:51,939
And him?

255
00:30:51,974 --> 00:30:54,772
Ulrik. Ulrik Skakkebaek.

256
00:30:58,847 --> 00:31:03,994
U - L- R -

257
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:06,544
I - K

258
00:31:08,424 --> 00:31:12,051
S - K - A -

259
00:31:12,552 --> 00:31:15,678
K - K -

260
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,205
E - B -

261
00:31:20,206 --> 00:31:22,732
A - E - K

262
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:25,506
- Age?
- 21

263
00:31:39,087 --> 00:31:41,557
So? Do you like it?

264
00:31:41,592 --> 00:31:43,650
Ehem... yes.

265
00:31:46,595 --> 00:31:49,398
I’m going to buy something to eat.
Want anything?

266
00:31:49,433 --> 00:31:52,601
No, thanks. I’m going to bed.
I’m exhausted.

267
00:31:52,636 --> 00:31:54,569
- Fine. Bye
- Bye.

268
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,318
Jose Ignacio what did I tell you!

269
00:32:14,389 --> 00:32:15,788
Hi.

270
00:32:17,593 --> 00:32:21,051
Flute is over at 7.
We already talked about that.

271
00:35:09,364 --> 00:35:10,353
Did you hear that one?

272
00:35:11,299 --> 00:35:12,493
Which one?

273
00:35:13,669 --> 00:35:14,727
That one.

274
00:35:21,076 --> 00:35:22,668
That one.

275
00:35:29,818 --> 00:35:31,285
That's the Tuta.

276
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:41,487
And that one?

277
00:35:42,864 --> 00:35:47,801
That one that sounds like a cry?
It's the ¡*little widow

278
00:36:00,816 --> 00:36:02,078
Where?

279
00:36:02,317 --> 00:36:04,285
There, on the branch

280
00:36:04,953 --> 00:36:06,319
Which one?

281
00:36:06,354 --> 00:36:09,585
There! Behind the trunk.

282
00:36:09,925 --> 00:36:12,257
I don't see it.

283
00:36:13,261 --> 00:36:15,126
What's that?

284
00:36:15,964 --> 00:36:19,422
That’s a highway they’re building.

285
00:36:21,837 --> 00:36:24,106
We will loose a good chunk of the park.

286
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:25,906
That's too bad.

287
00:36:25,941 --> 00:36:28,739
Well, it's complicated.

288
00:36:29,611 --> 00:36:32,171
Are you a “Chilean Chilean”?

289
00:36:32,247 --> 00:36:33,214
Yes!

290
00:36:33,348 --> 00:36:35,578
You don't look Chilean.

291
00:36:35,684 --> 00:36:38,567
Because of...
the way you walk

292
00:36:38,602 --> 00:36:41,451
...like stepping on eggs, nervous.

293
00:36:42,324 --> 00:36:45,125
And how do Chilean women walk?

294
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,762
I don't know, firmly, looking forward.

295
00:36:51,797 --> 00:36:55,104
Do you know that Silvio Rodriguez's
song the one about the brothers?

296
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:57,162
Yes... no, how was it?

297
00:37:00,642 --> 00:37:03,202
Well, there were three brothers.

298
00:37:04,446 --> 00:37:08,246
The first one always walked
looking down.

299
00:37:10,618 --> 00:37:16,550
So his neck got stuck and he was
never able to look forward again.

300
00:37:16,792 --> 00:37:20,228
The second one... looked forward...

301
00:37:22,297 --> 00:37:25,562
... but he was always tripping on
stones.

302
00:37:26,434 --> 00:37:30,530
And the other one looked up and down
like undecided.

303
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:33,173
Right. Which one's me?

304
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:37,179
The last one.
The one always changing the gaze.

305
00:37:37,214 --> 00:37:38,476
One eye for each side.

306
00:37:39,481 --> 00:37:40,647
So?

307
00:37:40,682 --> 00:37:41,910
So what?

308
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:44,841
How does it end?
What happens to that one?

309
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:49,220
Nothing. He remains confused forever.

310
00:37:50,959 --> 00:37:56,097
Finally they all do badly.
It's like a fable

311
00:37:56,132 --> 00:37:58,588
Don’t fables always have animals?

312
00:37:59,601 --> 00:38:03,059
Well, like a parable then.

313
00:38:03,872 --> 00:38:08,176
And it wants to tells us that...
none of the options are good.

314
00:38:08,211 --> 00:38:10,343
Are you sure?

315
00:38:10,378 --> 00:38:12,848
Isn’t there a strophe missing?

316
00:38:12,883 --> 00:38:15,339
No, it's just like that.

317
00:38:16,952 --> 00:38:19,011
Do we know each other?

318
00:38:19,754 --> 00:38:23,315
I don't know you.
You might know me.

319
00:38:24,025 --> 00:38:26,361
Were you on TV?
You were an actor!

320
00:38:26,396 --> 00:38:28,128
Once I got offered a...

321
00:38:28,163 --> 00:38:31,223
You were a singer!
Yes, you were a singer!

322
00:38:31,967 --> 00:38:33,969
How was your name?
Don't tell me...

323
00:38:34,004 --> 00:38:35,001
Orlando.

324
00:38:35,036 --> 00:38:37,038
Of course!
Don't tell me your last name...

325
00:38:37,073 --> 00:38:38,205
Palma.

326
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,199
Orlando Palma, of course.
You were very famous.

327
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:45,074
You had that song everybody knew...

328
00:38:45,146 --> 00:38:46,947
“Vanity” you mean.

329
00:38:46,982 --> 00:38:49,542
That was the best known.

330
00:38:49,985 --> 00:38:53,182
It was almost the only one people knew.

331
00:38:53,488 --> 00:38:55,080
How was it?

332
00:38:59,461 --> 00:39:03,365
Alpha Sierra to Oscar Papa,
do you copy?

333
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,598
I can't remember...

334
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:07,165
Oscar Papa here,
go ahead Alfa Sierra.

335
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,698
If you sing a bit
I’ll remember right away.

336
00:39:19,748 --> 00:39:21,545
What do you want?

337
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:26,544
let's see... milk, coffee, and bread

338
00:39:27,722 --> 00:39:30,125
I have some avocados.

339
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,923
Ripe... Creamy

340
00:39:33,962 --> 00:39:38,199
A bit expensive, but they're worth it.
Want some?

341
00:39:38,234 --> 00:39:39,223
Sure.

342
00:39:39,868 --> 00:39:42,837
Susana! Bring some avocados!

343
00:39:43,271 --> 00:39:46,240
Don't yell at me,
I have a headache.

344
00:39:47,309 --> 00:39:48,775
Bring avocados.

345
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:51,643
You go, I don't know how to pick them.

346
00:39:52,647 --> 00:39:55,775
Sell some bread to the lady then.

347
00:40:03,224 --> 00:40:04,589
Four.

348
00:40:13,835 --> 00:40:15,704
Did you arrive today?

349
00:40:15,739 --> 00:40:17,171
Yes, yesterday.

350
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:19,606
From Santiago?

351
00:40:20,241 --> 00:40:22,242
Santiago is beautiful.

352
00:40:22,277 --> 00:40:25,245
I got my wisdom teeth pulled out there.

353
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,647
I have an aunt there,
in EI Bosque, you know?

354
00:40:28,783 --> 00:40:32,583
Yes, I mean not specifically but yes.

355
00:40:34,589 --> 00:40:36,556
Do you live here?

356
00:40:36,591 --> 00:40:39,992
In Molina, but in the summer
we work here.

357
00:40:40,228 --> 00:40:42,564
And what do you do in Santiago?

358
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:44,498
I’m a biochemist.

359
00:40:45,834 --> 00:40:47,801
You work in a lab?

360
00:40:47,836 --> 00:40:50,972
You mix things in jars,
reactions and stuff?

361
00:40:51,007 --> 00:40:53,304
Precisely. And you both?

362
00:40:53,441 --> 00:40:58,936
Susana studies hairdressing
and I study accounting

363
00:40:59,914 --> 00:41:02,917
You are with that blond guy, right?

364
00:41:02,952 --> 00:41:05,920
Is he your younger brother, your son?

365
00:41:05,955 --> 00:41:07,287
A friend.

366
00:41:07,322 --> 00:41:09,390
Friend or “friend friend”?

367
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,176
Susana, don't be intruding

368
00:41:11,211 --> 00:41:12,927
Are you both called Susana?

369
00:41:12,962 --> 00:41:14,362
Are you sisters?

370
00:41:14,397 --> 00:41:15,522
Cousins.

371
00:41:16,498 --> 00:41:19,134
What's the blond guy's name?

372
00:41:19,169 --> 00:41:21,102
Ulrik, he's Norwegian.

373
00:41:21,836 --> 00:41:23,721
From Oslo?

374
00:41:23,756 --> 00:41:25,606
I don't know.

375
00:41:28,376 --> 00:41:29,502
2.800

376
00:41:47,729 --> 00:41:52,067
Sun block! Did anybody bring sun block?

377
00:41:52,102 --> 00:41:53,534
No.

378
00:41:53,701 --> 00:41:55,969
It's not that sunny, Mari please.

379
00:41:56,004 --> 00:41:58,173
Don't start daddy, I already explained.

380
00:41:58,208 --> 00:42:01,108
Fine, I’ll go.

381
00:42:04,679 --> 00:42:07,313
It's not that sunny,
it's ridiculous.

382
00:42:07,348 --> 00:42:08,749
It's because of the hole.

383
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:13,150
My field guide says
the hole is huge here.

384
00:42:14,923 --> 00:42:16,222
The hole!

385
00:42:16,257 --> 00:42:17,849
The ozone hole.

386
00:42:18,326 --> 00:42:20,995
Where are you from?

387
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:22,796
From Norway.

388
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:28,770
I have a friend from Norway.
He's called Olsen Forden.

389
00:42:35,643 --> 00:42:37,201
Sun block!

390
00:42:40,014 --> 00:42:42,715
Is your husband like that gentleman?

391
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:46,709
No... yes, I don't know.
He's different.

392
00:42:47,922 --> 00:42:49,189
In what?

393
00:42:49,224 --> 00:42:51,522
He's more interesting

394
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,555
More handsome?

395
00:42:57,765 --> 00:43:00,393
He's smart, he's funny.

396
00:43:00,835 --> 00:43:03,463
And why aren’t you with him then?

397
00:43:03,805 --> 00:43:06,899
I don't think that’s an issue you can
help me with

398
00:43:07,041 --> 00:43:08,941
All right...

399
00:43:11,312 --> 00:43:16,017
I can't help because I’m not an adult?
Because I don't have kids?

400
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:18,620
No, because it’s a complicated
issue for anyone.

401
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:20,555
You are saying
I’m an adult then?

402
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:21,715
Yes...

403
00:43:23,091 --> 00:43:29,089
My girlfriend would tell me everyday
that I’m like an immature boy.

404
00:43:31,499 --> 00:43:33,399
That word makes me laugh.

405
00:43:33,535 --> 00:43:35,435
Like an unripe fruit.

406
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:38,969
I told her she was a rotten fruit.

407
00:43:39,874 --> 00:43:41,842
I don't have that word in Norway.

408
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,070
Mature?

409
00:43:43,545 --> 00:43:46,571
How is to be mature?

410
00:43:47,115 --> 00:43:49,675
Mature, like...

411
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:51,050
...like the fruit.

412
00:43:51,051 --> 00:43:56,685
Like when fruit is ready to be
eaten, it is like being ready for life.

413
00:43:58,359 --> 00:44:01,442
Completely developed...

414
00:44:01,443 --> 00:44:04,525
Emotionally, mentally.

415
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:10,838
Basically, it's knowing what you want,
what you like and don't like...

416
00:44:10,873 --> 00:44:12,372
...being calm.

417
00:44:12,407 --> 00:44:14,875
Being old essentially.

418
00:44:15,777 --> 00:44:18,905
I think it's harder than being old.

419
00:44:19,013 --> 00:44:23,416
But when you are mature
it's all over, then what?

420
00:44:24,652 --> 00:44:28,247
Then... I don't know...

421
00:44:28,323 --> 00:44:32,817
...enjoy adult life, supposedly.

422
00:44:34,729 --> 00:44:39,901
Like fruit... you're there,
hanging from the tree...

423
00:44:39,936 --> 00:44:44,235
...you're just enjoying the sun.

424
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:48,186
Then you begin to decay.

425
00:44:48,187 --> 00:44:54,080
The birds start picking on you...

426
00:44:55,250 --> 00:45:00,278
...you fall to the ground,
then tissues start to decompose and...

427
00:45:00,688 --> 00:45:03,090
...I don't know.

428
00:45:03,125 --> 00:45:05,492
You bite your nails!

429
00:45:39,627 --> 00:45:41,322
Hi.

430
00:45:59,247 --> 00:46:02,705
I have a confession to make.

431
00:46:05,153 --> 00:46:06,620
Sure?

432
00:46:08,456 --> 00:46:10,321
If you don't want,
I won't tell you.

433
00:46:10,491 --> 00:46:13,255
Don't tell me if you don't want to.

434
00:46:14,729 --> 00:46:19,063
I had a boyfriend.
Just once, in Norway.

435
00:46:19,934 --> 00:46:21,162
What happened?

436
00:46:21,502 --> 00:46:22,662
He left me.

437
00:46:22,837 --> 00:46:24,998
He left you? Why?

438
00:46:25,573 --> 00:46:27,632
I became jealous and I hit him

439
00:46:27,842 --> 00:46:30,868
You hit him?
I don't believe you.

440
00:46:31,212 --> 00:46:34,375
For real. A punch like this.

441
00:46:34,515 --> 00:46:36,710
I can't imagine you hitting anybody.

442
00:46:37,018 --> 00:46:42,957
It was the first time. Did you know
the fist hurts a lot? Hitting hurts.

443
00:46:43,257 --> 00:46:46,715
That's fine, it's fair that it hurts.

444
00:46:47,228 --> 00:46:48,796
Have you hit anybody?

445
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,263
No

446
00:46:50,298 --> 00:46:52,433
And have you been hit?

447
00:46:52,468 --> 00:46:53,900
No.

448
00:47:00,041 --> 00:47:02,441
You probably haven't fallen off a bike.

449
00:47:02,543 --> 00:47:06,775
I’m not going to compete for who
has suffered more, Ulrik.

450
00:47:07,382 --> 00:47:09,873
That's because you're mature.

451
00:47:10,151 --> 00:47:14,451
Don't mess with me! I am trying to rest.

452
00:47:14,889 --> 00:47:16,857
Did you get mad?

453
00:48:01,302 --> 00:48:03,964
Alpha Sierra to Oscar Papa,
do you copy?

454
00:48:04,672 --> 00:48:06,374
Oscar Papa why don't you answer?

455
00:48:06,409 --> 00:48:08,257
Turn off the radio!

456
00:48:08,292 --> 00:48:10,106
Don't be do loud!

457
00:48:13,014 --> 00:48:14,747
I’m bored!

458
00:48:14,782 --> 00:48:16,977
You left me all alone here!

459
00:48:27,795 --> 00:48:29,746
I can come back later.

460
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:31,698
- No, go ahead.
- Thanks.

461
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:56,989
Look, Orlando finished the
translation. It goes...

462
00:48:57,024 --> 00:49:00,894
When routine bites and we run out
of ambition,

463
00:49:00,895 --> 00:49:04,765
and resentment triumphs...

464
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:09,136
...emotions get stuck and we are
changing, taking different routes.

465
00:49:09,171 --> 00:49:12,128
Then, love, love...

466
00:49:12,206 --> 00:49:14,342
Love will tear us apart.

467
00:49:14,377 --> 00:49:16,309
Love, love...

468
00:49:16,344 --> 00:49:19,802
Well like that, 4 times,
it's the chorus.

469
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:23,050
It’s sad, isn't it?

470
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:24,016
What?

471
00:49:24,018 --> 00:49:26,646
That love always tears you apart.

472
00:49:26,921 --> 00:49:28,286
I like it.

473
00:49:28,422 --> 00:49:30,390
Because it has never happened to you.

474
00:49:30,491 --> 00:49:32,584
No? What about Jose?

475
00:49:33,094 --> 00:49:35,595
You always said that José was a fool.

476
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:39,828
He was a fool, but love teared us
apart anyway.

477
00:49:40,234 --> 00:49:42,664
One thing has nothing
to do with the other.

478
00:49:42,665 --> 00:49:44,694
I was in love.

479
00:49:46,707 --> 00:49:49,642
I couldn't fall in love with a fool.

480
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:52,178
Because you're a coward.

481
00:49:53,214 --> 00:49:56,945
It's much more dangerous to fall in love
with fools because you don't get them.

482
00:49:57,718 --> 00:50:00,084
They are pure mystery.

483
00:50:01,522 --> 00:50:05,458
Like riding a horse,
but with your eyes closed.

484
00:50:05,593 --> 00:50:08,221
That's stupid.
Why would anybody want that?

485
00:50:08,529 --> 00:50:12,216
Because it's exciting.
It's risky.

486
00:50:12,817 --> 00:50:15,903
That's the point! That's
how love should be.

487
00:50:15,938 --> 00:50:18,064
You are such a fool, Susana.

488
00:50:18,172 --> 00:50:19,972
But that's what your song says, right?

489
00:50:20,007 --> 00:50:23,602
Right, but it’s a sad song and
you're saying it as a good thing.

490
00:50:28,015 --> 00:50:30,984
Who's in the shower?

491
00:51:24,305 --> 00:51:26,500
What a surprise.

492
00:51:27,575 --> 00:51:31,033
Where are you!
You disappeared.

493
00:51:33,881 --> 00:51:36,714
Well, I changed plans.

494
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:42,254
Great that you recovered
your sense of humor

495
00:51:42,289 --> 00:51:46,316
I thought you were still crying over
the steering wheel.

496
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:52,958
Sorry, I didn't mean to say that.

497
00:51:54,335 --> 00:51:57,827
Sorry, I told you already, it's enough.

498
00:51:59,807 --> 00:52:03,265
I’m so annoying, I know.

499
00:52:09,917 --> 00:52:13,876
In “Siete Tazas”, do you know it?
It’s beautiful.

500
00:52:18,459 --> 00:52:22,020
Yes, I mean, more or less by myself.

501
00:52:22,963 --> 00:52:26,922
Do you know who is
the park ranger here? Guess.

502
00:52:30,905 --> 00:52:34,864
Well, if you're not interested
I won't tell you.

503
00:52:39,346 --> 00:52:43,305
No, don't hang up, let's talk at least.

504
00:53:05,072 --> 00:53:06,539
Honey!

505
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,778
Ximena, how are you?

506
00:53:15,449 --> 00:53:16,916
I’m fine.

507
00:53:24,592 --> 00:53:27,026
Sure, don't worry.

508
00:53:27,628 --> 00:53:30,153
OK, you have my computer.

509
00:53:31,031 --> 00:53:33,727
... go to shared files.

510
00:53:40,474 --> 00:53:43,932
... folder... Time.

511
00:53:46,247 --> 00:53:51,617
Open there, the file is called MDS final
...that one.

512
00:53:51,752 --> 00:53:54,448
Right - click there..

513
00:53:54,688 --> 00:53:59,648
Third or fourth option, I don't know
which one, but it is called Graph

514
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:02,261
Did it work?

515
00:54:02,296 --> 00:54:08,235
Ok, I have to go. Joel is calling me
to go for a walk.

516
00:54:14,608 --> 00:54:16,576
Bye bye

517
00:54:39,667 --> 00:54:41,133
For the cold.

518
00:54:41,168 --> 00:54:43,068
Thank you very much.

519
00:55:00,287 --> 00:55:01,948
“Iskald”

520
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:04,157
Cold.

521
00:55:19,473 --> 00:55:20,940
“skogen”

522
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:25,135
Forest.

523
00:55:26,013 --> 00:55:27,514
“Tell”

524
00:55:27,549 --> 00:55:28,478
Me?

525
00:55:33,888 --> 00:55:36,049
Oh, the tent.

526
00:55:41,128 --> 00:55:42,595
What?

527
00:55:43,864 --> 00:55:46,833
Doesn't matter, nothing.

528
00:58:51,318 --> 00:58:52,683
Hello!

529
00:58:59,659 --> 00:59:05,562
Carla, do you think that in the future
there will be no more trees?

530
00:59:09,069 --> 00:59:11,867
Eh...I don't think so.

531
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:17,436
Me neither. There're too many.

532
00:59:29,022 --> 00:59:34,983
When I first came here I saw everything
like a green mass.

533
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:41,665
Almost exasperating.
I even dreamt in green.

534
00:59:41,969 --> 00:59:46,940
Now I know all of them!
Should I say them?

535
00:59:46,975 --> 00:59:48,407
What?

536
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:53,245
The names of the trees,
so you start learning them.

537
00:59:59,319 --> 01:00:00,786
Roble

538
01:00:01,788 --> 01:00:04,279
Castaño de Indias

539
01:00:05,459 --> 01:00:07,427
Ciprés cordillerano

540
01:00:11,598 --> 01:00:13,065
Radal

541
01:00:15,035 --> 01:00:17,902
Tabaco del Diablo

542
01:00:34,788 --> 01:00:40,727
These coigües are old, they can be 200
or 300 years of age, or more.

543
01:00:41,061 --> 01:00:44,865
Did you know that these
are already dead inside?

544
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:48,028
But they keep living, on the outside.

545
01:00:48,302 --> 01:00:53,373
Trees are the only ones that can
do that, to die and keep going.

546
01:00:53,408 --> 01:00:55,341
Like me.

547
01:00:57,110 --> 01:01:00,591
Marcela left home let's say on
a Friday,

548
01:01:00,592 --> 01:01:04,073
and I didn't notice until Monday.

549
01:01:05,686 --> 01:01:08,752
When I went to get her
at her parent's house,

550
01:01:08,753 --> 01:01:11,818
she didn't even want to see me.

551
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:15,323
My mother in law came out...

552
01:01:15,996 --> 01:01:21,663
...and she talked about cocaine,
the brain, Marcelita's black eye...

553
01:01:23,570 --> 01:01:27,563
... and I just looked at her,
without listening.

554
01:01:27,641 --> 01:01:31,259
And suddenly I realized...

555
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,877
...that the lady
had her sweater on inside out.

556
01:01:36,049 --> 01:01:39,985
I don't know why I got stuck
on that stupid detail.

557
01:01:41,588 --> 01:01:45,125
Until I couldn't resist it.
I interrupted her and said...

558
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:49,459
...excuse me madam,
you sweater's inside out.

559
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:52,389
She slammed the door...

560
01:01:54,167 --> 01:01:57,659
... and never opened it again.

561
01:02:02,042 --> 01:02:04,636
I was left alone.

562
01:02:04,711 --> 01:02:08,511
And here I am! Strong and healthy.

563
01:02:09,249 --> 01:02:12,047
Come here, touch!

564
01:02:14,688 --> 01:02:16,679
It's great!

565
01:02:35,776 --> 01:02:38,506
You’re very thin.

566
01:02:38,679 --> 01:02:41,170
Are you all right?
Do you feel good?

567
01:02:41,415 --> 01:02:44,213
Yes... more or less

568
01:02:49,022 --> 01:02:51,145
Skinny and pale.

569
01:02:52,146 --> 01:02:55,393
You should eat better, get some sun.

570
01:02:56,363 --> 01:02:59,764
Well... I’ll try, thanks

571
01:03:04,938 --> 01:03:07,808
Too much chatting already.

572
01:03:07,843 --> 01:03:10,402
I better get to work.

573
01:03:10,777 --> 01:03:12,912
Oscar Papa to Alfa Sierra...

574
01:03:12,947 --> 01:03:14,915
Alfa Sierra to Oscar Papa

575
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:16,848
I’ll be by the Oak forest

576
01:03:16,883 --> 01:03:20,842
R4, come around when you're done.

577
01:05:12,966 --> 01:05:14,331
Hi.

578
01:05:14,835 --> 01:05:18,032
We were talking about you.

579
01:05:19,573 --> 01:05:21,708
OK, are we going home?

580
01:05:21,743 --> 01:05:23,324
Let's go.

581
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:24,906
All of us?

582
01:05:32,886 --> 01:05:34,649
Drink.

583
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:49,225
Hi uncle! These are Carla and Ulrik.

584
01:05:52,806 --> 01:05:54,535
Good afternoon, come in.

585
01:05:54,908 --> 01:05:56,967
Hi aunt Mecha.

586
01:05:57,410 --> 01:06:02,006
These are Ulrik and Carla.
Ulrik is from Norway.

587
01:06:02,249 --> 01:06:03,782
From Oslo?

588
01:06:03,817 --> 01:06:07,685
No, from a small town near the
polar circle: Masfjorden.

589
01:06:07,821 --> 01:06:08,787
No, thanks.

590
01:06:08,822 --> 01:06:10,188
Eat, eat, you could use some.

591
01:06:10,223 --> 01:06:11,925
Grandpa I am going to use your
stereo for a while.

592
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:13,620
Sure, darling

593
01:06:14,261 --> 01:06:16,410
Thanks.

594
01:06:16,445 --> 01:06:18,560
Sit down.

595
01:06:20,667 --> 01:06:24,797
Let that thing go,
it will make you sick. Eat!

596
01:06:57,871 --> 01:06:59,862
Come on aunt Mecha.

597
01:06:59,973 --> 01:07:03,209
Let's see... a bit closer together.

598
01:07:03,244 --> 01:07:05,006
A bit more.

599
01:07:05,378 --> 01:07:06,845
Squeeze together

600
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:08,977
A bit more...

601
01:07:14,654 --> 01:07:16,383
I’m sorry!

602
01:07:16,456 --> 01:07:19,125
It doesn't matter.
Leave that chicken there boy.

603
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:22,094
Come on, let's take the picture.

604
01:07:45,085 --> 01:07:48,054
Hey Susana, I already told you!

605
01:07:49,022 --> 01:07:50,388
Just relax aunt!

606
01:07:50,423 --> 01:07:52,775
Better go to bed madam.

607
01:07:52,810 --> 01:07:55,093
Grandpa needs to rest too.

608
01:07:55,128 --> 01:07:56,529
But grandpa doesn't mind,
right grandpa?

609
01:07:56,564 --> 01:07:57,996
Right!

610
01:08:41,374 --> 01:08:42,991
What's wrong with you faggot!

611
01:08:43,026 --> 01:08:44,608
You liked it all the same.

612
01:08:46,279 --> 01:08:48,941
I won't hit you because
you're a woman and wear glasses!

613
01:08:56,222 --> 01:08:57,280
This way?

614
01:08:57,824 --> 01:09:02,862
No, it's that way.
I am going for a walk

615
01:09:02,897 --> 01:09:04,193
So late?

616
01:09:06,433 --> 01:09:07,815
Are you scared?

617
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:09,198
Yes, a bit.

618
01:09:10,403 --> 01:09:12,371
Then don't come.

619
01:09:14,808 --> 01:09:16,742
Are you pissed off?

620
01:09:19,112 --> 01:09:21,205
Sorry Ulrik.

621
01:09:22,582 --> 01:09:24,049
Wait!

622
01:09:26,553 --> 01:09:29,750
Come on Ulrik don't go so fast.

623
01:09:30,323 --> 01:09:31,984
Fuck!

624
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:35,527
Ulrik?

625
01:09:38,264 --> 01:09:39,993
What happened?

626
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:41,328
Nothing.

627
01:09:42,969 --> 01:09:44,994
Are you all right?

628
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:56,675
I’m a bit lost!

629
01:10:14,968 --> 01:10:16,663
Ulrik!

630
01:11:11,191 --> 01:11:13,455
Is there anybody here?

631
01:11:19,666 --> 01:11:21,691
Excuse me.

632
01:17:57,730 --> 01:17:59,698
What happened to you?

633
01:18:01,667 --> 01:18:05,159
Nothing...to you?

634
01:18:06,906 --> 01:18:08,373
Nothing.

635
01:20:45,231 --> 01:20:46,926
Miguel.

636
01:20:53,339 --> 01:20:55,637
Hello Miguel.

637
01:20:56,776 --> 01:20:58,243
Hello.

638
01:21:16,195 --> 01:21:19,289
Carla... wait.

639
01:21:20,566 --> 01:21:22,401
Something happened to Orlando!

640
01:21:22,436 --> 01:21:23,401
What?

641
01:21:23,436 --> 01:21:24,903
I don't know.

642
01:21:31,577 --> 01:21:34,960
He just fainted.
I don't know what happened.

643
01:21:34,995 --> 01:21:38,344
You're a medical student,
aren't you Ulrik?

644
01:21:49,128 --> 01:21:51,961
Yes, he’s alive!

645
01:22:29,668 --> 01:22:30,635
Hi.

646
01:22:33,105 --> 01:22:35,140
How do you feel?

647
01:22:35,175 --> 01:22:36,607
Tired.

648
01:22:39,111 --> 01:22:40,635
Old.

649
01:22:42,348 --> 01:22:45,215
Should I call someone from your family?

650
01:22:45,384 --> 01:22:48,842
No, there's nobody to call.

651
01:22:49,922 --> 01:22:53,380
Orlando... excuse me.

652
01:22:53,726 --> 01:22:56,456
You don't have kids, right?

653
01:22:57,530 --> 01:22:58,997
No.

654
01:22:59,899 --> 01:23:02,493
Would you like to?

655
01:23:03,435 --> 01:23:05,960
Do you ever think about that?

656
01:23:07,406 --> 01:23:10,776
For example that now your kids
could visit you.

657
01:23:10,811 --> 01:23:12,073
Things like that.

658
01:23:14,213 --> 01:23:16,681
I do think about that.

659
01:23:16,815 --> 01:23:18,783
Just imagine...

660
01:23:19,818 --> 01:23:22,918
...if I’d had them with Marcelita...

661
01:23:22,953 --> 01:23:26,018
...because she wanted
kids, you know?

662
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:31,894
Damn, they would be now,
what... 18?

663
01:23:32,798 --> 01:23:34,766
Two good sons.

664
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:37,001
They would come and say:

665
01:23:37,002 --> 01:23:40,902
Don't worry daddy, we’ll
take care of everything.

666
01:23:41,674 --> 01:23:44,142
Who else would say that shit?

667
01:23:44,710 --> 01:23:48,146
I don't know, friends I guess.

668
01:23:48,714 --> 01:23:50,181
No.

669
01:23:51,250 --> 01:23:53,718
Friends are for good times.

670
01:23:53,886 --> 01:23:55,353
Maybe

671
01:23:58,357 --> 01:24:01,155
Why don't you have kids now?

672
01:24:02,895 --> 01:24:04,328
Now?

673
01:24:06,332 --> 01:24:12,328
You should have kids when you're young.
It’s a law of nature.

674
01:24:17,476 --> 01:24:20,445
It's sad you know?

675
01:24:21,614 --> 01:24:23,714
Leaving this world without a trace

676
01:24:23,749 --> 01:24:27,207
Who is leaving this world?
Don't be tragic.

677
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:31,820
But it is a tragedy if you think
about it.

678
01:24:33,993 --> 01:24:36,725
You’re born and then you die.

679
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:39,457
And nobody remembers you.

680
01:24:40,332 --> 01:24:43,667
There is no trace of your life on earth.

681
01:24:43,702 --> 01:24:47,640
No trace? You’re leaving a song
that everybody knows!

682
01:24:47,675 --> 01:24:49,707
A horrible song.

683
01:24:49,742 --> 01:24:54,202
You’re depressed,
don't think about this now.

684
01:24:59,652 --> 01:25:01,950
You brought it up.

685
01:25:06,959 --> 01:25:09,792
Alfa Sierra to Oscar Papa.

686
01:25:10,295 --> 01:25:11,795
You're right, sorry.

687
01:25:11,830 --> 01:25:12,863
Oscar Papa here,
go ahead Alfa Sierra.

688
01:25:12,898 --> 01:25:14,900
I’m waiting for you here at the hot
dog party. Are you coming?

689
01:25:14,935 --> 01:25:18,402
Negative, I’m busy at the time.

690
01:25:18,437 --> 01:25:23,397
Too bad, I thought that,
well... OK... over.

691
01:25:26,845 --> 01:25:29,782
Ah! I authorize you to eat my hot dog.

692
01:25:29,817 --> 01:25:33,240
Thanks anyway Oscar Papa.

693
01:25:34,687 --> 01:25:37,815
Why do they call you Oscar Papa?

694
01:25:38,657 --> 01:25:41,125
It's the R code

695
01:25:41,927 --> 01:25:44,329
Carla... what was your...

696
01:25:44,364 --> 01:25:45,796
Gutierrez.

697
01:25:47,499 --> 01:25:49,533
You would be Charlie Golf.

698
01:25:49,568 --> 01:25:51,968
Nice, I like it... Charlie Golf.

699
01:26:01,814 --> 01:26:03,495
Excuse me!

700
01:26:03,530 --> 01:26:05,176
We’re leaving.

701
01:26:05,317 --> 01:26:07,478
Can I leave you the money I owe?

702
01:26:07,619 --> 01:26:09,333
I don't want to...

703
01:26:09,368 --> 01:26:11,048
You understand.

704
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:17,129
All right then...
I will give it to...

705
01:26:17,164 --> 01:26:18,397
Did you have a goodtime?

706
01:26:18,432 --> 01:26:19,864
Yes.

707
01:26:20,733 --> 01:26:22,718
Can I ask you a favor?

708
01:26:22,753 --> 01:26:24,703
How was Orlando's song?

709
01:26:24,738 --> 01:26:25,829
Vanity?

710
01:26:26,138 --> 01:26:27,940
Can you sing it?
I can't remember.

711
01:26:27,975 --> 01:26:29,139
No, I sing too badly

712
01:26:29,174 --> 01:26:31,677
Just a little bit.
It's on the tip of my tongue.

713
01:26:31,712 --> 01:26:34,305
No, I’m really bad at singing.

714
01:26:35,247 --> 01:26:38,341
OK, fine, have a good trip.

715
01:27:08,380 --> 01:27:10,062
Where are you going?

716
01:27:10,097 --> 01:27:11,745
To the hot springs.

717
01:27:13,552 --> 01:27:15,042
Can I go?

718
01:27:16,255 --> 01:27:18,883
lid prefer if you don't.

719
01:27:23,529 --> 01:27:25,121
Please?

720
01:29:22,614 --> 01:29:24,414
Will you talk to me?

721
01:29:24,449 --> 01:29:27,976
Can you stop using that
stupid accent, please?

722
01:29:30,122 --> 01:29:31,714
Sorry.

723
01:29:33,692 --> 01:29:36,092
I like being Ulrik.

724
01:29:36,662 --> 01:29:39,909
Is it so bad wanting to be Ulrik?

725
01:29:39,944 --> 01:29:43,156
What's wrong with being Miguel?

726
01:29:44,069 --> 01:29:46,436
Miguel is boring.

727
01:29:46,471 --> 01:29:50,842
You wouldn't have travelled
with Miguel Cardenas.

728
01:29:50,877 --> 01:29:53,902
OK, maybe. But what can you do?

729
01:29:55,514 --> 01:29:58,347
You can't lie just to have more friends.

730
01:29:58,417 --> 01:30:02,421
You lied too.
The twins were a lie.

731
01:30:02,456 --> 01:30:04,621
That was different.

732
01:30:04,656 --> 01:30:08,023
It was an excuse. I only did it once.

733
01:30:08,627 --> 01:30:11,863
You lied all the time.
You told only lies.

734
01:30:11,898 --> 01:30:16,201
They weren't all lies.
Just the name.

735
01:30:16,236 --> 01:30:18,867
Everything you said.

736
01:30:18,902 --> 01:30:21,499
You were acting.

737
01:30:22,441 --> 01:30:24,776
I wasn't acting.
It was only the voice.

738
01:30:24,811 --> 01:30:27,040
The voice is everything.

739
01:30:28,647 --> 01:30:31,172
The voice is just the voice.

740
01:30:33,986 --> 01:30:35,954
So, where are you from?

741
01:30:35,989 --> 01:30:38,286
From Puerto Montt.

742
01:30:40,692 --> 01:30:43,490
I don't believe a word you say

743
01:30:44,997 --> 01:30:46,862
From Ñuñoa

744
01:31:15,027 --> 01:31:18,428
You are not scared, are you?

745
01:31:19,064 --> 01:31:20,429
No.

746
01:32:31,403 --> 01:32:34,471
Where were you?

747
01:32:34,506 --> 01:32:39,010
We were at the hot springs.
It’s very nice there.

748
01:32:39,045 --> 01:32:42,013
Look what we found.
Can you play?

749
01:32:42,048 --> 01:32:43,072
No.

750
01:32:43,548 --> 01:32:44,981
I can play a bit.

751
01:32:45,016 --> 01:32:46,414
Let's go play.

752
01:32:50,722 --> 01:32:52,349
Ah, Carla!

753
01:32:53,158 --> 01:32:56,294
Someone's looking for you,
down at the cabin

754
01:32:56,329 --> 01:32:57,761
Thanks.

755
01:32:59,364 --> 01:33:00,831
...like on a screen...

756
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,334
In the retina, I’m telling you!

757
01:33:04,369 --> 01:33:07,372
I’ve seen a picture of retina,
and all you see is blood.

758
01:33:07,407 --> 01:33:09,372
What did you want to see?

759
01:33:09,407 --> 01:33:11,875
It's supposed to be like a screen.

760
01:33:11,910 --> 01:33:15,744
It's not so literal,
it doesn't need to reflect light...

761
01:33:38,703 --> 01:33:40,694
Lots of bugs.

762
01:33:48,847 --> 01:33:50,644
How are you?

763
01:33:52,017 --> 01:33:53,814
I’m good

764
01:33:55,253 --> 01:33:56,811
Better.

765
01:33:58,290 --> 01:34:01,691
That's how you look... better.

766
01:34:03,061 --> 01:34:05,723
Yes, I’m better.

767
01:34:06,298 --> 01:34:09,096
You look good.

768
01:34:09,801 --> 01:34:11,268
Thanks.

769
01:34:12,404 --> 01:34:16,397
Yes, l... I feel good.

770
01:34:25,850 --> 01:34:27,852
How are you?

771
01:34:27,887 --> 01:34:29,319
What?

772
01:34:30,822 --> 01:34:33,814
How are you doing?

773
01:34:37,195 --> 01:34:39,561
The same.

774
01:34:46,504 --> 01:34:47,971
Joel?

775
01:35:27,078 --> 01:35:30,673
When are you coming back
to Santiago?

776
01:35:32,984 --> 01:35:36,254
I don't know. I’ll wait
until Orlando gets better.

777
01:35:36,289 --> 01:35:37,881
Who's Orlando?

778
01:35:38,556 --> 01:35:42,720
The park... Orlando Palma!
The singer, remember him?

779
01:35:42,961 --> 01:35:43,928
No.

780
01:35:44,129 --> 01:35:49,134
Sure you remember.
He had this song called Vanity

781
01:35:49,169 --> 01:35:50,431
No... no.

782
01:35:50,702 --> 01:35:54,160
Vanity, it was very well known.

783
01:35:55,006 --> 01:35:56,673
I don't know it.

784
01:35:56,708 --> 01:36:00,645
But everybody knows that song!
Vanity by Orlando Palma.

785
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:04,604
I’m fucking sorry.
I don't know it... so what?

786
01:36:06,117 --> 01:36:09,321
Never mind... it's just a good song.

787
01:36:09,356 --> 01:36:11,983
I’m sure you know it.

788
01:36:14,025 --> 01:36:15,992
How was it?

789
01:36:16,027 --> 01:36:18,395
Sing a little bit.

790
01:36:18,430 --> 01:36:20,557
Come on, sing a little bit.

791
01:36:23,134 --> 01:36:25,830
I can't remember it.

792
01:37:50,722 --> 01:37:52,652
...for vanity...

793
01:37:52,687 --> 01:37:54,582
...to the wind...

794
01:38:10,708 --> 01:38:14,303
...a dream... for vanity...

795
01:38:19,951 --> 01:38:23,409
<i>If you want to bet,</i>

796
01:38:24,189 --> 01:38:29,627
<i>you can offer more</i>

797
01:38:30,862 --> 01:38:34,298
<i>than a plain feeling.</i>

798
01:38:37,435 --> 01:38:41,671
<i>But soon you’ll see,</i>

799
01:38:41,706 --> 01:38:46,700
<i>Things always come back to their place,</i>

800
01:38:48,513 --> 01:38:51,971
<i>And your game is over.</i>

801
01:38:54,452 --> 01:39:00,451
<i>I changed my freedom for
a moment.</i>

802
01:39:03,261 --> 01:39:06,742
<i>For vanity,</i>

803
01:39:06,743 --> 01:39:10,224
<i>I threw my luck to the wind.</i>

804
01:39:12,704 --> 01:39:15,434
<i>To the wind...</i>

805
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:39,264
<i>I lost everything...</i>

806
01:39:39,299 --> 01:39:44,000
<i>...lying.</i>

807
01:39:44,035 --> 01:39:48,687
<i>I threw everything...</i>

808
01:39:48,722 --> 01:39:53,339
<i>...to the wind.</i>

809
01:41:02,647 --> 01:41:04,444
OK then.

810
01:41:14,359 --> 01:41:19,097
You could give me your number,
we can have lunch one day.

811
01:41:19,132 --> 01:41:20,564
Really?

812
01:41:22,934 --> 01:41:25,767
We are friends Ulrik...

813
01:41:26,938 --> 01:41:28,838
Miguel.

814
01:41:32,043 --> 01:41:33,840
Aren't we?

815
01:41:41,986 --> 01:41:44,784
Do you have where to...

816
01:42:16,784 --> 01:42:20,784
THE END
