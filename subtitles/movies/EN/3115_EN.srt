1
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:28,512
LOVELY LONELINESS

2
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,998
Hello? Hi mum.

3
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,999
No, nothing's wrong.
I've got a bit of a cold.

4
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,241
It's not flu, it's a cold.
I'm fine.

5
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:09,379
Oh yes? When?

6
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:16,748
Yes, yes, sure. It'll do me good
for you to come.

7
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:21,119
Mum, can I call you back?

8
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:23,559
I've got another call.

9
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,858
OK? OK. Love you, bye.

10
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:09,066
Javi... Are you there?

11
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,036
Hello, Javi.

12
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,713
Hi... yes, yes, I'm fine.
I can talk now.

13
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,444
Well...

14
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,448
No, nothing.

15
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,054
Yes, no.

16
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,452
He said...

17
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:31,352
it wasn't the right time
for us to live together,

18
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:34,128
he needed time...

19
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:37,999
for his things, his career.

20
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:41,839
He said he couldn't...

21
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,739
I don't know.
I don't remember.

22
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:48,142
He said a lot, I forget...

23
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,407
Yes, yes, I know...

24
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:55,379
Yes, no, but I can't.

25
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,680
No, I know.

26
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:03,227
I'm calm, the thing is...

27
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,594
I've got this contraction...

28
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:09,096
and my arm hurts,
it goes numb...

29
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:13,030
I'm worried it's serious...

30
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:16,098
I don't want to worry,
but it scares me.

31
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,573
Yes, I know.
I'm calm all the same.

32
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:23,277
No, no. Best not.

33
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:27,385
I'm fine on my home.
I'm going to bed now.

34
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:29,745
Yes, yes, OK.

35
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:35,491
If I need anything
I'll call you, OK?

36
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,825
OK, fine.

37
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:40,228
Love you. Bye.

38
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:17,424
Hi, this is Soledad,
leave a message, thanks.

39
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,034
<i>Hi, this is Soledad,
leave a message, thanks.</i>

40
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:40,475
4565-6785
Leave a message, thanks.

41
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,426
Hello...

42
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:52,521
<i>Hi... It's noisy, where are you?</i>

43
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,995
<i>Down where?</i>

44
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:58,927
What?

45
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,368
Nico...

46
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:07,506
I'm busy right now.
I don't want to speak,

47
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:11,114
I'm about to go to work...

48
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,146
<i>It's not to talk.</i>

49
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,510
<i>I've got a practice
and my harmonica's there.</i>

50
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,753
Yes, the harmonica's here.
But I'm in a hurry, you know?

51
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,065
<i>- Could you bríng it down for me?
- Yes, hang on.</i>

52
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:44,078
<i>- I'll throw it, I have to go.
- What? No, it'll break...</i>

53
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,310
It won't break.
I'll throw it down to you.

54
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,247
<i>Wait, wait!</i>

55
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,516
- Hello.
- Good evening.

56
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:56,550
I need to see a kinesiologist.

57
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:58,522
There's no kinesiologist now.

58
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:01,057
You'll have to call from 8 to 6
and ask for an appointment.

59
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,027
Is there no one to see me now?

60
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,956
Yes, the duty doctor.

61
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:08,125
He can see you and give you
something for the pain.

62
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:12,594
- OK...
- Your medical card, please.

63
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,944
Is there a cardiologist?

64
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:25,476
Yes, but first the GP will see you.

65
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:30,150
The thing is,

66
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:33,086
I've got
this terrible contraction,

67
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:36,786
and it makes my head and arm hurt,

68
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:39,055
and my arm goes numb.

69
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:42,325
And I want to make sure
it's not my heart.

70
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,393
Yes, sure... that's fine.

71
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,029
A GP will see you...

72
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:50,300
and refer you
to a cardiologist if necessary.

73
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,337
What if I have a heart attack?

74
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,505
You'll have to be admitted.

75
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,080
Sit there and the doctor will
call you by your surname.

76
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:03,251
OK, thank you.

77
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,681
<i>- Hi!
- Hi!</i>

78
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,319
Maybe the blue's better
because they're both...

79
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:42,154
Let me see, put it there.

80
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,725
<i>- Your neighbour called...
- Ah... what did she say?</i>

81
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,460
She wanted to know if you could sit
for her on Saturday night.

82
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:53,964
<i>- Ah, I'll call her later.
- What do you think now?</i>

83
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:57,275
- Hi...
- Hi, how's it going?

84
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,046
Ah, they look nice.

85
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,808
- Do you like them?
- A lot...

86
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:06,708
What did the doctor say?

87
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,650
Nothing...
There's nothing wrong with me.

88
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:12,848
All the same, it was a duty doctor.
I don't believe him.

89
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:14,859
I'm going to see my doctor.

90
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:18,055
- You can come too if you like.
- OK, I'll see, alright.

91
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:20,495
You can come too, if you want.

92
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,399
OK, we'll see.

93
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,995
<i>Hi! You've been selected...</i>

94
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,004
<i>for our weekend discounts...</i>

95
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,339
<i>Hello love, just to confirm
I'm coming next Friday,</i>

96
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,469
<i>not this one, the next one.</i>

97
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:10,103
<i>Well, call me if you
need anything, love you.</i>

98
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,147
Hello...

99
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,181
Hello?

100
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,541
LEZAMA PHARMACY
This is very good.

101
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,747
And this is just in.

102
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,407
Amazing.

103
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:47,914
I know this one's good.
It's like my doctor's.

104
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:51,054
But I don't know
if it'll be easy to use.

105
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,418
Yes, it's easy.
It's semi-automatic.

106
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:55,150
You won't have any trouble with
this one.

107
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,591
- It's fully automatic.
- Let's see...

108
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:03,534
It's light, easy to use.
And it has a memory function.

109
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:05,167
What's that?

110
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:08,035
You take your pressure
and it stores it in the memory.

111
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,302
When you take your pressure again,

112
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:13,912
- you can compare them.
- Oh, great.

113
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,844
And you can work out an average.

114
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,439
Right.

115
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,416
Look at this one if you like.

116
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:24,019
No, I like this one.
The Velcro's good, it's nice.

117
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:28,119
- Is this one much pricier?
- No, not much.

118
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:29,785
I'll have a look.

119
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:32,557
- It's nice, isn't it?
- Yes, and it looks great on you.

120
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:37,134
- OK, I'll take this one.
- Fine.

121
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:43,871
I like the design
of these thermometers.

122
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,244
They're very similar
to one you bought the other day.

123
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:48,542
Yes, but mine is thinner.

124
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:52,373
- Do you want to take a look?
- No, it's OK. Another day.

125
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:27,183
The bill. Excuse me. The bill.

126
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,991
- Hi.
- Hello.

127
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,164
- Is something up?
- No, I have to make a call.

128
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,893
- What did you buy?
- A digital blood-pressure meter.

129
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:51,709
Hi Nicolás, well...

130
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:55,377
I'm going to leave
yourthings in your bag...

131
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:57,341
with Carlos.

132
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:00,750
When you want to go and get them,
just pop round.

133
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:04,013
Hope you're OK, bye.

134
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,296
- Everything OK?
- No, but isn't it great?

135
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,398
I just bought it.

136
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,974
- Hi Carlos.
- Good afternoon.

137
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,537
- Good afternoon, how are you?
- Fine.

138
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:32,846
Can I ask you a favour?
Can I leave you this bag?

139
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,915
Nicolás will come and get it.

140
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:38,247
OK? Do you know Nicolás?

141
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:41,325
- Yes.
- I don't know when,

142
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:44,460
- but he'll come by one of these days.
- OK, leave it there.

143
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,359
- I'll put it away later.
- OK, thanks, thanks very much.

144
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,525
- Don't mention it.
- Afternoon.

145
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:55,035
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi!

146
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,767
- Hi!
- How are you?

147
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,307
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Come on, I'm in a hurry.

148
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,039
OK. We'll talk later.

149
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,407
Good afternoon.

150
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:28,727
I want to tell you something.

151
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,866
I've made a decision...

152
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:35,270
I'm going to stay single
for at least 2 or 3 years.

153
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:39,172
- Why?
- I'm tired of crying,

154
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:42,175
suffering,
waiting for a phone call...

155
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,612
And I feel like I have to learn
to be alone,

156
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:50,016
I want to allow myself that
experience.

157
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:54,015
I don't know,

158
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:59,093
I feel more stable.

159
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,492
And that in general,
people who are alone...

160
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:05,394
are OK, they do OK.

161
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,769
I could...

162
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:11,834
travel.

163
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:15,468
Concentrate on my work in the shop.

164
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:17,438
- Sole...
- Hi...

165
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,709
- Hi, how are you?
- Fine.

166
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,148
Hi Olivia!

167
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:26,022
- Sole, how are you, gorgeous?
- How's it going?

168
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:17,189
Hello?

169
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,955
Hello?

170
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:27,705
- Hello.
- Hello, here we are.

171
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:29,365
- How are you?
- Come in.

172
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:32,242
- How are you?
- Fine, really good.

173
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,107
- Thank you. Were you sleeping?
- No, no.

174
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:36,544
I'll have to dash,
the taxi's waiting.

175
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,307
Be good now!

176
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:40,146
Are you sure you don't want her
to stay over?

177
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:42,311
Doesn't bother me.
We'll sleep together.

178
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:44,378
No, I'll get her.
Best if she's at home.

179
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:46,151
OK, thanks Sole.

180
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,757
- Bye gorgeous. I love you.
- Have a good time, eh?

181
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,895
- Bye, mum.
- Bye, gorgeous.

182
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:52,926
It's cold.

183
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,692
It's so pretty!

184
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:57,927
- Is it new?
- Yes.

185
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:00,062
- What's it called?
- Rain.

186
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:03,739
- I've rented a film to watch.
- OK.

187
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:05,936
And Nico?

188
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:08,809
- Nico.
- We've fallen out.

189
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:12,814
So that's why my mum told me
not to ask you.

190
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:14,642
Time!

191
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:18,286
Cold, blocked up nose,
generally unwell.

192
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,084
- Flu.
- OK.

193
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:23,351
Rapid heart rate.

194
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:25,696
- Tachycardia.
- OK.

195
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:29,227
Nausea and vomiting.

196
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:33,294
Pain in the upper part
of the left iliac crest,

197
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:37,102
increases when suddenly pressing
and releasing this area.

198
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,366
- Appendicitis.
- OK.

199
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:43,273
Feeling run-down,

200
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,276
doesn't tolerate changes
in position,

201
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:48,114
For example, dizzy when moving...

202
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:50,953
from horizontal to vertical.

203
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:53,319
- Low arterial pressure.
- OK.

204
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:57,924
Difficulty...

205
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:02,027
memorising and ordering
letters and numbers,

206
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,464
and also poor sentence structuring,

207
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:06,595
affecting both speech and writing.

208
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:08,537
Time.

209
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:12,238
- Time, time!
- Dyslexia!

210
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,042
Right.

211
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:18,809
- Hi.
- Hi.

212
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:20,078
How are you?

213
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:21,778
Fine.

214
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,253
- Is this the same as usual?
- Yes.

215
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:27,951
OK, I'll have one,
but could you heat it up?

216
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:30,094
- Sure.
- Yes? And wait...

217
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:37,167
Could you put the tomato here,

218
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:40,062
so it doesn't soften with the heat?

219
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:42,103
OK.

220
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:46,277
- Shall I bring it over?
- No, I'll wait here, thanks.

221
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:56,682
Hello, hello?

222
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:09,524
Hello, hello.

223
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:13,403
I can't hear you well, hello?

224
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:19,533
Excuse me, could I have another coffee
and the bill, please?

225
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,806
- Sorry about the shouting. No signal.
- Oh, that's fine.

226
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:28,675
- I haven't got a mobile.
- You're lucky then.

227
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:41,427
- It's coming.
- OK. Thanks.

228
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:55,412
OK, thanks. Perfect.

229
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:57,378
- Could you put it on my tab?
- OK.

230
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,973
OK, thanks.

231
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:02,013
- Are you off already?
- What?

232
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:05,918
Excuse me.
Maybe this sounds silly.

233
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,157
- What's your name?
- Soledad.

234
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:12,260
Solitude... It's what brings us
together?

235
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:14,765
That's my name. Soledad.

236
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:18,001
I know, it was a joke...

237
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,562
Oh, I didn't get it,

238
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:25,175
I have a thing with my name.

239
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:28,804
I have this theory that...

240
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:32,074
parents should give us fantasy names,

241
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,445
and when we're older...

242
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,420
everyone can have
the name they want.

243
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:40,052
It's not a bad theory.

244
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:42,052
Can I call you?

245
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:43,721
What?

246
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:46,320
I mean...

247
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:52,330
To go for a drink.

248
00:27:57,442 --> 00:28:00,502
I can give you my business card,
if you like.

249
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:02,443
- OK...
- OK, very good.

250
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:04,773
Wait. Can you hold this?

251
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:15,860
OK, fine.

252
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:17,988
- Well...
- Well...

253
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:20,327
- OK. Bye.
- Bye.

254
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:22,866
- What's your name?
- Nicolás.

255
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:25,962
But you can call me by
any fantasy name you like.

256
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:27,804
No, no, it's OK.

257
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:29,968
See you!

258
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,511
<i>Hi, it's dad. Are you there?</i>

259
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,746
<i>Never mind. Just calling
to see how you were.</i>

260
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:43,484
<i>Bye, love you.</i>

261
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,755
PLUMBING - GAS - DRAINS

262
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:34,164
<i>Hello.</i>

263
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,206
<i>Hello?</i>

264
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:48,646
<i>Javi, I forgot to ask you.
Do you know a good plumber?</i>

265
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,446
Plumber, no. I know a gasman...

266
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:55,655
who sometimes does plumbing.
I'll have a look...

267
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:59,387
- Hello.
- Hello.

268
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:01,422
I'll be right with you.

269
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,965
Just a second...

270
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:07,795
and I'll be with you.

271
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:10,403
<i>That mirror, how much is it?</i>

272
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:12,842
- 250 pesos.
- Hi.

273
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:15,402
- How are you?
- Good.

274
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:17,674
- Do you know each other?
- Yes. I...

275
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,876
- Yes. A little.
- Do you want to take over?

276
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,482
No, you serve him. No problem.

277
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:23,885
No, I'd rather you served me,
no offence!

278
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,580
None taken.

279
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,482
- Alright?
- Yes.

280
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,821
- Nice shop.
- Thanks.

281
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:35,465
And that mirror,
can I get it in other colours?

282
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:38,991
Yes, we have different colours,
different frames.

283
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,367
- Shall I show you?
- OK.

284
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:42,497
Come here.

285
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:49,678
Here you have all the frames
and colours.

286
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,839
I don't know if you're
looking for something more...

287
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:54,949
- This might work.
- Something opaque, you mean?

288
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:57,611
More grey.

289
00:30:57,789 --> 00:30:59,848
- In that tone, yes.
- It's grey...

290
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,685
This is a little opaque.

291
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,921
Do you want to have dinner some time?

292
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,658
I have plans today.

293
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:13,196
Well, it doesn't have to be today,
it could be another day.

294
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:19,967
What do you say?

295
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:24,245
Listen, there's something
I didn't tell you the other day,

296
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:28,277
because I don't know you very well.

297
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:34,019
It's just right now,
I'm going through this thing.

298
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:36,788
And I need to be alone...

299
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:38,886
I'm sorry...

300
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:42,492
That's OK.

301
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,227
Shall we look at the colours?

302
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:46,769
- This one might work.
- This one? Yes?

303
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:48,135
This one's fine.
Do you do home delivery?

304
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:50,870
No, but I can order you a removal van.

305
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:53,876
- No, I'll come for it myself.
- This one then?

306
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:58,978
Do you fancy going on a trip?

307
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:03,015
- When?
- I don't know, in a week.

308
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:05,248
Sole, you're crazy,
I can't go away.

309
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:06,915
I've got Mili,
she's got school.

310
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:09,960
- I'd love to but I can't.
- Sure.

311
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:13,460
- Anything else?
- And one of these. Two.

312
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:16,364
- Oh, me too. Three.
- Three?

313
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:20,062
- Yes please.
- Add on those three.

314
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,803
And two ripe avocados, for today.

315
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:26,338
I love avocados.

316
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:29,037
Do you want to come for dinner
tonight, with Mili?

317
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,478
I can't tonight.

318
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:34,245
- I'm going out. With the doctor.
- Great.

319
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,980
- It worked.
- Yes, yes.

320
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:37,419
It seems so.

321
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,516
Anything else?

322
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:54,803
- Hi dad.
- Hi love. How are you? OK?

323
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:57,372
Sorry I've no time, not even a minute
for a coffee with you,

324
00:32:57,542 --> 00:33:00,375
Mechi's waiting for me at home.
We've guests tonight. I'm late.

325
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:02,637
- Everything OK?
- Yes, do you like it?

326
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,247
Yes, I'll look at it later
in my own time. How much?

327
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,942
- Nothing.
- Go on, tell me how much it is.

328
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:08,110
- No, it's nothing.
- OK, don't say anything. Here.

329
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:10,984
- No, it's too much.
- Go on, take it.

330
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:12,214
- Do you need more?
- No, no, no.

331
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,723
- Sure?
- Yes.

332
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:15,520
You have to come
and see the new house.

333
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:17,786
Mechi's doing an amazing job.
You know what she's like.

334
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:19,090
No.

335
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:23,224
She likes artistic stuff, design,
decoration. Like you.

336
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:26,594
- You OK?
- Yes. OK, I'm off.

337
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,105
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

338
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:30,970
Speak to you soon, let's see if you
can come one day.

339
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:32,669
Yes, OK... bye.

340
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:34,302
- Bye.
- Ah! Your credit card renewal came,

341
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:36,279
I have to give you it.

342
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:38,438
- Ah, yes. Thanks.
- Bye.

343
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,184
- Say hi to Nicolás.
- OK, will do...

344
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:04,799
- Hi!
- Hi, how are you?

345
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:08,369
- Everything OK?
- Yes, fine.

346
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:11,312
Excuse me. Hello?

347
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,511
Yes, hang on. Is the mirror here?

348
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:17,110
- Yes, I'll get it.
- Hello? OK, fine.

349
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:23,760
OK, OK. Fine.

350
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:27,396
I'll call you back in
five minutes. Fine. Bye.

351
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:30,392
- OK, this is it.
- Do you want to open it?

352
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:32,333
- No, no.
- You sure? It looks good, eh?

353
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,462
No, no. Not at all.
I owe you something, don't I?

354
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,607
- No, it's all paid up.
- OK.

355
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:41,167
OK. Do you want to see something here?

356
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,907
- Anything else?
- No, not for now.

357
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:45,346
But I will leave you my card...

358
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:47,347
In case you ever need an architect.

359
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:50,854
Ah! You're an architect! Great!

360
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,083
- OK. I'm going. Bye.
- Bye.

361
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:56,758
- Bye, all the best.
- Bye, see you later.

362
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:43,495
I'm so stupid!

363
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:54,268
Stupid!

364
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:58,127
<i>Hello.</i>

365
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:01,694
Hi, it's me, sorry to interrupt.
Is Javi in?

366
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:04,537
<i>Yes, hold on. Javi!</i>

367
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:08,240
<i>- Hello.
- Hi, Javi...</i>

368
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:11,679
<i>- Could you bring me the copy of the key?
Yes, what happened? Are you okay?</i>

369
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,975
It's all good.
I got locked out.

370
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:16,983
<i>- Okay, but...
- Will you bring it down? C'mon!</i>

371
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:19,279
<i>Okay, come up.
It's raining, Soledad.</i>

372
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,722
No, no, no. I don't want to.

373
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:24,194
Sorry,
sorry to interrupt.

374
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,592
<i>It's okay, it's cool,
come up for a second.</i>

375
00:39:26,964 --> 00:39:31,025
No, no, I don't want to, I was
doing fine at home...

376
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:33,736
<i>- I got locked out, I forgot the key.
- Soledad...</i>

377
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:35,931
<i>- I didn't want to interrupt...
- Soledad...</i>

378
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:39,806
<i>- Sorry...
- I'll get it and bríng it down, okay?</i>

379
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:43,174
<i>- Okay, thanks.
- Chill down.</i>

380
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:23,776
Hello, hi Nicolás?

381
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:27,480
This is Soledad,
from "La Esperanza".

382
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,385
Remember me?

383
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,373
Hello? Yes, coming.

384
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,224
You haven't eaten anything.

385
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:13,195
No, I don't eat much at night.

386
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,274
You're very thin.
You need to feed yourself up.

387
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,439
Yes, but I eat well, you know?

388
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:23,238
All my family's like this.

389
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:26,681
Yes? You're lucky.
They're all fat in my family.

390
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:30,609
Yes? But you're OK, aren't you?

391
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:32,551
Yes, I look after myself a bit.

392
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,557
I bought a treadmill
forthe new house.

393
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:38,322
That's good.
You should use it.

394
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:47,566
And when will you finish your house?

395
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:49,503
In a month, I think.

396
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:53,267
The electrician's a bit behind,
he's doing some otherjob,

397
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:57,937
but I should be living there
in a month.

398
00:41:58,115 --> 00:42:00,050
Did you build it from scratch?

399
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:03,451
No, but it was in a bad state...

400
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:06,319
and I did most of it up...

401
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:12,628
I did a year of architecture,
but I dropped out.

402
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,322
Oh, yes?

403
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,158
But did you do interior design
or decoration?

404
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:22,637
Yeah, I dropped out of that too.

405
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,831
The chance came up...

406
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:29,971
to open the shop with Javi and Darío.
You remember Javier?

407
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:33,244
- Yes, yes.
- So that year...

408
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:35,046
I stopped studying.

409
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:37,618
But the others carried on and
graduated.

410
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:44,124
I think the academic life
is for a certain kind of person...

411
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:47,322
who likes going to the same place,

412
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:50,661
all year long,
with the same people,

413
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:53,069
during a long time...

414
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:55,801
I'm not that kind of person.

415
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:59,065
But I'm envious
of the people who can do it.

416
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:02,207
- I envy you a little.
- Don't say that.

417
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:03,974
But in a good way.

418
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:06,780
You have a pretty mouth.

419
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,575
Thanks.

420
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:16,985
Just going to the bathroom.

421
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:08,668
- Shall we order some tea?
- Yes.

422
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:13,574
- Everything OK?
- Yes.

423
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:17,084
- I'm a little dizzy...
- Really? Oh dear.

424
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:20,954
- Do you want to leave?
- No, I'm fine.

425
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:25,118
- Sure?
- Yes, yes.

426
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:31,592
Ah, no, yes. I don't feel well.
I'd rather we left.

427
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:33,727
- Let's go then. Shall I get the bill?
- Yes, go on.

428
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:36,766
How do you feel?

429
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:38,797
I don't know.

430
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:42,007
I'll explain in a minute...

431
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:49,180
<i>Hi, daughter! Are you there?</i>

432
00:44:49,253 --> 00:44:51,448
<i>I'm here.
I'm at grandma's.</i>

433
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:54,413
<i>Anyway, call me when you like.
Love you.</i>

434
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:43,196
<i>- Morning Carlos...
- Morning.</i>

435
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:46,534
I need to ask you a favour,

436
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:49,237
I've got a problem.
The zip on my dress is stuck.

437
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:51,178
I can't unzip it.
Could you help me?

438
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:54,147
Yes, yes, sure.

439
00:45:57,354 --> 00:45:59,219
- Excuse me.
- Yes, yes.

440
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:11,064
- There we go. Good. Thanks.
- No problem.

441
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:15,136
When I bought it, I didn't realise it
was so complicated.

442
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:17,102
- Of course.
- OK, thanks Carlos.

443
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:18,641
You are welcome.

444
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:29,577
I can't believe
you didn't tell me the other day.

445
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:32,686
I don't know, I forgot.

446
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:36,585
- How big are you having them?
- I don't know. But I saw them.

447
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,326
No idea, but the doctor knows.

448
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:43,560
Yes, but... Does the size go with
your body? Does it go with your age?

449
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:51,030
This doesn't look like a clinic to me.

450
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,037
It's not a clinic,
it's a consulting room.

451
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:56,841
- There's a little operating room.
- I'm not sure about this.

452
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:59,980
Cut it out, Soledad.
I'm here now.

453
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:02,112
What do you want me to do, eh?

454
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:06,550
I can't see a nurse or an ambulance,

455
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:09,455
- if something happens.
- It's all upstairs.

456
00:47:09,693 --> 00:47:12,560
Don't forget to buy me
the bra and the bandage,

457
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:14,563
I have to wear it from Monday.

458
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:15,893
Yes, yes.

459
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:18,261
Are you sure you want
to go to grandma's?

460
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:21,532
- Yes.
- How are you going to get there?

461
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:24,371
María's picking me up,
it's all sorted.

462
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,872
All the same, I'll be able to walk,
it's nothing.

463
00:47:27,978 --> 00:47:30,071
We'll see if it's nothing.

464
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:34,242
- Elsa Schved...
- Doctor.

465
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:38,079
Pleased to meet you,
I'm the daughter.

466
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:41,583
- OK dear, take it easy.
- OK.

467
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:44,653
- Call me from grandma's?
- I'll call you.

468
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:48,261
How are you doctor?
I'm glad the day's finally come.

469
00:47:57,274 --> 00:47:58,741
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

470
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:01,642
Can I ask something?
Is the operating room...

471
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,270
any good?

472
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:07,215
- Like what professionals use?
- It's a normal operating room.

473
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:10,014
- Well equipped, is it?
- Yes, fine. Everything will be fine.

474
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:12,954
- Don't you worry.
- OK, thanks.

475
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:19,124
<i>How are you?</i>

476
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:23,094
Fine, thanks. Better, yes.

477
00:48:25,702 --> 00:48:29,103
Now? Look,

478
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:31,903
I'm just chatting
with friends right now,

479
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:34,441
and later I don't know...

480
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:37,041
Why?
Did you want to do something?

481
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:46,483
Yes. I don't know,
I don't want to get wet.

482
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:51,590
Yes... sure, you have a car.

483
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:54,720
No, I can't drive.

484
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:59,569
Sure, one day you can teach me,
there's no rush.

485
00:49:02,072 --> 00:49:04,768
Listen, do you want to come here?

486
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:07,310
Yes, OK.

487
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,541
Do you remember how to get here?

488
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:12,140
OK, see you then.

489
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:27,990
My cheeks get hot when I kiss.

490
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:31,331
- Are they red?
- A bit, yes.

491
00:49:34,271 --> 00:49:37,104
When I was a girl,
when I had fever,

492
00:49:37,574 --> 00:49:40,771
I liked it because
it gave me this natural blush...

493
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:43,344
I'd get rosy cheeks...

494
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,541
and it looked good...

495
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:49,343
Anyway, I'd finish it off,

496
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:52,752
I'd make up with my saliva.
Like this, look...

497
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,718
Here on my eyelashes.

498
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:02,027
And a little on my lips.

499
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:05,065
When I took the bus.

500
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:14,100
I can imagine what
you were like when you were young,

501
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:16,805
I would've liked
to have known you back them.

502
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:19,107
I think we would've got on well.

503
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:20,907
- Do you think so?
- Yes.

504
00:50:20,984 --> 00:50:23,350
I don't know, maybe.

505
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:37,729
They didn't put us in this month.
We forgot to send a fax.

506
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:42,230
Yes. I'll send it.

507
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,872
- Thanks.
- No problem.

508
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:47,943
The picture I liked has been sold,
has it?

509
00:50:48,011 --> 00:50:50,309
- Yes, yesterday. I didn't tell you.
- What?

510
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:53,144
Darío got a call,
they've confirmed the Colombia expo.

511
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:54,376
- No!
- Yes!

512
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:55,611
- With this series?
- Yes.

513
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:59,382
Great. Great, how nice...
the beach, Colombia.

514
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:01,889
- No, it's in Bogotá, not on the beach.
- Oh, I see...

515
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:05,758
And now we want to see if we can find
somewhere to stay. I'm going with him.

516
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:08,263
No!
Oh, that's great, how nice.

517
00:51:08,632 --> 00:51:11,157
- I'd like to get away too.
- Where to?

518
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:14,529
Don't know, do you think Brazil
would be very expensive?

519
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:17,832
No, check it out,
there are always cheap packages.

520
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,399
La Esperanza.
Hello.

521
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,909
Yes, how are you?

522
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:25,541
Yes, she's right here beside me.

523
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,975
Here she is. Cheers.

524
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:30,310
- Your boyfriend.
- What a pain...

525
00:51:32,155 --> 00:51:33,622
Hello?

526
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,281
Fine, you?

527
00:51:35,959 --> 00:51:39,793
What? Sorry, I didn't realise.

528
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:42,229
No, sorry, hang on, I'm coming.

529
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:45,332
- What happened?
- I locked him in.

530
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:48,727
Back in a sec.

531
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:50,996
Take your time.

532
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:00,707
Hi! Where are you?

533
00:52:00,984 --> 00:52:03,111
In the bathroom.

534
00:52:03,186 --> 00:52:04,778
I'm sorry.

535
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:06,754
You fixed my toilet?

536
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:08,484
- Yes.
- Why?

537
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:12,155
I thought it'd be good if it worked.

538
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,162
Was that wrong?

539
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:18,133
No, but I was going to fix it.

540
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:19,998
Well, I fixed it.

541
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:22,900
Anyway, I'll let you go.

542
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:29,477
Does it bother you?

543
00:52:29,946 --> 00:52:33,040
No, it's fine,
it had to be done.

544
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:36,614
I'm off, I'm going for lunch.

545
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:40,119
Who with?

546
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:43,159
- Afriend.
- Enjoy!

547
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:46,395
- Thanks. Is it open downstairs?
- Yes.

548
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:49,896
It's open. Call me, OK?

549
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:52,194
See you.

550
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:26,600
- Why so many?
- I liked the Velcro on this one,

551
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:31,029
and this one here,
this one's got hooks.

552
00:53:31,508 --> 00:53:33,476
Which can be a good idea too.

553
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:36,410
And another,
in case you want to change.

554
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:39,640
And the chemist told me
that these are handy,

555
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,377
they're what everyone uses.

556
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:43,749
Yes, I'm wearing
those, I can change them.

557
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:47,187
- Shall I show you them?
- No, what for?

558
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:49,724
I don't want to see them.
Why would I?

559
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:52,157
- Fine!
- I'll give grandma a kiss...

560
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:54,992
- and I'll be on my way.
- Careful, she's a bit mad today.

561
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:57,733
She thinks I'll take María away.

562
00:53:58,301 --> 00:54:01,498
OK, I'll call you tomorrow
to see how you are.

563
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:05,136
Yes, and we still haven't had time
to talk about Nicolás.

564
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:08,669
Yes, because you decided to have
an operation. That's why...

565
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:11,441
- But now I'm out.
- Yes, luckily.

566
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:13,982
I had a boob job, it's not
as if I had heart surgery.

567
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:17,611
It could have been serious
and you'd have complicated my life.

568
00:54:17,687 --> 00:54:19,655
- I?
- Yes, you.

569
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:22,383
- OK. Bye.
- Bye.

570
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:05,828
<i>Hi Sole, are you there?</i>

571
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:09,000
<i>Sole? It's OK.</i>

572
00:55:09,572 --> 00:55:11,802
<i>See you later in the shop.</i>

573
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:13,399
<i>OK. Big kiss.</i>

574
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:30,589
- So when would you be going?
- Next week.

575
00:55:30,694 --> 00:55:33,219
- So soon!
- The curator...

576
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:34,957
who wanted to see Darío's work...

577
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:38,096
is only in Bogotá for a week.

578
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:40,126
You don't have to open the shop,
though.

579
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:42,237
No, I don't want to close.

580
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:45,067
I want to work, I can manage.

581
00:55:45,141 --> 00:55:48,474
- But you don't have to.
- I want to.

582
00:55:48,578 --> 00:55:51,342
- Oh, I could look after the dog.
- No, she's coming with us.

583
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:54,679
On the plane? Do you have
to put herthrough that?

584
00:55:56,653 --> 00:55:58,587
She's done it before
and she was fine.

585
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:02,287
I don't know, it can't be healthy.

586
00:56:02,425 --> 00:56:05,155
- So can I confirm with Darío?
- Yes, tell him it's OK.

587
00:56:06,763 --> 00:56:08,390
La Esperanza.

588
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:11,333
- Hello.
- Hello.

589
00:56:14,003 --> 00:56:16,733
I'm a bit nauseous and
I wanted to see a doctor.

590
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:19,366
OK. Can I see your medical card?

591
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:27,940
- A GP, right?
- Yes.

592
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:36,152
And aren't you cold
wearing only that shirt?

593
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:38,420
No, no.

594
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:42,789
Sit there and
they'll call you by your surname.

595
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:45,257
Sorry, can I just ask...

596
00:56:45,435 --> 00:56:48,700
is there a phone on this floor?

597
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:52,401
- Yes, there. At the end, on your right.
- Ah yes, thanks.

598
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:55,100
- You're welcome.
- Bye.

599
00:57:20,537 --> 00:57:23,335
Hello? How's it going?

600
00:57:23,807 --> 00:57:25,604
Are you busy?

601
00:57:26,042 --> 00:57:28,101
Oh sorry, I'll call you later.

602
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:31,243
No, no, I'm not at home. No.

603
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:34,683
I'm in the hospital.

604
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:39,912
No, it's nothing.
Just feeling a bit dizzy.

605
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:42,182
No, it's not serious,

606
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,760
nothing to worry about.
No, don't worry.

607
00:57:44,928 --> 00:57:46,395
<i>Correa Soledad.</i>

608
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:48,995
- This way please.
- Sorry, the doctor's calling me.

609
00:57:49,532 --> 00:57:51,397
Carry on eating, don't worry.

610
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:54,527
I'll call you when I get home.

611
00:57:54,671 --> 00:57:56,764
OK, take care. Sorry. Bye.

612
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:01,872
- Evening.
- How's it going?

613
00:58:08,852 --> 00:58:10,581
Feeling better?

614
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:13,445
Yes, I'm better.

615
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:17,791
- What did you eat?
- Beef.

616
00:58:19,362 --> 00:58:21,353
It's not good to eat protein at night,

617
00:58:21,531 --> 00:58:24,022
the body can't digest it.

618
00:58:27,103 --> 00:58:29,401
My body's used to it by now.

619
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:31,233
All the same.

620
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:36,037
Go like this,

621
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:39,046
hit me and rub me,

622
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:41,649
hit me and rub me.

623
00:58:52,128 --> 00:58:55,427
- Do you like that?
- Yes, it soothes me.

624
00:59:00,503 --> 00:59:02,471
Are you staying the night?

625
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:06,341
OK. We'll see later.

626
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,750
Nico?

627
00:59:35,004 --> 00:59:36,596
Nico?

628
00:59:40,443 --> 00:59:42,035
Nico?

629
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:43,874
Nico...

630
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:47,039
Hi... I was scared.

631
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:49,280
- Why? What's up?
- I don't know. I couldn't find you,

632
00:59:49,352 --> 00:59:52,378
I thought something was up.
I got worried.

633
00:59:52,455 --> 00:59:54,514
I went to buy breakfast.

634
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:58,016
I got scared, I was worried.

635
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:03,797
- What did you get?
- Scones, OK?

636
01:00:05,835 --> 01:00:09,134
I'm going to make some tea.
Do you want some?

637
01:00:21,684 --> 01:00:23,015
La Esperanza.

638
01:00:23,186 --> 01:00:25,711
Hi mum. Fine, fine.

639
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:29,852
Can I call you from home?
I'm just closing.

640
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:33,127
OK, you too.

641
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:44,899
Hi, what are you doing here?

642
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:47,775
I came to see you.
Got a minute?

643
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:51,774
No, I have to go and send a fax.
I have to go.

644
01:00:51,914 --> 01:00:53,973
- OK, I'll go with you.
- I'm in a hurry.

645
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:57,486
- That's OK, we'll walk fast.
- OK, it's up to you... Hello.

646
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:01,718
You look well.

647
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:04,793
Yes, I am well.
You surprised?

648
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:07,088
No, I'm glad.

649
01:01:08,564 --> 01:01:10,998
- How are you?
- Fine, fine.

650
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,600
Lots of work, bit tired.
We finished the record.

651
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:14,898
Oh, good.

652
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:21,974
- Hi.
- Hi.

653
01:01:22,045 --> 01:01:25,572
- I need to send this. A fax.
- Just one page?

654
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:27,206
- Yes.
- Number?

655
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:30,750
Yes. 4771-9129.

656
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:34,357
Before, I don't know why,
I couldn't be with you,

657
01:01:34,358 --> 01:01:37,224
- but now I can.
- Yes, I understood...

658
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:40,124
you couldn't be with me,
I know that now.

659
01:01:40,596 --> 01:01:42,427
I want to go.

660
01:01:42,965 --> 01:01:44,193
- Phone booth?
- Yes.

661
01:01:44,267 --> 01:01:46,235
I think it's time for us
to be together again.

662
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:48,030
No, not now.

663
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:49,694
Now I know that I love you.

664
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,335
- Has it gone through?
- It's going.

665
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:54,968
Look at me.

666
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:56,511
- And now?
- It's still going through.

667
01:01:56,579 --> 01:01:58,672
Say something. Please.

668
01:01:58,781 --> 01:02:00,271
Excuse me, could I have a phone?

669
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:03,147
- Yes, go to number 4.
- Sorry, I have to go.

670
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:06,086
- Stop, stop.
- Let me go, what are you doing?

671
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:09,152
I don't want you to love me now.
I'm alone and I'm fine,

672
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:12,126
and now I want
to check my messages, bye.

673
01:02:29,378 --> 01:02:33,747
<i>4565-6785,
leave a message, thanks.</i>

674
01:02:37,987 --> 01:02:39,852
<i>Hi Sole, I wanted to talk to you
about something before I leave.</i>

675
01:02:39,956 --> 01:02:42,925
<i>Don't miss me, I'll be back soon.
Love you.</i>

676
01:02:44,827 --> 01:02:47,455
<i>Hi sweetheart. It's Dad...</i>

677
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:50,724
<i>I wanted to invite you
to visit my new home.</i>

678
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:52,525
<i>Love you.</i>

679
01:03:32,775 --> 01:03:36,074
<i>Hi Sole. Are you there?</i>

680
01:03:36,913 --> 01:03:38,778
<i>Talk to me, please.</i>

681
01:03:45,555 --> 01:03:48,217
- Buzios you said, right?
- Yes.

682
01:03:49,091 --> 01:03:51,218
- For one person?
- Yes.

683
01:03:51,561 --> 01:03:53,358
- With flights?
- Yes.

684
01:03:53,863 --> 01:03:55,592
- Is it for you?
- Yes.

685
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:59,294
Do you mind if I recommend you
somewhere else?

686
01:03:59,402 --> 01:04:02,394
Because Buzios is more for couples.

687
01:04:02,772 --> 01:04:05,605
- What do you recommend?
- How about Love Club?

688
01:04:05,775 --> 01:04:09,142
They're great places for meeting
people, have you ever been?

689
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:11,874
No, I don't want to meet people,
I want to go to the beach for a week.

690
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:16,078
The thing is there aren't generally
very many single rooms.

691
01:04:16,152 --> 01:04:18,712
Wouldn't you prefer
to do something with a friend?

692
01:04:18,888 --> 01:04:22,790
Because double rooms
are easier to get, you know?

693
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:25,220
I had a "Fun"...

694
01:04:25,394 --> 01:04:28,329
friends and couples package.

695
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:31,889
No, my friends have plans
and this would be confirmed,

696
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:34,127
so don't look.

697
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:38,298
All the same,

698
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:40,699
this is no good...

699
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:43,505
because it's a cabin for four.

700
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:46,545
There's no room here...

701
01:04:46,616 --> 01:04:49,779
The thing is, it's very last minute.
And if I find anything...

702
01:04:49,852 --> 01:04:52,480
it's going to be
a lot more expensive.

703
01:04:52,588 --> 01:04:54,920
Yes, that's what I've heard.

704
01:04:56,659 --> 01:04:58,524
How about this?

705
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:04,726
OK, this has single rooms available.

706
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,130
- I'll get you a leaflet.
- Where is it?

707
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:09,899
- In Fortaleza. Heard of it?
- Brazil?

708
01:05:09,972 --> 01:05:13,271
- Yes.
- No, but the name's nice.

709
01:05:14,043 --> 01:05:15,772
Yes.

710
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:21,745
Great! All sorted.

711
01:05:21,817 --> 01:05:24,980
Yes, Javier's very organised.

712
01:05:25,054 --> 01:05:27,318
This is going to come in handy.
Walk me to the car?

713
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:28,584
OK.

714
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:30,949
The house is turning out great.

715
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:32,426
Yes?

716
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:36,258
- You have to come and see it.
- Yes, great, I'd like to.

717
01:05:37,533 --> 01:05:39,797
- I bought a fish tank.
- Oh yes?

718
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:41,359
Do you like them?

719
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:46,408
I don't know.
I find they suffocating sometimes.

720
01:05:46,676 --> 01:05:50,373
Also, they say fish have no memory.

721
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:52,208
And they don't remember if...

722
01:05:53,382 --> 01:05:57,512
- Oh, they say that?
- Yes, they could have a broader reality.

723
01:05:58,721 --> 01:06:00,313
- Do you want to come?
- Where to?

724
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:01,913
The house.

725
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:06,592
Not today. Another day,
when I have more time.

726
01:06:07,663 --> 01:06:10,496
- Thanks for your help.
- You are welcome.

727
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:20,138
<i>I can see the Velcro in you
bra from here, it's nice...</i>

728
01:06:22,678 --> 01:06:24,373
<i>Can you use wear it
like that already?</i>

729
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,313
Yes, the doctor said
the tightest the best.

730
01:06:27,383 --> 01:06:29,078
Really?

731
01:06:29,685 --> 01:06:32,950
I'd like it if you could go
and visit grandma.

732
01:06:33,923 --> 01:06:35,481
Yes.

733
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:37,817
Sorry I can't open the door,

734
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:41,090
there are still
some things I can't do.

735
01:06:48,437 --> 01:06:51,065
Please, take care with all that.

736
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:53,767
Don't worry, I'm fine.

737
01:06:54,143 --> 01:06:56,236
Thanks forthe shawl.
I loved it.

738
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:59,337
Isn't it lovely?
It's very rare mink.

739
01:06:59,548 --> 01:07:01,413
Sir, taxi for the second floor?

740
01:07:01,484 --> 01:07:03,782
Thank you. Can you open
the door for me? Because...

741
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:06,485
Well...

742
01:07:07,056 --> 01:07:10,150
- OK, take care.
- Call me when you get there.

743
01:07:10,226 --> 01:07:11,853
Yes, I will.

744
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:19,364
To the airport, please.

745
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:28,241
- This is practical and modern.
- It's nice.

746
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:30,938
Yes, my dad gave me it
and I've never used it.

747
01:07:31,013 --> 01:07:33,345
- But is it OK if you lend me it?
- Yes, no worries.

748
01:07:33,516 --> 01:07:35,040
Thanks. I'll give it you
as soon as I come back.

749
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:39,247
- There's no rush.
- Lovely. Thanks a lot, Sole.

750
01:07:40,122 --> 01:07:42,147
- Great, I love it.
- Isn't it good that you're going away?

751
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:44,522
Yes, I'm very happy.
Just three days but...

752
01:07:44,593 --> 01:07:47,619
- It's great all the same.
- Yes. Just to get to know each other.

753
01:07:48,597 --> 01:07:50,565
And Mili...
she staying with her dad?

754
01:07:50,633 --> 01:07:52,567
Yes. I can't believe herfather.
He said yes.

755
01:07:52,635 --> 01:07:53,693
- Great.
- Yes.

756
01:07:53,769 --> 01:07:56,203
- Great, you've got everything sorted.
- Yes, I've got the suitcase...

757
01:07:56,272 --> 01:07:58,399
- and now I have to shave my legs.
- Well, you know...

758
01:07:58,474 --> 01:08:01,466
please bring me the suitcase
when you come back,

759
01:08:01,544 --> 01:08:03,978
I might need it.

760
01:08:04,046 --> 01:08:05,707
Sure, no problem.

761
01:08:05,981 --> 01:08:07,949
Have a good trip.

762
01:08:08,017 --> 01:08:09,382
- Thanks honey.
- Everything's going to be OK.

763
01:08:09,452 --> 01:08:11,579
I guess, I'll tell you after.

764
01:08:11,654 --> 01:08:13,315
- Yes.
- Bye.

765
01:08:24,467 --> 01:08:26,731
<i>Hi, are you there? It's me.</i>

766
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:31,706
<i>Right, I'm starting to pack.</i>

767
01:08:32,575 --> 01:08:35,703
<i>Call me. Bye.</i>

768
01:08:36,045 --> 01:08:37,637
<i>Love you.</i>

769
01:09:22,224 --> 01:09:24,089
It looks very nice.

770
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,050
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

771
01:09:26,228 --> 01:09:28,924
And you have a hospital here,
round the corner, you know?

772
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:31,330
- Yes?
- Yes, very good.

773
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:37,664
It's very good taste, I like it.

774
01:09:38,274 --> 01:09:40,902
- Well, thank you.
- And the fish tank looks good.

775
01:09:40,976 --> 01:09:44,207
- What a good idea.
- Yes.

776
01:09:45,981 --> 01:09:48,643
- And the mirror will look good.
- The mirror looks great.

777
01:09:48,784 --> 01:09:50,376
Yes.

778
01:09:53,088 --> 01:09:56,182
- You've got a barbecue.
- Yes.

779
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:05,129
The lights are great.

780
01:10:05,601 --> 01:10:07,592
It's just a question of finishing it,
isn't it? I still...

781
01:10:17,079 --> 01:10:19,070
Sorry I didn't help with the packing.

782
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:22,311
Don't worry, you got me the boxes.

783
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:27,121
- What's up? Are you OK?
- Yes, I'm fine.

784
01:10:27,523 --> 01:10:29,115
What's up?

785
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:32,827
I don't know. It's just that it's nice
here, your house,

786
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:37,059
the area, you.
It's all very nice, I don't know.

787
01:10:38,367 --> 01:10:40,335
Sometimes it happens...

788
01:10:40,836 --> 01:10:44,499
that when I fall in love,
or when I like someone...

789
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:46,871
I feel like I lose my way,

790
01:10:47,009 --> 01:10:50,001
like I run away from myself.

791
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:53,407
But don't think I'm not OK...

792
01:10:53,482 --> 01:10:56,076
- just because I'm crying, I'm fine.
- OK, OK.

793
01:10:56,185 --> 01:10:59,677
Take it easy,
everything's fine.

794
01:11:00,789 --> 01:11:03,257
Don't worry about a thing,
everything's fine.

795
01:11:03,325 --> 01:11:06,658
- Don't say it's fine.
- Well...

796
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:17,804
Easy, easy,

797
01:11:19,174 --> 01:11:21,734
- nothing's wrong.
- I really am OK, eh?

798
01:11:22,311 --> 01:11:24,279
Don't worry.

799
01:11:28,017 --> 01:11:30,417
OK. OK...

01:12:30,379 --> 01:12:33,041
Good afternoon, can I help you?

802
01:12:33,115 --> 01:12:35,174
No, I'm just looking, thanks.
