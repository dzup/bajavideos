1
00:00:46,195 --> 00:00:47,184
Come forward.

2
00:00:48,264 --> 00:00:50,129
- Name.
- Avila, Ricardo.

3
00:00:53,202 --> 00:00:54,226
On.
Forward!

4
00:00:57,206 --> 00:00:58,264
Battaglia, Francesco.

5
00:01:00,243 --> 00:01:03,179
- You're not here.
- What do you mean?

6
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:05,238
It has to be!
I was promised!

7
00:01:06,215 --> 00:01:11,152
I was promised a job!
I'm a survivor of the Rosales!

8
00:01:12,221 --> 00:01:15,190
- I've not been paid!
- Take him away!

9
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,218
Come on! Take him away!
Forward!

10
00:01:19,195 --> 00:01:25,156
Listen, Sir!
What do you mean I'm not in?

11
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,230
I know all the truth about
the wreckage of the Rosales!

12
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:43,085
No, let go!

13
00:01:44,253 --> 00:01:47,245
I was supposed to have a job...
Sure...

14
00:01:55,331 --> 00:01:58,367
There's something strange
in all this, Sir.

15
00:01:58,367 --> 00:02:00,267
What times we're living!

16
00:02:35,204 --> 00:02:39,140
THE ROSALES

17
00:04:56,345 --> 00:04:57,312
Come in.

18
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:07,180
Captain Lowry,
Admiral Hernández.

19
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,216
Take a seat, Captain.

20
00:05:20,302 --> 00:05:22,271
We're ready to listen.

21
00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:25,141
I have carefully read
what was done

22
00:05:25,141 --> 00:05:30,079
under prosecutor Pérez
and I believe there are omissions

23
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,282
and contradictions which conceal
extremely serious deeds

24
00:05:33,282 --> 00:05:36,085
which took place
on board the Rosales.

25
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,154
What is it precisely that you mean?

26
00:05:38,154 --> 00:05:41,089
My dear Lowry,
I know you're responsible.

27
00:05:41,323 --> 00:05:45,127
I've known you since
you were under my command.

28
00:05:45,127 --> 00:05:49,086
But these officers have already
been tried and acquitted.

29
00:05:49,298 --> 00:05:54,270
The case was reopened solely
because of public opinion,

30
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:59,105
stirred by certain interests
which you know as well as I do.

31
00:06:01,143 --> 00:06:07,082
Gentlemen, you've asked my opinion
as prosecutor and I delivered it.

32
00:06:12,221 --> 00:06:13,119
Please...

33
00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:20,254
Well, as you can see our fund-raiser
has reached almost 5,000 pesos.

34
00:06:21,197 --> 00:06:24,098
Celia, dear,
could you stop playing the piano?

35
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:27,134
As if you knew how to...

36
00:06:27,236 --> 00:06:31,073
Neither do you.
I don't know why you have it.

37
00:06:31,073 --> 00:06:33,064
Because it's fashionable.

38
00:06:40,116 --> 00:06:44,143
In a short while we'll get the rest
and we'll have a new ship!

39
00:06:44,253 --> 00:06:48,157
My God, what a tragedy that was!
How did it happen?

40
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:50,292
You promised
your boyfriend would tell us.

41
00:06:50,292 --> 00:06:51,293
- Yes.
- When?

42
00:06:51,293 --> 00:06:52,225
Now!

43
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,164
How lucky!

44
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,189
Otherwise,
why would we be here for?

45
00:06:59,235 --> 00:07:01,203
Honey, honey, honey!

46
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:09,111
All my friends are waiting
for you to tell your tales!

47
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:11,102
- Not today...
- My hero! My hero!

48
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,082
Tell me, please!

49
00:07:17,153 --> 00:07:21,089
- It's our hero!
- We better not talk about this.

50
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,292
Why not?
We must, more than ever!

51
00:07:23,292 --> 00:07:26,159
Come on,
my friends want to meet you!

52
00:07:36,172 --> 00:07:38,037
Come back in an hour.

53
00:07:49,151 --> 00:07:51,220
- La Nacion newspaper!
- No, out!

54
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,245
Is this where the Captain lives?

55
00:07:56,292 --> 00:07:58,283
- I want to tell you...
- What?

56
00:08:00,162 --> 00:08:03,063
- I know it all.
- You shouldn't speak.

57
00:08:05,034 --> 00:08:06,228
You have a temperature.

58
00:08:07,102 --> 00:08:09,229
I saved what you
would have saved.

59
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:14,169
CaptaiN Funes, Sir!
Let me in, he knOws me!

60
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,279
CaptaiN Funes!

61
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:19,179
- Cabassa...
- I know, Funes.

62
00:08:21,116 --> 00:08:23,185
I know you lost the ship
the right way.

63
00:08:23,185 --> 00:08:26,245
I., . I want mY mOneY!
I kNOw the Captain is iN!

64
00:08:27,056 --> 00:08:28,045
CaptaiN Funes!

65
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:30,593
It's alright, Juana.

66
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,161
It's alright, Juana.

67
00:08:32,161 --> 00:08:35,231
All I want, madam,
is to talk to Captain Funes.

68
00:08:35,231 --> 00:08:38,133
I told you, he's ill.
He is unable to see you.

69
00:08:38,133 --> 00:08:40,260
- What do you mean, ill?
- Please, leave.

70
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,305
- What does this man want?
- He doesn't understand.

71
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:47,142
- What I want, Sir, is to be paid.
- Leave this house.

72
00:08:47,142 --> 00:08:48,143
- No!
- Out!

73
00:08:48,143 --> 00:08:51,078
No! I want to be paid!
I want my salary!

74
00:08:52,214 --> 00:08:56,207
Captain, Captain, help me!
You know who I am!

75
00:08:59,154 --> 00:09:00,178
I don't know you.

76
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,128
I don't know who you are.

77
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,128
Come on!

78
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:23,239
Will you listen to me, please?
Just one minute, listen.

79
00:09:25,214 --> 00:09:30,208
I'm going to go round with the hat.
Give what you can.

80
00:09:31,053 --> 00:09:36,258
It's for the mothers, the wives,
the children of those who died

81
00:09:36,258 --> 00:09:39,250
on board the Rosales.
Our own folk.

82
00:09:40,262 --> 00:09:45,067
- And who are you?
- Enzo, he writes in "The workman".

83
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:46,159
Oh, the anarchist.

84
00:10:13,162 --> 00:10:14,129
Thank you.

85
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,199
- Battaglia...
- Who looks for me?

86
00:10:27,343 --> 00:10:29,243
I need to talk to you.

87
00:10:51,266 --> 00:10:53,097
What do you want?

88
00:10:54,203 --> 00:10:57,263
I want to hear the story
you're telling around.

89
00:11:00,175 --> 00:11:01,039
Why?

90
00:11:02,144 --> 00:11:04,135
I write for "La Nación".

91
00:11:05,214 --> 00:11:08,283
- Oh, yes...
- Speak, Battaglia, speak!

92
00:11:08,283 --> 00:11:10,080
We all need it!

93
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:13,288
If they publish it
it will have a bigger impact!

94
00:11:13,288 --> 00:11:18,123
Why? Why do I have to speak?
Why do I have to speak?

95
00:11:25,234 --> 00:11:28,170
I went to Funes' house today.
He threw me out!

96
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,070
Funes threw me out!

97
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:35,209
My own Captain saying
he doesn't know me!

98
00:11:36,311 --> 00:11:40,247
Battaglia's annoying!
He's annoying for everyone!

99
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:45,219
Why?
Because he saw everything!

100
00:12:13,148 --> 00:12:14,240
Let's go. Let's go!

101
00:12:20,155 --> 00:12:22,248
DON't leave me!
DON't leave me!

102
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:45,075
Sir... get on the boat.
Get on the boat now!

103
00:13:32,227 --> 00:13:33,194
Renata...

104
00:13:36,298 --> 00:13:37,265
Renata!

105
00:13:38,133 --> 00:13:40,124
HONeY, breakfaSt!

106
00:13:44,173 --> 00:13:46,232
- Try it.
- This is great!

107
00:13:47,176 --> 00:13:49,311
- Thank you.
- It seems like a party!

108
00:13:49,311 --> 00:13:52,214
No, it's just pasta.
Are you seeing Marcelo?

109
00:13:52,214 --> 00:13:55,240
- Yes, I'm carrying his lunch.
- Carletto!

110
00:13:57,352 --> 00:13:58,284
Watch it!

111
00:14:01,256 --> 00:14:06,193
Please, excuse me, excuse me.
Excuse me...

112
00:14:07,196 --> 00:14:09,164
Come on, come on, excuse me!

113
00:14:14,136 --> 00:14:15,160
How are you?

114
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:22,076
Can you button up inside?
All the children are there!

115
00:14:23,145 --> 00:14:25,170
Francesco! Are you ready?

116
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:31,253
Oh, you're up!
Come here, try them.

117
00:14:31,253 --> 00:14:34,120
They're just the way
you like them.

118
00:14:36,158 --> 00:14:37,125
Is it good?

119
00:14:45,234 --> 00:14:49,104
- Where did you get all this?
- You gave me the money.

120
00:14:49,104 --> 00:14:51,265
You told me everything
would change.

121
00:14:52,307 --> 00:14:55,276
- When did I say that?
- Last night.

122
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,111
- Did I say that?
- Yes.

123
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:05,084
You said you told everything
and that it all would change now.

124
00:15:10,225 --> 00:15:13,160
Oh, well, let's just eat!
Let's drink!

125
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,121
We'll have everything now!

126
00:15:21,303 --> 00:15:23,168
Joy! Joy!

127
00:15:25,073 --> 00:15:26,233
Battaglia, where is he?

128
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:34,238
Will you run away again?
You already told everything!

129
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,243
- Battaglia...
- Tell her to go away!

130
00:15:38,186 --> 00:15:41,246
- I know what I'm doing!
- Battaglia!

131
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:50,097
Do you know why I'm here?
What happened to my son?

132
00:16:06,214 --> 00:16:09,047
- I've got Flush.
- Full.

133
00:16:10,118 --> 00:16:11,142
Four aces.

134
00:16:12,087 --> 00:16:14,214
You're on a wining streak,
Bartolito.

135
00:16:16,124 --> 00:16:19,093
- Mr. Bartolomé Mitre Vedia.
- Yes, it's me.

136
00:16:20,095 --> 00:16:23,231
We've come on behalf
of Lieutenant Jorge Victorica,

137
00:16:23,231 --> 00:16:25,133
whom we represent.

138
00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:28,203
Given the offense through
your newspaper "La Nación"

139
00:16:28,203 --> 00:16:31,036
he demands proper satisfaction.

140
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:34,209
According to the code of honor,
it is your choice

141
00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:36,109
of place and weapons.

142
00:16:42,284 --> 00:16:46,050
- Good afternoon.
- GOOD afternOON, Dr, VictOrica.

143
00:16:46,221 --> 00:16:49,247
- How are you?
- Good afternoon, Dr. Victorica.

144
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,253
Congratulations
on yesterday's speech.

145
00:16:54,196 --> 00:16:57,097
Excuse me, please.
I'll see you in the hall.

146
00:16:57,165 --> 00:16:58,200
My dear friend!

147
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,069
You've come from Entre Ríos
just to see me!

148
00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:04,172
How unlucky! Damn!

149
00:17:04,172 --> 00:17:07,242
We were just about the session
in the Parliament!

150
00:17:07,242 --> 00:17:10,211
What are you in need of?

151
00:17:14,149 --> 00:17:17,118
I want to know how my son died.
That's all.

152
00:17:17,185 --> 00:17:18,152
But, hey...

153
00:17:19,154 --> 00:17:22,089
Don't tell me you believe
these things!

154
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,093
Think for a while.
Let's see.

155
00:17:25,227 --> 00:17:30,198
Who is that Battaglia man?
A sailor claiming a salary.

156
00:17:30,198 --> 00:17:33,167
He's trying to raise scandal,
you know?

157
00:17:38,306 --> 00:17:41,070
La Nación is pampering him.

158
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:44,176
I asked you to get him a job.

159
00:17:47,115 --> 00:17:50,278
You referred him to your son,
Lieutenant Victorica.

160
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,055
He was only fourteen.

161
00:17:59,194 --> 00:18:03,221
All I want to know is if he died
for his country...

162
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:10,229
...or if he was killed by those
trying to escape the wreckage.

163
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,109
Attorney...

164
00:18:36,264 --> 00:18:39,028
You might wonder why I'm here.

165
00:18:39,267 --> 00:18:43,203
Don't tell me I managed to fool
the Navy's best attorney!

166
00:18:45,106 --> 00:18:48,276
I've come to visit you because
today the Admiralty

167
00:18:48,276 --> 00:18:50,278
will sign your assignment.

168
00:18:50,278 --> 00:18:54,316
Of course it is uncommon
for an old Admiral

169
00:18:54,316 --> 00:18:58,150
to tell you this in advance.

170
00:18:59,154 --> 00:19:01,179
But this is also a special case.

171
00:19:02,257 --> 00:19:04,122
You will be assigned.

172
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:11,030
But I want you to know many Admirals
will sign with clenched teeth.

173
00:19:11,199 --> 00:19:15,067
- You have my resignation.
- It's not about that.

174
00:19:15,136 --> 00:19:19,072
You will be attorney.
But let me give you some advice.

175
00:19:19,274 --> 00:19:22,243
- Take care.
- You're imposing restrictions.

176
00:19:24,145 --> 00:19:26,079
We're all restricted.

177
00:19:35,123 --> 00:19:36,055
Madam...

178
00:19:50,138 --> 00:19:51,230
Come on, come on!

179
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,214
Son of a bitch!

180
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:14,287
I didn't speak!
The journalist made everything up!

181
00:20:17,265 --> 00:20:21,258
Oh, dear God!
Pay me, pay me and I'll go!

182
00:20:22,237 --> 00:20:24,137
I'll go back to Italy!

183
00:20:48,196 --> 00:20:51,188
Gentlemen, I remind you
you are incommunicado.

184
00:20:53,301 --> 00:20:55,098
Captain Funes...

185
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:59,137
As on the Rosales,
I'm still under your command.

186
00:21:13,321 --> 00:21:15,118
Captain...

187
00:21:58,266 --> 00:22:02,168
Madam, I'm sorry I've kept
you waiting.

188
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:05,229
- Please...
- There's no need. My uncle?

189
00:22:06,274 --> 00:22:10,267
General Roca left last night
to the countryside with his family.

190
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:17,241
- My husband has been arrested.
- I know, madam.

191
00:22:18,186 --> 00:22:19,278
Your uncle does too.

192
00:22:21,156 --> 00:22:23,283
- And he left just the same?
- One or two?

193
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,254
So... he's not planning
to do anything about it.

194
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,198
I wouldn't say that, madam.

195
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:34,302
Your uncle is an old fox.

196
00:22:34,302 --> 00:22:38,136
His enemies aren't at ease
not even when he rests!

197
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:43,267
Don't be impatient.
The general knows what he's doing.

198
00:22:45,213 --> 00:22:48,080
Specially taking care
of his interests.

199
00:22:49,184 --> 00:22:51,209
Apparently my husband isn't one.

200
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,088
Enzo?

201
00:23:30,091 --> 00:23:32,082
- Yes, and you?
- Renata.

202
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:37,131
- Battaglia was arrested.
- When?

203
00:23:38,133 --> 00:23:40,192
- Yesterday.
- Why?

204
00:23:41,202 --> 00:23:43,227
Because of the Rosales thing.

205
00:23:45,106 --> 00:23:49,133
Roberto, stop the press.
I have to add something.

206
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,270
I'll tell you...

207
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:56,080
"Italian stoker Battaglia jailed".

208
00:24:05,293 --> 00:24:08,194
- Who sent you here?
- Him, Battaglia.

209
00:24:10,265 --> 00:24:13,200
Are you a relative?

210
00:24:16,171 --> 00:24:20,039
Almost.
I'm going to have a baby with him.

211
00:24:22,277 --> 00:24:24,074
That's good.

212
00:24:27,148 --> 00:24:29,116
Do you need anything?

213
00:24:32,287 --> 00:24:34,050
A relative?

214
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,283
Almost.

215
00:24:45,099 --> 00:24:48,262
- I can read!
- Take it.

216
00:24:49,304 --> 00:24:50,271
What for?

217
00:24:53,141 --> 00:24:55,132
Then you'll bring it back.

218
00:24:56,311 --> 00:24:57,243
Alright.

219
00:24:58,313 --> 00:25:00,076
- Bye.
- Bye.

220
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:09,056
Ho!

221
00:25:19,234 --> 00:25:21,269
Everybody's talking, uncle.

222
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:25,139
Everywhere I go everyone
looks at me and whisper.

223
00:25:25,139 --> 00:25:27,232
Why did they have
to reopen the case?

224
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:30,278
Calm down, Elvira.
Calm down.

225
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,113
"Calm down"?

226
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:35,241
When everyone talks about us?
Even the immigrant rats!

227
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:38,176
- Don't be a baby.
- Why, uncle?

228
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,323
Because I'm a woman
standing up for her husband?

229
00:25:42,323 --> 00:25:45,292
Come on, Elvirita.
Nothing will happen.

230
00:25:46,094 --> 00:25:47,288
Neither to you nor to Jorge.

231
00:25:48,162 --> 00:25:51,299
A few days ago you were in fits
for that duel I told you

232
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,201
we would never allow.

233
00:25:53,201 --> 00:25:57,137
And now you see La Nación
had to take its words back.

234
00:26:00,108 --> 00:26:04,067
Carry on with your wedding.
Leave politics to us.

235
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,212
Uncle...

236
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:10,142
You politicians think
you know it all.

237
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:15,112
And you can't even see
the feelings of those next to you.

238
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:19,249
- Madam, Miss Elisa looks for you.
- Which Elisa?

239
00:26:20,128 --> 00:26:22,062
Captain Funes' wife.

240
00:26:23,131 --> 00:26:27,090
- Where was your father?
- At his desk.

241
00:26:30,138 --> 00:26:32,038
- Elvira...
- Elisa...

242
00:26:34,275 --> 00:26:37,142
Let's go outside,
it's a beautiful day.

243
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:40,214
This way.
How's your daughter?

244
00:26:40,214 --> 00:26:44,173
Excuse my coming here like this
but I'm desperate.

245
00:26:45,219 --> 00:26:49,087
I was left all alone, Elvira.
I've come from my uncle's.

246
00:26:50,224 --> 00:26:53,127
- And of course he was away.
- What?

247
00:26:53,127 --> 00:26:56,255
Roca's away,
we have to think what to do.

248
00:26:57,298 --> 00:27:00,233
No, not now.
I have to go to mass.

249
00:27:01,135 --> 00:27:03,000
I'll go with you.

250
00:27:05,173 --> 00:27:06,140
No.

251
00:27:07,275 --> 00:27:10,073
I don't want them
to see us together.

252
00:27:13,081 --> 00:27:18,109
We must keep appearances.
People can be malicious.

253
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:23,179
Elisa, your husband
was the commander of the ship.

254
00:27:25,293 --> 00:27:27,124
I'm sorry.

255
00:27:38,172 --> 00:27:41,198
- Name and rank.
- Leopoldo Funes, captain.

256
00:27:41,275 --> 00:27:45,177
- Assignment.
- Captain of the corvette Rosales.

257
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:46,211
Mission.

258
00:27:47,148 --> 00:27:50,251
To form part of the fleet
sailing to Spain to participate

259
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:54,051
in the 400th. Anniversary
of the discovery of America,

260
00:27:56,157 --> 00:27:59,149
representing the Argentine government.

261
00:27:59,227 --> 00:28:01,024
Take a seat, Captain.

262
00:28:12,106 --> 00:28:18,170
- How many did you have on board?
- Seventy...

263
00:28:22,216 --> 00:28:24,207
State the facts, Captain.

264
00:28:27,088 --> 00:28:30,023
I left Buenos Aires with foul weather.

265
00:28:30,158 --> 00:28:34,062
Next day a storm broke off
and I lost sight

266
00:28:34,062 --> 00:28:36,030
of the rest of the ships.

267
00:28:39,067 --> 00:28:45,233
Captain, your words were
"I was exposed to a severe storm

268
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:49,174
and I lost contact with the rest
of the fleet".

269
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:53,178
How do you explain
not having sought shelter

270
00:28:53,247 --> 00:28:56,216
by the coast so as not
to endanger the ship?

271
00:28:56,284 --> 00:29:00,050
Because until then I deemed
there was no danger.

272
00:29:07,061 --> 00:29:10,189
By your judgment,
what was the height of the waves?

273
00:29:11,165 --> 00:29:13,133
26 feet, approximately.

274
00:29:13,234 --> 00:29:18,194
So the water coming into the ship
was concerning!

275
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:23,006
The pumping was carried out
with no problems

276
00:29:23,144 --> 00:29:25,112
until the ship went off.

277
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:29,215
The hull cracked opened
along with the boards.

278
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,245
We must have hit a reef.

279
00:29:38,292 --> 00:29:41,227
A rock or a piece of wreckage.

280
00:29:44,098 --> 00:29:46,191
The engine room was flooded.

281
00:29:47,268 --> 00:29:52,103
My ship went adrift.
I realized we had to abandon it.

282
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:02,181
How did you distribute
the crew for evacuation?

283
00:30:02,283 --> 00:30:06,151
30 crew on the first boat
and 25 on the second.

284
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,245
That's just 55 men.

285
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:13,194
What about the rest, Captain?

286
00:30:13,194 --> 00:30:16,095
I ordered Ensign Giralt
to build a raft.

287
00:30:16,164 --> 00:30:18,291
I assigned the second boat
to officers.

288
00:30:19,167 --> 00:30:21,067
I encouraged my crew.

289
00:30:22,103 --> 00:30:24,238
The spirit of my men
was excellent,

290
00:30:24,238 --> 00:30:27,208
they answered with cheers
for our country.

291
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:29,310
Everything was in perfect order.

292
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:32,211
And the rest of the crew, Captain?

293
00:30:33,181 --> 00:30:36,284
According to Admiral De Solier,
Commander of the fleet,

294
00:30:36,284 --> 00:30:38,186
there were over 100 men.

295
00:30:38,186 --> 00:30:42,179
I was the last one to leave the ship,
after all embarked.

296
00:30:44,358 --> 00:30:47,156
That's all I have to say.

297
00:31:02,276 --> 00:31:04,212
Lieutenant Victorica.

298
00:31:04,212 --> 00:31:08,148
Do you also affirm there was
an opening in the hull?

299
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:11,243
Yes, Sir.
Some plates dislodged.

300
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:19,081
I think this was consequence
of having collided two months before.

301
00:31:20,228 --> 00:31:23,095
Tell me about the raft, Lieutenant.

302
00:31:23,231 --> 00:31:26,300
When Captain Funes decided
to abandon ship

303
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:29,098
he ordered a raft to be built.

304
00:31:29,237 --> 00:31:33,196
There wasn't enough room
for the crew in the lifeboats.

305
00:31:34,175 --> 00:31:38,179
He ordered Ensign Giralt
to carry out the construction.

306
00:31:38,179 --> 00:31:41,148
- Was the raft constructed?
- Yes, Sir.

307
00:31:43,284 --> 00:31:47,152
- Tell me the size of it.
- 8 feet each side.

308
00:31:47,255 --> 00:31:52,215
- It was squared-shaped then.
- Exactly, fit for some 25 men.

309
00:31:53,261 --> 00:31:57,095
Did Captain Funes assemble
the men to inform them

310
00:31:57,164 --> 00:31:58,222
of his decision?

311
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:00,265
Yes, Sir.

312
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:04,204
What was the spirit
of the men like?

313
00:32:06,173 --> 00:32:08,164
At that moment they had panicked.

314
00:32:08,242 --> 00:32:10,210
Panicked?
Why, Lieutenant?

315
00:32:13,281 --> 00:32:15,272
They were inexperienced.

316
00:32:17,118 --> 00:32:19,109
Immigrants and peasants.

317
00:32:20,254 --> 00:32:24,125
For many of them it was
their first time on a ship.

318
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:26,184
They were scared and sea-sick.

319
00:32:29,163 --> 00:32:32,098
How was the situation dealt with?

320
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:36,137
A double ration of alcohol
was distributed.

321
00:32:36,137 --> 00:32:37,126
What else?

322
00:32:38,239 --> 00:32:42,310
The officers were delivered
guns to keep the order.

323
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:44,073
Was it kept?

324
00:32:46,113 --> 00:32:47,080
Yes, Sir.

325
00:32:48,182 --> 00:32:53,245
Although there was a critical moment
when the first boat was destroyed

326
00:32:54,255 --> 00:32:56,223
after a shock of the ocean.

327
00:32:58,192 --> 00:33:01,228
The men were distributed
between the other boats

328
00:33:01,228 --> 00:33:04,129
and the raft and it all
went back to normal.

329
00:33:05,199 --> 00:33:08,259
A few remained sea-sick
and were looked after.

330
00:33:09,203 --> 00:33:12,104
A 14-year-old,
deck hand González Casas,

331
00:33:12,239 --> 00:33:14,175
was embarked by myself.

332
00:33:14,175 --> 00:33:17,278
Are you certain that there were
no crew members on board

333
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:19,246
at the time you abandoned ship?

334
00:33:20,281 --> 00:33:24,240
Captain Funes checked the ship.
He said there was no one left.

335
00:33:25,219 --> 00:33:27,210
He was the last one to leave.

336
00:33:28,222 --> 00:33:31,157
What is your opinion
about Captain Funes?

337
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,185
Captain Funes
is an excellent officer and citizen.

338
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:44,162
What is your opinion
about Captain Funes, Lieutenant?

339
00:33:45,172 --> 00:33:49,074
Captain Funes
is an excellent officer and citizen.

340
00:33:51,145 --> 00:33:52,134
The raft, Sir?

341
00:33:55,182 --> 00:33:58,185
Well, yes, I saw it when
they started to build it

342
00:33:58,185 --> 00:34:00,121
but I didn't see it finished.

343
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:06,151
Did the crew panic because
the first lifeboat was destroyed?

344
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:12,066
No, sir, I didn't see any incident
with the sailors.

345
00:34:12,066 --> 00:34:17,271
Well, just one, when a black sailor
tried to get on the officer's boat

346
00:34:17,271 --> 00:34:21,139
but Lieutenant Victorica
prevented it.

347
00:34:24,111 --> 00:34:27,171
According to a testimony
a black sailor attempted

348
00:34:27,248 --> 00:34:32,208
to board the officer's boat
but was prevented by an officer.

349
00:34:34,088 --> 00:34:39,048
- Do you remember this incident?
- There was great confusion, sir.

350
00:34:39,326 --> 00:34:44,229
Many tried to get on that boat
and all were expelled.

351
00:34:45,132 --> 00:34:50,092
- When did it happen?
- When the first boat was destroyed.

352
00:34:52,339 --> 00:34:55,308
What was the size
and shape of the raft?

353
00:34:58,312 --> 00:35:01,213
I never saw any raft
under construction.

354
00:35:03,217 --> 00:35:06,186
I cannot recall
the shape of the raft.

355
00:35:07,254 --> 00:35:13,090
I think it was rectangular, sir.
To fit about ten men.

356
00:35:13,227 --> 00:35:17,097
So there were still men on board
when the ship was abandoned?

357
00:35:17,097 --> 00:35:17,264
Yes, sir.

358
00:35:17,264 --> 00:35:21,235
When Captain Funes abandoned ship
there were still men on board.

359
00:35:21,235 --> 00:35:25,103
- How many men were abandoned?
- No, Sir.

360
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:28,108
I cannot positively state anything.

361
00:35:28,108 --> 00:35:30,277
You cannot say how many men
were left behind?

362
00:35:30,277 --> 00:35:31,278
No, sir.

363
00:35:31,278 --> 00:35:36,181
I cannot assure that at that moment
there were still people on board.

364
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,276
It was night time.

365
00:35:41,121 --> 00:35:42,053
No, Sir.

366
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:45,258
No men were left on board.

367
00:35:52,299 --> 00:35:56,133
Ajournalist?
What journalist, sir?

368
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:00,230
I never saw a journalist.
I cannot read.

369
00:36:05,045 --> 00:36:09,083
Do you deny having made
these declarations to this paper?

370
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:12,086
I am immigrant, sir.
I have nothing.

371
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:16,182
- Who would listen to me?
- Did you or did you not?

372
00:36:17,157 --> 00:36:20,092
- I am a stoker, nothing more.
- Answer!

373
00:36:21,295 --> 00:36:25,231
No, no, sir.
I didn't say anything.

374
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:30,227
- Your name is here!
- It must be someone else.

375
00:36:32,139 --> 00:36:34,164
There are many Battaglias!

376
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:40,077
But it says Batalla there.
I was told.

377
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:19,016
Battaglia, there's nothing
to be afraid of here.

378
00:37:21,121 --> 00:37:23,089
We need the truth.

379
00:37:25,092 --> 00:37:29,085
And sooner or later
I'll find out the truth.

380
00:37:32,066 --> 00:37:38,027
It's better for you to tell me
everything you know now.

381
00:37:40,074 --> 00:37:43,134
Truth will be your best protection.

382
00:37:47,214 --> 00:37:50,081
Do you see what I mean?

383
00:37:54,288 --> 00:37:59,055
Did you make
those declarations published?

384
00:38:06,233 --> 00:38:07,200
Did you?

385
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:12,005
No.

386
00:38:14,141 --> 00:38:16,132
I never told anybody anything.

387
00:38:17,144 --> 00:38:20,170
I didn't see what happened.
I was below deck.

388
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:25,083
I then went up and threw
myself into the water.

389
00:38:31,091 --> 00:38:32,080
Get him out!

390
00:38:34,094 --> 00:38:38,155
You have previously declared
that the plates opened up.

391
00:38:40,134 --> 00:38:41,101
Yes, sir.

392
00:38:42,102 --> 00:38:44,263
And that the ship was flooded.

393
00:38:45,139 --> 00:38:49,166
At the engine room
and the rest of the compartments.

394
00:38:50,277 --> 00:38:51,244
Yes, sir.

395
00:38:53,113 --> 00:38:56,316
According to your testimony
and those of other officers

396
00:38:56,316 --> 00:39:00,980
the ship was abandoned
after a 15-hour struggle.

397
00:39:03,123 --> 00:39:07,219
- Is this correct?
- Yes, sir.

398
00:39:09,063 --> 00:39:13,200
So how do you explain
Captain Funes checked the ship

399
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,227
as you yourself assured
if it was all under water?

400
00:39:18,205 --> 00:39:20,173
Magnificent, Sir!

401
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:24,077
You are brilliant, Sir!

402
00:39:26,246 --> 00:39:28,009
Keep digging.

403
00:39:32,086 --> 00:39:33,075
Go on.

404
00:39:34,221 --> 00:39:37,054
Go to the bottom of the Rosales.

405
00:39:38,158 --> 00:39:44,198
You'll see we're not responsible
for the wreckage but those

406
00:39:44,198 --> 00:39:46,223
sitting behind great desks...

407
00:39:48,168 --> 00:39:49,226
...Full of medals.

408
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:56,310
The Rosales, like it or not, sir,
sunk because it wasn't repaired

409
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,279
after the collision
with the "Spencer" ship.

410
00:39:59,279 --> 00:40:02,271
Can't you see you're accusing
the Admiralty?

411
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:08,087
You will arrive at that conclusion
by yourself, sir.

412
00:40:08,222 --> 00:40:12,181
I wonder how you'll manage
to make them show up here.

413
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:16,058
You've also fallen into a trap.

414
00:40:17,231 --> 00:40:19,256
You may leave, Lieutenant.

415
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:27,106
Bring Captain FuneS!

416
00:40:32,212 --> 00:40:33,201
Go away.

417
00:40:33,313 --> 00:40:34,302
Go...

418
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:46,250
This will probably be useless
thanks to you, Funes.

419
00:40:47,327 --> 00:40:51,198
You have placed the Navy
on the verge of scandal!

420
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:54,190
Smeared it's past... its reputation!

421
00:40:55,135 --> 00:40:58,298
You are a coward!
Totally incompetent!

422
00:40:59,173 --> 00:41:02,040
You do not deserve
to carry that uniform!

423
00:41:02,109 --> 00:41:04,311
You should have gone down
with your ship!

424
00:41:04,311 --> 00:41:09,116
That's what you should have done
had you have a seaman's honor!

425
00:41:09,116 --> 00:41:10,242
Something of a man!

426
00:41:11,285 --> 00:41:15,187
It would have been easier
than facing all of this.

427
00:41:16,156 --> 00:41:20,092
But that's what I accepted
to save my officers.

428
00:41:20,294 --> 00:41:22,196
And I chose well!

429
00:41:22,196 --> 00:41:25,290
Thanks to me the best men
in the Navy are alive!

430
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:29,236
The Fatherland is built
with the best men!

431
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:33,240
That's what you taught me
and that's what I did!

432
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:38,177
Your conduct is immoral, Funes.
I'm going to end with you!

433
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:46,115
CiaO, ciaO.

434
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:50,314
- I've been waiting for you.
- I'm a slow reader.

435
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:54,294
- But the kid's growing fast.
- He sure is...

436
00:41:54,294 --> 00:41:57,231
Wait for me,
we'll talk afterwards.

437
00:41:57,231 --> 00:41:59,290
Battaglia... find out how he is.

438
00:42:02,135 --> 00:42:03,261
- Wait, wait...
- Press...

439
00:42:05,305 --> 00:42:08,103
Find out what they did to him.

440
00:43:10,304 --> 00:43:16,209
Gentlemen, we shall commence
the military trial to judge

441
00:43:16,209 --> 00:43:21,148
the officers involved in the loss
and abandonment in high sea

442
00:43:21,148 --> 00:43:23,139
of the corvette Rosales.

443
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:31,146
Captain Lowry, as prosecutor
you can open the proceedings.

444
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:38,298
Mr. President,
members of the Supreme Court

445
00:43:38,298 --> 00:43:41,062
of the Argentine Navy.

446
00:43:42,269 --> 00:43:48,308
I require attention and imagination
to follow the course of events

447
00:43:48,308 --> 00:43:55,148
which led to the tragic loss
of our Navy's ship,

448
00:43:55,148 --> 00:43:58,276
the corvette Rosales.

449
00:44:01,121 --> 00:44:07,094
The interrogatory research
carried out by this prosecution

450
00:44:07,094 --> 00:44:10,130
have come
to the following conclusion,

451
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:12,257
which chronologically are:

452
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:18,271
On the early morning of July 8
a severe storm struck the Rosales

453
00:44:18,271 --> 00:44:22,139
250 miles off Cabo Polonio.

454
00:44:24,311 --> 00:44:25,243
Hold on...

455
00:44:29,282 --> 00:44:30,249
Sir!

456
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:34,254
What's wrong with the boilers?
Lieutenant!

457
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:36,323
Why aren't the engines running?

458
00:44:36,323 --> 00:44:40,259
The engine-room is flooded!
We can't stop the water on deck!

459
00:44:48,301 --> 00:44:50,064
Hold on!

460
00:44:55,208 --> 00:44:57,142
Ensign, help here!

461
00:45:00,213 --> 00:45:03,205
Keep pumping!
Come on, keep pumping!

462
00:45:16,129 --> 00:45:19,030
Shut the door of the coal cellar!

463
00:45:41,088 --> 00:45:44,148
Look after the other ones,
these men are no good!

464
00:45:44,257 --> 00:45:47,055
We need men to keep the water out!

465
00:45:50,163 --> 00:45:52,188
The boilers are dying out!

466
00:45:53,166 --> 00:45:56,192
Keep them burning!
Keep them burning!

467
00:45:57,237 --> 00:46:01,105
Keep pumping, keep pumping!
Faster, keep pumping!

468
00:46:01,241 --> 00:46:04,211
Water's coming through
the coal cellar!

469
00:46:04,211 --> 00:46:08,079
- Keep pumping, faster!
- More men for the pumping!

470
00:46:08,248 --> 00:46:11,284
- Come on, there's water coming in!
- Keep pumping!

471
00:46:11,284 --> 00:46:14,082
Keep the pressure, keep the fire!

472
00:46:14,187 --> 00:46:19,147
Keep pumping, faster!
More men for the pumping!

473
00:46:22,162 --> 00:46:23,186
Keep the fire!

474
00:46:24,264 --> 00:46:28,200
- There'S water iN the cOal cellar!
- Keep the fire!

475
00:46:34,241 --> 00:46:39,144
Keep pumping! Keep pumping!
Sir, the boilers have died out!

476
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,105
We need more men for pumping!

477
00:46:42,249 --> 00:46:46,185
The boilers are dying out!
Water is coming in!

478
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:52,080
- Keep the fire on!
- Pump, pump!

479
00:46:52,292 --> 00:46:55,261
- We need more men!
- Faster!

480
00:46:57,330 --> 00:46:59,195
Give me, give me!

481
00:47:02,135 --> 00:47:03,193
Let me go by!

482
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:12,101
Fasters!
Secure that cannon!

483
00:47:39,139 --> 00:47:43,098
Sir, the ship is across its course.
We're going adrift.

484
00:47:58,325 --> 00:48:00,088
Give them rhum.

485
00:48:05,031 --> 00:48:07,124
What about the rest of the crew?

486
00:48:10,203 --> 00:48:12,194
- Double ration.
- Yes, sir.

487
00:48:14,107 --> 00:48:16,041
Go.
You too.

488
00:48:22,115 --> 00:48:25,016
Tell the officers
we'll abandon the ship.

489
00:48:26,186 --> 00:48:30,213
- Without anyone else knowing.
- Shall I deliver the guns, Sir?

490
00:48:33,159 --> 00:48:34,148
Yes.

491
00:48:47,274 --> 00:48:48,263
Follow me.

492
00:48:52,212 --> 00:48:54,180
Deliver the guns, corporal.

493
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:58,116
You take care of the food.

494
00:48:59,219 --> 00:49:02,222
You go on deck,
Lieutenant Irizar.

495
00:49:02,222 --> 00:49:04,090
Yes.

496
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:07,060
You're in charge
of the officer's boat.

497
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,049
Very well, Sir.

498
00:49:11,131 --> 00:49:12,063
Let's go.

499
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:37,057
- Give them double ration.
- Double, sir?

500
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:40,026
- Lieutenant Victorica's orders.
- Understood.

501
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,111
Hold this, sailor.

502
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:07,279
Bring all the lifebelts.

503
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:14,092
Carpenter, that plank.
Come on with that plank.

504
00:50:15,228 --> 00:50:18,288
Sir, the boats won't be enough
for all the crew.

505
00:50:20,133 --> 00:50:22,168
Sir, you must do something.

506
00:50:22,168 --> 00:50:25,105
- Go back to your post, Ensign.
- But sir!

507
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:28,074
- What do you want me do?
- Let me make a raft!

508
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:39,218
Did the raft ever exist?

509
00:50:41,154 --> 00:50:44,257
As I see it, sir,
prosecutor Lowry has tried

510
00:50:44,257 --> 00:50:50,127
to impress the court stressing
a supposed incompetence of yours.

511
00:50:56,169 --> 00:50:57,158
I can see.

512
00:50:59,172 --> 00:51:02,073
But what he wants to prove
is that you ordered

513
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:05,278
to abandon ship in haste,
passing over the facts

514
00:51:05,278 --> 00:51:07,280
that the plates had broken!

515
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,145
They need a scapegoat.

516
00:51:11,184 --> 00:51:14,153
Someone to take responsibility
for everything.

517
00:51:16,122 --> 00:51:17,180
Maybe I should.

518
00:51:18,091 --> 00:51:20,252
Sir, I want you to know
I admire you.

519
00:51:21,194 --> 00:51:25,153
I don't think I could have
a bigger honor than defending you.

520
00:51:52,125 --> 00:51:55,322
Gentlemen, we open today's session.

521
00:51:57,263 --> 00:52:00,130
Captain Lowry
will continue his address.

522
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:09,175
Gentlemen, I have kept
from the beginning

523
00:52:09,175 --> 00:52:12,278
three essential points
in which I shall base my trial

524
00:52:12,278 --> 00:52:16,182
against the officers responsible
for the sinking of the Rosales.

525
00:52:16,182 --> 00:52:19,252
Yesterday I demonstrated
that the incompetence

526
00:52:19,252 --> 00:52:24,189
of Captain Funes was the main cause
for the wreckage.

527
00:52:25,291 --> 00:52:28,283
Today I will demonstrate
the grievous behavior

528
00:52:29,095 --> 00:52:31,222
of the officers towards the crew.

529
00:52:32,265 --> 00:52:39,103
Before the prosecutor continues
remove the officers from the hall.

530
00:52:39,339 --> 00:52:42,137
They must remain, Mr. President.

531
00:52:42,342 --> 00:52:47,211
They have to be guaranteed
of the right to a defense in trial.

532
00:52:48,181 --> 00:52:51,284
I remind you that the authority
rests with the court

533
00:52:51,284 --> 00:52:53,149
on which you depend.

534
00:52:54,153 --> 00:52:58,112
The session is adjourned.
We shall have an intermission.

535
00:53:19,212 --> 00:53:20,201
Captain Lawry...

536
00:53:25,184 --> 00:53:31,054
Captain, I just had a private talk
with the president of the court

537
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:36,296
and there is great concern
over the charges you propose

538
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:39,231
against the officers of the Rosales.

539
00:53:40,199 --> 00:53:43,202
We would like to know
what those charges are.

540
00:53:43,202 --> 00:53:47,070
Admiral, I'm no bureaucrat
nor a newcomer.

541
00:53:48,174 --> 00:53:52,178
If you don't trust my integrity
you have, as always,

542
00:53:52,178 --> 00:53:54,305
my resignation at your disposal.

543
00:54:03,089 --> 00:54:05,258
These are the comments
that have reached me

544
00:54:05,258 --> 00:54:08,250
and I want to know the truth
about the trial.

545
00:54:09,128 --> 00:54:11,264
Let me introduce
Ensign Giralt's mother.

546
00:54:11,264 --> 00:54:15,068
Pleased to meet you, madam.
I know your story, go on.

547
00:54:15,068 --> 00:54:16,202
What is happening now?

548
00:54:16,202 --> 00:54:18,170
Lowry has just resigned.

549
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:24,310
- Nothing will happen again.
- Let's hope not, madam.

550
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:25,277
Have faith.

551
00:54:29,215 --> 00:54:32,241
Renata, they want
to stop the whole thing.

552
00:54:33,152 --> 00:54:35,321
How?
With everything Battaglia said?

553
00:54:35,321 --> 00:54:38,154
He denied everything he declared.

554
00:54:43,296 --> 00:54:44,228
Renata!

555
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:50,101
But...

556
00:54:56,242 --> 00:54:59,145
Admiral, is it true Lowry resigned?

557
00:54:59,145 --> 00:55:01,170
Was it prepared
by the Minister of Navy?

558
00:55:01,247 --> 00:55:04,150
Does this mean
we go back to square one?

559
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:09,110
Where did you get such a thing?
No one has asked anything.

560
00:55:09,188 --> 00:55:13,226
The trial will go on.
Please, no comments.

561
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:14,158
Sir!

562
00:55:15,128 --> 00:55:18,097
Please, no questions.
I won't answer.

563
00:55:18,197 --> 00:55:21,200
I will only talk to the court.
Excuse me.

564
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,134
- We need you to say it!
- Sir!

565
00:55:25,138 --> 00:55:29,142
It is with a calm conscience
and a clear mind,

566
00:55:29,142 --> 00:55:34,045
that I shall continue examining
the facts with which I shall prove

567
00:55:34,113 --> 00:55:42,088
the responsibility of the officers
who abandoned the crew

568
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:44,113
of the Rosales to its fate.

569
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:53,197
Come on!

570
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:58,093
Come on, we have to finish it!
Everybody up!

571
00:56:40,213 --> 00:56:42,238
Get more wood, those there!
Come on!

572
00:56:45,218 --> 00:56:46,242
The nails as well!

573
00:56:48,187 --> 00:56:49,176
Man overboard!

574
00:56:55,294 --> 00:56:59,060
- Take this to the officer's boat.
- Understood, sir.

575
00:57:02,034 --> 00:57:04,127
Get the chosen men together.

576
00:57:18,117 --> 00:57:22,019
Go to the officer's boat.
Get on deck, on deck!

577
00:57:24,123 --> 00:57:27,115
Corporal, quick, you too!
Get on deck, quick!

578
00:57:28,127 --> 00:57:29,185
No one else!

579
00:57:32,064 --> 00:57:33,088
Come on!

580
00:57:38,137 --> 00:57:40,037
We must abandon ship!

581
00:57:42,275 --> 00:57:45,176
Keep discipline
and follow your orders!

582
00:57:46,312 --> 00:57:49,145
- Long live the Fatherland!
- Long live!

583
00:57:55,087 --> 00:57:56,247
And my God help us.

584
00:57:57,190 --> 00:58:00,159
The captain has ordered
to abandon ship, sir.

585
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:07,193
Francesco,
don't leave me, Francesco!

586
00:58:08,267 --> 00:58:09,234
Francesco!

587
00:58:18,211 --> 00:58:20,145
Come on, quick!
Come on!

588
00:58:23,149 --> 00:58:25,251
You two,
lower the officer's boat, quick!

589
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:26,183
Yes, sir!

590
00:58:28,054 --> 00:58:30,249
Come on, come on.
Get the food on the boat.

591
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,260
Quick! Come on!
Lower the boat!

592
00:58:46,172 --> 00:58:49,141
Come on, quick!
The first boat, quick!

593
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:54,113
- Get on!
- To the stern dinghy.

594
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:55,080
Get on!

595
00:59:02,088 --> 00:59:05,114
God damn it!
I told you the dinghy!

596
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:08,991
Board the first boat!

597
00:59:17,169 --> 00:59:20,036
Mate, get to the stern dinghy!

598
00:59:21,207 --> 00:59:24,110
To the stern dinghy!
Follow your orders!

599
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:27,170
They're deceiving us!
They want to leave us here!

600
00:59:29,048 --> 00:59:30,015
Get ready!

601
00:59:31,183 --> 00:59:32,150
Aim!

602
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:34,084
Fire!

603
00:59:48,234 --> 00:59:51,270
Let me get in!
Don't leave me, please!

604
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:52,168
Coward!

605
01:00:14,293 --> 01:00:17,091
Lock him up in the bow!

606
01:00:44,290 --> 01:00:47,282
Ensign Giralt,
get to the officer's boat.

607
01:00:48,127 --> 01:00:50,186
Ensign! On the boat, Ensign!

608
01:00:53,332 --> 01:00:54,264
Captain!

609
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:59,170
Get on the boat now!

610
01:01:10,082 --> 01:01:12,243
Follow your orders!
Get on the boat!

611
01:01:13,085 --> 01:01:15,178
- I can't, Sir.
- Get on, Ensign.

612
01:01:15,287 --> 01:01:19,189
I can't, Sir.
The ship can still be saved.

613
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:25,331
AS a cOnsequence then

I demand that he,
Captain Leopoldo Funes,

625
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:15,081
be sentenced to the death penalty.

626
01:02:15,081 --> 01:02:21,220
For being guilty of complicity
in these crimes I demand

627
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:25,324
that Lieutenant Jorge Victorica
be sentenced

628
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:31,092
to a dishonorable discharge
and to have 10 years in prison.

629
01:02:32,298 --> 01:02:38,270
For being equally guilty
of complicity I demand that the rest

630
01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:44,143
of the officers and subordinates
who survived the wreckage

631
01:02:44,143 --> 01:02:50,139
be sentenced to separate them
from their ranks with no exception.

632
01:02:51,217 --> 01:02:55,210
There are no soldiers in Navy
who can bring dishonor to it!

633
01:03:01,227 --> 01:03:05,095
The truth will impose itself,
Captain Lowry!

634
01:03:07,066 --> 01:03:13,027
You have adopted declarations
funded only in mean statements

635
01:03:13,239 --> 01:03:17,141
which have been supported
by some newspapers

636
01:03:17,243 --> 01:03:21,147
that for political interests
have made serious events

637
01:03:21,147 --> 01:03:25,217
on the wreckage believable
which aren't in harmony

638
01:03:25,217 --> 01:03:28,118
with the elevated Argentine race.

639
01:03:31,123 --> 01:03:35,287
You, Captain Lowry,
are a high-sounding man

640
01:03:36,095 --> 01:03:40,132
and in your frenzy have even
entangled the penalties you asked

641
01:03:40,132 --> 01:03:44,170
pretending to apply to wreckage
the penalties applied to a troop

642
01:03:44,170 --> 01:03:45,262
in land in wartime!

643
01:03:48,307 --> 01:03:55,179
Furthermore your declarations
fall into ridiculous contradictions.

644
01:03:58,184 --> 01:04:01,253
For instance here,
when you state the ship

645
01:04:01,253 --> 01:04:05,291
was abandoned in a haste
at the same time that the rescue

646
01:04:05,291 --> 01:04:08,192
operations for the crew
started too late!

647
01:04:09,261 --> 01:04:11,024
How can that be?

648
01:04:15,301 --> 01:04:19,305
Gentleman, we can't make
the officers responsible and victims

649
01:04:19,305 --> 01:04:25,073
of the irresponsibility
of the institution

650
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:30,104
when it is the institution who
should take care of its officers!

651
01:04:33,152 --> 01:04:36,087
We must no allow wrath
to carry us away,

652
01:04:36,322 --> 01:04:41,227
but we must never assign vessels
for missions to which

653
01:04:41,227 --> 01:04:47,166
they haven't been constructed
and that there never again

654
01:04:47,166 --> 01:04:53,071
should be an inexperienced crew
who know nothing of the sea!

655
01:04:57,209 --> 01:05:04,116
Mr. President, I ask that all officers
of the Rosales be returned

656
01:05:04,116 --> 01:05:07,210
to freedom and to our Fatherland.

657
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:16,218
It was wrong to appoint Lowry
knowing it would end like this.

658
01:05:17,062 --> 01:05:20,122
My dear Benjamin,
you know there was no other way.

659
01:05:20,266 --> 01:05:25,101
We needed someone prestigious
to face Mitre's campaign.

660
01:05:25,304 --> 01:05:27,172
That is the sheer truth.

661
01:05:27,172 --> 01:05:29,163
If it hadn't been
for this political game

662
01:05:29,241 --> 01:05:31,143
nothing would have happened.

663
01:05:31,143 --> 01:05:34,079
We would only have heroes
whom everyone would revere.

664
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:35,171
And they are heroes!

665
01:05:36,282 --> 01:05:37,249
Bartolito!

666
01:05:38,284 --> 01:05:41,276
Our political affrays
are always family affrays.

667
01:05:43,122 --> 01:05:46,191
- Yes; I think I can win.
- Good evening, good evening.

668
01:05:46,191 --> 01:05:48,125
That is absolutely true.

669
01:05:48,327 --> 01:05:52,161
Mitre and Roca embraced
and nothing happened here.

670
01:05:54,133 --> 01:05:55,225
Take a seat, please.

671
01:05:56,335 --> 01:06:01,068
Of course we went adrift
with the Rosales.

672
01:06:02,274 --> 01:06:06,040
We can't allow the institution
to be smeared.

673
01:06:06,111 --> 01:06:09,137
Who would think that?
Beheading the admirals?

674
01:06:13,285 --> 01:06:17,189
- What is the name of this school?
- Impressionism.

675
01:06:17,189 --> 01:06:18,247
It's from Paris.

676
01:06:20,125 --> 01:06:22,094
It could be interesting!

677
01:06:22,094 --> 01:06:24,196
I think you,
as minister of war,

678
01:06:24,196 --> 01:06:28,189
should support Lowry
making Funes the sole responsible.

679
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:31,133
Yes, but Funes is Roca's nephew.

680
01:06:31,270 --> 01:06:34,239
Levalle,
if Roca's nephew is sentenced

681
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:38,143
even Roca will be cleared up
of the accusations against

682
01:06:38,143 --> 01:06:39,244
the Armed Forces.

683
01:06:39,244 --> 01:06:42,281
He's a politician,
he knows what's best for him.

684
01:06:42,281 --> 01:06:46,185
But father, if they accuse Funes
they'll accuse Jorge as well.

685
01:06:46,185 --> 01:06:48,187
You can't do that!
He's my fiancé!

686
01:06:48,187 --> 01:06:51,088
Elvira, we military have to obey.

687
01:06:52,224 --> 01:06:55,260
Our dear Jorge,
as second-in-command,

688
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:57,160
merely obeyed orders.

689
01:06:58,130 --> 01:07:00,132
Gentlemen,
it seems that we don't know

690
01:07:00,132 --> 01:07:01,156
what's going on.

691
01:07:02,167 --> 01:07:06,071
If Funes is sentenced
the defense will bring up again

692
01:07:06,071 --> 01:07:09,063
the problem with the plates.

693
01:07:10,175 --> 01:07:13,144
And that will fall on us,
the admirals.

694
01:07:15,047 --> 01:07:17,140
And isn't that
what's supposed to be?

695
01:07:20,285 --> 01:07:22,082
I'm childish.

696
01:07:27,259 --> 01:07:30,194
Good night.
Until tomorrow.

697
01:07:32,097 --> 01:07:34,156
- Good night.
- Good night, thanks.

698
01:08:36,128 --> 01:08:39,120
Why do you say
nothing will happen in the end?

699
01:08:45,137 --> 01:08:50,074
Because it's us.
And we're not America yet.

700
01:08:51,143 --> 01:08:52,269
Then why are we here?

701
01:08:53,145 --> 01:08:56,114
- Why don't we all go back to Italy?
- Renata...

702
01:08:57,316 --> 01:09:00,149
What about the people
who died here?

703
01:09:00,252 --> 01:09:04,052
And who live and suffer here?
And work here?

704
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:08,991
Are we going to leave them?

705
01:09:11,196 --> 01:09:14,233
- Battaglia left us.
- That doesn't change anything.

706
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:15,222
Nothing!

707
01:09:18,036 --> 01:09:21,130
We will have to struggle
all of us together

708
01:09:23,041 --> 01:09:26,044
to make it the America
we dreamed as children.

709
01:09:26,044 --> 01:09:27,212
- Struggle...
- Struggle.

710
01:09:27,212 --> 01:09:30,079
But how?
We don't have anything!

711
01:09:35,153 --> 01:09:36,211
I've got this.

712
01:09:38,190 --> 01:09:41,159
And you've got that.

713
01:09:54,206 --> 01:09:56,106
I'm surprised, Captain.

714
01:09:57,075 --> 01:10:02,035
There is nothing abnormal
on the decision of the court.

715
01:10:03,215 --> 01:10:07,117
The court is resigning
to its responsibilities.

716
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:11,189
The court has given its verdict.

717
01:10:11,189 --> 01:10:15,160
Now the only instance lies
with the president of the Nation

718
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:20,257
as chief of the armed forces.
It's constitutional, captain.

719
01:10:21,166 --> 01:10:23,101
It's a washing of hands.

720
01:10:23,101 --> 01:10:25,237
This trial is military,
not political.

721
01:10:25,237 --> 01:10:27,137
You're wrong, captain.

722
01:10:27,339 --> 01:10:31,070
These are hard times, crisis.

723
01:10:32,210 --> 01:10:41,209
We can't, we mustn't add another.
We have made a scandal!

724
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:45,157
The scandal wasn't brought
by the trial, admiral!

725
01:10:45,157 --> 01:10:50,195
It's the fact and the use of them
by some politicians!

726
01:10:50,195 --> 01:10:56,225
We're a young nation, Lowry.
As such we have our defects.

727
01:10:57,202 --> 01:11:02,107
But we're also a virile,
courageous race.

728
01:11:02,107 --> 01:11:04,075
We have a bright future.

729
01:11:05,210 --> 01:11:11,046
We have bright progressive men
handling our economy.

730
01:11:11,283 --> 01:11:14,184
There are real patriots
in the armed forces!

731
01:11:15,153 --> 01:11:16,211
You know that, Lowry.

732
01:11:17,089 --> 01:11:21,126
All this Rosales business
is nothing but regrettable,

733
01:11:21,126 --> 01:11:22,252
a bad twist of fate.

734
01:11:23,328 --> 01:11:28,061
Open your eyes, Lowry.
The nation's at stake here.

735
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:32,168
That's why we must forget.
Forget!

736
01:11:33,305 --> 01:11:35,239
Time heals all wounds.

737
01:11:37,209 --> 01:11:43,170
Anyways, this will never
happen again.

738
01:11:45,283 --> 01:11:47,080
Are you sure?

739
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:53,283
Corruption is like gangrene.
Once it starts it can't be stopped.

740
01:11:56,194 --> 01:11:59,322
Considering the lack
of formal evidence

741
01:12:00,065 --> 01:12:05,103
supporting the accusations
stated by the prosecution

742
01:12:05,103 --> 01:12:13,311
this Court, by its own right,
definitely acquits each

743
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:23,118
and every officer who survived
the corvette Rosales.

744
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:29,261
Officers, as a consequence
of this verdict,

745
01:12:29,261 --> 01:12:33,231
you can proclaim to the world
that you're worth

746
01:12:33,231 --> 01:12:37,135
of walking the decks of our ships
under the glorious shadow

747
01:12:37,135 --> 01:12:39,126
of our national flag.

748
01:13:13,138 --> 01:13:16,039
They have declared them innocent!

749
01:13:23,081 --> 01:13:26,244
Is there another way out?
Is there another way out?

750
01:13:27,085 --> 01:13:28,109
Isn't there?

751
01:13:52,310 --> 01:13:56,248
PRESIDENT DR. LUIS SAENZ PEÑA
APPROVED THE VERDICT

752
01:13:56,248 --> 01:13:59,117
OF THE WAR COUNCIL.
MARCH 25, 1894
