THE SWAMP

2
00:02:20,987 --> 00:02:22,784
Thank you, God,
for giving me Isabel.

3
00:02:22,856 --> 00:02:25,518
Thank you, God,
for giving me Isabel.

4
00:02:41,441 --> 00:02:43,773
Who's Joaquin with in the mountains?

5
00:04:26,913 --> 00:04:27,971
Vero.

6
00:04:30,383 --> 00:04:31,543
Vero.

7
00:04:39,893 --> 00:04:42,726
- Move over.
- What's wrong?

8
00:04:54,074 --> 00:04:56,736
I don't want anyone but Isabel.

9
00:05:00,246 --> 00:05:02,305
Mom's firing her, Momi.

10
00:05:03,316 --> 00:05:04,647
Why?

11
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:09,380
She says sheets and towels
are disappearing.

12
00:05:09,556 --> 00:05:11,490
She's firing her.

13
00:05:14,995 --> 00:05:16,724
It's a lie.

14
00:05:50,664 --> 00:05:51,824
Mechita.

15
00:05:52,499 --> 00:05:54,433
Get up. It's gonna rain.

16
00:05:55,435 --> 00:05:59,269
Okay, I'm getting up. I'm fine.

17
00:06:01,441 --> 00:06:04,103
Momi!!

18
00:06:04,177 --> 00:06:05,610
Mecha fell down.

19
00:06:07,447 --> 00:06:10,473
I don't want to see blood, Momi.

20
00:06:23,697 --> 00:06:25,358
I'll get up myself.

21
00:06:27,701 --> 00:06:29,828
Put her in the chair.

22
00:06:29,903 --> 00:06:31,165
Let me go.

23
00:06:32,772 --> 00:06:34,535
Don't make a fuss.

24
00:06:36,376 --> 00:06:38,241
Stop it.

25
00:06:51,191 --> 00:06:53,659
So here are all the towels.

26
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,253
Momi, bring the car around.

27
00:06:59,933 --> 00:07:01,423
Let me go!

28
00:07:07,774 --> 00:07:11,039
She's crushing the hydrangeas.
Stop her.

29
00:07:13,046 --> 00:07:14,707
Let me go, Isabel!

30
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:28,054
Tell the gringo doctor she's coming.
Your mom's losing a lot of blood.

31
00:07:28,895 --> 00:07:32,331
Momi, go get my dress with buttons.

32
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:35,566
This savage wants to take me
to the Swamp like this.

33
00:07:51,251 --> 00:07:54,584
We've gotta take her to the hospital.
She's losing a lot of blood.

34
00:08:05,765 --> 00:08:08,256
Go see what Isabel took.

35
00:08:21,114 --> 00:08:24,606
Don't put the towels in hot water.
They'll stain.

36
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,610
What's going on?

37
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:34,453
It's all dirty.
I can't wear this.

38
00:08:35,128 --> 00:08:38,461
- Don't make me.
- It's raining. Get in the car.

39
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:44,129
It will do the land good.

40
00:08:45,305 --> 00:08:47,205
Come on.

41
00:08:47,273 --> 00:08:49,366
- No, Gregorio.
- Vero, I'll go.

42
00:08:49,876 --> 00:08:52,037
Do as I say, Veronica.

43
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:55,341
- Let me go, please.
- Don't let him drive.

44
00:08:55,415 --> 00:08:56,905
What if I'm stopped?

45
00:08:56,983 --> 00:08:59,816
Say you forgot your license
and that it's serious.

46
00:08:59,886 --> 00:09:01,547
It is serious.

47
00:09:18,338 --> 00:09:20,306
Isabel, the gate!

48
00:09:20,373 --> 00:09:22,204
Isa, the gate.

49
00:10:03,216 --> 00:10:04,706
It's the age.

50
00:10:04,784 --> 00:10:07,446
My mom-in-law
was always like that.

51
00:10:08,121 --> 00:10:09,918
She's not blind.

52
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:14,389
She should travel,
but she doesn't want to.

53
00:10:15,061 --> 00:10:18,394
- There are so many cultures.
- I'm going to the fair.

54
00:10:18,464 --> 00:10:20,932
Isn't it raining?

55
00:10:22,101 --> 00:10:23,762
So many-

56
00:10:23,836 --> 00:10:25,565
Not that far, but -

57
00:10:25,638 --> 00:10:27,970
Look at the hare in the sink.

58
00:10:29,842 --> 00:10:34,006
No. Rafael has so much work,
we're stuck here all year.

59
00:10:35,515 --> 00:10:37,107
Where?

60
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,445
Bolivia?

61
00:10:39,118 --> 00:10:40,779
Who'd you go with?

62
00:10:41,287 --> 00:10:43,312
Alone, with the kids?

63
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:44,879
That's daring.

64
00:10:46,225 --> 00:10:48,056
Colorful costumes?

65
00:10:49,562 --> 00:10:51,052
Very colorful.

66
00:10:52,231 --> 00:10:54,756
Too gaudy.
Nothing you could wear.

67
00:10:55,868 --> 00:10:58,928
Really gorgeous.
But not to wear.

68
00:11:00,106 --> 00:11:02,165
Stop that!

69
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:05,574
And were you held up at customs?

70
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,344
My mother-in-law should go,
but she's blind.

71
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:15,183
- They soaked us.
- We didn't want to play.

72
00:11:19,826 --> 00:11:22,158
Girls, please. Hang on.

73
00:11:22,228 --> 00:11:24,162
What is it? I'm talking.

74
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:27,961
- Tell them off, Mom.
- Carnival begins, and so do the problems.

75
00:11:29,569 --> 00:11:31,366
I'll call you later.

76
00:11:31,437 --> 00:11:33,905
What happened, Luchi?
Let's see.

77
00:11:33,973 --> 00:11:35,634
You cut yourself.

78
00:11:40,546 --> 00:11:42,776
Girls, I can't think straight.

79
00:11:42,849 --> 00:11:45,818
Agustina, come and help.

80
00:11:46,986 --> 00:11:50,820
Take him to the bathroom.
Wash it carefully.

81
00:11:52,158 --> 00:11:54,854
We'll pour water on it
to stop the bleeding.

82
00:11:54,927 --> 00:11:57,452
- It's okay.
- Rafael?

83
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:01,193
Can you take Luchi to see the gringo?
He cut himself again.

84
00:12:02,035 --> 00:12:04,560
No, nothing serious.

85
00:12:04,637 --> 00:12:06,696
Tali, this won't defrost.

86
00:12:06,773 --> 00:12:11,540
Get some chicken.
The beef was frozen solid.

87
00:12:11,611 --> 00:12:13,169
Okay. Bye.

88
00:12:19,685 --> 00:12:21,346
Careful. It's hot.

89
00:12:24,857 --> 00:12:29,351
DoctorJohn, the surgeon

90
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:33,229
We must operate today

91
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:37,531
In the emergency ward

92
00:12:37,603 --> 00:12:40,868
A girl of your age

93
00:12:41,374 --> 00:12:45,435
She is 2 1 years old

94
00:12:45,511 --> 00:12:48,674
You are one year older

95
00:12:49,849 --> 00:12:51,510
Who's this girl?

96
00:12:51,584 --> 00:12:55,520
Veronica. But at home
they call her Verito.

97
00:12:56,189 --> 00:12:59,215
She lives four days with her mom
and three with her dad.

98
00:12:59,725 --> 00:13:03,889
Her dad lives in an apartment.
Her mom kept the house.

99
00:13:03,963 --> 00:13:06,431
- That's nice. Poor thing.
- Other way around.

100
00:13:06,499 --> 00:13:09,297
My mom has the apartment.
My dad has the house.

101
00:13:09,368 --> 00:13:10,858
Same thing.

102
00:13:12,205 --> 00:13:13,695
Hello?

103
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:16,072
Agustina, it's for you.

104
00:13:16,142 --> 00:13:17,700
Ayoung man.

105
00:13:20,913 --> 00:13:22,346
Hello?

106
00:13:22,415 --> 00:13:24,576
It's my dad. Yes, Dad.

107
00:13:25,418 --> 00:13:27,386
They're leaving now.

108
00:13:27,453 --> 00:13:29,114
Okay. Bye.

109
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,780
Are you all right?

110
00:13:38,998 --> 00:13:40,989
Are you crying?

111
00:13:43,002 --> 00:13:45,061
It sounded like it.

112
00:13:49,075 --> 00:13:52,067
I don't know if I can go.
There's a lot of work.

113
00:13:54,814 --> 00:13:56,475
It's raining there, isn't it?

114
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,311
I can hear it.

115
00:14:02,155 --> 00:14:03,645
- I don't know.
- Who is it?

116
00:14:03,723 --> 00:14:05,384
- Vero.
- Vero who?

117
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:06,948
My sister.

118
00:14:08,628 --> 00:14:10,027
Hello.

119
00:14:10,096 --> 00:14:11,757
Yes, I can hear you.

120
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,969
How many stitches did they give her?

121
00:14:18,971 --> 00:14:20,802
Did you have to give blood?

122
00:14:20,873 --> 00:14:22,636
What happened?

123
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,539
-Jose.
- Is Mom all right?

124
00:14:25,378 --> 00:14:28,779
- Are they both at the clinic?
-Jose, what happened?

125
00:14:28,848 --> 00:14:31,339
My mom had an accident,
but she's all right.

126
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:32,645
What?

127
00:14:32,718 --> 00:14:35,209
Tali, you know Mecha?

128
00:14:35,288 --> 00:14:37,586
Yes. She's almost a cousin.

129
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,422
Poor Mecha.

130
00:14:40,493 --> 00:14:42,290
Is she badly hurt?

131
00:14:42,795 --> 00:14:44,456
A bit drunk.

132
00:14:45,631 --> 00:14:48,896
Poor Mecha.
I don't know what's wrong.

133
00:14:48,968 --> 00:14:51,630
This isn't anything new,
but she'd stopped.

134
00:14:52,138 --> 00:14:53,628
Obviously not.

135
00:14:53,706 --> 00:14:55,196
- What happened?
- Nothing.

136
00:14:55,274 --> 00:15:00,268
Rosa, tell the gringo to hurry.
My house is in chaos.

137
00:15:00,346 --> 00:15:01,870
Yes, Tali.

138
00:15:02,548 --> 00:15:04,038
- What happened, Mom?
- What happened?

139
00:15:04,116 --> 00:15:07,813
When I tell you to listen,
you have to listen.

140
00:15:07,887 --> 00:15:11,448
If Mecha had listened to her mom,
she'd never have married that man.

141
00:15:11,524 --> 00:15:14,391
- I always listen.
- I know.

142
00:15:26,772 --> 00:15:30,503
It's back on, thank God. No.

143
00:15:30,576 --> 00:15:33,067
- On top of everything else.
- Damn rain.

144
00:15:33,145 --> 00:15:35,238
- Want to stay over?
- Yes.

145
00:15:35,748 --> 00:15:37,579
Who'll stay with Mecha?

146
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:40,744
- Momi's coming.
- All right, then.

147
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,811
Tali, has he had a tetanus shot?

148
00:15:42,888 --> 00:15:46,221
Damn! I left the vaccine at home.

149
00:15:46,292 --> 00:15:48,783
Did we vaccinate you?

150
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:50,522
- Did we?
- Yes, we did.

151
00:15:50,596 --> 00:15:52,928
We did. Are you sure?

152
00:15:52,999 --> 00:15:55,490
- Bye, Gringo. Thanks.
- Bye.

153
00:15:56,335 --> 00:15:59,361
- Will he need stitches?
- Yes, but don't worry.

154
00:15:59,872 --> 00:16:01,203
Luchi.

155
00:16:01,274 --> 00:16:02,764
What's in your mouth?

156
00:16:03,442 --> 00:16:06,172
It's a new tooth coming in.

157
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:08,340
Close it.

158
00:16:09,515 --> 00:16:12,450
- May I see Mecha?
- No.

159
00:16:12,518 --> 00:16:16,010
We had to pump her stomach
to give her tranquilizers.

160
00:16:16,522 --> 00:16:18,319
- She must be asleep.
- Poor Mecha.

161
00:16:18,391 --> 00:16:20,359
- Better tomorrow.
- Tomorrow, then.

162
00:16:20,426 --> 00:16:23,418
- Gregorio was no better.
- Was he hurt too?

163
00:16:23,496 --> 00:16:26,488
No,just drunk.
Couldn't even give blood.

164
00:16:26,565 --> 00:16:28,897
Good God! What a family.

165
00:16:29,802 --> 00:16:33,499
I've been here two hours
and haven't seen anything.

166
00:16:33,572 --> 00:16:35,233
But that's the owner's home.

167
00:16:35,308 --> 00:16:36,969
Nilda.

168
00:16:38,878 --> 00:16:40,038
Look, there it is.

169
00:16:40,112 --> 00:16:42,603
I can't see a thing.

170
00:16:43,282 --> 00:16:48,117
- Did you see the Virgin?
- Well, not me. My daughter.

171
00:16:48,187 --> 00:16:50,519
- Is she in?
- Yes, I'll call her.

172
00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:54,047
Miriam, they want to ask you
some questions.

173
00:16:54,126 --> 00:16:56,458
- You saw the Virgin?
- Yes, ma'am.

174
00:16:56,529 --> 00:16:59,692
- How?
- I was hanging out the wash,

175
00:16:59,765 --> 00:17:02,598
and I saw a light on the water tank.

176
00:17:03,102 --> 00:17:06,435
I looked up and saw the Virgin.

177
00:17:07,273 --> 00:17:09,673
Had you seen her before?

178
00:17:09,742 --> 00:17:11,403
Just this once.

179
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,911
Close up or far away?

180
00:17:15,981 --> 00:17:17,778
Medium.

181
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:21,809
I was in the yard
and saw her on the tank.

182
00:17:21,887 --> 00:17:23,878
Anyone want to comment?

183
00:17:23,956 --> 00:17:27,448
I came because my niece saw her.

184
00:17:27,526 --> 00:17:29,585
But I can't.

185
00:17:30,096 --> 00:17:33,031
Mom says you have to answer.

186
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:36,692
- Do you pray or sing?
- We pray.

187
00:17:36,769 --> 00:17:37,701
Hello.

188
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,863
Hi, dirty Momi.

189
00:17:40,873 --> 00:17:42,534
Yes, I know what happened.

190
00:17:43,376 --> 00:17:45,537
Vero called me. Is she back?

191
00:17:45,611 --> 00:17:49,103
Remember, it's long distance.

192
00:17:49,181 --> 00:17:51,342
- Shall I open up?
- No, that's worse.

193
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:52,748
Hello.

194
00:17:52,818 --> 00:17:56,481
Tell Vero I'll be there tomorrow.

195
00:17:57,523 --> 00:18:00,014
Tell Vero I'll be there tomorrow.

196
00:18:01,026 --> 00:18:03,494
Turn the TV down. I can't hear.

197
00:18:03,996 --> 00:18:05,657
Who's with you?

198
00:18:06,332 --> 00:18:07,765
Put Isabel on.

199
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:11,693
He didn't believe.

200
00:18:11,771 --> 00:18:14,103
- He had to see it to believe.
- Hi,Jose.

201
00:18:14,173 --> 00:18:16,403
There were lots of people.

202
00:18:16,475 --> 00:18:19,638
- You saw the Virgin?
- Yes, with Pablo.

203
00:18:19,712 --> 00:18:24,240
He was ecstatic.

204
00:18:24,316 --> 00:18:27,649
- Where are you going?
- Your brother wants me to go.

205
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,982
Jose, don't be bossy!

206
00:18:31,056 --> 00:18:33,923
Isa, he says he's sorry.

207
00:18:33,993 --> 00:18:35,654
Isa, come back.

208
00:18:39,899 --> 00:18:41,491
And Mom?

209
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:44,400
She's spending the night at the clinic.

210
00:18:51,243 --> 00:18:52,904
Is she okay?

211
00:18:58,417 --> 00:19:01,409
She wants a nightgown,

212
00:19:01,921 --> 00:19:07,587
and she wants you to take her
her dress with buttons

213
00:19:08,093 --> 00:19:09,754
and a towel.

214
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,020
And Vero?

215
00:19:13,699 --> 00:19:16,634
She's sleeping over at Tali's.

216
00:19:18,137 --> 00:19:19,798
How can I go?

217
00:19:21,474 --> 00:19:23,305
Take the car.

218
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,505
I don't have a license.

219
00:19:27,847 --> 00:19:31,544
I told you, you should get one.

220
00:19:33,552 --> 00:19:35,952
Dad, I'm 1 5.

221
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:38,080
Damn it, Momi.

222
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:45,253
The road's deserted.
If you're stopped, say I sent you.

223
00:19:45,331 --> 00:19:47,822
Tell Isabel to go with you.

224
00:19:52,304 --> 00:19:55,967
- Look up there.
- It's not there.

225
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,531
Over there, maybe.

226
00:20:02,214 --> 00:20:04,876
Look how these are.

227
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,441
I'll take that T-shirt just the same.

228
00:20:07,953 --> 00:20:10,080
How long are you going for?

229
00:20:10,756 --> 00:20:12,246
A few days.

230
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,365
Is it serious?
We have so much work this week.

231
00:20:28,207 --> 00:20:30,641
If you're not back in a few days,

232
00:20:31,644 --> 00:20:33,805
maybe I should go too.

233
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,075
I could talk to Mecha.

234
00:20:37,149 --> 00:20:40,676
They never deliver the peppers on time.

235
00:20:40,753 --> 00:20:44,985
There's no need.
I can talk to Dad and fix everything,

236
00:20:45,057 --> 00:20:47,025
so you don't have to go.

237
00:20:47,092 --> 00:20:49,026
Gregorio! Fat chance.

238
00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:57,362
Maybe, it's too much for two days.

239
00:21:05,544 --> 00:21:08,707
Go sleep in your room.
It's too hot.

240
00:21:31,904 --> 00:21:34,236
I'll be right back.

241
00:22:04,837 --> 00:22:06,327
Would this fitJose?

242
00:22:10,943 --> 00:22:12,877
What size is he?

243
00:22:16,315 --> 00:22:19,648
- Perro's outside.
- Call him so he can try it on.

244
00:22:28,994 --> 00:22:30,655
Here's Perro.

245
00:22:32,698 --> 00:22:35,360
- What are you doing here?
- Working with my cousin.

246
00:22:35,434 --> 00:22:37,994
Try this on. It's forJose.

247
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:41,005
- He's bigger than me.
- I know. It's just to check.

248
00:23:06,331 --> 00:23:07,491
Medium.

249
00:23:09,768 --> 00:23:11,133
Fine.

250
00:23:15,941 --> 00:23:17,067
Bye.

251
00:23:23,082 --> 00:23:25,380
What size are the gray trousers?

252
00:23:31,557 --> 00:23:33,218
Whose turn is it?

253
00:23:42,534 --> 00:23:45,025
- I can't open it.
- Let's see.

254
00:23:50,876 --> 00:23:53,640
It's locked. Can't be opened.

255
00:23:55,314 --> 00:23:56,804
Let's go back to town

256
00:23:56,882 --> 00:23:58,873
and call them to open it.

257
00:23:59,384 --> 00:24:01,875
Sure they invited you?

258
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:08,890
Things work the same everywhere.

259
00:24:18,737 --> 00:24:23,071
Rafael, we could put
a pool in the back.

260
00:24:23,142 --> 00:24:26,134
-Just for cooling off.
- Of course.

261
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:28,042
Your house is too small.

262
00:24:30,415 --> 00:24:31,882
Step on the clutch.

263
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:34,544
There. That's it.

264
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,316
Poor Mecha. Where will it end?

265
00:24:38,657 --> 00:24:42,093
Gregorio's always been
such a ladies' man.

266
00:24:42,161 --> 00:24:45,494
- Slow down. That's it.
- She knew about Mercedes,

267
00:24:45,564 --> 00:24:47,555
but she turned a blind eye.

268
00:24:47,633 --> 00:24:49,828
Not in front of the children.

269
00:24:49,902 --> 00:24:52,735
Yes, because otherwise
it'll be worse later.

270
00:24:52,805 --> 00:24:54,636
History repeats itself.

271
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:58,234
I always thought Mecha knew
he and Mercedes -

272
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:01,802
Gregorio's married to Mecha
and he's going out with another girl?

273
00:25:05,484 --> 00:25:07,714
Before. Now -

274
00:25:07,786 --> 00:25:10,186
- Apparently.
- Which Mercedes?

275
00:25:10,255 --> 00:25:12,120
Careful. Watch the road.

276
00:25:12,191 --> 00:25:15,354
Mercedes, the one
who works with Jose in Buenos Aires.

277
00:25:15,427 --> 00:25:18,521
- Weren't you all close friends?
- That's just it.

278
00:25:18,597 --> 00:25:20,963
Turn here and stop slowly.

279
00:25:21,633 --> 00:25:23,464
That's it.

280
00:25:25,304 --> 00:25:27,431
What's he doing standing there?

281
00:25:27,506 --> 00:25:29,565
Nothing, of course.

282
00:25:30,075 --> 00:25:31,838
He's just standing there.

283
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,571
What's the problem?

284
00:25:36,748 --> 00:25:40,081
That guy was never any use.

285
00:25:42,421 --> 00:25:44,719
I guess I've got to get out.

286
00:25:45,657 --> 00:25:47,648
- How are you?
- Fine. You?

287
00:25:48,994 --> 00:25:50,985
Hello, Rafael. How are you?

288
00:25:57,836 --> 00:26:00,430
- I brought the kids.
- How are you, Gregorio?

289
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,271
So they can use the pool.

290
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:07,101
- Lovely day.
- Hope it stays this way.

291
00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:10,342
- I'll pick them up this evening.
- Gregorio dyed his hair.

292
00:26:22,527 --> 00:26:24,688
Isa.

293
00:26:28,567 --> 00:26:30,432
We came to see.

294
00:26:30,936 --> 00:26:33,427
They say that the Virgin appeared

295
00:26:33,505 --> 00:26:35,336
on that water tank.

296
00:26:35,407 --> 00:26:39,639
But we didn't see anything.

297
00:26:39,711 --> 00:26:43,841
But it appears to be
here in this house,

298
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:46,248
by the small tank

299
00:26:46,318 --> 00:26:48,650
on the small ledge

300
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,384
where the cement tank sits.

301
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:56,393
They say they saw her
right there in the center.

302
00:26:56,461 --> 00:26:58,929
That's where she stands.

303
00:26:59,765 --> 00:27:01,255
We'll stay a while.

304
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:05,793
We'll wait all night,
until 3:00 in the morning.

305
00:27:06,305 --> 00:27:09,638
We're very anxious
to see the Virgin.

306
00:27:13,578 --> 00:27:15,910
Look at my cleavage.

307
00:27:16,581 --> 00:27:18,412
What a mess.

308
00:27:42,107 --> 00:27:43,768
Where are you going?

309
00:27:44,609 --> 00:27:46,270
To see my sister.

310
00:27:49,247 --> 00:27:50,737
And that dress?

311
00:28:01,293 --> 00:28:03,454
Going to carnival?

312
00:28:09,801 --> 00:28:13,293
How can you, when Mom's ill?

313
00:28:16,641 --> 00:28:20,133
Momi, why don't you go to the pool?
It's hot.

314
00:28:21,813 --> 00:28:23,747
Party animal!

315
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:02,013
Momi, dirty Momi.

316
00:29:30,215 --> 00:29:32,206
I'll get you, Momi.

317
00:29:32,284 --> 00:29:33,376
Come here.

318
00:29:33,452 --> 00:29:34,680
No!

319
00:29:57,676 --> 00:30:02,841
Her cousin found a dog
in the street.

320
00:30:02,914 --> 00:30:04,848
A tiny short-haired one.

321
00:30:06,118 --> 00:30:09,087
It looked abandoned,
so she took it home.

322
00:30:09,588 --> 00:30:13,080
She left it with her cats and fed it.

323
00:30:13,158 --> 00:30:16,093
The next day,
she gets up to feed it again.

324
00:30:16,628 --> 00:30:20,962
The dog is covered in blood,
and the cats are gone.

325
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,633
She takes the dog,
washes and dries it off,

326
00:30:24,703 --> 00:30:27,604
and takes it to the nearest vet.

327
00:30:28,106 --> 00:30:29,801
She tells the vet,

328
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:34,744
""Doctor, I think this dog ate my cats.''

329
00:30:35,914 --> 00:30:38,348
""Put it on the bed.''

330
00:30:38,416 --> 00:30:43,149
The vet turns and takes an ax
hanging on the wall

331
00:30:43,822 --> 00:30:45,847
and cuts the dog in half.

332
00:30:48,193 --> 00:30:53,324
The woman gets up close and sees
it has loads of teeth, two rows.

333
00:30:54,699 --> 00:30:56,189
The vet says,

334
00:30:56,701 --> 00:30:58,328
""That's not a dog, ma'am.

335
00:30:59,004 --> 00:31:00,938
It's an African rat.''

336
00:31:09,981 --> 00:31:11,949
What are you taking?

337
00:31:31,136 --> 00:31:32,797
What's in your hand?

338
00:31:38,977 --> 00:31:41,309
I didn't steal it.
I just put it there.

339
00:31:42,314 --> 00:31:44,475
I didn't steal it, Isa.

340
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,861
Come here.

341
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:06,860
Why don't you take a bath?

342
00:32:06,938 --> 00:32:09,270
You haven't bathed in four days.

343
00:32:10,108 --> 00:32:13,771
And that pool's filthy.
You can't swim in it.

344
00:32:13,845 --> 00:32:16,507
You'll catch something nasty.

345
00:32:33,698 --> 00:32:35,529
Here, put this on.

346
00:32:40,372 --> 00:32:43,102
- It doesn't match.
- Yes, it does.

347
00:32:43,174 --> 00:32:47,440
- Not stripes and flowers.
- Yes, Momi. Go on.

348
00:33:42,967 --> 00:33:45,993
When Joaquin goes to the mountains,
I'm frightened for his other eye.

349
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:53,841
Go get the kids
from the mountains.

350
00:33:53,912 --> 00:33:57,245
If they're not ready when Tali comes,
she'll stay and chat for hours.

351
00:35:09,554 --> 00:35:11,385
- Get out of there, Luchi.
- Luciano!

352
00:35:11,456 --> 00:35:13,788
Out of the way.

353
00:35:26,404 --> 00:35:28,565
These priests are very organized.

354
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:32,039
They make such a mess.

355
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:36,809
I got a list of stuff
the kids need for school.

356
00:35:36,881 --> 00:35:39,714
They even need nylon thread.

357
00:35:39,784 --> 00:35:40,773
I wonder.

358
00:35:40,852 --> 00:35:43,753
- What can they learn with that?
- Nothing.

359
00:35:44,422 --> 00:35:46,253
- Want a drink?
- No.

360
00:35:46,324 --> 00:35:49,487
Something cool, with ice.

361
00:35:51,162 --> 00:35:54,325
Okay, something cool.

362
00:35:54,399 --> 00:35:56,333
- Some ice with -
- Mamina.

363
00:35:57,001 --> 00:35:58,832
Mamina!

364
00:36:02,006 --> 00:36:04,839
- Yes, ma'am.
- Get some cool drinks.

365
00:36:04,909 --> 00:36:07,503
Glasses, ice and some wine.

366
00:36:11,449 --> 00:36:14,111
Teresa went shopping in Bolivia.

367
00:36:14,185 --> 00:36:17,780
She went over,
and for two pesos she got everything,

368
00:36:17,856 --> 00:36:20,256
from gym shoes to pencils.

369
00:36:20,325 --> 00:36:24,159
Tali, why don't we take a little trip?

370
00:36:24,229 --> 00:36:26,322
To Bolivia, the two of us.

371
00:36:28,566 --> 00:36:31,296
- To shop.
- Yes, why not?

372
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:34,361
Teresa can suggest a hotel.

373
00:36:34,439 --> 00:36:35,929
She got everything.

374
00:36:36,007 --> 00:36:39,499
- From pencils to gym shoes.
- It's worth it.

375
00:36:39,577 --> 00:36:42,410
There's never enough money with kids.

376
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,780
And there's Joaquin's operation too.

377
00:36:46,851 --> 00:36:48,785
That's right.

378
00:36:48,853 --> 00:36:51,686
You know Joaquin. Nothing troubles him.

379
00:36:52,357 --> 00:36:54,951
But this year,
he'll start going dancing.

380
00:36:55,026 --> 00:36:57,392
Pour me a bit.

381
00:36:57,462 --> 00:36:58,451
What's wrong?

382
00:36:58,530 --> 00:36:59,428
Nothing.

383
00:36:59,497 --> 00:37:01,863
- And the parties.
- Oh, yes.

384
00:37:02,534 --> 00:37:04,661
His eye will be a problem.

385
00:37:04,736 --> 00:37:06,397
What did the gringo say?

386
00:37:07,238 --> 00:37:09,263
The gringo said,

387
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:14,334
he'd need surgery
two years after the accident.

388
00:37:15,847 --> 00:37:18,338
It's almost four years now.

389
00:37:20,018 --> 00:37:22,680
Yes, Mom was still alive.

390
00:37:23,521 --> 00:37:26,547
The gringo says it'll look perfect.

391
00:37:26,624 --> 00:37:29,286
But he has to take out his eye

392
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,191
and put in an artificial one

393
00:37:31,262 --> 00:37:35,596
to hide the cavity.

394
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:39,603
- Amazing.
- He hates the glass eye.

395
00:37:39,671 --> 00:37:42,572
- He says they'll call him One Eye.
- No, they won't.

396
00:37:45,076 --> 00:37:47,408
On Thursday,
I'm taking Luchi to the dentist.

397
00:37:47,478 --> 00:37:52,142
He's got a tooth growing
in his palate.

398
00:37:54,485 --> 00:38:00,321
- This girl's prettier every day.
- Her hairs all knotted.

399
00:38:00,391 --> 00:38:04,225
It's fine, like silk.
It's beautiful.

400
00:38:06,564 --> 00:38:09,897
Tali wants to go to Bolivia
this weekend.

401
00:38:10,735 --> 00:38:15,729
- We want to go and buy things for school.
- Already?

402
00:38:15,807 --> 00:38:19,607
- The kids are in the pool.
- Fine.

403
00:38:19,677 --> 00:38:21,838
Can't they stay a few more days?

404
00:38:21,913 --> 00:38:23,904
It's fine by me, sweetheart.

405
00:38:23,982 --> 00:38:26,382
Yes, let's turn the lights on.

406
00:38:27,051 --> 00:38:30,543
The problem is Rafael hates
not having the kids around.

407
00:38:30,622 --> 00:38:34,285
- He has no one to talk to.
- But we'll be back soon.

408
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:36,657
Why not come visit us
so your mom can rest?

409
00:38:36,728 --> 00:38:38,218
I hardly hear them.

410
00:38:38,296 --> 00:38:42,289
- How would you? You're in bed all day.
- Shut up, dirty savage!

411
00:38:42,867 --> 00:38:46,166
Tali says we're going shopping in Bolivia.

412
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:50,239
We could ask Rafael for the car, right?

413
00:38:50,308 --> 00:38:52,242
Don't worry.
We'll find something.

414
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:56,740
It's Jose.

415
00:38:57,248 --> 00:39:00,411
- What a handsome son, Mecha.
- Unlike his dad.

416
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:06,614
- Did you see the Virgin?
- I haven't had time to go.

417
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:08,786
Teresa went.

418
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,522
She said it was incredible.

419
00:39:11,596 --> 00:39:14,929
She was transformed.
She phoned me in tears.

420
00:39:14,999 --> 00:39:19,993
""You have to see it
to understand, Tali,'' she said.

421
00:39:20,071 --> 00:39:24,064
- Teresa likes being everywhere.
- Yes, she does.

422
00:39:24,142 --> 00:39:27,339
She went at the beginning
and saw her very clearly.

423
00:39:27,845 --> 00:39:31,872
It was packed,
but Teresa pushed through

424
00:39:32,383 --> 00:39:38,219
and slowly made her way
right up to the house

425
00:39:38,289 --> 00:39:41,019
and saw her on the tank.

426
00:39:41,092 --> 00:39:44,721
The Virgin of Carmen,

427
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:49,094
with scapular and robe
just like in the image.

428
00:39:49,167 --> 00:39:51,931
- You know Dr. Mauro's wife?
- Yes.

429
00:39:52,003 --> 00:39:54,631
She saw Our Lady of Mercy

430
00:39:55,139 --> 00:39:58,336
with Jesus and the guardian angels.

431
00:39:58,409 --> 00:40:00,206
And she's Jewish.

432
00:40:00,278 --> 00:40:05,341
It must be true.
Jews don't go around seeing things.

433
00:40:05,416 --> 00:40:07,316
We each see what we can.

434
00:40:07,385 --> 00:40:12,550
I heard of another apparition
in a blue robe

435
00:40:13,224 --> 00:40:15,715
with golden rays
coming from her hands.

436
00:40:17,895 --> 00:40:20,056
What a clown!

437
00:40:30,641 --> 00:40:31,665
That's right, dance!

438
00:41:14,685 --> 00:41:17,381
Come on. Let's go.

439
00:41:17,889 --> 00:41:19,550
- How lovely.
- Am I staying?

440
00:41:19,624 --> 00:41:22,957
Yes, sweetie.
But Luchi, you come along.

441
00:41:23,027 --> 00:41:26,053
The dentist has to see
that extra tooth of yours.

442
00:41:28,065 --> 00:41:30,056
Where are your clothes?

443
00:41:32,069 --> 00:41:34,401
- Come on, Luchito.
- Vacation's ending.

444
00:41:34,472 --> 00:41:38,602
But when you grow up
with nice teeth, you'll thank me.

445
00:41:38,676 --> 00:41:40,166
- Bye, Martin.
- Let's see your teeth.

446
00:41:40,244 --> 00:41:43,873
No, another time.
Come on. Are you wet?

447
00:41:43,948 --> 00:41:47,440
Don't show your father.
He'll start fussing.

448
00:41:47,518 --> 00:41:49,918
Jose, help me.

449
00:41:49,987 --> 00:41:51,648
I'll change him in the car.

450
00:41:51,722 --> 00:41:53,212
Okay. Bye.

451
00:41:55,293 --> 00:41:57,090
What a heavy kid.

452
00:41:57,762 --> 00:41:59,992
Don't forget anything.

453
00:42:04,135 --> 00:42:06,296
What's wrong?

454
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:09,100
I thought we'd agreed
the kids wouldn't stay.

455
00:42:09,173 --> 00:42:12,301
- So why did they?
- It'll be okay.

456
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:16,803
- We'll pick them up tomorrow.
- They'll be okay. Don't scare me.

457
00:42:16,881 --> 00:42:18,872
That house is a disaster.

458
00:42:19,884 --> 00:42:21,579
You know whose fault it is?

459
00:42:21,652 --> 00:42:24,985
Your cousin's.
She should have thrown him out.

460
00:42:25,056 --> 00:42:26,546
Poor Mecha.

461
00:42:27,391 --> 00:42:29,655
She'll end up like her mother,

462
00:42:29,727 --> 00:42:32,195
who went to bed one day
and never got up till she died

463
00:42:32,263 --> 00:42:35,130
1 5 or 20 years later.

464
00:42:38,469 --> 00:42:41,302
We might go to Bolivia
next weekend with Mecha.

465
00:42:41,372 --> 00:42:44,739
School things are cheaper there.

466
00:42:45,243 --> 00:42:47,973
- I can't go.
- No, we're going alone.

467
00:42:48,045 --> 00:42:49,808
With the kids.

468
00:42:50,481 --> 00:42:53,848
- When I go hunting with Martin,
- Why not?

469
00:42:53,918 --> 00:42:58,685
- It's always no!
- he won't lend me his rifle.

470
00:43:00,691 --> 00:43:04,149
He'll lend it to you in time.
You're still little.

471
00:43:04,428 --> 00:43:06,020
What do we need?

472
00:43:07,298 --> 00:43:11,860
Luchi, I told you not to get wet.
Now look.

473
00:43:11,936 --> 00:43:14,564
Do we need papers?
Careful, Mariana.

474
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:17,836
Do we need papers
to cross the border?

475
00:43:18,376 --> 00:43:20,367
Don't you have them?

476
00:43:21,479 --> 00:43:23,470
What papers do we need?

477
00:43:26,284 --> 00:43:29,276
I'm sick of these natives
hammering all night,

478
00:43:29,353 --> 00:43:31,344
never letting anyone sleep.

479
00:43:36,794 --> 00:43:39,627
It's not a good time for a trip.

480
00:43:40,298 --> 00:43:42,960
It's too dangerous for two women.

481
00:43:43,034 --> 00:43:46,526
Teresa went and nothing happened.

482
00:43:46,604 --> 00:43:49,630
Mecha's a drunk
and all stitched up.

483
00:43:50,308 --> 00:43:52,367
So? Nothing'll happen.

484
00:43:53,544 --> 00:43:55,705
It's two or three days at most.

485
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:59,113
Why go so far
when you can buy it all here?

486
00:43:59,951 --> 00:44:02,852
- It's cheaper.
- No, it's more expensive.

487
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,581
Want more?

488
00:44:04,655 --> 00:44:05,815
Here.

489
00:44:06,757 --> 00:44:07,724
Mom.

490
00:44:08,392 --> 00:44:09,723
How -

491
00:44:09,794 --> 00:44:12,957
Do African rats exist?

492
00:47:04,602 --> 00:47:07,435
Leave the light on, Dad.

493
00:47:10,774 --> 00:47:13,140
There's a huge rat.

494
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:14,700
It's okay.

495
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,991
How revolting.

496
00:48:10,334 --> 00:48:11,824
Let me see.

497
00:48:14,138 --> 00:48:15,799
Go on.

498
00:48:24,982 --> 00:48:26,506
It's all bloody.

499
00:48:35,693 --> 00:48:36,216
Agus -

500
00:48:37,394 --> 00:48:38,554
What?

501
00:48:42,533 --> 00:48:43,659
What?

502
00:48:50,007 --> 00:48:51,975
We won't move you.

503
00:48:57,781 --> 00:48:59,339
Go to sleep.

504
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:03,450
His clothes are all dirty.

505
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,612
- What did they do?
- They took an X-ray.

506
00:50:05,683 --> 00:50:08,015
Now we have to wait for it to grow.

507
00:50:08,285 --> 00:50:10,310
What did they do to your mouth?

508
00:50:10,387 --> 00:50:11,945
I hate that noise!

509
00:50:12,022 --> 00:50:13,683
Look at the X-ray.

510
00:50:16,527 --> 00:50:19,360
Let me see. Open wide.

511
00:50:29,206 --> 00:50:31,140
Are the kids coming back today?

512
00:50:31,208 --> 00:50:33,142
I'll go get them when they call.

513
00:50:33,977 --> 00:50:35,945
I don't like them being there.

514
00:50:36,013 --> 00:50:38,504
How many times do I have to say it?

515
00:50:43,821 --> 00:50:45,652
That's killing me.

516
00:50:48,492 --> 00:50:50,483
- They'll be home this weekend?
- Yes.

517
00:50:50,561 --> 00:50:53,689
There's a pool there.
They get bored in the house.

518
00:50:55,199 --> 00:50:58,225
I'll buy a pool for the yard.

519
00:50:58,302 --> 00:51:00,236
Your house is too small.

520
00:51:00,304 --> 00:51:02,238
Stop putting that in your mouth.

521
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:04,765
Take that eraser out.

522
00:51:07,845 --> 00:51:09,335
Let's go.

523
00:51:14,385 --> 00:51:15,443
Hello.

524
00:51:17,354 --> 00:51:19,379
- You going to the dam?
- Yes.

525
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:25,391
They don't know about last night.

526
00:51:26,063 --> 00:51:27,894
They want to go to the dam.

527
00:51:29,233 --> 00:51:30,928
Let's go.

528
00:51:56,727 --> 00:51:59,628
What a pig you turned out to be.

529
00:52:02,966 --> 00:52:06,026
Someone answer the phone!

530
00:52:06,703 --> 00:52:09,536
Answer the phone!

531
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:14,776
Same old story.

532
00:52:20,451 --> 00:52:22,282
It rings and rings.

533
00:52:25,088 --> 00:52:27,079
Who is it?

534
00:52:27,157 --> 00:52:30,354
Who?
The phone, Mamina.

535
00:52:31,695 --> 00:52:34,994
Mercedes who?
Mercedes, how are you?

536
00:52:35,065 --> 00:52:39,399
These Indians never answer the phone.

537
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:41,734
No, don't worry.

538
00:52:41,805 --> 00:52:45,070
I'm fine. It was just a little scare.

539
00:52:45,576 --> 00:52:47,771
My blood pressure dropped.

540
00:52:48,445 --> 00:52:50,106
I don't know.

541
00:52:50,614 --> 00:52:52,605
What? Jose.

542
00:52:52,683 --> 00:52:54,173
Wait a minute.

543
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:59,079
Just a second.Jose!

544
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:09,963
He went partying.
Now he's at the dam, I guess.

545
00:53:11,301 --> 00:53:12,268
Yes.

546
00:53:13,504 --> 00:53:16,735
He must be out.
I'll tell him to call you.

547
00:53:20,611 --> 00:53:21,873
Really?

548
00:53:22,546 --> 00:53:24,446
When are you coming?

549
00:53:24,515 --> 00:53:25,846
Mamina.

550
00:53:27,351 --> 00:53:29,342
Get me some ice.

551
00:53:29,853 --> 00:53:31,514
When are you coming?

552
00:53:32,689 --> 00:53:34,520
Fine.

553
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:36,752
You can get a little rest too.

554
00:53:38,495 --> 00:53:39,484
Okay.

555
00:53:40,564 --> 00:53:42,589
Okay. Bye, Mercedes.

556
00:53:57,681 --> 00:53:59,342
Ah, you were here after all.

557
00:54:04,855 --> 00:54:06,379
I don't have a swimsuit.

558
00:54:29,146 --> 00:54:30,272
There!

559
00:55:38,215 --> 00:55:40,479
One, two, three, four...

560
00:55:46,156 --> 00:55:48,181
1 5, 1 6, 1 7...

561
00:55:55,532 --> 00:55:58,126
...25, 26.

562
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:33,492
Now it will grow straight.

563
00:56:35,238 --> 00:56:41,734
The dog next door barks and jumps
against the wall. He might break it.

564
00:56:41,812 --> 00:56:42,836
Who?

565
00:56:42,913 --> 00:56:46,246
- The dog next door.
- Break the wall?

566
00:56:46,316 --> 00:56:49,251
It can't. The wall's thick.

567
00:56:49,319 --> 00:56:50,980
I think it's real big.

568
00:56:51,822 --> 00:56:53,312
- The dog?
- Yes.

569
00:57:10,006 --> 00:57:13,203
Luciano, you're dead!
Drop dead!

570
00:57:35,565 --> 00:57:37,294
Get up.

571
00:57:38,468 --> 00:57:40,663
Pass me the hammer.

572
00:57:45,342 --> 00:57:46,900
Look at me.

573
00:57:46,977 --> 00:57:48,467
What's in your mouth?

574
00:57:48,678 --> 00:57:51,169
You hiding something? Open up.

575
00:57:51,248 --> 00:57:54,877
- Lots of teeth are coming in.
- Where? It's only one.

576
00:57:54,951 --> 00:57:56,612
Open up.

577
00:57:57,954 --> 00:57:59,285
Breathe.

578
00:57:59,356 --> 00:58:01,517
- Don't do that.
- It's a dog-rat.

579
00:58:01,591 --> 00:58:03,491
Get down from there!

580
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,790
You're scaring your brother.

581
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:13,235
Careful.
Now go play somewhere else.

582
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:17,767
I said you're not allowed
to get on the ladder.

583
00:58:19,776 --> 00:58:21,903
Luchi, come and help me.

584
00:58:22,412 --> 00:58:24,243
Let's move it here.

585
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:04,150
Joaquin, your fish.

586
00:59:04,221 --> 00:59:05,711
Thanks.

587
00:59:07,824 --> 00:59:11,021
- You gonna cook them?
- What, this shit?

588
00:59:11,094 --> 00:59:14,257
It's all mud.
Indians eat any shit.

589
00:59:25,775 --> 00:59:27,402
Summer getting you down?

590
00:59:27,544 --> 00:59:31,947

601
01:00:20,363 --> 01:00:22,957
Ask Tali to let you stay longer.

602
01:00:23,033 --> 01:00:25,831
- Till the weekend.
- Yes.

603
01:00:25,902 --> 01:00:28,063
It smells like fish in here.

604
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:35,070
It's awful!

605
01:00:41,251 --> 01:00:42,912
Go get some soda,Joaquin.

606
01:00:42,986 --> 01:00:45,147
- It's your turn.
- You go.

607
01:00:45,221 --> 01:00:48,349
- Did you see a doctor?
- It's nothing.

608
01:00:48,425 --> 01:00:51,394
""It's nothing,'' and then one of you
shows up one day without an eye!

609
01:00:56,132 --> 01:00:57,463
Joaca.

610
01:00:58,802 --> 01:01:00,770
Eat properly.

611
01:01:02,605 --> 01:01:04,664
Don't be a pig,Joaca.

612
01:01:10,447 --> 01:01:12,779
Did you call Mercedes?

613
01:01:14,284 --> 01:01:17,048
Did you call her,Jose?

614
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:18,417
What?

615
01:01:18,488 --> 01:01:20,547
Did you call Mercedes?

616
01:01:20,623 --> 01:01:21,647
No.

617
01:01:21,725 --> 01:01:23,215
She called today.

618
01:01:24,327 --> 01:01:28,058
Needed some information
about customs.

619
01:01:33,236 --> 01:01:35,101
She's coming for a few days.

620
01:01:39,275 --> 01:01:41,937
I guess she'll stay here.

621
01:01:42,612 --> 01:01:45,809
I'll stay in bed till she leaves.
I can't stand her.

622
01:01:45,882 --> 01:01:48,373
Yes, she's unbearable,

623
01:01:48,451 --> 01:01:51,352
but she sells peppers,
unlike other people.

624
01:01:55,191 --> 01:01:59,651
- Did you have fun at the pool?
- The pool's been filthy for years.

625
01:01:59,729 --> 01:02:01,287
- Oh, that's right.
- Your hair's filthy.

626
01:02:01,364 --> 01:02:06,324
The filter doesn't work,
the pump doesn't work-

627
01:02:06,403 --> 01:02:07,927
nothing works.

628
01:02:08,338 --> 01:02:09,999
Leave that.

629
01:02:19,549 --> 01:02:21,949
-Joaca, eat properly.
- Go on.

630
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,280
What is it?

631
01:02:25,355 --> 01:02:27,823
- Fish stew.
- It's good.

632
01:02:30,627 --> 01:02:32,322
It is, but...

633
01:02:32,829 --> 01:02:35,161
go light on the peppers
for me for a while.

634
01:02:40,703 --> 01:02:43,672
Isabel, bring me some peaches, please.

635
01:03:09,399 --> 01:03:11,367
Hello,Jose.

636
01:03:16,739 --> 01:03:18,832
Hi, Mercedes. It's Jose.

637
01:03:20,977 --> 01:03:23,002
I'm at home. I'll call you later.

638
01:03:41,431 --> 01:03:43,092
Mechita.

639
01:03:44,267 --> 01:03:46,428
Go get a cool drink.

640
01:04:14,631 --> 01:04:16,656
Get off, Vero.

641
01:04:23,139 --> 01:04:24,868
Is Mercedes coming?

642
01:04:25,875 --> 01:04:27,536
I think so.

643
01:04:29,212 --> 01:04:30,372
You love her?

644
01:04:34,817 --> 01:04:36,785
Go to your room.

645
01:04:37,453 --> 01:04:39,421
Out!

646
01:04:53,002 --> 01:04:55,470
Here, have a little more.

647
01:04:59,309 --> 01:05:01,436
Look, Gregorio.

648
01:05:02,378 --> 01:05:06,747
Tomorrow Isabel will take
your things to the back room.

649
01:05:07,850 --> 01:05:10,876
I'd like you to move there.

650
01:05:10,954 --> 01:05:14,947
- Mecha, what about the kids?
- Starting tonight.

651
01:05:15,024 --> 01:05:18,687
- What will the kids say?
- And another thing.

652
01:05:18,761 --> 01:05:21,821
Stop dying your hair.
It's ruining the sheets.

653
01:05:21,898 --> 01:05:24,492
Are you doing that for carnival?

654
01:05:44,887 --> 01:05:46,684
Careful with the dogs!

655
01:05:47,924 --> 01:05:49,789
Let them go.

656
01:05:56,633 --> 01:05:58,897
Let it go, bloody Indian!

657
01:06:01,904 --> 01:06:05,431
- Don't pat them. It makes them tame.
- It doesn't.

658
01:06:05,508 --> 01:06:08,966
- I said don't pat them.
- One's stuck up there.

659
01:06:11,581 --> 01:06:14,209
Go and get it.

660
01:06:14,284 --> 01:06:16,377
Hurry up! Go get it!

661
01:06:55,325 --> 01:06:58,783
It's not a dog-rat.
We can get out.

662
01:07:01,798 --> 01:07:05,131
Don't look. He's dyed his hair.

663
01:07:15,478 --> 01:07:18,641
It's not as bad as I thought.

664
01:07:18,715 --> 01:07:21,741
Without the bandages,
in just a couple days...

665
01:07:21,818 --> 01:07:23,615
Hello, Tali.

666
01:07:23,886 --> 01:07:24,853
- How are you?
- Fine.

667
01:07:24,921 --> 01:07:27,822
- Fine? And the kids?
- Fine.

668
01:07:27,890 --> 01:07:29,619
I'm glad.

669
01:07:29,792 --> 01:07:31,453
I'll take that.

670
01:07:33,196 --> 01:07:35,289
Mercedes is coming.

671
01:07:35,565 --> 01:07:37,795
Really? When?

672
01:07:38,668 --> 01:07:40,795
I don't know.

673
01:07:42,472 --> 01:07:45,305
She's so brilliant.
Remember at college?

674
01:07:45,375 --> 01:07:47,639
Always taking notes.

675
01:07:51,848 --> 01:07:55,807
Kids are so lucky nowadays
with photocopies.

676
01:07:59,822 --> 01:08:01,517
Is she with someone?

677
01:08:01,591 --> 01:08:04,560
- She never sleeps alone.
- Poor thing.

678
01:08:07,497 --> 01:08:09,192
Answer the phone!

679
01:08:10,366 --> 01:08:12,425
Answer the phone, Isabel!

680
01:08:13,736 --> 01:08:16,500
They never understand.

681
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:19,035
Why ""poor thing''?

682
01:08:19,108 --> 01:08:23,067
She always had lots of admirers
and suitors, remember?

683
01:08:23,146 --> 01:08:24,807
Even so,

684
01:08:24,881 --> 01:08:26,576
it was always a bunch of-

685
01:08:26,649 --> 01:08:29,880
Almost all scoundrels.

686
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:33,280
She's always had a weakness for idiots.

687
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:37,453
Pity I realized it too late.

688
01:08:40,463 --> 01:08:41,987
That's a shame.

689
01:08:43,766 --> 01:08:47,497
Shame you can't come,
'cause the weather's great.

690
01:08:49,505 --> 01:08:51,996
I'm staying a few more days.

691
01:08:54,343 --> 01:08:57,835
I'll be back in Buenos Aires
in a few days.

692
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:03,944
There are things to fix in the house.

693
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:05,749
The electricity and -

694
01:09:09,592 --> 01:09:11,958
Have you got my towel?

695
01:09:13,296 --> 01:09:14,957
This one's yours.

696
01:09:17,633 --> 01:09:20,033
- Guess what?
- What?

697
01:09:20,102 --> 01:09:22,070
Mercedes isn't coming.

698
01:09:23,406 --> 01:09:24,737
Jose.

699
01:09:24,807 --> 01:09:26,297
Give me my panties.

700
01:09:28,945 --> 01:09:30,606
Look!

701
01:10:09,986 --> 01:10:12,648
Those Indians must have fucked her.

702
01:10:15,825 --> 01:10:18,692
You can't trust them for a minute.

703
01:10:19,328 --> 01:10:21,057
They like dogs.

704
01:10:21,731 --> 01:10:23,392
They like their hair.

705
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:25,562
It's so soft.

706
01:10:25,635 --> 01:10:28,365
They're so rough,
and they live on top of each other.

707
01:10:29,105 --> 01:10:31,437
Father, mother, grandfather,

708
01:10:31,507 --> 01:10:33,168
cat, dogs.

709
01:10:39,348 --> 01:10:41,942
Did you see how
they're always patting them?

710
01:10:46,622 --> 01:10:48,590
They fondle them all day.

711
01:11:02,038 --> 01:11:05,974
Ask Gringo to do
some good plastic surgery.

712
01:11:07,476 --> 01:11:11,276
- It's a shame. I so love low necklines.
- It'll hardly show.

713
01:11:11,347 --> 01:11:17,013
There's great plastic surgery now.
Teresa had it after her cesarean.

714
01:11:17,086 --> 01:11:20,749
- Though cesareans are more hidden.
- What lovely hands.

715
01:11:21,824 --> 01:11:25,817
First I have to worry
about eye surgery forJoaquin.

716
01:11:26,662 --> 01:11:28,323
Look after yourself a bit more.

717
01:11:28,397 --> 01:11:32,595
These worthless kids leave such a mess.
I'm always tripping over-

718
01:11:32,668 --> 01:11:35,000
What did you trip over
the other day, Mom?

719
01:11:37,707 --> 01:11:39,641
A towel. Didn't you know?

720
01:11:41,043 --> 01:11:45,104
Although with Isabel,
towels are hard to come by these days.

721
01:11:45,181 --> 01:11:47,741
- She doesn't steal towels.
- Don't answer back!

722
01:11:49,085 --> 01:11:51,246
Dirty savage.

723
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:55,916
She spends all day with the maid.
Look at her hair!

724
01:11:56,759 --> 01:11:59,193
- You were all drunk.
- Shut up!

725
01:11:59,261 --> 01:12:02,424
Don't listen.
All she does is torture me.

726
01:12:02,498 --> 01:12:03,988
Get out!

727
01:12:09,672 --> 01:12:15,611
- A bit of sun will heal it.
- Sun, Tali? In this heat.

728
01:12:15,945 --> 01:12:18,175
I know how this will end.

729
01:12:18,247 --> 01:12:20,841
You'll stay in your room
like Grandma.

730
01:12:20,916 --> 01:12:23,407
Get out!

731
01:12:25,254 --> 01:12:27,484
If I want to stay in bed, I will!

732
01:12:31,794 --> 01:12:35,696
Let's go to Bolivia
this weekend, Tali. Okay?

733
01:12:35,765 --> 01:12:41,260
All right.
I'll sort out the papers.

734
01:12:42,038 --> 01:12:44,438
We'll rest, get some fresh air.

735
01:12:45,207 --> 01:12:47,232
The road's a bit dangerous, but -

736
01:12:47,309 --> 01:12:49,436
It'll be fine. We can walk.

737
01:12:49,945 --> 01:12:51,606
I'll find those papers.

738
01:12:51,681 --> 01:12:54,081
What if I do end up like Mom?

739
01:12:58,487 --> 01:13:01,388
Kids, get those dogs out of here.

740
01:13:01,457 --> 01:13:03,482
Come on, let's get going.

741
01:13:04,627 --> 01:13:06,288
Ready?

742
01:13:06,362 --> 01:13:08,193
My towel's missing.

743
01:13:08,264 --> 01:13:11,461
Look at you,Jose.
Go wash up!

744
01:13:11,534 --> 01:13:13,058
Find him a towel.

745
01:13:13,135 --> 01:13:15,968
Look. Mecha has a dog-rat.

746
01:13:16,038 --> 01:13:17,869
Where's Isabel?

747
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:21,103
- My towel's in the bathroom.
- Go and look.

748
01:13:21,177 --> 01:13:22,838
For heaven's sake, kids!

749
01:13:22,912 --> 01:13:24,573
- We have to go.
- It's a dog-rat.

750
01:13:24,647 --> 01:13:27,138
Take it off.
The bed will be full of germs.

751
01:14:32,414 --> 01:14:33,904
Get out.

752
01:14:40,022 --> 01:14:41,512
Get out.

753
01:14:46,462 --> 01:14:47,952
Get out.

754
01:15:11,287 --> 01:15:13,380
Leave that dog.

755
01:15:13,455 --> 01:15:14,945
Leave it.

756
01:15:15,791 --> 01:15:18,453
- Forget anything?
- Let's take it.

757
01:15:19,728 --> 01:15:21,787
Let's go.

758
01:15:30,973 --> 01:15:33,407
Faster. They're catching us.

759
01:15:33,475 --> 01:15:37,775
That poor one-eyed boy
is gonna fall down.

760
01:16:01,837 --> 01:16:03,498
Are they gone?

761
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:06,731
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to walk.

762
01:16:06,809 --> 01:16:09,073
- I'll take you.
- No, it's okay.

763
01:16:09,144 --> 01:16:11,078
I'll take you in Gregorio's van.

764
01:16:11,146 --> 01:16:12,636
Wait here.

765
01:16:41,143 --> 01:16:42,804
- Dad?
- What?

766
01:16:42,878 --> 01:16:45,813
After you wash my legs,
can you wash my hair?

767
01:16:46,081 --> 01:16:49,517
Look. I found them.
Aren't these the car papers?

768
01:16:49,685 --> 01:16:51,380
Pass me a towel.

769
01:16:51,453 --> 01:16:52,943
From where?

770
01:16:55,891 --> 01:16:57,859
No, a rag.

771
01:16:58,861 --> 01:17:01,056
No, clean her off with this.

772
01:17:01,130 --> 01:17:02,620
I'll wash it later.

773
01:17:02,698 --> 01:17:05,030
Are these the papers
we need for the border?

774
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:07,830
- Put them where you found them.
- In a minute.

775
01:17:07,903 --> 01:17:12,567
Look at you.
That's why the house is so dirty.

776
01:17:12,641 --> 01:17:15,769
Do they ask for these papers
at the border?

777
01:17:16,445 --> 01:17:18,743
You shouldn't go there.
You get all dirty.

778
01:17:18,914 --> 01:17:20,745
Mom said I could.

779
01:17:21,417 --> 01:17:23,078
Pass me the detergent.

780
01:17:26,055 --> 01:17:28,489
You're a mess.

781
01:17:29,325 --> 01:17:30,815
Luciano too.

782
01:17:35,931 --> 01:17:38,161
Something exploded.

783
01:17:45,274 --> 01:17:46,764
The bulb went.

784
01:17:47,776 --> 01:17:50,836
Get out or the smoke will -

785
01:18:25,147 --> 01:18:26,808
Where's Perro?

786
01:18:28,283 --> 01:18:31,184
- What did he do to you?
- Nothing, Momi.

787
01:18:31,253 --> 01:18:33,744
- What did he do?
- Stay here.

788
01:19:08,857 --> 01:19:11,758
- Is the owner home?
- Yes, she is.

789
01:19:12,261 --> 01:19:13,592
Ma'am,

790
01:19:13,662 --> 01:19:16,324
has the Virgin reappeared?

791
01:19:16,398 --> 01:19:22,564
My daughter says the Virgin
asks us to pray a lot

792
01:19:22,638 --> 01:19:25,004
because hard times are coming.

793
01:19:25,174 --> 01:19:26,937
May we speak with your daughter?

794
01:19:27,109 --> 01:19:29,873
No, she's very tired.

795
01:19:29,945 --> 01:19:32,209
Miriam, how are you?

796
01:19:32,714 --> 01:19:34,978
Did you see the Virgin again?

797
01:19:35,050 --> 01:19:37,883
Phone! Answer the phone!

798
01:19:39,388 --> 01:19:45,054
She's tired of all the people.

799
01:19:45,127 --> 01:19:47,459
She doesn't want to see anyone.

800
01:19:47,529 --> 01:19:49,827
That's the truth.
She doesn't want to talk.

801
01:19:49,898 --> 01:19:52,526
Has she appeared again?

802
01:19:53,302 --> 01:19:54,792
Very well.

803
01:19:56,305 --> 01:20:00,366
At this intersection
in the suburb of San Francisco,

804
01:20:00,442 --> 01:20:02,137
something worries us.

805
01:20:02,211 --> 01:20:04,202
Now you answer.
Isabel, hang up!

806
01:20:04,613 --> 01:20:06,274
Hello?

807
01:20:06,348 --> 01:20:10,842
Mercedes, these Indians
never tell me who's calling. What?

808
01:20:12,054 --> 01:20:13,885
Yes.

809
01:20:13,956 --> 01:20:16,618
I don't know if he's up.
Just a minute.

810
01:20:21,864 --> 01:20:25,265
Wait, I'll try to transfer the call.

811
01:20:25,334 --> 01:20:27,666
Damn phone.

812
01:20:29,171 --> 01:20:33,005
- Hello,Jose?
- No, it's me, Mecha.

813
01:20:33,075 --> 01:20:37,637
- Okay, Mecha.
-Just a second, because -

814
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:40,073
This phone's a piece of junk.

815
01:20:40,149 --> 01:20:43,277
Come here.
Can you work this phone?

816
01:20:45,621 --> 01:20:47,555
- Who is it?
- For you.

817
01:20:48,490 --> 01:20:51,891
You're always either out or asleep.

818
01:20:52,394 --> 01:20:54,055
Yes, Mecha.

819
01:20:54,796 --> 01:20:56,457
Yes, Mercedes.

820
01:20:57,299 --> 01:20:59,233
Yes, Mecha's fine.

821
01:20:59,868 --> 01:21:01,529
Yes, she's fine.

822
01:21:05,574 --> 01:21:07,064
Don't worry.

823
01:21:09,011 --> 01:21:10,945
Okay. Big kiss.

824
01:21:13,916 --> 01:21:16,544
I gotta go back to Buenos Aires.

825
01:21:22,491 --> 01:21:24,857
Get some rest, son.

826
01:21:25,827 --> 01:21:28,660
- It's mine.
- No. It's mine.

827
01:21:28,730 --> 01:21:31,824
Kids, stop fighting and get in.

828
01:21:33,635 --> 01:21:37,196
- That's my pencil.
- No. It's mine.

829
01:21:39,241 --> 01:21:42,335
Here, take this. What is it?

830
01:21:44,646 --> 01:21:45,772
They're mine.

831
01:21:45,847 --> 01:21:47,474
What are those?

832
01:21:47,549 --> 01:21:49,210
Let your brother have those.

833
01:21:49,284 --> 01:21:53,118
Let's see, Mariana.
What's this?

834
01:21:53,188 --> 01:21:56,248
- How nice. Where did you get this?
- Back there.

835
01:21:57,759 --> 01:22:00,250
- What is it?
- School stuff.

836
01:22:03,599 --> 01:22:05,089
What stuff?

837
01:22:05,167 --> 01:22:08,500
For school. What else?

838
01:22:14,543 --> 01:22:15,703
Give it to me.

839
01:22:22,384 --> 01:22:24,409
When did you buy all this?

840
01:22:25,787 --> 01:22:27,812
Why didn't you tell me?

841
01:22:27,889 --> 01:22:29,379
I don't know.

842
01:22:30,125 --> 01:22:32,252
Who gave Rafael the list?

843
01:22:32,761 --> 01:22:33,853
Agustina.

844
01:22:36,231 --> 01:22:38,722
You've already bought everything.

845
01:22:41,069 --> 01:22:43,594
Why didn't you tell me?

846
01:22:46,742 --> 01:22:49,006
Take the box out, Mariana.

847
01:22:49,077 --> 01:22:51,045
- I can't.
- Take it out!

848
01:22:51,113 --> 01:22:53,047
Luciano, help me.

849
01:23:11,433 --> 01:23:13,526
Are you asleep, Isabel?

850
01:23:17,439 --> 01:23:19,100
Are you asleep?

851
01:23:19,775 --> 01:23:21,072
Momi.

852
01:23:21,977 --> 01:23:25,469
Go pick up a box
that arrived for Mecha.

853
01:23:25,547 --> 01:23:30,712
- Go on. Take the car.
- I can't. I'm busy. AskJose.

854
01:23:35,924 --> 01:23:37,585
Can you hear me?

855
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:02,376
- Go pick up the fridge. I need the car.
- I'm not going.

856
01:24:07,989 --> 01:24:09,650
Stay a while longer.

857
01:24:26,675 --> 01:24:29,701
Luciano, what color labels do you want?

858
01:24:29,878 --> 01:24:32,142
Blue, red, burgundy.

859
01:24:33,482 --> 01:24:35,245
- Pale blue?
- Yes.

860
01:24:39,354 --> 01:24:42,619
- Name and surname?
- Luciano Echenique.

861
01:24:47,629 --> 01:24:48,789
Class?

862
01:24:48,864 --> 01:24:50,923
First grade, section A.

863
01:24:52,768 --> 01:24:56,499
First grade is easy.
Second is harder.

864
01:25:03,879 --> 01:25:05,540
Luciano, breathe.

865
01:25:07,215 --> 01:25:09,046
Breathe, Luciano.

866
01:25:13,555 --> 01:25:15,216
Breathe, Luciano.

867
01:25:16,892 --> 01:25:18,689
Breathe.

868
01:25:19,628 --> 01:25:21,118
Breathe.

869
01:25:30,739 --> 01:25:32,604
I'm gonna call Mecha.

870
01:25:36,945 --> 01:25:38,970
I'm gonna call her right now.

871
01:25:40,182 --> 01:25:42,173
I'll tell her we're not going.

872
01:25:43,351 --> 01:25:47,344
Besides, it's dangerous.

873
01:25:52,694 --> 01:25:57,427
We'll call Mecha and tell her
it's a waste of time going to Bolivia.

874
01:25:57,766 --> 01:26:00,030
We'll avoid complications.

875
01:26:03,972 --> 01:26:05,803
It won't stop raining.

876
01:26:08,477 --> 01:26:10,809
What if something happened
on the way?

877
01:26:14,649 --> 01:26:16,310
And with no papers for the car.

878
01:26:16,384 --> 01:26:20,878
- Going to Bolivia is a waste of money.
- We'd spend too much.

879
01:26:21,790 --> 01:26:24,657
Rafael bought it all wholesale.

880
01:26:24,726 --> 01:26:26,751
It was dirt cheap.

881
01:26:26,828 --> 01:26:28,989
We'd end up spending more.

882
01:26:32,067 --> 01:26:35,366
We'll say it's a shame we can't go.

883
01:26:40,809 --> 01:26:43,369
He bought everything?

884
01:26:44,546 --> 01:26:47,037
- What an extraordinary man you've got.
- Hey, kids.

885
01:26:49,784 --> 01:26:53,550
- While I'm here with...
- Pass me the pillow.

886
01:26:57,058 --> 01:26:59,925
We can go later on, of course.

887
01:27:03,198 --> 01:27:04,392
Okay.

888
01:27:05,233 --> 01:27:06,564
Bye, Tali.

889
01:27:16,578 --> 01:27:18,546
Isn't he sleeping here anymore?

890
01:27:18,613 --> 01:27:20,877
It's impossible in this heat.

891
01:27:22,050 --> 01:27:24,883
The healing process
raises my temperature.

892
01:27:28,223 --> 01:27:30,157
There's never any ice.

893
01:27:30,992 --> 01:27:34,155
God, I hate this climate.

894
01:27:37,999 --> 01:27:39,489
Stop it, asshole.

895
01:27:40,368 --> 01:27:41,995
Kids!

896
01:27:42,404 --> 01:27:44,065
I don't feel well.

897
01:27:46,875 --> 01:27:48,365
Stop it.

898
01:28:01,890 --> 01:28:03,721
Ma'am, may I talk to you?

899
01:28:04,726 --> 01:28:06,387
Bring me some ice.

900
01:28:12,133 --> 01:28:15,296
I have to go to my sister's.

901
01:28:17,772 --> 01:28:21,208
Why didn't you tell me sooner?
For how long? I need you here.

902
01:28:21,276 --> 01:28:23,767
I might have to stay there.

903
01:28:24,279 --> 01:28:27,271
You'll have to find another girl.
I have to stay with her.

904
01:28:27,349 --> 01:28:29,715
She asked me to.

905
01:28:32,587 --> 01:28:34,885
I wonder why.

906
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:42,493
These party girls.
You give them everything:

907
01:28:42,564 --> 01:28:45,089
a roof, food, everything.

908
01:28:45,266 --> 01:28:48,064
And this is what you get.
They're all the same.

909
01:28:48,136 --> 01:28:51,264
Ingrates. Then you have
to look after their kids.

910
01:28:54,943 --> 01:28:56,706
God, what ingrates!

911
01:28:56,778 --> 01:28:57,802
Move!

912
01:28:57,879 --> 01:29:02,543
Go! I'll send for you
to settle your pay.

913
01:29:03,718 --> 01:29:05,379
Just great.

914
01:29:05,453 --> 01:29:06,784
Unbelievable.

915
01:30:03,011 --> 01:30:04,672
Leave me alone.

916
01:31:25,527 --> 01:31:29,793
- There it is.
- Where?

917
01:31:34,702 --> 01:31:36,795
- Here. Listen.
- Here?

918
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,975
There it is.

919
01:31:48,650 --> 01:31:49,981
Listen.

920
01:31:55,323 --> 01:31:56,813
It's fading.

921
01:32:07,302 --> 01:32:08,963
Stop that.

922
01:34:22,103 --> 01:34:24,128
Call anyway.

923
01:34:24,339 --> 01:34:26,864
No one may be home.
You can leave a message.

924
01:34:31,946 --> 01:34:34,972
You call.
I don't know what to say.

925
01:34:36,150 --> 01:34:38,983
No, I'll call some other time.

926
01:34:41,322 --> 01:34:42,880
Hang up.

927
01:34:44,092 --> 01:34:46,856
No need for you to come.
Stay here.

928
01:34:49,864 --> 01:34:51,957
I'll call Tali and go.

929
01:35:46,521 --> 01:35:48,182
Where did you go?

930
01:35:50,191 --> 01:35:52,216
Where the Virgin's been appearing.

931
01:35:59,534 --> 01:36:01,195
I didn't see anything.

932
01:36:02,195 --> 01:36:12,195
