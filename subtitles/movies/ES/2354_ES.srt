1
00:00:00,952 --> 00:00:02,861
<i>Y acción</i>

2
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:16,567
Damas y caballeros, jovenes y viejos..

3
00:00:16,632 --> 00:00:18,966
Esto puede parece un proceder inusual

4
00:00:19,031 --> 00:00:21,333
Hablarles a ustedes antes
de que empiece la película...

5
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:23,254
Pero tenemos un inusual objetivo

6
00:00:23,319 --> 00:00:25,294
Otra vez..

7
00:00:28,055 --> 00:00:32,627
Cuando digo que este es la película
más importante..que alguna vez verán

8
00:00:32,696 --> 00:00:35,795
Mi motivación no es financiera

9
00:00:35,864 --> 00:00:40,817
Pero una firme creencia que la delicada
fábrica que nos sostiene a todos juntos

10
00:00:40,887 --> 00:00:45,122
Será destruída a menos que cada
hombre mujer o niño en este país...

11
00:00:45,687 --> 00:00:46,570
Vea este film

12
00:00:47,171 --> 00:00:48,771
Y pague el precio total de la entrada

13
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:50,709
Y no una barata matinee por un corto

14
00:00:51,736 --> 00:00:53,645
Otra vez..

15
00:00:57,271 --> 00:01:01,908
En el caso de que usted encuentre
algunas secuencias o ideas confusas

16
00:01:01,975 --> 00:01:05,587
Por favor entienda que la
falta es suya y no nuestra

17
00:01:05,655 --> 00:01:10,162
Tendrá que ver la película una y
otra vez hasta que entienda todo

18
00:01:10,232 --> 00:01:11,541
Otra vez..

19
00:01:15,415 --> 00:01:17,750
Cerrando... quiero asegurarles

20
00:01:17,816 --> 00:01:21,198
Que no hay gastos extras incluídos

21
00:01:21,271 --> 00:01:23,792
Trayendo esta película a su teatro

22
00:01:23,864 --> 00:01:27,279
Y ahora... el film en su totalidad

23
00:01:27,352 --> 00:01:30,286
Y comprobado su salud de
cortes menores y desgastes...

24
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:33,028
Orgullosamente presentamos... Schizopolis.!

25
00:01:39,929 --> 00:01:43,829
Ningún pez fué herido en la filmación de esta película

26
00:01:48,792 --> 00:01:51,061
<i>Su mejor libro, aquí estoy ahora...</i>

27
00:01:51,127 --> 00:01:52,982
<i>Ayudando a usted a encontrarse a si mismo</i>

28
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:56,757
<i>Su piedra fundamental ,como
controlar su propia mente</i>

29
00:01:56,824 --> 00:01:58,679
<i>Enseñandole como pensar</i>

30
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:03,413
<i>Ahora T.Azimuth Schwitters, autor de
el importante manifiesto del Eventualismo...</i>

31
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,552
<i>Y el más influyente pensador del mundo</i>

32
00:02:05,623 --> 00:02:07,827
<i>Aparecerá el 11 Febrero ...</i>

33
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:11,026
<i>En el Civic Sports Memorial
Performing Arts teatro</i>

34
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:15,163
<i>Tickets a la venta donde sea que se vendan</i>

35
00:03:06,488 --> 00:03:09,521
<i>Todas mis ansiedades disminuyeron</i>

36
00:03:09,591 --> 00:03:12,886
<i>Mi vida anterior estaba
llena de rituales y habitos</i>

37
00:03:12,951 --> 00:03:16,115
<i>Una vez, por ejemplo estaba cepillando mis dientes</i>

38
00:03:16,183 --> 00:03:18,355
Cada 15 minutos porque no podía recordar

39
00:03:18,424 --> 00:03:20,758
<i>De veras?
- Si los había cepillado..</i>

40
00:03:20,823 --> 00:03:23,027
Y por cierto, casi perdí todos mis dientes

41
00:03:23,595 --> 00:03:24,923
Pero ahora no lo hace...

42
00:03:24,824 --> 00:03:27,224
- No, no ahora ya no

43
00:03:26,195 --> 00:03:28,011
Ya veo..

44
00:03:28,012 --> 00:03:29,012
Está muy bién

45
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:34,064
Entonces, se siente relajada?... se siente libre?
Sí..sí

46
00:03:34,136 --> 00:03:36,307
Alguna otra palabra podría usar
para describir como se siente ahora..?

47
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,230
Me siento controlada

48
00:03:38,295 --> 00:03:41,692
Me siento... más feliz que nunca

49
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,414
Hay algo más que necesito preguntarle

50
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,563
Y después no la molestaré

51
00:03:45,264 --> 00:03:46,264
Seguro..

52
00:03:46,231 --> 00:03:49,843
Está tomando alguna clase de medicamentos..?

53
00:03:49,911 --> 00:03:50,934
Oh, no..no..

54
00:03:51,635 --> 00:03:52,035
No

55
00:03:51,703 --> 00:03:54,802
No? realmente? bién..

56
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:10,794
Sí..

57
00:04:10,795 --> 00:04:12,295
Su hermano en la dos

58
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:13,869
Oh, mierda! muy bién

59
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,157
Para ya..

60
00:04:16,158 --> 00:04:17,658
Lo has pensado..?

61
00:04:17,623 --> 00:04:19,533
No tengo que pensarlo

62
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:22,455
Cuanto tardarán en darse
cuenta que no tienes hermano..?

63
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:31,450
<i>Primero, estoy naciendo...
entonces los problemas empiezan</i>

64
00:04:32,923 --> 00:04:35,285
<i>A los cinco años fantaceaba que era huerfano</i>

65
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:39,148
<i>Tratando de perder a mis padres
en el festejo del 4 de Julio</i>

66
00:04:39,223 --> 00:04:40,627
<i>Me encontraron...</i>

67
00:04:41,495 --> 00:04:43,983
<i>A los nueve tuve una experiencia extra sensorial</i>

68
00:04:44,055 --> 00:04:45,943
<i>Cuando jugaba en el campo</i>

69
00:04:46,007 --> 00:04:48,178
<i>Marqué tres corridas (beisbol)</i>

70
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:50,920
<i>A los quince tuve una punzante sensación</i>

71
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:52,725
<i>De que algo terrible me pasaría</i>

72
00:05:33,155 --> 00:05:35,351
Generalmente no hago este tipo de cosas

73
00:05:35,415 --> 00:05:36,368
Eh..entrevistas

74
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:37,369
<i>Muy bién</i>

75
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:39,428
Está esto filmado o grabado..?

76
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:40,629
<i>Está filmado</i>

77
00:06:07,064 --> 00:06:09,095
Señor..señor está usted bién..!?

78
00:06:08,663 --> 00:06:10,518
Bueno tenemos un infarto del miocardio

79
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,405
De la pared interior del ventrículo izquierdo

80
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:14,610
Señor.. señor..puede escucharme..?

81
00:06:14,679 --> 00:06:16,534
Consecuencia de una oclusión por trombosis

82
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:19,501
Del interior de la rama descendiente
de la arteria izquierda de la coronaria

83
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,484
Deberíamos presionarle el pecho

84
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:25,683
Probablemente los dos fueron causados por
una dieta grasa y un estilo de vida sedentario

85
00:06:25,751 --> 00:06:27,988
Quizás deberías ir a llamar a una ambulancia
Si está bién

86
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,772
La cual, cuando se combina con un
entorno de trabajo estresante

87
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:33,228
Conduce a un infarto del miocardio

88
00:06:33,304 --> 00:06:35,475
De la pared interior del ventrículo izquierdo..

89
00:06:35,543 --> 00:06:37,452
Bién..bién..sí

90
00:06:37,527 --> 00:06:39,748
Y me siento realmente terrible empezar con..

91
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:42,029
Incluso después que pasó esa horrible cosa y

92
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,419
Así, las cosas se volvieron realmente terribles y

93
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:49,745
Me preguntaba...cuanto más depresivo puede ser

94
00:06:49,815 --> 00:06:50,872
Y yo...

95
00:06:50,873 --> 00:06:53,873
Ví ese sádico show acerca de.. una pareja infeliz

96
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,354
Mira..

97
00:06:56,455 --> 00:06:57,655
Lo siento..

98
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:00,181
Tengo razón..tengo que hacerlo

99
00:07:00,247 --> 00:07:01,456
Oh, lo siento

100
00:07:01,457 --> 00:07:02,857
- No, no es que..

101
00:07:02,231 --> 00:07:06,606
Lo sé.. es que este.. triste melancólico

102
00:07:06,679 --> 00:07:08,916
Miserable y depresivo tipo...

103
00:07:08,983 --> 00:07:10,892
Y esto es... no.. lo sé

104
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:13,536
Si podemos hacerlo en otro momento

105
00:07:13,911 --> 00:07:16,393
Está bién, mi estómago me está matando

106
00:07:15,594 --> 00:07:16,994
Bueno..

107
00:07:21,912 --> 00:07:25,173
Circulos negros alrededor de sus
ojos descontento ambulatorio..

108
00:07:26,935 --> 00:07:28,877
Tendencia a mirar el canal Spice

109
00:07:30,615 --> 00:07:33,200
Combinado con una dieta grasa
y un estilo de vida sedentario

110
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:38,389
Pueden resultar en un psiconeurótico desorden

111
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:44,309
Hiperparasipatetico efecto reververante
con circulos negros alrededor de sus ojos

112
00:08:35,939 --> 00:08:37,792
Oh, hola como vamos..?

113
00:08:38,263 --> 00:08:40,652
Oh.. no muy bién..
Bueno..nos vemos

114
00:09:09,495 --> 00:09:10,270
Fletch

115
00:09:09,943 --> 00:09:10,690
Hola

116
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,991
Escuchastes sobre Lester?

117
00:09:12,855 --> 00:09:13,872
Qu..qué..?

118
00:09:14,073 --> 00:09:15,973
Ataque al corazón.. esta mañana

119
00:09:16,247 --> 00:09:17,064
<i>Estás bromeando..</i>

120
00:09:16,965 --> 00:09:18,765
Si solo cayó muerto

121
00:09:20,183 --> 00:09:23,066
Mi dios.. alguién llamó a Shelly?

122
00:09:23,267 --> 00:09:24,567
Sí la llamaron desde el hospital

123
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:29,261
<i>Quiero decir... se veía venir</i>

124
00:09:30,135 --> 00:09:30,906
Que quieres decir..?

125
00:09:30,707 --> 00:09:32,407
Bueno, el tipo comía como el demonio

126
00:09:33,675 --> 00:09:35,144
<i>Tenía insomnio crónico</i>

127
00:09:35,511 --> 00:09:38,149
<i>Su presión sanguínea era sumamente alta</i>

128
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:43,095
Y creo que tenía algunos
sintomas de diabetes también

129
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:44,366
Que es eso..?

130
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:45,667
<i>Saborear barras de caramelo</i>

131
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,554
<i>Tobillos hinchados</i>

132
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:50,639
<i>Corriendo constantemente al baño</i>

133
00:09:50,711 --> 00:09:53,078
<i>Para ehh orinar</i>

134
00:09:53,143 --> 00:09:54,912
Hmm..

135
00:09:55,479 --> 00:09:57,912
Y tu sabes como Lester nunca escribió nada

136
00:09:57,813 --> 00:09:58,713
Así es..

137
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,493
Bueno ahi estan buscando un discurso

138
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:03,949
Y.. está en su cabeza y el está muerto

139
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:06,940
-Hmm..

140
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,541
-Oh, pero lo que realmente vine a decirte es..

141
00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:10,694
Coloqué otra órden

142
00:10:11,063 --> 00:10:13,616
<i>- Así que... recibirás otro embarque</i>

143
00:10:13,687 --> 00:10:14,727
<i>- Oh, bueno</i>

144
00:10:14,928 --> 00:10:15,928
Si tu pudieras guardar...

145
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:16,861
Estaré alerta si muy bién..

146
00:10:16,862 --> 00:10:18,162
Muchas gracias

147
00:10:19,127 --> 00:10:20,342
Cuídate no trabajes muy duro

148
00:10:20,343 --> 00:10:21,343
Bién

149
00:10:24,951 --> 00:10:25,787
Sí

150
00:10:25,488 --> 00:10:26,988
Su tio en la cuatro

151
00:10:27,255 --> 00:10:29,360
Mi tio..muy bién

152
00:10:30,743 --> 00:10:32,783
Mierda...!

153
00:10:32,854 --> 00:10:33,738
Qué..? hola

154
00:10:33,939 --> 00:10:34,939
Cincuenta grandes...

155
00:10:35,607 --> 00:10:38,192
Y esa es nuestra oferta quizás puedas hablarlo

156
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,532
Qué.. por que no dejan de molestarme..?

157
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:44,876
Podríamos hacerlo por supuesto,
pero tendríamos que buscar a otro

158
00:10:45,015 --> 00:10:49,238
A menudo una persona de este, ehh--
una persona de este tipo se inmagina

159
00:10:49,303 --> 00:10:53,198
Como el sujeto de una.. una detallada biografía

160
00:10:53,271 --> 00:10:57,875
Es incapaz de esperimentar alguna emoción..

161
00:10:57,943 --> 00:11:00,529
O.. evento no importa.. cuan trivial..

162
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:02,173
<i>- No lo marcástes...</i>

163
00:11:04,439 --> 00:11:07,308
No importa cuan.. insignificante

164
00:11:07,383 --> 00:11:10,995
Una persona es a menudo incapaz de
experimentar cualquier evento o emoción

165
00:11:11,063 --> 00:11:12,972
No importa si es insignificante

166
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:18,644
Sin inmaginar que está tipificado
y visto en detalle por el público

Armamento nasal

171
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:04,332
Um, armamento nasal..?

172
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:07,446
Uh, bife de pañal..?

173
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,788
Nomenclatura

174
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:21,101
- Me gusta..
- Muchísimo..

175
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:28,821
Vibrante generación de polvo

00:12:28,887 --> 00:12:30,456
Ataque sonoro de tissue

00:12:30,757 --> 00:12:32,357
Rompecabezas

178
00:12:33,206 --> 00:12:36,654
Uh, manteca fragmentada
cirujia de cerebro..?

Señal de aromas

182
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:50,163
Tomemosnos un momento y
hablemos acerca del Azimut Schwitters

183
00:12:50,231 --> 00:12:52,719
Cual es su opinion acerca de
Schwitters y su organización.?

184
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,646
Oh, ese Azimut Schwitters...

185
00:12:54,711 --> 00:12:56,653
El es el peor tipo de charlatán...

186
00:12:56,727 --> 00:12:59,280
Y bandido que pueda inmaginar

187
00:12:59,351 --> 00:13:02,449
Construyó un imperio de un millón de dolares

188
00:13:02,518 --> 00:13:04,460
Embaucando al publico americano

189
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,607
En este... obscuro

190
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:09,679
<i>Movimiento y no es más que
una serie de excursión</i>

191
00:13:09,751 --> 00:13:14,606
<i>solipsistica a la divagación
de controlarse a si mismo...</i>

192
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:16,686
En todo el sentido de la responsabilidad personal

193
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:19,280
Y la responsabilidad de la comunidad también

194
00:13:19,351 --> 00:13:22,001
Y peor que eso tenemos información
de nuestras fuentes internas...

195
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:25,965
<i>Que está teniendo una pequeña desviación mental</i>

196
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:30,512
<i>Y su manager personal tuvo
que retirarle sus pertenencias</i>

197
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:35,984
<i>Y yo me prometí a exponer a este
lider del fraude tal como es, y...</i>

198
00:13:36,055 --> 00:13:38,477
- Está usted bién..?
- Mi...mi muela

199
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,926
- Podemos hacerlo de vuelta..?
- Si hagámoslo..hagámoslo de vuelta

200
00:13:46,863 --> 00:13:49,381
<i>Hey, es esa una forma de hablar con una dama..?</i>

201
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,983
<i>Ou..!</i>

202
00:14:03,735 --> 00:14:04,984
<i>Oh...</i>

203
00:14:07,798 --> 00:14:09,708
<i>Oh...</i>

204
00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:12,109
<i>Oh..!</i>

205
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:19,086
Cuanto tiempo cree que puede llevar..?
estuvo en todos los seis pisos...

206
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:21,493
<i>-Tiene once autos
- Once..?</i>

207
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:24,461
<i>No tiene once autos pregúntele
a el estuvimos en su casa..</i>

208
00:14:24,535 --> 00:14:26,722
<i>- Que hacían en su casa?
-Lavando autos...</i>

209
00:14:26,594 --> 00:14:27,949
Puedo terminar..?

210
00:14:29,014 --> 00:14:32,662
- Entonces estaba hablando con
-(No tomo café..es para mí..)
este tipo de estadísticas...

211
00:14:31,927 --> 00:14:34,316
- Quién dijo, tenemos un topo

212
00:14:34,391 --> 00:14:36,245
Aquí en algún lugar...o algo

213
00:14:36,311 --> 00:14:37,998
-Que quieres decir con topo..?
- Quién tiene un topo..?

214
00:14:38,262 --> 00:14:40,237
No, un topo es un espía

215
00:14:40,311 --> 00:14:43,411
Aparentemente hay un tipo en Creative
que está filtrando información

216
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:45,372
- Quién..?
- Un tipo

217
00:14:45,846 --> 00:14:48,399
Filtrando información a Thaddeus Tribby

218
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,669
Ahora...

219
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,670
Este tipo me dice..que

220
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:54,028
Su mano derecha tiene el mismo un infiltrado

221
00:14:54,103 --> 00:14:55,488
<i>- Un espía y un mole?</i>

222
00:14:55,489 --> 00:14:56,789
- No, yo no dije eso..

223
00:14:56,758 --> 00:14:58,213
Dije que hay un tipo filtrando inf...

224
00:14:57,878 --> 00:15:00,150
Dijistes que hay un tipo
filtrando información a Tribby

225
00:15:00,151 --> 00:15:00,851
Eso es Tribby..correcto

226
00:15:00,619 --> 00:15:01,873
Ese es el espía

227
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:04,493
Después dijistes que su mano
derecha tiene el mismo un mole

228
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:06,213
Asumiría que hay que chequear al espía

229
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:07,532
- Esas son dos personas

230
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:08,933
- Bueno, hay un espía y hay un mole

231
00:15:09,303 --> 00:15:11,157
Eran dos como hace un minuto atrás

232
00:15:11,223 --> 00:15:13,077
Todos los que conozco han estado
aquí por lo menos tres años

233
00:15:13,143 --> 00:15:15,509
- Cuanto tiempo estuvistes aquí..?
- Bastante

234
00:15:15,575 --> 00:15:18,225
Yo digo que el tipo que te lo dijo es el mole

235
00:15:18,294 --> 00:15:20,782
No, eso es imposible el
estuvo aquí siete años

236
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:23,604
Yo trabajé con este tipo desde el correo

237
00:15:23,671 --> 00:15:26,256
- Tu eres el mole
- No, no, no el es el espía

238
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:28,236
- No, el es el espía
- Si yo fuera el espía...

239
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:30,678
Estaría parado aquí
diciendo que hay un espía..?

240
00:15:30,743 --> 00:15:32,685
- Quizás
- Y un mole?

241
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:34,864
-Está bién cubierto
-Bién olvídenlo...

242
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:38,164
Yo no soy la fuente en esto y lo digo en serio

243
00:15:38,231 --> 00:15:41,843
Muy bién, está limpio..!
pueden volver a trabajar..!

244
00:15:47,126 --> 00:15:49,515
<i>Trampear desparamando ladridos?</i>

245
00:15:49,591 --> 00:15:51,598
<i>Minero arrebatado..?</i>

246
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:56,940
Enterito embajador de minero

247
00:16:04,503 --> 00:16:06,390
Munson!

248
00:16:07,831 --> 00:16:11,759
No necesito decirle lo crítico que es esto

249
00:16:11,831 --> 00:16:17,527
Vistazo a la ciudad, mucha atención, los ojos
de la comunicación..eso es lo que necesito

250
00:16:17,591 --> 00:16:19,586
Deberá ser lo bastante extenso para...

251
00:16:19,587 --> 00:16:20,887
Verse substancial

252
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,166
Pero todavía lo suficientemente conciso...

253
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:24,567
Para sentirse ligero

254
00:16:24,439 --> 00:16:26,326
Deberá ser serio...

255
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,300
Pero con un ligero guiño

256
00:16:30,007 --> 00:16:32,047
Habrá que diseñar un
nuevo curso de acción

257
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:35,467
Pero uno que pueda.. cambiar la
dirección en cuaquier momento

258
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:39,154
Si debe mencionar hechos y
fisonomía no lo haga directamente

259
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:42,668
La legítima verdad...

260
00:16:42,743 --> 00:16:46,485
Debe permanecer metídas en
nuestra mente para siempre

261
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:49,327
Pero las palábras específicas deben
olvidarse en el momento que se oyen

262
00:16:49,994 --> 00:16:53,775
No deberán contener nada que
no se pueda confirmar o negar

263
00:16:55,127 --> 00:16:57,036
Deberá estar en mi escritorio
el viernes a la mañana

264
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,413
Hay algo que usted quiere...--
- Lester Richards...

265
00:17:02,382 --> 00:17:04,437
Me jodió...!!

00:17:04,502 --> 00:17:06,739
Jodió al señor Schwitters...!!

267
00:17:06,806 --> 00:17:08,693
Y jodió a toda la corporación..!!

268
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:10,613
Usted va a escribir el discurso..!

269
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:13,572
No puedo..

270
00:17:13,573 --> 00:17:14,773
- Me está diciendo que no puede..?

271
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:17,839
Tomar un sustancial aumento o
esa enorme nueva oficina..?

272
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,885
Es eso lo que me está diciendo...

273
00:17:22,582 --> 00:17:23,884
- El viernes..?

274
00:17:24,785 --> 00:17:25,985
- A las 10:00 a.m.

275
00:17:35,126 --> 00:17:36,330
Yo solo...

276
00:17:54,135 --> 00:17:57,713
Acerca de su promoción solo quiero que sepa que

277
00:17:57,783 --> 00:17:59,692
A pesar de que usted fué promovido

278
00:17:59,766 --> 00:18:03,956
Por sobre mucha gente que ha
estado aquí mucho mas tiempo que usted

279
00:18:04,022 --> 00:18:08,146
Eso..eh nadie parece estar resentido

280
00:18:08,214 --> 00:18:10,669
Eso lo he hablado..recientemente..

281
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:14,769
Así que...congratulaciones

282
00:18:14,838 --> 00:18:16,999
Gracias.. gracias

283
00:18:43,574 --> 00:18:44,662

Vendrá su esposa esta noche..?

288
00:18:51,222 --> 00:18:54,297
Porque su grán trasero me deja siempre satisfecho...

289
00:18:55,062 --> 00:19:00,213
Gracias por mencionarlo, ella disfruta
del sexo más con usted que conmigo

290
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:03,508
Estoy seguro que ella le dice
lo mismo con todo el vecindario

291
00:19:03,574 --> 00:19:05,646
Creo que usted tiene razón  en eso

292
00:19:05,718 --> 00:19:07,088
- Lo veo luego

293
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:08,089

Teahouse grain structure.
Uh, mellow rhubarb turbine?

-Jigsaw. Smell sign.
-Jigsaw.

312
00:20:11,223 --> 00:20:13,361
Smell sign.

313
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,285
Yow!

314
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,838
That's right.

315
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:21,838
- Put this bear wearing a hat.
- Obligation.

316
00:20:23,382 --> 00:20:25,935
<i>- The bear wears the hat.
- Greeting.</i>

317

<i>Response indicating
caller mistake.</i>

318
00:20:30,934 --> 00:20:32,941
- Mistake.
- I don't know.

319
00:20:37,462 --> 00:20:39,317
Semi-innocent query.

320
00:20:39,382 --> 00:20:41,389
Convincingly confused.

321
00:20:44,342 --> 00:20:47,571
Yeah. See, now the bear--
the bear goes into the box.

And so, at this point...

323
00:20:51,031 --> 00:20:54,805
we see him exhibiting
diagonal characteristics...

324
00:20:54,871 --> 00:20:58,187
as opposed to
horizontal characteristics.

325
00:20:58,263 --> 00:21:00,750
<i>What does that mean?</i>

326
00:21:00,822 --> 00:21:02,797
Haven't you read my manual?

327
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:11,379
Eventualism is not a cause...

328
00:21:11,447 --> 00:21:16,236
a course, a fashion,
or a religion.

329
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,644
Eventualism is a state of mind.

330
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:22,093
Time and again we see the reliance
on a proven methodology--

331
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,587
a methodology separate
from human experience...

332
00:21:24,662 --> 00:21:28,307
built upon figures,
not feelings...

333
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:31,408
which encourages our dependence
on the empirical world...

334
00:21:31,478 --> 00:21:34,478
a world with no room
for ground-rule doubles.

335
00:21:36,502 --> 00:21:38,357
Damn it!

336
00:21:40,374 --> 00:21:42,578
Imminent departure.
Return as discussed.

337
00:21:42,646 --> 00:21:45,493
- Acknowledged.
- Uh, location of offspring.

338
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:47,468
Acknowledged.

339
00:21:52,694 --> 00:21:55,083
<i>- Secretary blindfold?
- Mmm.</i>

340
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:57,907
Whale blanket.

341
00:22:03,478 --> 00:22:05,682
- Scratch pad horoscope.
- Hmm.

342
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:10,006
Chew bone.
Rubber belly flesh frame.

343
00:22:11,638 --> 00:22:16,853
Flesh frame jigsaw. Sneeze?

344
00:22:18,134 --> 00:22:20,044
Sneeze.

345
00:22:29,526 --> 00:22:32,275
<i>Generic greeting.</i>

346
00:22:32,343 --> 00:22:36,718
Generic greeting. Obligatory question
about the evening's activities.

347
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:40,500
Oh, qualified,
vaguely positive reply.

348
00:22:40,566 --> 00:22:44,625
Uninspired description of movie and
subsequent conversation with girlfriend.

349
00:23:00,662 --> 00:23:05,452
Ooh, really well-rehearsed speech
about workload and stress.

350
00:23:08,022 --> 00:23:09,877
Genuine sorrow.

351
00:23:09,942 --> 00:23:14,731
Um, truthful-sounding promises
of future satisfaction?

352
00:23:16,342 --> 00:23:18,252
Enticement to agree?

353
00:23:22,838 --> 00:23:24,910
- Accepted.
- Gratitude.

354
00:23:54,358 --> 00:23:56,213
I'm just going to make
this brief statement...

355
00:23:56,278 --> 00:23:59,212
on behalf
of A.R.H.A.D.L.

356
00:23:59,286 --> 00:24:04,021
The spreading of these erroneous and offensive
descriptions has gone on for decades...

357
00:24:04,086 --> 00:24:06,541
and we find ourselves
once again...

358
00:24:06,614 --> 00:24:08,883
having to make
a public statement.

359
00:24:08,951 --> 00:24:12,114
Racehorses do not urinate
more frequently...

360
00:24:12,182 --> 00:24:15,182
or at greater length
than non-racing horses...

361
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:19,248
or, for that matter,
any mammal of comparable size.

362
00:24:19,318 --> 00:24:23,344
This organized,
publicly-sanctioned slander must stop.

363
00:24:26,806 --> 00:24:29,173
<i>Lester Richards is dead...</i>

364
00:24:29,238 --> 00:24:31,791
<i>and aren't you glad
it wasn't you?</i>

365
00:24:31,862 --> 00:24:34,709
<i>Don't you wish
you felt something?</i>

366
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:39,727
<i>How many men here are attracted
to Shelly, his--his lovely wife?</i>

367
00:24:39,798 --> 00:24:41,653
<i>She's a babe.</i>

368
00:24:41,718 --> 00:24:45,330
<i>And how many women here wish that
their husbands would drop dead...</i>

369
00:24:45,398 --> 00:24:49,042
<i>and leave them
a big, fat insurance policy?</i>

370
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:51,565
<i>Yes, I thought so.</i>

371
00:24:51,638 --> 00:24:56,373
Hell, it'll be years before you figure out
what Lester's death really means.

372
00:24:56,438 --> 00:25:00,911
So let's forget the blah-blah-blah
and go have a drink. Amen.

373
00:25:00,982 --> 00:25:02,837
- Amen.
- Amen.

374
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:18,539
- Eccentric money.
- Mmm, nose army.

- Aw, genius kidney.

377
00:25:25,462 --> 00:25:29,040
Dine, dining, death rattle,
monkey callousness.

379
00:25:31,766 --> 00:25:33,675
Smell sign.

380

- Now?
- No. Not now.

381
00:25:45,558 --> 00:25:48,242
- But soon.
- Yeah, soon.

382
00:25:49,494 --> 00:25:53,455
Everybody thinks I'm the mole.
E-Everybody.

383
00:25:53,526 --> 00:25:56,909
And those people that don't think
I'm the mole, they think I'm the spy.

384
00:25:56,982 --> 00:26:00,211
I gotta find out who it really is
so people will stop thinking that.

385
00:26:00,278 --> 00:26:05,329
Listen. I think
this whole spy/mole thing...

386
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:07,537
is just a creation
of the Right-Hand Man...

387
00:26:07,606 --> 00:26:10,061
to keep everybody
paranoid and scared.

388
00:26:10,134 --> 00:26:13,712
I'm scared, but that's terrible, because that's
exactly how the mole would act...

389
00:26:13,782 --> 00:26:16,717
if he was trying
to not be the mole, you know?

390
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:19,245
l-I do-- I don't know
what to tell you.

391
00:26:19,318 --> 00:26:23,114
Well, I wish you would tell me something,
because you are the only person I trust.

392
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:25,972
Although, I don't believe
a word you say.

393
00:26:26,038 --> 00:26:28,110
Yesterday, you said,
"Appearances."

394
00:26:28,182 --> 00:26:30,833
I thought you said,
"A fear is this."

395
00:26:31,862 --> 00:26:33,749
<i>Weird.</i>

396
00:26:33,814 --> 00:26:36,301
"A fear is this."

397
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:50,160
<i>Hey, hey.
No, don't do that.</i>

398
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:52,467
<i>I mean, they won't let you,
but you shouldn't do that.</i>

399
00:26:52,534 --> 00:26:55,251
<i>I forget.
These new rules.</i>

400
00:26:55,318 --> 00:26:57,587
<i>- How's, um-- How's Diane?
- Terrible.</i>

401
00:26:57,654 --> 00:27:00,272
She's getting thinner every day.

402
00:27:00,342 --> 00:27:02,414
I mean, I really think
the woman has betrayed me...

403
00:27:02,486 --> 00:27:05,868
because when I married her nine months ago,
she was fat as a house.

404
00:27:05,942 --> 00:27:08,364
<i>- She was big. Big. Yeah.
- Huge. She was big.</i>

405
00:27:08,438 --> 00:27:11,155
Nice. And now,
nine months later...

406
00:27:11,222 --> 00:27:13,360
she's skinny
and getting skinnier.

407
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,339
I should have known.
They say...

408
00:27:15,414 --> 00:27:18,065
<i>- Her mom's thin. Yeah, right.
- "Look at the mother. "</i>

409
00:27:18,134 --> 00:27:20,272
<i>- I looked at the father.
- Yeah, 'cause her dad's big.</i>

410
00:27:20,342 --> 00:27:23,026
Right. I looked at him,
and I thought--

411
00:27:23,094 --> 00:27:25,777
But no, the mother and her,
they just sit all day...

412
00:27:25,846 --> 00:27:28,464
<i>- eating nothing on purpose--

413
00:27:28,533 --> 00:27:31,054
<i>- Munson!
- I'm-- I'm--</i>

414
00:27:31,126 --> 00:27:33,613
I'm formatting right now.
It's formatting.

415
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:36,271
Shit. Can you see this isn't on?

416
00:28:00,918 --> 00:28:02,773

417
00:28:02,838 --> 00:28:04,693

00:28:04,758 --> 00:28:06,930

- Uh, when do you think they'll be ready?

419
00:28:06,998 --> 00:28:08,907

- How are you?
- Can we have a word with you?

00:30:20,854 --> 00:30:24,269
- Sure, sure.
- We can't help but notice that
you're a fascinating character.

446
00:30:24,342 --> 00:30:27,440
- Very compelling.
- More fascinating than the things
you're being given to do.

447
00:30:27,509 --> 00:30:29,452
- Spraying houses.
- Taking pictures of yourself.

448
00:30:29,525 --> 00:30:31,827
- Driving around.
- We think you're in need of another venue.

00:30:31,893 --> 00:30:34,446
- In which you are the main attraction.
- And paid accordingly.

- Right.

- What guarantee do you have?

Oh, these guys are my friends.
I've worked with them before.

This is not our first project,

00:31:56,598 --> 00:32:00,013
Listen. This is the last time I'm taking
one of these calls. Do you understand me?

474
00:32:00,086 --> 00:32:03,566
- It's the right thing to do.
- No, it's not the right thing to do.
It's a betrayal.

475
00:32:03,638 --> 00:32:05,678
You're right.
And 50 is an insult.

476
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:08,237
You wouldn't be comfortable
with anything less than a hundred.

477
00:32:08,309 --> 00:32:10,895
They're tracing the calls here
because of the bomb threats...

478
00:32:10,966 --> 00:32:14,065
although you probably know that because
you're probably making the bomb threats.

479
00:32:14,134 --> 00:32:18,389
- We don't need bombs. We've got you.
- You don't have me.

480
00:32:18,453 --> 00:32:20,974
<i>Munson?
Munson!</i>

481
00:32:21,045 --> 00:32:24,842
Uh, uh, proofing.
Proofing. Right now.

482
00:32:24,918 --> 00:32:27,089
<i>- It's Rudolph Alan.
- What? What? What?</i>

483
00:32:27,157 --> 00:32:31,086
- He hit me.
- Unprovoked? He hit you.
For no reason, he hit you.

484
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:34,835
I said that I knew he'd been telling people
I was the mole, and he hit me!

485
00:32:34,902 --> 00:32:37,389
He's a hothead.
He hits everybody.

486
00:32:37,461 --> 00:32:41,007
Which is why he's a stupid choice
for a spy or a mole. He can't control himself.

487
00:32:41,078 --> 00:32:42,933
Which is the perfect cover.

488
00:32:42,998 --> 00:32:45,070
That way he's so obvious
about being a spy...

489
00:32:45,141 --> 00:32:48,556
that way no one knows
he's the actual spy.

490
00:32:48,629 --> 00:32:51,117
All right. All right.

491
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:53,426
What if the person
who is the mole...

492
00:32:53,494 --> 00:32:56,047
is so good
at being the mole...

493
00:32:56,118 --> 00:33:00,274
that the Right-Hand Man
picks him to be the spy?

494
00:33:00,341 --> 00:33:04,138
Wow. That's perfect. That way he could
manipulate his own investigation.

495
00:33:04,214 --> 00:33:07,061
<i>Right.Just like
in No Way Out.</i>

496
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:09,035
I gotta think about that.

497
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:24,270
I just have a sore spot.

498
00:33:24,341 --> 00:33:26,196
- Oh, you got a problem with your teeth?
- Mm-hmm.

499
00:33:26,261 --> 00:33:28,465
- I have just the guy.
- Really?

500
00:33:28,533 --> 00:33:31,315
Yeah. He does bleaching,
he does bonding, he does scraping.

501
00:33:31,381 --> 00:33:33,236
He does filing.
I go to him twice a week.

502
00:33:33,301 --> 00:33:37,098
- It's not bad.
- And he's cheap. And he speaks Italian.

503
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:42,222
- You speak Italian, don't you?
- No.

504
00:33:42,293 --> 00:33:44,749
Oh, well, anyway,
he's fabulous.

505
00:33:44,821 --> 00:33:47,636
- This is like,just a loose cap.
- I mean, look at my teeth.

506
00:33:47,701 --> 00:33:50,003
- Look. Look.
- They're gorgeous.

507
00:33:52,054 --> 00:33:54,672
- They're beautiful.
- Mm-hmm. I know.

508
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:58,287
Yeah, he does the lady on Channel 9.
You know, the one with the big teeth?

509
00:33:58,357 --> 00:34:00,462
- Wow. What's his name?
- Yeah.

510
00:34:00,533 --> 00:34:02,289
Dr. Korchek.

511
00:34:02,357 --> 00:34:04,146
- Dr. Korchek.
- Yeah. Oh.

512
00:34:04,213 --> 00:34:07,061
And if you ever have
a problem with bugs...

513
00:34:07,126 --> 00:34:09,330
I have just the guy.

514
00:34:09,398 --> 00:34:11,470
Bugs.

515
00:34:11,637 --> 00:34:14,387
The fallacy that work
under pressure...

516
00:34:14,454 --> 00:34:18,578
results in a direct pipeline
to creative genius...

517
00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:22,386
uh, that divine inspiration...

518
00:34:22,453 --> 00:34:24,875
can be conjured by...

519
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:26,924
well, anything but the most, uh...

520
00:34:27,957 --> 00:34:29,964
mind-bending concentration...

521
00:34:31,126 --> 00:34:33,330
now, this is
the world of the poseur--

522
00:34:33,398 --> 00:34:37,391
the, uh, pretender,
the fraud.

523
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:42,673
Th-- This is the worst
piece of shit I've ever read.

524
00:34:44,021 --> 00:34:47,152
<i>No, really. The worst!</i>

525
00:34:47,221 --> 00:34:50,189
What have you been doin',
Munson? Jackin' off all day?

526
00:34:50,262 --> 00:34:52,367
<i>Why did you give me this?</i>

527
00:34:52,438 --> 00:34:54,859
<i>- You said you wanted to see a draft.
- You're absolutely right.</i>

528
00:34:54,933 --> 00:34:57,169
<i>I said I wanted
to see a draft.</i>

529
00:34:57,238 --> 00:35:00,205
I didn't want to see a misdirected,
panic-induced...

530
00:35:00,278 --> 00:35:02,187
cretinous little piece of shit.

531
00:35:03,733 --> 00:35:06,188
Maybe if I were able to talk
to Mr. Schwitters, I could--

532
00:35:06,261 --> 00:35:08,116
You don't need to talk
to Mr. Schwitters.

533
00:35:08,181 --> 00:35:11,476
<i>He told me personally through his assistant
that I am to handle this.</i>

534
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:13,549
Is there any way
we could adjust the deadline?

535
00:35:13,622 --> 00:35:15,477
<i>- What's the deadline?
- Friday.</i>

536
00:35:15,542 --> 00:35:17,397
Okay, now it's Thursday.

537
00:35:17,462 --> 00:35:20,113
What's that moron?
The one that used to work in your section.

538
00:35:20,182 --> 00:35:22,516
The one who wore
the brown shirt all the time.

539
00:35:22,581 --> 00:35:26,411
- Oh, Nameless Numberheadman?
- Yeah. Send him in.

540
00:35:29,557 --> 00:35:32,906
- Here you go.
- Thanks. Uh, did they all come out okay?

541
00:35:32,981 --> 00:35:35,981
Yeah. Yeah, they came out. Okay?

542
00:35:36,054 --> 00:35:38,323
Great.

543
00:35:40,342 --> 00:35:45,076
He said it was 'cause I wasn't getting
any work done, but that is not true.

544
00:35:45,142 --> 00:35:48,916
And I know it's 'cause Nick
and Ellen and all those guys...

545
00:35:48,982 --> 00:35:50,869
told him I was the mole.

546
00:35:50,933 --> 00:35:52,788
<i>Listen to me.</i>

547
00:35:52,853 --> 00:35:54,763
Listen to me. The--

548
00:35:56,853 --> 00:35:58,763
There is no mole. Okay?

549
00:35:58,838 --> 00:36:02,383
- How do you know?
- Because I've been getting calls for weeks...

550
00:36:02,453 --> 00:36:05,617
from some guy offering me money
for information.

551
00:36:05,685 --> 00:36:09,362
If they had somebody inside, they would not
be calling me on the phone offering money.

552
00:36:09,429 --> 00:36:11,185
It doesn't make sense.

553
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:15,148
But maybe the calls
are coming from the spy...

554
00:36:15,221 --> 00:36:18,516
trying to trick you
into becoming a mole.

555
00:36:18,581 --> 00:36:21,997
I'm-- I'm not gonna miss you.

556
00:36:22,069 --> 00:36:24,273
Oh, call me
when that package shows up.

557
00:36:25,557 --> 00:36:28,721
<i>- Oh, okay.
- Do you have any money?</i>

558
00:36:28,789 --> 00:36:32,085
<i>- #Ba-boo #
- # Oh, my darling #</i>

559
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:34,516
<i># On my soul #</i>

560
00:37:00,534 --> 00:37:04,756
So... I walk
right into his office.

561
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:06,731
I said,
"Right-Hand Man...

562
00:37:08,021 --> 00:37:10,410
"Lester's dead.
He's gonna be dead a long time.

563
00:37:10,486 --> 00:37:13,300
<i>"When are you gonna put me in
my rightful position in his office...</i>

564
00:37:13,366 --> 00:37:15,570
where I belong?"

565
00:37:15,638 --> 00:37:17,809
Did you want some of these?
'Cause-- You sure?

566
00:37:19,638 --> 00:37:21,547
He had no expression
on his face at all.

567
00:37:21,621 --> 00:37:25,483
He said nothing except,
"Let me think about it."

568
00:37:25,557 --> 00:37:27,412
I said, "Think about it?

569
00:37:27,477 --> 00:37:31,219
Why don't you think
about this? I quit!"

570
00:37:31,285 --> 00:37:33,522
I said that.
I said the words, "I quit."

571
00:37:33,589 --> 00:37:37,298
I never felt so light in all my--
You sure you don't want any of these?

572
00:37:37,366 --> 00:37:39,733
Did you eat anything today
at all besides yogurt?

573
00:37:40,885 --> 00:37:43,307
So, lightly, feelin' great,
like a new man...

574
00:37:43,382 --> 00:37:45,389
I walk out, and it comes
crashing down on me...

575
00:37:45,461 --> 00:37:47,468
"Oh, my God.
Ten years down the drain."

576
00:37:47,541 --> 00:37:50,094
I drive home,
sink in my chair, and...

577
00:37:51,893 --> 00:37:54,577
I'm not ashamed to say
l-I cried.

578
00:37:54,646 --> 00:37:57,580
But it's better this way, right?
It's better.

579
00:37:57,653 --> 00:37:59,628
I don't want to end up
like Lester.

580
00:37:59,702 --> 00:38:01,611
You don't want me to end up--
Lester's dead!

581
00:38:01,685 --> 00:38:04,554
No one wants to be like Lester.
Not even Lester.

582
00:38:05,877 --> 00:38:08,332
I got it.
It's probably them.

583
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,819
<i>Eat, please.</i>

584
00:38:14,005 --> 00:38:15,947
<i>Hello.</i>

585
00:38:16,022 --> 00:38:17,931
<i>Uh,yeah,
this is he.</i>

586
00:38:19,189 --> 00:38:21,099
Um, yes.

587
00:38:22,742 --> 00:38:24,651
Uh, yeah.
l-I guess so. Um--

588
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:28,562
Yeah, I'll, uh, be home
the rest of the evening.

589
00:38:29,973 --> 00:38:33,999
If you want. Sure.
You're welcome to come by anytime.

590
00:38:34,069 --> 00:38:36,589
Maybe till, uh--
Well, l-I sleep here.

591
00:38:36,661 --> 00:38:39,411
I'll be here
all night.

592
00:38:39,477 --> 00:38:42,324
Okay.
Thank you very much.

593
00:38:42,389 --> 00:38:44,299

- Hi, it's me.

624
00:45:18,101 --> 00:45:20,686
I told him I'm gonna go to
a movie with Judy.

625
00:45:20,756 --> 00:45:23,178
So I'll be there at about
a quarter to 8:00.

626
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:25,424
Uh, okay.

627
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,005
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

628
00:45:37,076 --> 00:45:40,372
<i>I'm having an affair
with my wife.</i>

629
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:56,588
So, what is Fletcher
working on now?

630
00:45:58,773 --> 00:46:03,083
Uh, some speech
for Azimuth Schwitters.

631
00:46:04,629 --> 00:46:07,214
Oh, is this the one
on the 11 th?

632
00:46:07,284 --> 00:46:09,194
Mm-hmm.

633
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:12,428
And you said
he's having a hard time?

634
00:46:16,149 --> 00:46:20,273
Uh, I don't know.
It's-- I guess so.

635
00:46:25,332 --> 00:46:27,504
He comes in every night
with this, uh...

636
00:46:30,293 --> 00:46:32,202
"Honey, I'm home" face.

637
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,697
And he pretends
to like my cooking...

638
00:46:35,765 --> 00:46:38,099
which I know
I'm a shitty cook.

639
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:43,177
So, after supper,
I try to get him to talk, and...

640
00:46:44,661 --> 00:46:48,207
he's so preoccupied
that he doesn't hear what I say.

641
00:46:49,524 --> 00:46:51,597
So he doesn't want to talk.

642
00:46:51,669 --> 00:46:54,319
He doesn't wanna fuck.

643
00:46:54,389 --> 00:46:56,560
So I come here.

644
00:46:58,709 --> 00:47:01,426
Hmm.

645
00:47:01,493 --> 00:47:03,981
I better go. Oh.

646
00:47:05,365 --> 00:47:07,274
We never watched this.

647
00:47:09,813 --> 00:47:12,431
Well, bring it next time,
and we'll look at it.

648
00:47:21,781 --> 00:47:23,755
<i>Wh-Why don't you leave?</i>

649
00:47:24,725 --> 00:47:26,994
I'd like to get dressed first.

650
00:47:27,061 --> 00:47:29,778
<i>No. I mean,
why don't you leave him?</i>

651
00:47:29,844 --> 00:47:34,122
Oh. Oh. Uh, okay.
Then what?

652
00:47:34,196 --> 00:47:37,360
<i>Well, then we could--</i>

653
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:41,939
<i>- I mean, I could--
- Listen to you.</i>

654
00:47:42,005 --> 00:47:45,005
<i>- Like you know what you want?
- Well, I know I want you.</i>

655
00:47:45,077 --> 00:47:48,372
<i>I have all this money put away
that's just sitting there.</i>

656
00:47:50,004 --> 00:47:52,208
Will you think about it?

657
00:47:52,277 --> 00:47:54,382
Okay. I'll think about it.

658
00:47:58,133 --> 00:48:00,948
So, are you going to
Madam Rosa's tomorrow?

659
00:48:02,196 --> 00:48:04,051
I said I would.

660
00:48:05,461 --> 00:48:08,211
You say a lot of things.

661
00:48:08,277 --> 00:48:10,186
Bye.

662
00:48:19,253 --> 00:48:22,220
We interrupt this program
to bring you a news bulletin.

663
00:48:22,292 --> 00:48:26,897
Scientists at NASA have confirmed that
the comet Havarti is on course toward Earth.

664
00:48:26,965 --> 00:48:32,431
The odds of the comet colliding directly with
our planet are being calculated at this moment.

665
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,915
In a related story,
the price of capturing, restraining...

666
00:48:35,988 --> 00:48:38,890
and institutionalizing
a naked man in a T-shirt...

667
00:48:38,964 --> 00:48:43,154
remains stable at
around $367.50.

668
00:48:58,197 --> 00:48:59,953
Is that good?

669
00:49:00,117 --> 00:49:03,084
<i>This is very interesting.</i>

670
00:49:03,157 --> 00:49:05,491
<i>- What do you see?
- I see major changes.</i>

671
00:49:05,556 --> 00:49:07,891
<i>- Major changes.
- Really?</i>

672
00:49:07,957 --> 00:49:11,852
Yes. This is-- This is--
This is quite dramatic.

673
00:49:11,924 --> 00:49:14,958
You're going to be
experiencing major changes.

674
00:49:15,029 --> 00:49:17,233
- They involve a woman.
- Really.

675
00:49:17,301 --> 00:49:19,537
- Yes. I see a woman--
- But it's not my mother.

676
00:49:19,604 --> 00:49:23,728
No, it's not your mother. It's-- It's--
It's gonna be happening soon.

677
00:49:23,796 --> 00:49:27,058
It's-- It's something--
Well, it will require a move.

678
00:49:27,124 --> 00:49:29,459
It will require...

679
00:49:29,525 --> 00:49:31,380
drastic changes
in your life.

680
00:49:31,445 --> 00:49:35,274
Wow. Um, any idea
of a time frame?

681
00:49:35,349 --> 00:49:37,291
- No.
- A week? Tonight?

682
00:49:37,365 --> 00:49:39,220
- Uh, it will be soon.
- Soon?

683
00:49:39,285 --> 00:49:41,489
But this is--
This is a woman you don't know.

684
00:49:41,557 --> 00:49:44,557
- You haven't met her yet.
- Oh. Wow.

685
00:49:44,629 --> 00:49:48,273
This is big. This is going to be a big
transformation in your life.

686
00:50:27,477 --> 00:50:29,549
<i>- Morning, Rene.
- Good morning.</i>

687
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:31,475
<i>- How are you?
- I'm fine. How are you?</i>

688
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:33,362
Good. Uh, how's it
looking today?

689
00:50:33,428 --> 00:50:35,632
It's pretty busy today.

690
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,555
<i>- Really. Uh,
- Yes.</i>

691
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:41,036
why don't you give me about 10 minutes,
and then send the first patient in.

692
00:50:41,108 --> 00:50:43,497
- Okay.
- Great.

693
00:50:43,572 --> 00:50:47,729
All right.
Now, you see this, uh, shadow here, right?

694
00:50:47,797 --> 00:50:49,652
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay. That's our culprit.

695
00:50:49,717 --> 00:50:53,132
To fix that will be
a three-stage process.

696
00:50:53,205 --> 00:50:56,369
Do you think you can make
that sort of commitment?

697
00:50:56,437 --> 00:50:59,819
- Oh, yes.
- Great.

698
00:50:59,892 --> 00:51:02,194
You don't have to floss
all your teeth.

699
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,988
Just the ones
you want to keep.

700
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:10,027
Bob, that's a really
kind offer. It really is.

701
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:15,086
But I'm just dug in deep here.
I'm afraid Florida would really be a shock...

702
00:51:15,156 --> 00:51:18,452
although everybody I've talked to
just says great things about Tampa.

703
00:51:18,517 --> 00:51:21,615
Remember, be true
to your teeth...

704
00:51:21,684 --> 00:51:24,172
and they won't be false
to you.

705
00:51:25,429 --> 00:51:28,690
Carol, it's Dr. Korchek.
Is Greg in?

706
00:51:28,756 --> 00:51:32,139
No, he's not, Dr. Korchek.
Can I have him get back to you?

707
00:51:32,213 --> 00:51:35,115
Yes. Uh, tell him
to call me at my office.

708
00:51:35,189 --> 00:51:37,523
What time are you
expecting him?

709
00:51:37,588 --> 00:51:42,323
I'm not sure. He hasn't called in today,
uh, to check his messages.

710
00:51:42,388 --> 00:51:44,298
- All righty. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

711
00:51:44,372 --> 00:51:46,227
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

712
00:51:46,292 --> 00:51:51,628
<i>I may vote Republican,
but I'm a firm believer in gum control.</i>

713
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:00,784
<i>Do you have time
to squeeze someone in at 5:00?</i>

714
00:52:00,853 --> 00:52:03,886
<i>She was recommended by a patient,
and she's in some pain.</i>

715
00:52:03,956 --> 00:52:06,290
Um, okay.

716
00:52:06,357 --> 00:52:08,462
<i>And Mr. Martinez is here.</i>

717
00:52:09,684 --> 00:52:11,594
I'll be right out.

718
00:52:11,669 --> 00:52:14,222
Mr. Martinez.

719
00:52:14,293 --> 00:52:16,529
- How are you? Yeah.
- Hey, Doc.

720
00:52:16,596 --> 00:52:19,411
- Got terrible tooth.
- Oh, okay.

721
00:52:19,476 --> 00:52:23,371
Well, I'll tell you what.
Why don't you schedule some time with Rene.

722
00:52:23,445 --> 00:52:25,932
If anything has changed
since I saw you this morning...

723
00:52:26,004 --> 00:52:28,143
- we'll take care of it, okay?
- Thanks, Doc.

724
00:52:28,212 --> 00:52:29,805
All righty.

725
00:52:36,277 --> 00:52:39,441
Hi, how are you?
Dr. Korchek.

726
00:52:39,509 --> 00:52:43,305
Um, I think we're gonna be able to--
to squeeze you... in.

727
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:48,782
And, um, uh, if you'll just fill out
one of the insurance questionnaires--

728
00:52:48,853 --> 00:52:52,114
the name and address
and, uh, uh, phone number...

729
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:55,344
then we'll--
we'll get right to work.

730
00:52:55,412 --> 00:52:57,714
<i>- Thank you.
- Okay. Terrific.</i>

731
00:53:01,141 --> 00:53:04,785
All right.
I, um--

732
00:53:04,852 --> 00:53:07,754
I think I see what
your problem is...

733
00:53:07,828 --> 00:53:11,756
- and I think I can help you.
- Good.

734
00:53:11,828 --> 00:53:16,084
It may involve me
seeing you more than once.

735
00:53:16,149 --> 00:53:18,450
- That's fine.
- Okay.

736
00:53:18,517 --> 00:53:20,557
Then we'll
get started.

737
00:53:21,524 --> 00:53:24,426
Okay.

738
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,922
Here's my card.
There's a number there.

739
00:53:26,996 --> 00:53:29,713
Uh, you can reach me
after hours in the evening...

740
00:53:29,781 --> 00:53:33,709
just in case there's an emergency recurrence,
anything like that.

741
00:53:33,781 --> 00:53:38,603
<i>- This says Jiffy Massage.
- Oh. I was holding that for Rene.</i>

742
00:53:38,677 --> 00:53:42,768
<i>Um, if there's a problem,
contact me.</i>

743
00:53:42,836 --> 00:53:45,454
Thank you.

744
00:53:45,524 --> 00:53:47,434
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>

<i>Dear Attractive Woman #2:</i>

746
00:54:01,172 --> 00:54:03,889
<i>Only once in my life
have I responded to another person...</i>

747
00:54:03,956 --> 00:54:06,323
<i>the way I've responded to you.</i>

748
00:54:06,388 --> 00:54:10,960
<i>But I've forgotten when it was,
or even if it was in fact me that responded.</i>

749
00:54:14,068 --> 00:54:19,600
<i>I may not know much, but I know
that the wind sings your name endlessly...</i>

<i>although with a slight lisp
that makes it difficult to understand...</i>

751
00:54:22,997 --> 00:54:24,906
<i>if I'm standing
near an air conditioner.</i>

752
00:54:29,972 --> 00:54:32,874
<i>I know that your hair
sits atop of your head as though...</i>

753
00:54:32,949 --> 00:54:34,803
<i>it could sit nowhere else.</i>

754
00:54:38,516 --> 00:54:43,305
<i>I know that your figure
would make a sculptor cast aside his tools...</i>

755
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:46,828
<i>injuring his assistant who was looking out
the window instead of paying attention.</i>

756
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:53,006
<i>I know that your lips are as full
as that sexy French model's...</i>

757
00:54:53,076 --> 00:54:55,345
<i>that I desperately want to fuck.</i>

758

have you lie next to me...</i>

759
00:55:05,396 --> 00:55:09,422
<i>or on top of me, or sit on me,
or stand over me and shake...</i>

760
00:55:09,492 --> 00:55:13,038

How's that? Is that-- Is that good?

767
00:55:43,892 --> 00:55:46,794

Shut up! Is that all right? Is that good?

<i>For two months.</i>

769

00:55:51,476 --> 00:55:54,509
I miss you. I want to kiss you.
Come down and--you know.

771
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:56,238
- Right.
- I get down there...

772
00:55:56,308 --> 00:55:59,156
<i>- last night at midnight,
there's somebody else there.
- Oh.</i>

773
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:01,075
<i>And the fucking bus
is gone.</i>

774
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:04,075
- I gotta wait till 5:00
in the morning for the next bus.
- Right.

775
00:56:04,149 --> 00:56:07,444
Anyway. It'll just be
for a few days, man.

776
00:56:07,508 --> 00:56:09,996
I can't.
I just can't do it.

777
00:56:10,068 --> 00:56:14,094
I can't. And I gotta tell you, you know,
this whole drug thing, uh--

778
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:17,194
I'm a doctor.
I can get you drugs.

779
00:56:17,268 --> 00:56:20,400
You shouldn't be hanging out with these--
these thugs, these criminals.

780
00:56:20,469 --> 00:56:22,835
- You can come to me.
- Heroin?

781
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:27,821
No. Heroin l-- I can't get. But Darvocet
I can get in enormous quantities.

782
00:56:27,893 --> 00:56:31,275
Darvocet?
What do I look like, a housewife?

783
00:56:31,348 --> 00:56:33,104
Well, consider it
a standing offer.

784
00:56:33,172 --> 00:56:35,114
Just be for a few days.
Come on.

785
00:56:35,188 --> 00:56:39,443
I can't. l-- l--
I'm repainting the-- the house now.

786
00:56:39,508 --> 00:56:41,418
It's just--
It's a terrible time.

787
00:56:41,492 --> 00:56:43,826
It's perfect.

788
00:56:43,892 --> 00:56:46,991
For 10,000 bucks,
I'll paint the house.

789
00:56:48,309 --> 00:56:51,625
That's-- That's an outrageous figure.
You know that.

790
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:54,155
For painting a house.

791
00:56:54,228 --> 00:56:59,149
But I'll-- I'll get this.
Don't worry about this. This is on me. Okay?

792
00:56:59,221 --> 00:57:02,832
And then another funny thing
happened, followed by two things...

793
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:05,388
that were pretty amusing.

794
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:09,967
And the whole thing ended
with something that was just hysterical.

795
00:57:39,284 --> 00:57:41,870
<i>Hello?</i>

796
00:57:45,652 --> 00:57:48,620
<i>- I did it.
- You did what?</i>

797
00:57:48,692 --> 00:57:52,369
I thought about what you said, and I left him.

798
00:57:54,292 --> 00:57:56,562
That's great.

799
00:57:56,628 --> 00:57:59,475
<i>Tsk. Oh, honey.</i>

800
00:58:00,948 --> 00:58:03,566
Oh, that's great.

801
00:58:14,996 --> 00:58:17,265
<i>- Um, before you do that,
- Mm-hmm?</i>

802
00:58:17,332 --> 00:58:19,307
I need to
tell you something.

803
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:22,227
- What?
- Um...

804
00:58:22,292 --> 00:58:24,877
- today at work,
- Mm-hmm.

805
00:58:24,948 --> 00:58:27,818
l-- I met this person.

806
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:32,013
- "This person"?
- Yeah.

807
00:58:32,084 --> 00:58:34,157
Is it a male
or female?

808
00:58:34,228 --> 00:58:36,781
- It was a woman person.
- Uh-huh.

809
00:58:36,852 --> 00:58:40,594
And, um,
something happened.

810
00:58:42,996 --> 00:58:46,379
- What happened?
- Well, something happened for me.

811
00:58:46,452 --> 00:58:49,583
I don't think that
anything happened for her necessarily...

812
00:58:49,652 --> 00:58:51,986
but something happened for me--
this feeling.

813
00:58:52,052 --> 00:58:55,118
- Mm-hmm.
- Like this kind of falling for someone feeling.

814
00:58:55,188 --> 00:58:57,359
Falling like you
fell for me feeling?

815
00:58:57,428 --> 00:58:59,817
Well...

816
00:58:59,892 --> 00:59:03,274
with us it was more, I think,
of an incline than a fall.

817
00:59:03,348 --> 00:59:05,258
It wasn't like--
You know what I mean?

818
00:59:05,332 --> 00:59:07,820
- So--
- The result was the same, but it wasn't a fall.

819
00:59:07,892 --> 00:59:09,747
It was a slide.

820
00:59:09,812 --> 00:59:12,332
But this was a fall,
I think.

821
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:15,628
So?

822
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:20,522
So, I thought I should
say something about it before--

823
00:59:20,596 --> 00:59:22,768
- "Before."
- You know.

824
00:59:24,788 --> 00:59:26,698
<i>Yeah.</i>

825
00:59:28,468 --> 00:59:30,323
Hmm.

826
00:59:30,388 --> 00:59:32,298
Are you--
Are you leaving?

827
00:59:32,372 --> 00:59:34,706
Don't talk to me,
you worm.

828
00:59:39,604 --> 00:59:42,418
There was a time--

829
00:59:42,484 --> 00:59:45,298
There was a time
when I felt like an old rag...

830
00:59:45,364 --> 00:59:47,371
with a stain that
you couldn't get out.

831
00:59:47,444 --> 00:59:49,811
And you were like--

832
00:59:49,876 --> 00:59:53,171
You were like a piece
of rotting fruit on a windowsill.

833
00:59:54,356 --> 00:59:56,330
And it was great.

834
01:00:06,228 --> 01:00:08,399
You worm!

835
01:00:14,708 --> 01:00:18,702
The federal government announced today that,
in an effort to eradicate the national debt...

836
01:00:18,772 --> 01:00:22,384
it will be selling the state of Rhode Island
to a group of private investors...

837
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,819
for a reported
$18 billion.

838
01:00:24,884 --> 01:00:28,845
The investors plan to enclose
the entire state with an all-weather roof...

839
01:00:28,916 --> 01:00:31,534
and turn it into the world's
largest shopping mall.

840
01:00:31,604 --> 01:00:34,637
When asked for comment,
a White House spokesperson would only say...

841
01:00:34,708 --> 01:00:37,675
"Well, at least we didn't sell it
to the fucking Japanese."

842
01:00:52,852 --> 01:00:55,754
- Your brother.
- You're-- You're looking for my brother?

843
01:00:55,828 --> 01:00:58,894
I don't know where he is.
He wanted to stay with me, but l--

844
01:00:58,964 --> 01:01:02,128
Eight hours,
your brother, $15,000.

845
01:01:02,196 --> 01:01:05,491
$15,000, my brother,
eight hours?

846
01:01:05,556 --> 01:01:08,971
<i>- Well, but if--
- Your brother...</i>

847
01:01:09,044 --> 01:01:13,200
<i>- $ 15,000, eight hours.
- Okay, but if I can't find my brother...</i>

848
01:01:13,268 --> 01:01:15,178
um, can I give you
the $15,000?

849
01:01:15,252 --> 01:01:17,641
Do you still need
my brother, or--

850
01:01:17,716 --> 01:01:19,985
Eight hours,
your brother, $15,000.

851
01:01:20,052 --> 01:01:22,124
- All three of those things.
- Correct.

852
01:01:22,196 --> 01:01:25,163
- All three. Um--
- Correct. Correct.

853
01:01:25,236 --> 01:01:27,887
The keys?
You're gonna take the car?

854
01:01:27,956 --> 01:01:30,061
- The tape.
- You want the tape?

855
01:01:31,028 --> 01:01:33,166
- The tape.
- The tape.

856
01:01:38,836 --> 01:01:42,033
- Eight hours.
- Okay. You've got a little tartar buildup there.

857
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:44,009
You may wanna--

858
01:01:46,004 --> 01:01:48,939
<i>You wanna see aggression?
You wanna see vitality?</i>

859
01:01:49,012 --> 01:01:50,866
You wanna see me,
son of a bitch.

860
01:01:50,932 --> 01:01:55,056
Look at this. Fuckin' total disregard.
Fuckin' total disregard.

861
01:01:55,124 --> 01:01:57,164
Federal government.
Stinkin' fucks!

862
01:01:58,899 --> 01:02:01,387
Hey, what the hell
you doin'?

863
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:03,369
Hey! Hey! Hey! W-Wait! Wait!

864
01:02:03,443 --> 01:02:06,193
Hey, hey! Come on!
Come on! What are you doin'?

865
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:09,260
What are you doin'?
The son of a bitch is after me. Hey! Hey!

866
01:02:09,332 --> 01:02:11,154
Hey, hey!
Get him off of me!

867
01:02:11,316 --> 01:02:14,186
Okay, Mr. Tribby.

868
01:02:14,259 --> 01:02:19,081
I'm gonna recommend that you come in
every four months instead of every six...

869
01:02:19,156 --> 01:02:24,459
because you tend to build up calculus
at a slightly accelerated rate.

870
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:26,419
- Okay.
- Okay?

871
01:02:26,483 --> 01:02:28,338
You going to
the big event on Friday?

872
01:02:28,403 --> 01:02:31,665
I wouldn't put money in his pocket.

873
01:02:31,732 --> 01:02:34,449
- Oh?
- I don't need to.

874
01:02:34,516 --> 01:02:36,971
Got myself a defector.

875
01:02:37,043 --> 01:02:39,793
Classic disgruntled employee.

876
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:43,984
- I see.
- He's gonna provide
all the information we need.

877
01:02:44,052 --> 01:02:47,762
-Any messages for me?
-You do have one urgent message.

878
01:02:47,828 --> 01:02:50,675
<i>- From?
- Your brother.</i>

879
01:02:51,828 --> 01:02:54,283
Oh, he--
he seems really happy, you know.

880
01:02:54,356 --> 01:02:57,422
He actually enjoys
going to work in the morning.

881
01:02:57,492 --> 01:03:01,551
And what is it, uh,
exactly that he's doing?

882
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:04,881
I don't know.
He's getting paid as some sort of...

883
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:07,119
consultant or something.

884
01:03:07,188 --> 01:03:09,392
I see.

885
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:14,348
Oh, um, did you get a call
from an Attractive Woman #2?

886
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:17,387
l-- I told her
to come see you.

887
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:20,046
- Yes. She did come see me.
- Hmm.

888
01:03:20,116 --> 01:03:22,669
So, do you think
you can help her?

889
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:25,041
Yes, I do think
I can help her.

890
01:03:27,156 --> 01:03:29,065
<i>Is it about the money?</i>

891
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:33,231
Elmo Oxygen is
not about... money.

892
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:36,431
What is it then?

893
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,572
Elmo is not feeling...

894
01:03:39,764 --> 01:03:42,098
fulfilled.

895
01:03:42,164 --> 01:03:46,223
There's a spiritual...
element...

896
01:03:46,292 --> 01:03:48,147
missing.

897
01:03:49,876 --> 01:03:52,243
- "A spiritual element--"
- "Missing."

898
01:03:52,308 --> 01:03:56,945
Elmo needs his
other side to speak.

899
01:03:58,324 --> 01:04:00,266
His tender side.

900
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:02,347
His...

901
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:04,275
feminine side.

902
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:08,366
- Uh-- When you say this other side...
- This tender, feminine side.

903
01:04:08,436 --> 01:04:12,265
must speak, do you mean
literally speak?

904
01:04:12,339 --> 01:04:14,379
Say dialogue?

905
01:04:15,444 --> 01:04:19,666
Language does not always
require speech.

906
01:04:21,108 --> 01:04:23,180
We're a little confused.

907
01:04:24,148 --> 01:04:26,668
Actually more than a little.

908
01:04:26,739 --> 01:04:29,968
All right. If metaphors are too complicated
for you, let me explain it.

909
01:04:30,035 --> 01:04:34,345
<i>I want you to get me that little P.A.--
the one that wears black and the clogs.</i>

910
01:04:34,419 --> 01:04:36,307
I would like to
fuck her, please.

911
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:39,187
<i>And I want you two guys
to write us a scene.</i>

912
01:04:39,252 --> 01:04:41,673
Now, what is so confusing about that?
I don't understand.

913
01:04:41,747 --> 01:04:45,424
- Of course.
- This is fine, Elmo. We want you to be happy.

914
01:04:45,491 --> 01:04:48,175
<i>- I don't mean to be difficult.
- Oh, you don't know difficult.</i>

915
01:04:48,244 --> 01:04:51,146
<i>- Is there anything else we can do?
- How about a bowl of fruit?</i>

916
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:53,074
<i>- Yeah.
- Fruit would be good. Yeah.</i>

917
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:57,166
- Good, good. Okay. Um, anything else?
-Just name it.

918
01:04:57,236 --> 01:04:59,472
Elmo is tired now.

919
01:05:08,116 --> 01:05:11,345
I'm... glad you feel that way.
That's the way I feel too.

920
01:05:13,587 --> 01:05:16,904
Have you thought about
how you f-- No.

921
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:18,922
Can I tell you how I feel?

922
01:05:20,436 --> 01:05:22,989
- Is there something that--

923
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:26,191
<i>- Yeah.
- There's a registered letter
here you have to sign for.</i>

924
01:05:26,259 --> 01:05:28,561
<i>- A what?
- A registered letter.</i>

925
01:05:28,628 --> 01:05:30,483
Okay. Thanks.

926
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:35,602
- From the office ofTunnel--
- Fennel--

927
01:05:35,667 --> 01:05:39,115
- And Funnel.
- We represent the interests
of Attractive Woman #2.

928
01:05:39,188 --> 01:05:41,938
- Oh, no.
- Who received from you...

929
01:05:42,004 --> 01:05:45,168
on 10 February 1995,
a letter--

930
01:05:45,236 --> 01:05:48,236
The full content of which
is reproduced below for your benefit.

931
01:05:48,308 --> 01:05:50,828
- Oh, my God.
- Which is so explicit in nature--

932
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:55,439
- And intent--
- That we will pursue a case of
sexual harassment against you.

933
01:05:55,508 --> 01:05:57,842
- Oh, shit.
- We draw your attention...

934
01:05:57,908 --> 01:06:00,274
to underlined sections
one through four.

935
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:04,136
- This is bad.
- "That sexy French model that
I desperately want to fuck."

936
01:06:04,211 --> 01:06:08,521
"Have you lie next to me,
or... on top of me."

937
01:06:08,596 --> 01:06:11,760
- "Or sit on me."
- "Or stand over me and shake."

938
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:15,089
Oh, my God.

939
01:06:25,972 --> 01:06:28,754
<i>- David Stanley on two.
- Ah.</i>

940
01:06:29,908 --> 01:06:32,177
- David.
- Dr. Korchek, how are you?

941
01:06:32,243 --> 01:06:35,440
Uh, wonderful.
Where's Greg?

942
01:06:35,508 --> 01:06:38,857
Greg? Greg
has disappeared.

943
01:06:38,931 --> 01:06:43,023
Uh, I'm getting that feeling, but I'm--
What I want to know is--

944
01:06:43,092 --> 01:06:45,481
I mean he's disappeared
on purpose...

945
01:06:45,556 --> 01:06:49,134
<i>with all of your money--
with all of our money.</i>

946
01:06:49,204 --> 01:06:52,815
He's cleaned us out,
and, uh, we don't know where he is.

947
01:06:56,948 --> 01:07:00,243
Um--

948
01:07:00,307 --> 01:07:02,162
And?

949
01:07:02,227 --> 01:07:05,904
Well, obviously we're--
We've contacted the authorities...

950
01:07:05,972 --> 01:07:08,241
and, uh, we're doing
everything we can.

951
01:07:09,268 --> 01:07:11,635
Okay. All right.

952
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:14,799
Um, all right. l--
Then I'll speak to you soon.

953
01:07:14,868 --> 01:07:17,039
Okay. Bye-bye.

954
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:28,397
Has it--
Has it been eight hours?

955
01:07:30,196 --> 01:07:33,065
<i>So, we see, time and again...</i>

956
01:07:33,139 --> 01:07:36,270
that a man cannot escape
his own nature.

957
01:07:38,228 --> 01:07:42,319
But instead he must reconcile himself
to that nature.

958
01:07:42,387 --> 01:07:44,776
See, we are
what we pretend to be...

959
01:07:45,908 --> 01:07:51,342
because we pretend to be
what we really are.

960
01:07:51,412 --> 01:07:54,281
The act is not an act.

961
01:08:31,572 --> 01:08:34,289
The plan was I was gonna go back to work
after Emily was born...

962
01:08:34,356 --> 01:08:36,876
but it didn't really
work out that way.

963
01:08:36,947 --> 01:08:40,209
Well, I was going through
my second divorce...

964
01:08:40,276 --> 01:08:43,985
when I went to apply for a job
at Schwitters world headquarters.

965
01:08:44,052 --> 01:08:46,059
And I got the job.

966
01:08:46,132 --> 01:08:48,685
And I'd been there
about a week...

967
01:08:48,756 --> 01:08:52,498
when someone told me
Mr. Schwitters wanted to see me.

968
01:08:52,563 --> 01:08:55,181
So he took me
out to dinner.

969
01:08:55,251 --> 01:08:57,968
At the end of dinner,
he proposed.

970
01:08:58,035 --> 01:09:01,680
Fortunately, Lester was
well-insured.

971
01:09:01,748 --> 01:09:04,169
So I plan on selling
the house...

972
01:09:04,243 --> 01:09:08,651
and taking all the money
and traveling.

973
01:09:08,723 --> 01:09:10,578
I've always wanted
to travel...

974
01:09:10,643 --> 01:09:13,163
but, um, not with Lester.

975
01:09:13,235 --> 01:09:17,742
As I understand it, I'm supposed to
look like somebody's wife. Is that right?

976
01:09:17,812 --> 01:09:19,983
- No.
- Yes.

977
01:09:20,051 --> 01:09:22,288
I'd like something
more important to do.

978
01:09:27,252 --> 01:09:29,902
You done?

979
01:09:30,867 --> 01:09:32,722
- Mmm.
- Hello?

980
01:09:37,268 --> 01:09:39,657
Oh, my God. When?

981
01:09:41,652 --> 01:09:44,270
Did somebody call Shelly?

982
01:09:48,243 --> 01:09:52,105
Wow. Um,
so now what?

983
01:09:52,179 --> 01:09:54,667
Who's gonna take over?

984
01:09:56,564 --> 01:10:00,720
Oh, boy.

985
01:10:02,195 --> 01:10:05,010
Okay. Does this, uh--
Does this mean that you're gonna be late?

986
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:16,842
Okay. Bye.

987
01:10:16,915 --> 01:10:18,770
What did you drop?

988
01:10:23,251 --> 01:10:26,153
Derrick was kidnapped
and held hostage.

989
01:10:26,228 --> 01:10:30,254
<i>And Gassim, who may work
for either the Mossad or the P.L.O....</i>

990
01:10:30,323 --> 01:10:34,284
married Sue Ellen so he could
get information on Sue Ellen's brother...

991
01:10:34,356 --> 01:10:36,395
who is the prince
of Saudi Arabia.

992
01:10:36,467 --> 01:10:39,883
Wow. Amazing what you can
miss when you skip a day.

993
01:10:39,955 --> 01:10:42,411
I know. Oh.
Hang on just a minute, Deb.

994
01:10:42,483 --> 01:10:45,004
There's somebody at the door.

995
01:10:45,076 --> 01:10:46,985
<i>Okay. Thank you.</i>

996
01:10:47,059 --> 01:10:49,393
<i>I don't know. It's some package.</i>

997
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:51,314
What is it?

998
01:10:56,499 --> 01:11:00,874
- Oh. Deb, let me call you back, okay?
- Sure.

999
01:11:10,579 --> 01:11:13,427
It's these huge women having sex...

1000
01:11:13,491 --> 01:11:15,564
with these little,
tiny men.

1001
01:11:19,283 --> 01:11:21,138
I was planning on it.

1002
01:11:21,203 --> 01:11:23,886
Call me if we're still on.

1003
01:11:32,403 --> 01:11:34,345
<i>Hello.</i>

1004
01:11:38,867 --> 01:11:42,184
Oh, spaghetti and soft rolls.
Your favorite.

1005
01:11:55,059 --> 01:11:58,092
I told him I'm gonna see
a movie with Judy.

1006
01:11:58,163 --> 01:12:00,236
So I'll be there
about quarter to 8:00.

1007
01:12:02,483 --> 01:12:04,938
Okay, I'm gonna go.
I'll be back by 10:00.

1008
01:12:05,011 --> 01:12:07,432
And Emily's in the TV room.

1009
01:12:20,307 --> 01:12:23,537
Say you love me.

1010
01:12:25,779 --> 01:12:28,397
Say you need me.

1011
01:12:28,467 --> 01:12:31,533
Say...

1012
01:12:31,603 --> 01:12:33,774
I'm the most important
person in your life.

1013
01:12:38,483 --> 01:12:41,069
I love it when you say those things.

1014
01:12:44,979 --> 01:12:46,834
<i>Hi.</i>

1015
01:12:49,491 --> 01:12:52,939
Oh, the movie wasn't that great,
butJudy was fun...

1016
01:12:53,011 --> 01:12:56,589
and it was nice to get out of the house.

1017
01:13:25,299 --> 01:13:27,917
Okay.

1018
01:13:37,075 --> 01:13:40,687
<i>Lester Richards was a man
beloved by family...</i>

1019
01:13:40,756 --> 01:13:42,610
<i>friends and colleagues.</i>

1020
01:13:42,676 --> 01:13:47,531
<i>A man who leaves behind
a legacy oflove, good work...</i>

1021
01:13:47,603 --> 01:13:51,531
<i>and a sincere and genuine interest
in other people's lives.</i>

1022
01:13:51,603 --> 01:13:55,629
<i>But why not find inspiration
from this sorrowful event?</i>

1023
01:13:55,699 --> 01:14:00,849
Inspiration to say the kind words
and do the good deed now...

1024
01:14:00,916 --> 01:14:04,778
<i>immediately upon thinking them
or feeling them.</i>

1025
01:14:04,851 --> 01:14:09,391
<i>Time is in glorious abundance
to those who procrastinate.</i>

1026
01:14:28,819 --> 01:14:31,470
Hello.

1027
01:14:31,539 --> 01:14:33,393
Fine.

1028
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:39,983
About four points.

1029
01:14:42,675 --> 01:14:46,188
That's right.

1030
01:14:48,019 --> 01:14:50,059
You may be right
about that one.

1031
01:14:50,131 --> 01:14:53,197
Okay.

1032
01:15:16,147 --> 01:15:20,752
If you'll keep her just tonight,
I'll come by and pick her up tomorrow.

1033
01:15:25,971 --> 01:15:29,746
Call my mother.
She'll call me.

1034
01:16:00,723 --> 01:16:02,577
Oh. Yeah.

1035
01:16:17,427 --> 01:16:19,794
Oh.

1036
01:16:21,459 --> 01:16:23,368
Right.

1037
01:16:33,299 --> 01:16:36,780
Oh. Absolutely.
Um, yeah.

1038
01:16:36,851 --> 01:16:38,738
Of course.

1039
01:16:41,747 --> 01:16:45,292
Oh, you worm!

1040
01:16:46,419 --> 01:16:49,485
You know,
you accepted that job...

1041
01:16:49,555 --> 01:16:54,127
just before I accepted your invitation
to move in with you.

1042
01:16:54,195 --> 01:16:56,813
I mean, too bad
about the timing.

1043
01:16:56,883 --> 01:17:00,266
If I had waited
just a little longer...

1044
01:17:00,339 --> 01:17:02,859
you could have been gone.

1045
01:17:05,779 --> 01:17:07,786
You worm!

1046
01:18:15,411 --> 01:18:17,321
Uh--

1047
01:18:23,315 --> 01:18:25,257
Uh...

1048
01:18:26,707 --> 01:18:28,562
a little.

1049
01:18:28,627 --> 01:18:32,271
No. I, uh--

1050
01:18:33,907 --> 01:18:36,362
I don't know. l--

1051
01:18:36,435 --> 01:18:40,112
It's not a-- a physical kind of tired.
It's different.

1052
01:18:42,515 --> 01:18:44,424
Maybe.

1053
01:18:49,811 --> 01:18:51,720
You're very accommodating.

1054
01:18:51,795 --> 01:18:54,217
Hmm.

1055
01:18:57,587 --> 01:18:59,758
Okay.

1056
01:19:03,347 --> 01:19:06,860
<i>I want to go.</i>

1057
01:19:08,403 --> 01:19:10,312
To your room.

1058
01:19:22,483 --> 01:19:24,817
I could be happy
just doing this.

1059
01:19:34,995 --> 01:19:38,508
It's funny to think about
all the people I've known...

1060
01:19:38,579 --> 01:19:41,067
and all the decisions
I've made...

1061
01:19:41,139 --> 01:19:44,783
coming together
at this point.

1062
01:19:48,787 --> 01:19:50,926
I'm glad we know each other.

1063
01:19:56,595 --> 01:19:58,504
Hmm.

1064
01:20:02,227 --> 01:20:05,194
<i>Over the past decade,
the enormous expansion of Eventualism...</i>

1065
01:20:05,266 --> 01:20:09,969
<i>across the continent proves the absolute
and essential role of Eventualism...</i>

1066
01:20:10,035 --> 01:20:15,436
in all realms of life, be it metaphysics,
psychology, art, what have you.

1067
01:20:15,507 --> 01:20:19,566
The public perception of reality before
Eventualism was inadequate.

1068
01:20:19,635 --> 01:20:21,740
<i>Eventualism provides one...</i>

1069
01:20:21,811 --> 01:20:26,600
<i>with nothing less than
a transcendent idea of reality.</i>

1070
01:20:26,675 --> 01:20:30,319
<i>Soon its influence will extend beyond
the tangible empirical world...</i>

1071
01:20:30,386 --> 01:20:34,609
<i>and into the collective unconscious,
where it will become even more powerful.</i>

1072
01:20:34,674 --> 01:20:37,424
Eventualism is the long
overdue recognition...

1073
01:20:37,491 --> 01:20:40,338
of people everywhere
of their own significance.

1074
01:21:41,747 --> 01:21:43,656
Is it finished?

1075
01:21:43,731 --> 01:21:45,935
Yeah, it's finished.

1076
01:21:47,059 --> 01:21:49,230
<i>Are you pleased?</i>

1077
01:21:51,986 --> 01:21:54,321
I am actually.

1078
01:21:58,642 --> 01:22:02,701
A New Mexico woman was named
final arbiter of taste and justice today...

1079
01:22:02,771 --> 01:22:06,448
ending God's lengthy search
for someone to straighten this country out.

1080
01:22:06,515 --> 01:22:10,574
Eileen Harriet Paulglace
will have final say on every known subject...

1081
01:22:10,643 --> 01:22:14,254
including who should be put to death,
what clothes everyone should wear...

1082
01:22:14,322 --> 01:22:18,959
what movies suck and whether bald men
who grow ponytails should still get laid.

1083
01:22:22,163 --> 01:22:24,017
They tried his house?

1084
01:22:24,083 --> 01:22:28,043
- There was nobody there.
- Did they call, or did somebody
actually go over there?

1085
01:22:28,114 --> 01:22:30,318
Both.

1086
01:22:33,202 --> 01:22:35,569
Maybe somebody gave him
another offer.

1087
01:22:40,242 --> 01:22:42,152
Did you write this?

1088
01:22:43,347 --> 01:22:45,256
Yes.

1089
01:22:46,450 --> 01:22:49,265
It's very good.
He'll be pleased.

1090
01:22:50,515 --> 01:22:54,443
<i>Not only are you writing
his words...</i>

1091
01:22:54,515 --> 01:22:56,424
you are speaking
his language.

1092
01:22:56,498 --> 01:23:00,459
<i>You know, when I first got here,
we had a saying.</i>

1093
01:23:15,666 --> 01:23:17,576
I'll just--

1094
01:23:33,490 --> 01:23:36,305
Mr. Schwitters, it's such an exciting thing
to have you here today.

1095
01:23:36,370 --> 01:23:38,825
- Terrific.
- My life was a complete mess...

1096
01:23:38,898 --> 01:23:42,793
- until I read your books and
found out about your philosophy.
- Yeah. I'm sure it was.

1097
01:23:42,867 --> 01:23:45,801
- I'd been divorced three times. I was about--
- Let's get Munson.

1098
01:23:45,874 --> 01:23:47,882
- Okay. Hey, Munson. Munson!
- The day after...

1099
01:23:47,954 --> 01:23:49,864
I read your book
was just so exciting.

1100
01:23:49,939 --> 01:23:52,208
- I found out how to control my mind--
- Great speech.

1101
01:23:52,275 --> 01:23:55,657
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah. It was a great speech.

1102
01:23:55,730 --> 01:23:58,730
- Go ahead. I'm listening.
- Well,just to know that you're here--

1103
01:23:58,802 --> 01:24:01,486
I mean, and your philosophy
changed my entire life.

1104
01:24:01,555 --> 01:24:03,409
- Fabulous.
- And everyone that l--

1105
01:24:12,627 --> 01:24:14,536
Yeah. I mean, I'm not
mechanically incl--

1106
01:24:14,610 --> 01:24:17,926
Hi. Excuse me. Mrs. Schwitters,
I wanted to introduce myself.

1107
01:24:18,002 --> 01:24:19,857
- My name is Fletcher Munson.
- Hi.

1108
01:24:19,922 --> 01:24:21,897
- Um--
- Hi.

1109
01:24:21,971 --> 01:24:24,556
I thought maybe your husband
had mentioned me.

1110
01:24:24,626 --> 01:24:29,165
I've been working for him
the last few days... closely.

1111
01:24:29,234 --> 01:24:31,122
No.

1112
01:24:31,186 --> 01:24:33,325
Oh. Well--

1113
01:24:33,395 --> 01:24:36,777
You know what? He's been really busy
writing this speech that he's doing today.

1114
01:24:36,850 --> 01:24:40,014
- So maybe that's why.
- That's probably it then.

1115
01:24:40,082 --> 01:24:42,471
- Yeah.
- Anyway. Well,just wanted to say hi.

1116
01:24:42,547 --> 01:24:45,264
- Well, nice meeting you.
- Nice to meet you. Bye.

1117
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:47,239
Bye.

1118
01:24:55,858 --> 01:24:57,997
What time is it?

1119
01:24:58,066 --> 01:25:00,936
About five after.

1120
01:25:01,010 --> 01:25:05,036
I didn't ask you what time it is about.
I asked you what time it is.

1121
01:25:05,106 --> 01:25:07,016
It's three after 8:00.

1122
01:25:07,091 --> 01:25:09,774
- And what time does the speech start?
- 8:00.

1123
01:25:09,842 --> 01:25:11,784
"8:00"?

1124
01:25:27,411 --> 01:25:29,778
Ladies and gentlemen...

1125
01:25:29,842 --> 01:25:32,908
once in a very great while...

1126
01:25:33,938 --> 01:25:38,281
<i>an individual emerges
from a--</i>

1127
01:25:38,354 --> 01:25:43,024
from a sea of troubles
and-- and brings from this--

1128
01:25:43,090 --> 01:25:47,792
this sea... something to us.

1129
01:25:47,858 --> 01:25:49,997
Something in us.
Something...

1130
01:25:51,218 --> 01:25:54,447
from that... sea.

1131
01:25:54,514 --> 01:25:57,384
- Did you write this?
- I wish.

1132
01:25:57,458 --> 01:25:59,531
He reveals.

1133
01:26:00,595 --> 01:26:02,504
And I think you know
who it is.

1134
01:26:02,579 --> 01:26:05,000
He's here with us tonight.

1135
01:26:05,074 --> 01:26:08,336
Author, philosopher...

1136
01:26:08,402 --> 01:26:10,312
human being:

1137
01:26:10,386 --> 01:26:13,648
T. Azimuth Schwitters!

1138
01:26:27,858 --> 01:26:30,608
Thank you.

1139
01:26:30,675 --> 01:26:32,846
<i>Nose army!</i>

1140
01:26:36,690 --> 01:26:39,275
Oh, God.
Very bad.

1141
01:26:39,346 --> 01:26:41,321
Do something, will you?

1142
01:26:41,394 --> 01:26:43,761
People, get an ambulance.

1143
01:26:43,826 --> 01:26:46,281
<i>- Someone--
- Nose army!</i>

1144
01:26:46,354 --> 01:26:49,485
Nose army!

1145
01:27:28,434 --> 01:27:30,539
<i>Well, how is that book?</i>

1146
01:27:32,850 --> 01:27:34,705
It's extremely good.

1147
01:27:34,770 --> 01:27:36,843
Really? Yeah,
I haven't read it, uh...

1148
01:27:36,915 --> 01:27:39,817
but the subject
interests me.

1149
01:27:39,891 --> 01:27:43,087
<i>- Where are you flying?
- Costa Rica.</i>

1150
01:27:43,154 --> 01:27:46,318
<i>- That's where I'm going.
- Really? San José?</i>

1151
01:27:48,627 --> 01:27:51,660
<i>Did you have
any strong personal feelings about him...</i>

1152

<i>one way or another?</i>

1153

Where did you get the gun?

1154
01:27:58,098 --> 01:27:59,953
- What's your name?
- Dolores.

1155
01:28:00,018 --> 01:28:03,149
- Have you got my messages?
- Yes. People who have called to send regards.

1156
01:28:03,218 --> 01:28:05,073
- Oh. Fabulous.
- The president.

1157
01:28:05,138 --> 01:28:07,026
- Uh, send him a card.
- Senator Dole.

1158
01:28:07,090 --> 01:28:10,352
Hmm, send him a card.
Stop pacing!

1159
01:28:10,418 --> 01:28:13,036
- Governor Wilson.
- Uh, send him some meat.

1160
01:28:13,106 --> 01:28:15,375
- SenatorJohnson.
- Ca-Card.

1161
01:28:15,442 --> 01:28:17,679
Stop sweating on that.
It's an antique.

1162
01:28:17,746 --> 01:28:19,786
- Governor Edwards.
- Next.

1163
01:28:19,859 --> 01:28:21,713
- Mr. Perelman.
- Uh, card.

1164
01:28:21,779 --> 01:28:23,633
- Where's the tape?
- Wh-What tape?

1165
01:28:23,699 --> 01:28:26,797
The tape. The tape of the assassination.
The one that, uh...

1166
01:28:26,866 --> 01:28:29,900
- my, uh-- what's her name--
my wife shot yesterday.
- Oh, it's right there.

1167
01:28:29,970 --> 01:28:31,879
Well, put it in.
I want to watch it.

1168
01:28:31,954 --> 01:28:33,809
- Oliver Stone.
- Who?

1169
01:28:33,874 --> 01:28:37,354
- Oliver Stone.
- I don't know who that is. Send meat.

1170
01:28:37,426 --> 01:28:39,281
- Senator Feinstein.
- Send him a card.

1171
01:28:39,346 --> 01:28:41,518
- Mayor Dooley.
- Card. Okay. Let's watch this.

1172
01:28:45,202 --> 01:28:48,104
- What the fuck is this?
- I don't know. It looks like your house.

1173
01:28:48,178 --> 01:28:51,309
Thanks for the news flash. What the hell's
this guy doing in my house?

1174
01:28:53,298 --> 01:28:58,252
l-- I don't know. It looks like he's
getting ready to screw your wife.

1175
01:28:58,322 --> 01:29:00,656
Hmm. I wonder
what that's like.

1176
01:29:02,578 --> 01:29:05,807
Did you plan to shoot
anyone else?

1177
01:29:05,874 --> 01:29:07,784
Did you plan to
shoot yourself?

1178
01:29:08,819 --> 01:29:12,877
Elmo no-o-o-ose army.

1179
01:29:15,410 --> 01:29:19,022
Well, you're two
creative and intense houseplants.

1180
01:29:19,090 --> 01:29:21,643
Houseplants.
I can see that. I can see that.

1181
01:29:23,890 --> 01:29:28,592
I believe so strongly
in mayonnaise.

1182
01:29:28,658 --> 01:29:32,236
I'm talking about
perception...

1183
01:29:32,306 --> 01:29:34,576
and communication
skills-s-s-s-s-s.

Houseplant.

1185
01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:40,942
I can make sense...
out of yesterday.

1186
01:29:41,010 --> 01:29:45,036
Can you understand
the power of that?

1187
01:29:48,531 --> 01:29:51,597
You will learn
something from me.

1188
01:29:57,394 --> 01:30:01,387
- And which one's a plane?
- I'll get it.

1189
01:30:03,826 --> 01:30:06,128
Do you see which one
is different?

1190
01:30:06,194 --> 01:30:08,104
Can you circle the one
that's different?

<i>All right. Fine.</i>

Okay.

01:30:32,914 --> 01:30:36,689
- Who was that?
- Somebody for Bob.

1198
01:30:38,066 --> 01:30:40,073
<i>- Hmm.
- What is it?</i>

1199
01:30:41,874 --> 01:30:43,729
It's a spider.

01:30:43,794 --> 01:30:45,704
<i>Different spider.</i>

I can answer some of them.

Yes.

Yes.
